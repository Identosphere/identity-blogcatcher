Click on any Python symbol in GitHub's code browsing views and a box will show you exactly where that symbol was defined - all based on static analysis by a custom parser written in Rust as opposed to executing any Python code directly.

The word "eventually" is doing a lot of work here! But it's a way more and more startups will try and expand - by creating a bigger pie and being the owners of the way their market business is conducted. They get to stay clear of antitrust regulations while literally owning the market. Will it take years for this to happen? Yes. Is it near-inevitable? Also yes.</p>            <p>[<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/kickstarter-plans-to-move-its-crowdfunding-platform-to-the-blockchain/">Link</a>]</p>

  <p>I've stopped considering my projects "shipped" until I've written a proper blog entry about them, so yesterday I finally <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Dec/7/git-history/">shipped git-history</a>, coinciding with the release of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/git-history/releases/tag/0.6">version 0.6</a> - a full 27 days after the first <a href="https://github.com/simonw/git-history/releases/tag/0.1">0.1</a>.</p>
<p>It took way more work than I was expecting to get to this point!</p>
<p>I wrote the first version of <code>git-history</code> in an afternoon, as a tool <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Nov/15/weeknotes-git-history/">for a workshop I was presenting</a> on Git scraping and Datasette.</p>
<p>Before promoting it more widely, I wanted to make some improvements to the schema. In particular, I wanted to record only the updated values in the <code>item_version</code> table - which otherwise could end up duplicating a full copy of each item in the database hundreds or even thousands of times.</p>
<p>Getting this right took a lot of work, and I kept on getting stumped by weird bugs and edge-cases. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/git-history/issues/33">This bug</a> in particular added a couple of days to the project.</p>
<p>The whole project turned out to be something of a bug magnet, partly because of a design decision I made concerning column names.</p>
<p><code>git-history</code> creates tables with columns that correspond to the underlying data. Since it also needs its own columns for tracking things like commits and incremental versions, I decided to use underscore prefixes for reserved columns such as <code>_item</code> and <code>_version</code></p>
<p>Datasette uses underscore prefixes for its own purposes - special table arguments such as <code>?_facet=column-name</code>. It's supposed to work with existing columns that use underscores by converting query string arguments like <code>?_item=3</code> into <code>?_item__exact=3</code> - but <code>git-history</code> was the first of my projects to really exercise this, and I kept on finding bugs. Datasette <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-59-2">0.59.2</a> and <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-59-4">0.59.4</a> both have related bug fixes, and there's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1527">a re-opened bug</a> that I have yet to resolve.</p>
<p>Building the <a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires/incident">ca-fires demo</a> also revealed a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-cluster-map/issues/38">bug in datasette-cluster-map</a> which I fixed in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-cluster-map/releases/tag/0.17.2">version 0.17.2</a>.</p>
 s3-credentials --public 
<p>The <code>git-history</code> live demos are built and deployed by <a href="https://github.com/simonw/git-history/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy-demos.yml">this GitHub Actions workflow</a>. The workflow works by checking out three separate repos and running <code>git-history</code> against them. It takes advantage of that tool's ability to add just new commits to an existing database to run faster, so it needs to persist database files in between runs.</p>
<p>Since these files can be several hundred MBs, I decided to persist them in an S3 bucket.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Nov/3/s3-credentials/">s3-credentials tool</a> provides the ability to create a new S3 bucket along with restricted read-write credentials just for that bucket, ideal for use in a GitHub Actions workflow.</p>
<p>I decided to make the bucket public such that anyone can download files from it, since there was no reason to keep it private. I've been wanting to add this ability to <code>s3-credentials</code> for a while now, so this was the impetus I needed to finally ship that feature.</p>
<p>It's surprisingly hard to figure out how to make an S3 bucket public these days! It turned out the magic recipe was adding a JSON bucket policy document to the bucket granting <code>s3:GetObject</code> permission to principal <code>*</code> - here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/blob/0.8/README.md#public-bucket-policy">that policy in full</a>.</p>
<p>I released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/releases/tag/0.8">s3-credentials 0.8</a> with a new <code>--public</code> option for creating public buckets - here are the release notes in full:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 
<code>s3-credentials create my-bucket --public</code> option for creating public buckets, which allow anyone with knowledge of a filename to download that file. This works by attaching <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/blob/0.8/README.md#public-bucket-policy">this public bucket policy</a> to the bucket after it is created. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/issues/42">#42</a>
 
 
<code>s3-credentials put-object</code> now sets the <code>Content-Type</code> header on the uploaded object. The type is detected based on the filename, or can be specified using the new <code>--content-type</code> option. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/issues/43">#43</a>
 
 
<code>s3-credentials policy my-bucket --public-bucket</code> outputs the public bucket policy that would be attached to a bucket of that name. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/issues/44">#44</a>
 
 
</blockquote>
<p>I wrote up this TIL which doubles as a mini-tutorial on using <code>s3-credentials</code>: <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/github-actions/s3-bucket-github-actions">Storing files in an S3 bucket between GitHub Actions runs</a>.</p>
 datasette-hovercards 
<p>This was a quick experiment which turned into a prototype Datasette plugin. I really like how GitHub show hover card previews of links to issues in their interface:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I decided to see if I could build something similar for links within Datasette, specifically the links that show up when a column is a foreign key to another record.</p>
<p>Here's what I've got so far:</p>
<p></p>
<p>There's an interactive demo running on <a href="https://latest-with-plugins.datasette.io/github/issues">this table page</a>.</p>
<p>It still needs a bunch of work - in particular I need to think harder about when the card is shown, where it displays relative to the mouse pointer, what causes it to be hidden again and how it should handle different page widths. Ideally I'd like to figure out a useful mobile / touch-screen variant, but I'm not sure how that could work.</p>
<p>The prototype plugin is called <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-hovercards">datasette-hovercards</a> - I'd like to eventually merge this back into Datasette core once I'm happy with how it works.</p>

  <p>Summary:      Kim Cameron's Laws of Identity are a foundational work in online identity. He used his technical knowledge and position to advance the state of online identity in countless ways over multiple decades. We will miss him.</p>




<p>
    I got word early last week that Kim Cameron, a giant of the identity world, had passed away. I was shocked. I still am. Kim was one of those people who played such a big role in my life over so many years, that it's hard to imagine he's not there any more. The week before we'd been scheduled to talk and he'd canceled cause he wasn't feeling well. He wanted to talk about verifiable credential exchange over OpenID Connect SIOP. He was still in the trenches...working on identity. I'm sad we'll never get that last talk. 
</p>

<p>
    I had met Kim and talked to him at several identity conferences back in the early 2000's. But my relationship with him grew into friendship through Internet Identity Workshop (IIW). We held the first IIW in October 2005. Along with many others, Kim was there to talk about his ideas and plans for identity. He'd already published his <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">Laws of Identity</a> and was working on a project called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_card">Information Cards</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    At that first IIW, we went to dinner at the end of day one. The idea was that everyone would pay for their own meal since the workshop hadn't collected any money in the registration for that. Kim, with his typical generosity, told everyone that Microsoft would buy dinner...and drinks. Later he confided to me that he wasn't sure Microsoft would really pick up the tab—which turned out to be surprisingly large because of the alcohol—but he'd make sure it was covered either way. That started a tradition. Microsoft has sponsored the workshop dinner at every in-person IIW we've held. Not only with dinner, but in countless other ways, Kim's participation and support was instrumental in building IIW over the years. 
</p>



<p>
    Over the last several years I've remarked several times that Kim must be a being from the future. With his laws, Kim was telling us things about identity in 2004 that we weren't ready to hear until just the last few years. Kim not only saw the need for a set of laws to govern online identity system architecture, but also foresaw the need for an identity metasystem on the internet. Whether you view the laws as leading to the metasystem design or springing from it, they are both necessary to a future where people can live rich, authentic online lives. The laws are Kim's legacy in the identity world.  
</p>

<p>
Kim's technical excellence got him a seat at the table. His position at Microsoft gave him a big voice. But what made Kim effective was his gentle approach to technical discussions, especially those he thought might be contentious. He listened, asked questions, and guided discussion. As a result of his leadership we made progress in many ways that might not have otherwise happened. The identity world will sorely miss his leadership. I will miss his company, learning from him, and, most of all, his friendship.

   I described Git scraping last year: a technique for writing scrapers where you periodically snapshot a source of data to a Git repository in order to record changes to that source over time. 
 The open challenge was how to analyze that data once it was collected. git-history is my new tool designed to tackle that problem.

  <p>I described <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/">Git scraping</a> last year: a technique for writing scrapers where you periodically snapshot a source of data to a Git repository in order to record changes to that source over time.</p>
<p>The open challenge was how to analyze that data once it was collected. <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/git-history">git-history</a> is my new tool designed to tackle that problem.</p>
 Git scraping, a refresher 
<p>A neat thing about scraping to a Git repository is that the scrapers themselves can be really simple. I demonstrated how to run scrapers for free using GitHub Actions in this <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Mar/5/git-scraping/">five minute lightning talk</a> back in March.</p>
<p>Here's a concrete example: California's state fire department, Cal Fire, maintain an incident map at <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/">fire.ca.gov/incidents</a> showing the status of current large fires in the state.</p>
<p>I found the underlying data here:</p>
 <code>curl https://www.fire.ca.gov/umbraco/Api/IncidentApi/GetIncidents
</code> 
<p>Then I built <a href="https://github.com/simonw/ca-fires-history/blob/main/.github/workflows/scrape.yml">a simple scraper</a> that grabs a copy of that every 20 minutes and commits it to Git. I've been running that for 14 months now, and it's collected <a href="https://github.com/simonw/ca-fires-history">1,559 commits</a>!</p>
<p>The thing that excites me most about Git scraping is that it can create truly unique datasets. It's common for organizations not to keep detailed archives of what changed and where, so by scraping their data into a Git repository you can often end up with a more detailed history than they maintain themselves.</p>
<p>There's one big challenge though; having collected that data, how can you best analyze it? Reading through thousands of commit differences and eyeballing changes to JSON or CSV files isn't a great way of finding the interesting stories that have been captured.</p>
 git-history 
<p><a href="https://datasette.io/tools/git-history">git-history</a> is the new CLI tool I've built to answer that question. It reads through the entire history of a file and generates a SQLite database reflecting changes to that file over time. You can then use <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> to explore the resulting data.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires">an example database</a> created by running the tool against my <code>ca-fires-history</code> repository. I created the SQLite database by running this in the repository directory:</p>
  git-history file ca-fires.db incidents.json \
  --namespace incident \
  --id UniqueId \
  --convert 'json.loads(content)["Incidents"]'  
<p></p>
<p>In this example we are processing the history of a single file called <code>incidents.json</code>.</p>
<p>We use the <code>UniqueId</code> column to identify which records are changed over time as opposed to newly created.</p>
<p>Specifying <code>--namespace incident</code> causes the created database tables to be called <code>incident</code> and <code>incident_version</code> rather than the default of <code>item</code> and <code>item_version</code>.</p>
<p>And we have a fragment of Python code that knows how to turn each version stored in that commit history into a list of objects compatible with the tool, see <a href="https://github.com/simonw/git-history/blob/0.6/README.md#custom-conversions-using---convert">--convert in the documentation</a> for details.</p>
<p>Let's use the database to answer some questions about fires in California over the past 14 months.</p>
<p>The <code>incident</code> table contains a copy of the latest record for every incident. We can use that to see <a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires/incident">a map of every fire</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This uses the <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-cluster-map">datasette-cluster-map</a> plugin, which draws a map of every row with a valid latitude and longitude column.</p>
<p>Where things get interesting is the <a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires/incident_version">incident_version</a> table. This is where changes between different scraped versions of each item are recorded.</p>
<p>Those 250 fires have 2,060 recorded versions. If we <a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires/incident_version?_facet=_item">facet by _item</a> we can see which fires had the most versions recorded. Here are the top ten:</p>
 
 
<a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires/incident_version?_facet=_item&amp;_item__exact=174">Dixie Fire</a> 268 
 
<a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires/incident_version?_facet=_item&amp;_item__exact=209">Caldor Fire</a> 153 
 
<a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires/incident_version?_facet=_item&amp;_item__exact=197">Monument Fire</a> 65 
 
<a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires/incident_version?_facet=_item&amp;_item__exact=1">August Complex (includes Doe Fire)</a> 64 
 
<a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires/incident_version?_facet=_item&amp;_item__exact=2">Creek Fire</a> 56 
 
<a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires/incident_version?_facet=_item&amp;_item__exact=213">French Fire</a> 53 
 
<a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires/incident_version?_facet=_item&amp;_item__exact=32">Silverado Fire</a> 52 
 
<a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires/incident_version?_facet=_item&amp;_item__exact=240">Fawn Fire</a> 45 
 
<a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires/incident_version?_facet=_item&amp;_item__exact=34">Blue Ridge Fire</a> 39 
 
<a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires/incident_version?_facet=_item&amp;_item__exact=190">McFarland Fire</a> 34 
 
<p>This looks about right - the larger the number of versions the longer the fire must have been burning. The Dixie Fire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixie_Fire">has its own Wikipedia page</a>!</p>
<p>Clicking through to <a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires/incident_version?_facet=_item&amp;_item__exact=174">the Dixie Fire</a> lands us on a page showing every "version" that we captured, ordered by version number.</p>
<p><code>git-history</code> only writes values to this table that have changed since the previous version. This means you can glance at the table grid and get a feel for which pieces of information were updated over time:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The <code>ConditionStatement</code> is a text description that changes frequently, but the other two interesting columns look to be <code>AcresBurned</code> and <code>PercentContained</code>.</p>
<p>That <code>_commit</code> table is a foreign key to <a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires/commits">commits</a>, which records commits that have been processed by the tool -  mainly so that when you run it a second time it can pick up where it finished last time.</p>
<p>We can join against <code>commits</code> to see the date that each version was created. Or we can use the <a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires/incident_version_detail">incident_version_detail</a> view which performs that join for us.</p>
<p>Using that view, we can filter for just rows where <code>_item</code> is 174 and <code>AcresBurned</code> is not blank, then use the <a>datasette-vega</a> plugin to visualize the <code>_commit_at</code> date column against the <code>AcresBurned</code> numeric column... and we get a graph of <a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires/incident_version_detail?_item__exact=174&amp;AcresBurned__notblank=1#g.mark=line&amp;g.x_column=_commit_at&amp;g.x_type=temporal&amp;g.y_column=AcresBurned&amp;g.y_type=quantitative">the growth of the Dixie Fire over time</a>!</p>
<p></p>
<p>To review: we started out with a GitHub Actions scheduled workflow grabbing a copy of a JSON API endpoint every 20 minutes. Thanks to <code>git-history</code>, Datasette and <code>datasette-vega</code> we now have a chart showing the growth of the longest-lived California wildfire of the last 14 months over time.</p>
 A note on schema design 
<p>One of the hardest problems in designing <code>git-history</code> was deciding on an appropriate schema for storing version changes over time.</p>
<p>I ended up with the following (edited for clarity):</p>
  CREATE TABLE [commits] (
   [id] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [hash] TEXT,
   [commit_at] TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE [item] (
   [_id] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [_item_id] TEXT,
   [IncidentID] TEXT,
   [Location] TEXT,
   [Type] TEXT,
   [_commit] INTEGER
);
CREATE TABLE [item_version] (
   [_id] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [_item] INTEGER REFERENCES [item]([_id]),
   [_version] INTEGER,
   [_commit] INTEGER REFERENCES [commits]([id]),
   [IncidentID] TEXT,
   [Location] TEXT,
   [Type] TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE [columns] (
   [id] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [namespace] INTEGER REFERENCES [namespaces]([id]),
   [name] TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE [item_changed] (
   [item_version] INTEGER REFERENCES [item_version]([_id]),
   [column] INTEGER REFERENCES [columns]([id]),
   PRIMARY KEY ([item_version], [column])
);  
<p>As shown earlier, records in the <code>item_version</code> table represent snapshots over time - but to save on database space and provide a neater interface for browsing versions, they only record columns that had changed since their previous version. Any unchanged columns are stored as <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>There's one catch with this schema: what do we do if a new version of an item sets one of the columns to <code>null</code>? How can we tell the difference between that and a column that didn't change?</p>
<p>I ended up solving that with an <code>item_changed</code> many-to-many table, which uses pairs of integers (hopefully taking up as little space as possible) to record exactly which columns were modified in which <code>item_version</code> records.</p>
<p>The <code>item_version_detail</code> view displays columns from that many-to-many table as JSON - here's <a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires/incident_version_detail?_version__gt=1&amp;_col=_changed_columns&amp;_col=_item&amp;_col=_version">a filtered example</a> showing which columns were changed in which versions of which items:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires?sql=select+columns.name%2C+count%28*%29%0D%0Afrom+incident_changed%0D%0A++join+incident_version+on+incident_changed.item_version+%3D+incident_version._id%0D%0A++join+columns+on+incident_changed.column+%3D+columns.id%0D%0Awhere+incident_version._version+%3E+1%0D%0Agroup+by+columns.name%0D%0Aorder+by+count%28*%29+desc">a SQL query</a> that shows, for <code>ca-fires</code>, which columns were updated most often:</p>
  select columns.name, count(*)
from incident_changed
  join incident_version on incident_changed.item_version = incident_version._id
  join columns on incident_changed.column = columns.id
where incident_version._version &gt; 1
group by columns.name
order by count(*) desc  
 
 Updated: 1785 
 PercentContained: 740 
 ConditionStatement: 734 
 AcresBurned: 616

 WaterTenders: 225 
 Dozers: 211 
 AirTankers: 181

 Helicopters: 122 
 
<p>Helicopters are exciting! Let's find all of the fires which had at least one record where the number of helicopters changed (after the first version). We'll use a nested SQL query:</p>
  select * from incident
where _id in (
  select _item from incident_version
  where _id in (
    select item_version from incident_changed where column = 15
  )
  and _version &gt; 1
)  
<p>That returned 19 fires that were significant enough to involve helicopters - <a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/ca-fires?sql=select+*+from+incident%0D%0Awhere+_id+in+%28%0D%0A++select+_item+from+incident_version%0D%0A++where+_id+in+%28%0D%0A++++select+item_version+from+incident_changed+where+column+%3D+15%0D%0A++%29%0D%0A++and+_version+%3E+1%0D%0A%29">here they are on a map</a>:</p>
<p></p>
 Advanced usage of --convert 
<p>Drew Breunig has been running a Git scraper for the past 8 months in <a href="https://github.com/dbreunig/511-events-history">dbreunig/511-events-history</a> against <a href="https://511.org/">511.org</a>, a site showing traffic incidents in the San Francisco Bay Area. I loaded his data into this example <a href="https://git-history-demos.datasette.io/sf-bay-511">sf-bay-511 database</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>sf-bay-511</code> example is useful for digging more into the <code>--convert</code> option to <code>git-history</code>.</p>
<p><code>git-history</code> requires recorded data to be in a specific shape: it needs a JSON list of JSON objects, where each object has a column that can be treated as a unique ID for purposes of tracking changes to that specific record over time.</p>
<p>The ideal tracked JSON file would look something like this:</p>
  [
  {
    "IncidentID": "abc123",
    "Location": "Corner of 4th and Vermont",
    "Type": "fire"
  },
  {
    "IncidentID": "cde448",
    "Location": "555 West Example Drive",
    "Type": "medical"
  }
]  
<p>It's common for data that has been scraped to not fit this ideal shape.</p>
<p>The <code>511.org</code> JSON feed <a href="https://backend-prod.511.org/api-proxy/api/v1/traffic/events/?extended=true">can be found here</a> - it's a pretty complicated nested set of objects, and there's a bunch of data in there that's quite noisy without adding much to the overall analysis - things like a <code>updated</code> timestamp field that changes in every version even if there are no changes, or a deeply nested <code>"extension"</code> object full of duplicate data.</p>
<p>I wrote a snippet of Python to transform each of those recorded snapshots into a simpler structure, and then passed that Python code to the <code>--convert</code> option to the script:</p>
 <code>#!/bin/bash
git-history file sf-bay-511.db 511-events-history/events.json \
  --repo 511-events-history \
  --id id \
  --convert '
data = json.loads(content)
if data.get("error"):
    # {"code": 500, "error": "Error accessing remote data..."}
    return
for event in data["Events"]:
    event["id"] = event["extension"]["event-reference"]["event-identifier"]
    # Remove noisy updated timestamp
    del event["updated"]
    # Drop extension block entirely
    del event["extension"]
    # "schedule" block is noisy but not interesting
    del event["schedule"]
    # Flatten nested subtypes
    event["event_subtypes"] = event["event_subtypes"]["event_subtype"]
    if not isinstance(event["event_subtypes"], list):
        event["event_subtypes"] = [event["event_subtypes"]]
    yield event
'
</code> 
<p>The single-quoted string passed to <code>--convert</code> is compiled into a Python function and run against each Git version in turn. My code loops through the nested <code>Events</code> list, modifying each record and then outputting them as an iterable sequence using <code>yield</code>.</p>
<p>A few of the records in the history were server 500 errors, so the code block knows how to identify and skip those as well.</p>
<p>When working with <code>git-history</code> I find myself spending most of my time iterating on these conversion scripts. Passing strings of Python code to tools like this is a pretty fun pattern - I also used it <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Aug/6/sqlite-utils-convert/">for sqlite-utils convert</a> earlier this year.</p>

<p>No doubt the Covid wealth extraction plan has gone, well - according to plan!</p>

<p>That said, the extraction has been going on for a long time, with no abatement. I think history is likely to record ‘this period’ as a blip on the steady extraction that has been occurring for decades!</p>

<p>This is about credit where due, and unwanted by the credited. I speak here of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Cameron_(computer_scientist)">Kim Cameron</a>, a man whose modesty was immense because it had to be, given the size of his importance to us all.</p>
<p>See, to the degree that identity matters, and disparate systems getting along with each other matters—in both cases for the sakes of each and all—Kim’s original wisdom and guidance matters. And that mattering is only beginning to play out.</p>
<p>But Kim isn’t here to shake his head at what I just said, because (as I reported in&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2021/12/03/remembering-kim-cameron/">my prior post</a>) he passed last week.</p>
<p>What I want to celebrate, however, isn’t just Kim’s thoughts and works, but his example: of how an open and generous person in a giant company can use its power for good, and not play the heavy doing it. That’s what Kim did for the two decades he was the top architect of Microsoft’s approach to digital identity and meta systems (that is, systems that make disparate systems work as if just one). I first saw him practice these powers at the inaugural meeting of a group that called itself the Identity Gang.</p>
<p>That name was given to the gang by <a href="https://twitter.com/stevegillmor">Steve Gillmor</a>, who hosted <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail394.html">a Gillmor Gang podcast</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.windley.com/audio/GillmorGang-2004.12.31.mp3">here’s the audio</a>) on the topic of digital identity. That was on New Years Eve—the last day of 2004. To follow that up, seven of the nine people in that podcast, plus about as many more, gathered during a break at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther_Dyson">Esther Dyson</a>‘s PC Forum conference in Scottsdale, Arizona, on March 20, 2005. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157720211859061">Here is an album of photos</a>&nbsp;I shot of the Gang, sitting around an outside table. (The shot above is one of them.)</p>
<p>Kim was the most powerful participant, owing both to his position at Microsoft and for having issued, one by one,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=1065">Seven Laws of Identity</a>, over the preceding months. Like the Ten Commandments, Kim’s laws are rules which, even if followed poorly, civilize the world.</p>
<p>Kim always insisted that his Laws were not carved on stone tablets and that he was no burning bush, but those laws were, and remain, enormously important. And I doubt that would be so without Kim’s 200-proof Canadian modesty.</p>
<p>The next time the Identity Gang met was in October of that year, in Berkeley. By then the gang had grown to about a hundred people. Organized by <a href="https://identitywoman.net/">Kaliya (IdentityWoman) Young</a>, <a href="http://windley.org">Phil Windley</a> and myself (but mostly the other two), the next meeting was branded <a href="http://iiworkshop.org">Internet Identity Workshop (IIW)</a>, and it has been held every Fall and Spring since then at the Computer History Museum (and, on three pandemic occasions, online), with hundreds, from all over the world, participating every time.</p>
<p>IIW is an open space workshop, meaning that it consists entirely of breakouts on topics chosen and led by the participants. There are no keynotes, no panels, no vendor booths. Sponsor involvement is limited to food, coffee, free wi-fi, projectors, and other graces that carry no other promotional value. (Thanks to Kim, it has long been a tradition for Microsoft to sponsor an evening at a local restaurant and bar.) Most importantly, the people attending from big companies and startups alike are those with the ability to engineer or guide technical developments that work for everyone and not for just those companies.</p>
<p>I’m biased, but I believe IIW is the most essential and productive conference of any kind. Conversations and developments of many kinds are moved forward at every one of them. Examples of developments that might not be the same today but for IIW include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID">OpenID</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_cloud">personal clouds</a>, <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/picos">picos</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity">SSI</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_relationship_management">VRM</a>, <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/key-event-receipt-infrastructure-keri-secure-identifier-overlay-internet-sam-smith-webinar-58/">KERI</a>, and <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/whitepaper/distributed-ledger-technology">distributed ledgers</a>.</p>
<p>I am also sure that progress made around digital identity would not be the same (or as advanced) without Kim Cameron’s strong and gentle guidance. Hats off to his spirit and his legacy—and especially those laws.</p>

<p>I have implemented many Blazor WASM ASP.NET Core hosted applications now for both Azure AD and Azure B2C authentication. I always implement security for this type of application now using the Backend for Frontend (BFF) security architecture and can remove the tokens from the client. This is also what I recommend. At present, no Microsoft templates exist for this and it takes too much effort to set this up every time I start a new project. </p>



<p>To fill this gap, I created two templates to speed up the development process:</p>



  <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/Blazor.BFF.AzureAD.Template">Blazor.BFF.AzureAD.Template</a>  <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/Blazor.BFF.AzureB2C.Template">Blazor.BFF.AzureB2C.Template</a>  



<p>The two separate Nuget packages were created, one for Azure AD and one for Azure B2C due to the restrictions and differences in the identity providers. Both packages use <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web">Microsoft.Identity.Web</a> to authenticate and also use Microsoft Graph to access the profile data. I have included the typical security headers required using the <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders">NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders</a> Nuget package. The security headers and the CSP are setup ready for production deployment. (As best as Blazor allows)</p>







<p>Using the templates</p>



<p>You can install the Azure B2C template as follows:</p>


  dotnet new -i Blazor.BFF.AzureB2C.Template
  


<p>and the Azure AD template with</p>


  dotnet new -i Blazor.BFF.AzureAD.Template
  


<p>Then you can create a new project using the dotnet CLI</p>


  dotnet new blazorbffb2c -n YourCompany.MyB2cBlazor
  


<p>or</p>


  dotnet new blazorbffaad -n YourCompany.MyADBlazor
  


<p>You need to create the Azure App registrations for the applications as requires. If using Azure B2C, the user flow needs to be created. This is well documentation on the Microsoft.Identity.Web github repo. The Graph permissions also need to be added and configured in the app.settings.json. The app.settings.json have been configured with the values expected. Once all configured, you can run the application and also deploy this to an Azure Web App or whatever.</p>



<p>Each template implements an API call and a user profile view using the Microsoft Graph data.</p>







<p>If you have any comments, or ways of improving these templates, please create an issue or a PR in the github repo.</p>

<p>Sunday, November 14, 2021</p>



<p>We got an early start, said good-bye to Celeste (who got to stay in the room a little longer), and headed for Paddington Station about 7 am to catch the <a href="https://www.heathrowexpress.com/#/">Heathrow Express</a>. We bought our tickets, got out on the platform, and were greeted with a message board saying that there were delays on the line and that some trains had been canceled. This made us a little nervous, but the Network Rail application on my phone reassured us that there would, in fact, be a train soon. Although we had a bit more than the usual wait for Heathrow Express, the train proceeded normally and was not excessively crowded.</p>



<p>After the usual long walk, we reached the ticket counter and checked in. They were thorough in checking our vaccination and COVID testing status, although not to the point of actually checking the QR codes associated with each. After checking bags, there was another long walk to the vicinity of the gate. United’s lounge in London is still closed, but in the meantime they have an arrangement with Singapore Airlines for the use of their lounge where we were able to get breakfast.</p>



<p>At the gate, Kenna was diverted for extra security screening because the “SSSS” designation was printed on her boarding pass. Following that inconvenience, our flight departed on time, which given that we have only a 2-hour layover in Chicago (including customs and immigration) we appreciated. However, our arrival gate was occupied by another plane, resulting in about a 30 minute delay which made us understandably nervous.</p>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/img_7860.jpg"></a>Greenland from the air



<p>Having seen US Customs signs back in San Francisco promoting the <a href="https://mobilepassport.us/">Mobile Passport</a> immigration application for our phones, we entered our passport information and customs declaration. But after racing to the immigration hall, we were told, “We don’t use that any more. Get in line.” More nervousness about the time. After getting through Customs (which left us outside security), we took the tram to Terminal 1 for our flight to San Francisco.</p>



<p>Here we noticed that Kenna didn’t have the TSA Precheck designation on her boarding card, probably as a result of the SSSS designation earlier. It may not have mattered; there were signs saying precheck was closed and the people checking boarding passes didn’t seem to know. So we both went through the “slow line”, and unfortunately Kenna set something off and had to go through some extra screening. Apparently they thought there was something about one of her shoes, which they ran through the X-ray machine again; more delay. It was interesting that there were a number of women having their shoes rechecked at the same time.</p>



<p>We raced to our gate, nearly the furthest from the security checkpoint, and made it in enough time, but with not much to spare. The ride to San Francisco was unremarkable, and we collected our bags and caught our ride home, according to plan.</p>



 Epilogue 



  
<p>Arriving home we were severely jet lagged as expected, but tried to stay up as late as we could manage. After a few hours of sleep, I awoke about 2 am. I could hear some water dripping, which I attributed to a downspout being clogged with leaves following some recent rainfall. So I got up to investigate, and instead discovered that there was a substantial amount of water dripping from the ceiling into our guest room. It turns out that a hot water pipe in the attic had developed a pinhole leak and over time had soaked one wall. So we now have a new project.</p>

<p>Saturday, November 13, 2021</p>



<p>London isn’t in Sussex, that’s just the theme of the trip.</p>



<p>Celeste expressed a lot of interest in visiting the <a href="https://www.iwm.org.uk/visits/iwm-london">Imperial War Museum</a>, which none of us had visited, so we decided to make that our first destination. After a quick <a href="https://www.pret.co.uk/en-GB">Pret a Manger</a> breakfast, we took the Tube to the south side of London. The first thing you notice is the battleship guns at the front. My interest was also piqued by a short segment of Berlin Wall near the front entrance.</p>



<p>The museum has a large collection on several floors, with areas emphasizing World War I, World War II, the Cold War, the Holocaust, etc. One could easily spend several days to see all of the exhibits. Toward the end of our visit, we went in to the World War II gallery (having already seen quite a number of exhibits dealing with WW II), and it went on…and on. The gallery was very large and went into great detail, including many stories about participants in the war, German as well as Allied. We hadn’t expected the gallery to be nearly as large as it was, and might have allocated more time if we had.</p>



<p>Early in the afternoon we tired of the museum and decided to look for lunch. We thought we might like German food, so guided by our phones, we walked north and came to <a href="https://www.mercatometropolitano.com/">Mercato Metropolitano</a>, a large semi-outdoor food court with sustainable food from many world cuisines. Each of us selected something we like, but we never found the German restaurant we thought was there.</p>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/img_7846x-1.jpg"></a>



<p>Continuing north, we got to the <a href="https://boroughmarket.org.uk/">Borough Market</a>, a large trading market established in 1756. Perhaps because it was a Saturday, it was very crowded. Normally this might not have been as notable but that since the COVID epidemic we have avoided and become unaccustomed to crowds. We walked through quickly and then continued on to the Thames, where we went along the south shore to the Millennium Bridge. We walked out on the bridge, took some pictures, and continued west to the Westminster Bridge. All along the way there were people — lots of people.</p>



<p>After crossing the Westminster bridge, we took a short Tube ride to the West End. Again, everything was crowded. We tried a couple of places for dinner, but nothing was available without an advance booking. The Five Guys burger restaurant was jammed, and there was even a long queue at McDonalds (!). We couldn’t figure out the attraction there.</p>



<p>We finally settled on <a href="https://www.itsu.com/">Itsu</a>, the same Asian-themed fast food chain that we had tried in Brighton. We were able to find a table and had an enjoyable light meal.</p>



  
<p>The big event of the day was this evening: we had tickets to <a href="https://www.backtothefuturemusical.com/">Back to the Future: The Musical</a>, playing at the <a href="https://lwtheatres.co.uk/theatres/adelphi/">Adelphi Theatre</a> on The Strand. This is a new show that that just opened in July 2021 and has not yet made it to the United States. The theatre was, as expected, nearly full. But we had been told that COVID vaccination, negative tests, and the wearing of masks would be required. In fact, we were never asked about vaccinations or tests, and the majority of the audience did not wear masks. We felt somewhat less safe as a result.</p>
  



<p>Still, the show was very enjoyable. As Celeste pointed out, this is a “tech show” with the strong point being special effects. Most of the performances, particularly Doc Brown, were excellent as well, although Celeste noted that some of the actors had trouble with American accents.</p>



<p>We took the Tube back to our hotel and are retiring quickly. Tomorrow will be an early day for Jim and Kenna’s flight back home.</p>

<p>Got <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/resch/rest-in-peace-kim-cameron">word</a> yesterday that&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Cameron_(computer_scientist)">Kim Cameron</a> had passed.</p>
<p>Hit me hard. Kim was a loving and loved friend. He was also a brilliant and influential thinker and technologist.</p>
<p>That’s Kim, above, speaking at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2018">2018 EIC conference</a> in Germany. His <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2018/speakers/281">topics</a>&nbsp;were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/2293/1">The Laws of Identity on the Blockchain</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/2367/1">Informational Self-Determination in a Post Facebook/Cambridge Analytica Era</a> (in the Ownership of Data track).</p>
<p>The laws <a href="https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/The%20Seven%20Laws%20Of%20Identity">were seven</a>:</p>
 
 User control and consent 
 Minimum disclosure for a constrained use 
 Justifiable parties 
 Directed identity (meaning pairwise, known only to the person and the other party) 
 Pluralism of operators 
 Human integration 
 Consistent experience across contexts 
 
<p>He wrote these in 2004, when he was still early in his tenure as Microsoft’s chief architect for identity (one of several similar titles he held at the company). Perhaps more than anyone at Microsoft—or at any big company—Kim pushed constantly toward openness, inclusivity, compatibility, cooperation, and the need for individual agency and scale. His laws, and other contributions to tech,&nbsp;are still only beginning to have full influence. Kim was way ahead of his time, and its a terrible shame that his own is up. He died of cancer on November 30.</p>
<p>But Kim was so much more—and other—than his work. He was a great musician, teacher (in French and English), thinker, epicure, traveler, father, husband, and friend. As a companion, he was always fun, as well as curious, passionate, caring, gracious. Pick a flattering adjective and it likely applies.</p>
<p>I am reminded of what a friend said of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Tversky">Amos Tversky</a>, another genius of seemingly boundless vitality who died too soon: “Death is unrepresentative of him.”</p>
<p>That’s one reason it’s hard to think of Kim in the past tense, and why I resisted the urge to update <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Cameron_(computer_scientist)">Kim’s Wikipedia page</a>&nbsp;earlier today. (Somebody has done that now, I see.)</p>
<p>We all get our closing parentheses. I’ve gone longer without closing mine than Kim did before closing his. That also makes me sad, not that I’m in a hurry.&nbsp;Being old means knowing you’re in the exit line, but okay with others cutting in. I just wish this time it wasn’t Kim.</p>
<p>Britt Blaser says life is like a loaf of bread. It’s one loaf no matter how many slices are in it. Some people get a few slices, others many. For the sake of us all, I wish Kim had more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157720199287768">Here is an album of photos</a> of Kim, going back to 2005 at Esther Dyson’s PC Forum, where we had the first gathering of what would become the <a href="http://iiworkshop.org">Internet Identity Workshop</a>, the 34th of which is coming up next Spring. As with many other things in the world, it wouldn’t be the same—or here at all—without Kim.</p>

<p>Friday, November 12, 2021</p>



<p>Since it is now 2 days before our return to the United States, today was the day for our pre-trip COVID test. We were a little nervous about that because, of course, it determines whether we return as planned. Expecting a similar experience as for our Day 2 test, we were a bit surprised that this time we would have to do a proctored test where the proctor would watch us take the test via video chat. The next surprise was that you seem to need both a smartphone to run their app and some other device for the chat session. So we got out our iPads, and (third surprise) there was apparently a bug in their application causing it not to work on an iPad. So we got out my Mac laptop and (fourth surprise) couldn’t use my usual browser, Firefox, but could fortunately use Safari. Each test took about half an hour, including a 15-minute wait for the test to develop. Following the wait, a second video chat was set up where they read the test with you and issued your certificate. Very fortunately, both of our tests were negative.</p>



<p>We checked out of the apartment/hotel just before checkout time and stored our bags. Then the question was what to do until Celeste finished classes so we could all take the train to London. The answer was the <a href="https://www.visitsealife.com/brighton/">Sea Life Brighton</a>, apparently the oldest aquarium in the world. While not an extensive collection, many of the exhibits were in a classic style with ornate frames supporting the glass windows. There was a very enjoyable tunnel where you can sit while fish (and turtles!) swim overhead. The aquarium covered a number of regions of the world, with more of an emphasis on fresh-water fish than many others we have seen.</p>

<p>After browsing a bookstore for a while, we collected our bags and headed for the train station. Trains run to Victoria Station in London every half hour, and fortunately that connected well with the train Celeste took from Falmer to meet us.</p>



<p>After the train trip and Tube ride to Paddington Station, we walked the short distance to our hotel, a newly renovated boutique hotel called <a href="https://www.inhabithotels.com/">Inhabit</a>. We chose it largely because it had nice triple rooms, including an actual bed (not sofa bed) for Celeste. No London trip would be complete without a hotel where it’s necessary to lug your bags up a flight of stairs, but fortunately this one only required a single flight. Our room was modern and comfortable.</p>



<p>I had booked a table at the <a href="https://www.victoriapaddington.co.uk/">Victoria</a>, a pub in the Paddington area, and we were seated in a pleasant and not noisy dining room upstairs. Dinner was excellent. Upon returning to the hotel, Celeste immediately collapsed for the night on her cozy bed.</p>

<p>Thursday, November 11, 2021</p>



<p>While Celeste was in classes, Kenna and I set out on foot for Hove, Brighton’s “twin” city to the west. We had a rather pleasant walk through a shopping district, but there wasn’t much remarkable to see. In Hove, we turned south and followed the main road along the Channel back to the west. We stopped to look at one of the characteristic crescent-shaped residential developments, and continued toward Brighton. We considered going on the <a href="https://britishairwaysi360.com/">i360</a> observation tower, but it wasn’t particularly clear and the expense didn’t seem worth it.</p>



<p>Celeste and a friend of hers (another exchange student from Colorado) joined us in the afternoon to go ice skating at the <a href="https://royalpavilionicerink.co.uk/">Royal Pavilion Ice Rink</a>. While I am used to hockey skates, it was a bit of an adjustment to the others who are used to the toe picks on figure skates. We all got the hang of it; the ice was beautifully maintained (although with some puddles) and the rink was not particularly crowded for our 3 pm session.</p>

<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/img_4511.jpeg"></a>




<p>After skating we sat in the attached cafe to chat until it was time for dinner, which we had at an Italian restaurant, <a href="https://www.bellaitalia.co.uk/italian-restaurant/brighton/market-street#!">Bella Italia</a>, in the Lanes.</p>

<p>Wednesday, November 10, 2021</p>



<p>Celeste has a busy class schedule the early part of the day, so Kenna and I set out on our own, first for a hearty breakfast at <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186273-d467437-Reviews-Billie_s_Cafe-Brighton_East_Sussex_England.html">Billie’s Cafe</a> and then to the <a href="https://brightonmuseums.org.uk/royalpavilion/">Royal Pavilion</a>, one of the sightseeing highlights of Brighton. Originally a country estate, it was remodeled by King George IV into an ornate building, with the exterior having an Indian theme and the interior extensively decorated and furnished in Chinese style.</p>



<p>Brighton’s Royal Pavilion has had a varied history, having been of less interest to Queen Victoria (George IV’s successor in the throne) who moved most of the furnishings to London and sold the building to the City of Brighton. Over the years it has been refurnished in the original style and with many of the original furnishings, some of which have been loaned by Queen Elizabeth. The Pavilion was in the process of being decorated for Christmas, which reminded us of a visit we made two years ago to <a href="https://filoli.org/">Filoli</a> in California.</p>




<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/img_7769.jpg"></a>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/img_7770-1.jpg"></a>




<p>After the Pavilion, we went across the garden to the Brighton Museum, which had a wide range of exhibits ranging from ancient history of the British Isles and ancient Egypt to LGBT styles of the late 20th century and modern furniture.</p>



<p>Having finished her classes, Celeste joined us for lunch at <a href="https://www.itsu.com/">Itsu</a>, one of a chain of Asian-inspired fast food restaurants. We then returned with Celeste to the museum to see a bit more and allow her time to do some research she had planned.</p>



<p>We then made our way behind the Pavilion, where a seasonal ice rink is set up for recreational ice skating. With its location next to the Pavilion it is a particularly scenic place to skate. We are looking forward to doing that tomorrow.</p>



<p>Celeste returned to campus, and Kenna and I, having had a substantial lunch, opted for a light dinner at <a href="https://www.tengreenbottles.com/">Ten Green Bottles</a>, a local wine bar.</p>

  <p>I've been mostly <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">shaving yaks</a> this week - two in particular: the Datasette table refactor and the next release of <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/git-history">git-history</a>. I also built and released my first Web Component!</p>
 A Web Component for embedding Datasette tables 
<p>A longer term goal that I have for Datasette is to figure out a good way of using it to build dashboards, tying together summaries and visualizations of the latest data from a bunch of different sources.</p>
<p>I'm excited about the potential of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components">Web Components</a> to help solve this problem.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-notebook">datasette-notebook</a> project is a very early experiment in this direction: it's a Datasette notebook that provides a Markdown wiki (persisted to SQLite) to which I plan to add the ability to embed tables and visualizations in wiki pages - forming a hybrid of a wiki, dashboarding system and Notion/Airtable-style database.</p>
<p>It does almost none of those things right now, which is why I've not really talked about it here.</p>
<p>Web Components offer a standards-based mechanism for creating custom HTML tags. Imagine being able to embed a Datasette table on a page by adding the following to your HTML:</p>
  &lt;datasette-table
    url="https://global-power-plants.datasettes.com/global-power-plants/global-power-plants.json"
&gt;&lt;/datasette-table&gt;  
<p>That's exactly what <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-table">datasette-table</a> lets you do! Here's <a href="https://simonw.github.io/datasette-table/">a demo</a> of it in action.</p>
<p>This is version 0.1.0 - it works, but I've not even started to flesh it out.</p>
<p>I did learn a bunch of things building it though: it's my first Web Component, my first time using <a href="https://lit.dev/">Lit</a>, my first time using <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a> and the first JavaScript library I've ever packaged and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/datasette-table">published to npm</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a detailed TIL on <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/npm/publish-web-component">Publishing a Web Component to npm</a> encapsulating everything I've learned from this project so far.</p>
<p>This is also my first piece of yak shaving this week: I built this partly to make progress on <code>datasette-notebook</code>, but also because my big Datasette refactor involves finalizing the design of the JSON API for version 1.0. I realized that I don't actually have a project that makes full use of that API, which has been hindering my attempts to redesign it. Having one or more Web Components that consume the API will be a fantastic way for me to eat my own dog food.</p>
 Link: rel="alternate" for Datasette tables 
<p>Here's an interesting problem that came up while I was working on the <code>datasette-table</code> component.</p>
<p>As designed right now, you need to figure out the JSON URL for a table and pass that to the component.</p>
<p>This is usually a case of adding <code>.json</code> to the path, while preserving any query string parameters - but there's a nasty edge-case: if your SQLite table itself ends with the string <code>.json</code> (which could happen! Especially since Datasette promises to work with any existing SQLite database) the URL becomes this instead:</p>
 <code>/mydb/table.json?_format=json
</code> 
<p>Telling users of my component that they need to first construct the JSON URL for their page isn't the best experience: I'd much rather let people paste in the URL to the HTML version and derive the JSON from that.</p>
<p>This is made more complex by the fact that, thanks to <code>--cors</code>, the Web Component can be embedded on any page. And for <code>datasette-notebook</code> I'd like to provide a feature where any URLs to Datasette instances - no matter where they are hosted - are turned into embedded tables automatically.</p>
<p>To do this, I need an efficient way to tell that an arbitrary URL corresponds to a Datasette table.</p>
<p>My latest idea here is to use a combination of HTTP <code>HEAD</code> requests and a <code>Link: rel="alternate"</code> header - something like this:</p>
 <code>~ % curl -I 'https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/compound_three_primary_keys'
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
date: Sat, 27 Nov 2021 20:09:36 GMT
server: uvicorn
Link: https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/compound_three_primary_keys.json; rel="alternate"; type="application/datasette+json"
</code> 
<p>This would allow a (hopefully fast) <code>fetch()</code> call from JavaScript to confirm that a URL is a Datasette table, and get back the JSON that should be fetched by the component in order to render it on the page.</p>
<p>I have a prototype of this in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1533">Datasette issue #1533</a>. I think it's a promising approach!</p>
<p>It's also now part of the ever-growing table refactor. Adding custom headers to page responses is currently far harder than it should be.</p>
 sqlite-utils STRICT tables 
<p><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_37_0.html">SQLite 3.37.0</a> came out at the weekend with a long-awaited feature: <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/stricttables.html">STRICT tables</a>, which enforce column types such that you get an error if you try to insert a string into an integer column.</p>
<p>(This has been a long-standing complaint about SQLite by people who love strong typing, and D. Richard Hipp finally shipped the change for them with some salty release notes saying it's "for developers who prefer that kind of thing.")</p>
<p>I started researching how to add support for this to my <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html">sqlite-utils Python library</a>. You can follow my thinking in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/344">sqlite-utils issue #344</a> - I'm planning to add a <code>strict=True</code> option to methods that create tables, but for the moment I've shipped <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/commit/e3f108e0f339e3d87ce48541bbca8f891bfaf040">new introspection properties</a> for seeing if a table uses strict mode or not.</p>
 git-history update 
<p>My other big yak this week has been work on <a href="https://github.com/simonw/git-history">git-history</a>. I'm determined to get it into a stable state such that I can write it up, produce a tutorial and maybe produce a video demonstration as well - but I keep on finding things I want to change about how it works.</p>
<p>The big challenge is how to most effectively represent the history of a bunch of different items over time in a relational database schema.</p>
<p>I started with a <code>item</code> table that presents just the most recent version of each item, and an <code>item_version</code> table with a row for every subsequent version.</p>
<p>That table got pretty big, with vast amounts of duplicated data in it.</p>
<p>So I've been working on an optimization where columns are only included in an <code>item_version</code> row <a href="https://github.com/simonw/git-history/issues/21">if they have changed since the previous version</a>.</p>
<p>The problem there is what to do about <code>null</code> - does <code>null</code> mean "this column didn't change" or does it mean "this column was set from some other value back to <code>null</code>"?</p>
<p>After a few different attempts I've decided to solve this with a many-to-many table, so for any row in the <code>item_version</code> table you can see which columns were explicitly changed by that version.</p>
<p>This is all working pretty nicely now, but still needs documentation, and tests, and then a solid write-up and tutorial and demos and a video... hopefully tomorrow!</p>
<p>One of my design decisions for this tool has been to use an underscore prefix for "reserved columns", such that non-reserved columns can be safely used by the arbitrary data that is being tracked by the tool.</p>
<p>Having columns with names like <code>_id</code> and <code>_item</code> has highlighted several bugs with Datasette's handling of these column names, since Datasette itself tries to use things like <code>?_search=</code> for special query string parameters. I released <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-59-4">Datasette 0.59.4</a> with some relevant fixes.</p>

<p>Tuesday, November 9, 2021</p>



<p>Somewhat at the midpoint of our trip, it was time to take care of a few things like laundry. It’s also time for the thrice-annual <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> meeting, which was supposed to be in Madrid, but is being held online (again) due to the pandemic. I co-chaired a session from noon to 2 pm local time today, so I needed to be at the hotel for that. Meanwhile Kenna and Celeste did some exploring around the little shops in the Brighton Lanes.</p>



<p>Our downtime day also gave us an opportunity to do some laundry. One of the attractive features of our “aparthotel” is a compact combination washer/dryer. Our room also came with a couple of detergent pods, which were unfortunately and unexpectedly heavily scented. We will be using our own detergent in the future. The dryer was slow, but it did the job.</p>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/img_4493x.jpg"></a>IETF virtual venue



<p>I am again thankful for the good internet service here; the meeting went without a hitch (my co-chair is in Melbourne, Australia). Kenna and Celeste brought lunch from <a href="https://www.pret.co.uk/en-GB">Pret a Manger</a> to eat between meeting sessions I needed to attend. Following the second session we went off for dinner at a pizza place we had discovered, <a href="https://www.francomanca.co.uk/">Franco Manca</a>. The pizza and surroundings were outstanding; we would definitely return (and Celeste probably will). We then saw Celeste off to her bus back to campus and we returned to our hotel.</p>

<p>A little over a year ago, I switched roles at Oracle and joined the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Product Management team working on Identity and Access Management (IAM) services. It's been an incredibly interesting (and challenging) year leading up to our release of <a href="https://www.oracle.com/security/cloud-security/identity-cloud/">OCI IAM identity domains</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>We merged an enterprise-class Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) solution with our OCI-native IAM service to create a cloud platform IAM service unlike any other. We encountered numerous challenges along the way that would have been much easier if we allowed for customer interruption. But we had a key goal to not cause any interruptions or changes in functionality to our thousands of existing IDaaS customers. It's been immeasurably impressive to watch the development organization attack and conquer those challenges.<br></p><p>Now, with a few clicks from the OCI admin console, customers can create self-contained IDaaS instances to accommodate a variety of IAM use-cases. And this is just the beginning. The new, upgraded OCI IAM service serves as the foundation for what's to come. And I've never been more optimistic about Oracle's future in the IAM space.</p><p>Here's a short excerpt from our blog post <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/post/introducing-oci-iam-identity-domains">Introducing OCI IAM Identity Domains</a>:<br></p><p></p><blockquote><p>"Over the past five years, Oracle Identity  Cloud Service (IDCS) has grown to support thousands of customers and  currently manages hundreds of millions of identities. Current IDCS  customers enjoy a broad set of Identity and Access Management (IAM)  features for authentication (federated, social, delegated, adaptive, multi-factor authentication (MFA)), access management, manual or automated identity lifecycle and entitlement management, and single sign-on (SSO) (federated, gateways, proxies, password vaulting).</p> <p>In addition to serving IAM use cases for workforce and consumer  access scenarios, IDCS has frequently been leveraged to enhance IAM  capabilities for <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/">Oracle Cloud Infrastructure</a>&nbsp;(OCI) workloads. The <a href="https://www.oracle.com/security/cloud-security/identity-cloud/">OCI Identity and Access Management (OCI IAM)</a> service, a native OCI service that provides the access control plane  for Oracle Cloud resources (networking, compute, storage, analytics,  etc.), has provided the IAM framework for OCI via authentication, access  policies, and integrations with OCI security approaches such as <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcompartments.htm">compartments and tagging</a>.  OCI customers have adopted IDCS for its broader authentication options,  identity lifecycle management capabilities, and to provide a seamless  sign-on experience for end users that extends beyond the Oracle Cloud.</p> <p>To better address Oracle customers’ IAM requirements and to simplify  access management across Oracle Cloud, multi-cloud, Oracle enterprise  applications, and third-party applications, Oracle has merged IDCS and  OCI IAM into a single, unified cloud service that brings all of IDCS’  advanced identity and access management features natively into the OCI  IAM service. To align with Oracle Cloud branding, the unified IAM  service will leverage the OCI brand and will be offered as OCI IAM. Each instance of the OCI IAM service will be managed as identity domains in the OCI console."</p></blockquote><p></p><p><a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/post/introducing-oci-iam-identity-domains">Learn more about OCI IAM identity domains</a> <br></p>

<p>Monday, November 8, 2021</p>



<p>We started our day fairly early, getting a quick Starbucks breakfast before getting on the bus to University of Sussex to meet Celeste at 9:30 am. Celeste has an hour-long radio show, “Oops That Had Banjos”, on the campus radio station, <a href="https://www.urfonline.com/">University Radio Falmer</a>. She invited us to co-host the show. The studio was exactly as I had imagined, and it was a lot of fun doing the show with her. We each contributed a couple of songs to the playlist, and got to introduce them briefly.</p>



<p>After the show, Celeste had classes so we continued on to Lewes. We hadn’t been able to see much on our short visit Sunday evening. We started out at <a href="https://sussexpast.co.uk/attraction/lewes-castle-museum/">Lewes Castle &amp; Museum</a>, again getting an idea of the history of the place and then visiting portions of the castle itself. It was a clear day, and the view from the top was excellent. As with many of these sites, the castle went through many changes through the centuries as political conditions changed.</p>

<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/img_7759-1.jpg"></a>

<p>After climbing around the castle, we were ready for lunch. We checked out a few restaurants in town before settling on the Riverside Cafe, in an attractive area on the River Ouse. After lunch, we walked among a number of small shops before entering a <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/">Waterstones bookstore</a>. How we miss spending time in quality bookstores! I expect we’ll be seeking them out more once we return.</p>



<p>We then took the train back to Brighton, since I had a meeting to attend for work. The meeting went well; the internet connection at the hotel is solid and makes it seem like it hardly matters where in the world I am when attending these meetings.</p>



<p>Celeste came down to Brighton to have dinner with us. We decided to go with Latin American food at a local chain called Las Iguanas. The food was quite good although somewhat standard, at least to those of us from California and Colorado.</p>

  <p>Summary: Digital memories are an important component of our digital embodiment. SSI provides a foundation for self-sovereign digital memories to solve the digital-analog memory divide.</p>



<p>
    In a recent thread on the VRM mailing list, StJohn Deakins of <a href="https://www.citizenme.com/">Citizen Me</a> shared a <a href="https://www.citizenme.com/memory-the-simple-trick-to-understanding-personal-data/">formulation of interactions</a> that I thought was helpful in unpacking the discussions about data, identity, and ownership.  His framework concerns analog vs digital memories. 
</p>

<p>
    In real life, we often interact with others—both people and institutions—with relative anonymity. For example, if I go the store and use cash to buy a coke there is no exchange of identity information. If I use a credit card it's rarely the case that the entire transaction happens under the administrative authority of the identity system inherent in the credit card. Only the financial part of the transaction takes place in that identity system. This is true of most interactions in real life.
</p>

<p>
    In this situation, the cashier, others in the store, and I all share a common experience. Even so, we each retain our own memories of the interaction. No one participating would claim to "own" the interaction. But we all retain memories which are our own. There is no single "true" record of the interaction. Every participant will have a different perspective (literally). 
</p>

<p>
    On the other hand, the store, as an institution, retains a memory of having sold a coke and the credit card transaction. This digital memory of the transaction can easily persist longer than any of the analog memories of the event. Because it is a digital record we trust it and tend to think of it as "true." For some purposes, say proving in a court of law that I was in the store at a particular time, this is certainly true. But for other purposes (e.g. was the cashier friendly or rude?) the digital memory is woefully anemic. 
</p>

<p>
    Online, we only have digital memories. And people have very few tools for saving, managing, recalling, and using them. I think digital memories are one of the primary features of digital embodiment—giving people a place to stand in the digital world, their own perspective, memories, and capacity to act. We can't be peers online without having our own digital memories. 
</p>

<p>
    StJohn calls this the "analog-digital memory divide." This divide is one source of the power imbalance between people and administrative entities (i.e. anyone who has a record of you in an account). CitizenMe provides tools for people to manage digital memories. People retain their own digital memory of the event. While every participant has a similar digital memory of the event, they can all be different, reflecting different vantage points. 
</p>

<p>
    One of the recent trends in application development is microservices, with an attendant denormalization of data. The realization that there doesn't have to be, indeed often can't be, a single source of truth for data has freed application development from the strictures of centralization and led to more easily built and operated distributed applications that are resilient and scale. I think this same idea applies to digital interactions generally. Freeing ourselves from the mindset that digital systems can and should provide a single record that is "true" will lead to more autonomy and richer interactions. 
</p>

<p>
    Self-sovereign identity (SSI) provides a foundation for our digital personhood and allows us to not only taking charge of our digital memories but operationalize all of our digital relationships. Enriching the digital memories of events by allowing everyone their own perspective (i.e. making them self-sovereign) will lead to a digital world that is more like real life.

   The more I think about Facebook’s Meta’s pivot to the metaverse, the less it appears
like they do this voluntarily. I think they have no other choice: their existing
business is running out of steam. Consider: 
 
 
 At about
3.5 billion month active users

  <p>The more I think about Facebook’s Meta’s pivot to the metaverse, the less it appears
like they do this voluntarily. I think they have no other choice: their existing
business is running out of steam. Consider:</p>
 
 
<p>At about
<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/">3.5 billion month active users</a>
of at least one of their products (Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp etc),
they are running out of more humans to sign up.</p>
 
 
<p>People say they use Facebook to
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2011/12/22/using-social-media-to-keep-in-touch/">stay in touch with family and friends</a>.
But there is now one ad in my feed for each three or four posts that I actually want to
see. Add more ads than this, and users will turn their backs: Facebook doesn’t help
them with what they want help with any more, it’s all ads.</p>
 
 
<p>While their ARPU is <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/251328/facebooks-average-revenue-per-user-by-region/">much higher in the US</a>
than in Europe, where in turn it is much higher than the rest of the world – hinting that
international growth should be possible – their distribution of ARPU is not all that
different from the whole ad market’s
<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/258071/global-advertising-spending-by-region/">distribution of ad revenues in different regions</a>.
Convincing, say, Africa to spend much more on ads does not sound like a growth story.</p>
 
 
<p>And between the regulators in the EU and elsewhere, moves to effectively ban further
Instagram-like acquisitions, lawsuits left and right, and Apple’s privacy moves, their
room to manoever is getting tighter, not wider.</p>
 
 
<p>Their current price/sales ratio of <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB/key-statistics?p=FB">just under 10</a>
is hard to be justified for long under these constraints. They must also be telling themselves
that relying on an entirely ad-based business model is not good long-term strategy any
more, given the backlash against surveillance capitalism.</p>
<p>So what do you do?</p>
<p>I think you change the fundamentals of your business at the same time you change the
conversation, leveraging the technology you own. And you end up with:</p>
 
 
<p>Oculus as the replacement for the mobile phone;</p>
 
 
<p>Headset and app store sales, for Oculus, as an entirely new business model that’s
been proven (by the iPhone) to be highly profitable and is less under attack by regulators
and the public; it also supports potentially much higher ARPU than just ads;</p>
 
 
<p>Renaming the company to something completely harmless and bland sounding; that will also
let you drop the Facebook brand should it become too toxic down the road.</p>
 
 
<p>The risks are immense, starting with: how many hours a day do you hold your mobile phone
in your hand, in comparison to how many hours a day you are willing to wear a bucket
on your head, ahem, a headset? Even fundamental interaction questions, architecture questions
and use case questions for the metaverse are still completely up in the air.</p>
<p>Credit to Mark Zuckerberg for pulling off a move as substantial as this for an
almost trillion dollar company. I can’t think of any company which has ever done anything
similar at this scale. When Intel pivoted from memory to CPUs, back in the 1980’s and at
a much smaller scale, at least it was clear that there was going to be significant, growing
demand for CPUs. This is not clear at all about headsets beyond niches such as gaming.
So they are really jumping into the unknown with both feet.</p>
<p>But I don’t think any more they had a choice.</p>

<p>Having gone west to <a href="https://altmode.org/2021/11/27/sussex-day-3-chichester-and-fishbourne/">Chichester</a> yesterday, today we went east to Hastings, notable for the Norman conquest of 1066 (although the actual Battle of Hastings was some distance inland). We arranged to meet Celeste on the train as we passed through Falmer, where her campus is located, for the hour-or-so trip along the coast. Unfortunately, it seems like it’s an hour train ride to most sights outside Brighton.</p>



<p>Hastings is an attractive and somewhat touristy town, along the Channel and in a narrow valley surrounded by substantial hills. We walked through the town, stopping for a fish and chips lunch along the way, and admiring the small shops in the Old Town. We took a funicular up one of the two hills and had an excellent view of the surrounding terrain. Unfortunately, the ruins of the castle at Hastings were closed for the season.<br><br></p>

<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/img_7741-1.jpg"></a>
Funicular and view from the top



<p>After returning via funicular, we continued through the town to the <a href="http://www.hmag.org.uk/">Hastings Museum</a>, a well curated (and free!) small museum that was thorough in its coverage of the history of the area, from the Iron Age to the present. It also included an extensive collection from a local family that sailed around the world in the 1800s.</p>



<p>Taking the train back, we had a change of trains in Lewes, which Celeste had visited and enjoyed previously. We stopped at the Lewes Arms pub, but unfortunately (since it was Sunday evening) the kitchen had closed so we couldn’t get food. So Celeste returned to campus and got dinner there, while Kenna and I got take-out chicken sandwiches to eat in our hotel.</p>



<p>Our weekly family Zoom conference is on Sunday evening, England time, so we ate our sandwiches while chatting with other family members back home. It’s so much easier to stay in close touch with family while traveling than it was just a few years ago.</p>

<p>I’ve spent quite a few hours evenings and weekends recently building out a
comprehensive suite of <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch/actions">GitHub Actions for Sqitch</a>. They cover a dozen versions
of Perl, nearly 70 database versions amongst nine database engines, plus a
coverage test and a release workflow. A pull request can expect over 100 actions
to run. Each build requires over 100 direct dependencies, plus all their
dependencies. Installing them for every build would make any given run
untenable.</p>
<p>Happily, GitHub Actions include a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/advanced-guides/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows" title="GitHub Actions: “Caching dependencies to speed up workflows”">caching feature</a>, and thanks to a
<a href="https://github.com/shogo82148/actions-setup-perl/pull/892">recent improvement to shogo82148/actions-setup-perl</a>,
it’s quite easy to use in a version-independent way. Here’s an example:</p>
  <code>name: Test
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  OS:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ ubuntu, macos, windows ]
        perl: [ 'latest', '5.34', '5.32', '5.30', '5.28' ]
    name: Perl ${{ matrix.perl }} on ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Source
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Perl
        id: perl
        uses: shogo82148/actions-setup-perl@v1
        with: { perl-version: "${{ matrix.perl }}" }
      - name: Cache CPAN Modules
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: local
          key: perl-${{ steps.perl.outputs.perl-hash }}
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: cpm install --verbose --show-build-log-on-failure --no-test --cpanfile cpanfile
      - name: Run Tests
        env: { PERL5LIB: "${{ github.workspace }}/local/lib/perl5" }
        run: prove -lrj4
</code>  <p>This workflow tests every permutation of OS and Perl version specified in
<code>jobs.OS.strategy.matrix</code>, resulting in 15 jobs. The <code>runs-on</code> value determines
the OS, while the <code>steps</code> section defines steps for each permutation. Let’s take
each step in turn:</p>
 
 “Checkout Source” checks the project out of GitHub. Pretty much required for
any project. 
 “Setup Perl” sets up the version of Perl using the value from the matrix.
Note the <code>id</code> key set to <code>perl</code>, used in the next step. 
 “Cache CPAN Modules” uses the <a href="https://github.com/actions/cache">cache action</a> to cache the directory named
<code>local</code> with the key <code>perl-${{ steps.perl.outputs.perl-hash }}</code>. The key
lets us keep different versions of the <code>local</code> directory based on a unique
key. Here we’ve used the <code>perl-hash</code> output from the <code>perl</code> step defined
above. The <code>actions-setup-perl</code> action outputs this value, which contains a
hash of the output of <code>perl -V</code>, so we’re tying the cache to a very specific
version and build of Perl. This is important since compiled modules are not
compatible across major versions of Perl. 
 “Install Dependencies” uses <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/App-cpm/view/script/cpm" title="cpm - a fast CPAN module installer"><code>cpm</code></a> to quickly install Perl dependencies. By
default, it puts them into the <code>local</code> subdirectory of the current directory
— just where we configured the cache. On the first run for a given OS and
Perl version, it will install all the dependencies. But on subsequent runs
it will find the dependencies already present, thank to the cache, and
quickly exit, reporting “All requirements are satisfied.” In <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch/runs/4275487924?check_suite_focus=true">this Sqitch
job</a>, it takes less than a second. 
 “Run Tests” runs the tests that require the dependencies. It requires the
<code>PERL5LIB</code> environment variable to point to the location of our cached
dependencies. 
 
<p>That’s the whole deal. The first run will be the slowest, depending on the
number of dependencies, but subsequent runs will be much faster, up to the
seven-day caching period. For a complex project like Sqitch, which uses the same
OS and Perl version for most of its actions, this results in a tremendous build
time savings. CI configurations we’ve used in the past often took an hour or
more to run. Today, most builds take only a few minutes to test, with longer
times determined not by dependency installation but by container and database
latency.</p>

<p>Saturday, November 6, 2021</p>



<p>After a pleasant breakfast at a cafe in The Lanes, we met up with Celeste at the Brighton train station and rode to Chichester, about an hour to the west. Chichester is a pleasant (and yes, touristy) town with a notable cathedral. Arriving somewhat late, we walked through the town and then found lunch at a small restaurant on a side road as many of the major restaurants in town were quite crowded (it is a Saturday, after all).<br><br><br><br></p>



  
<p>One of the main attractions in the area is the <a href="https://sussexpast.co.uk/attraction/fishbourne-roman-palace-gardens/">Fishbourne Roman Palace</a>, one village to the west. We set out on foot, through a bit of rain, for a walk of a couple of miles. But when we arrived it was well worth the trip. This is an actual Roman palace, constructed in about 79AD, that had been uncovered starting in the 1960s, along with many coins, implements, and other artifacts. The mosaic floors were large and particularly impressive. As a teenager, I got to visit the ruins in Pompeii; these were of a similar nature. This palace and surrounding settlements were key to the Roman development of infrastructure in England.</p>
  



  
<p>Returning from Fishbourne to Chichester, we made a short visit to <a href="https://www.chichestercathedral.org.uk/">Chichester Cathedral</a>. Unfortunately, the sun had set and it was difficult to see most of the stained glass. At the time of our visit, there was a <a href="https://www.chichestercathedral.org.uk/news/50000-people-visited-luke-jerrams-museum-moon-chichester-cathedral">large model of the Moon</a>, traveling to several locations in Europe, that was hanging from the ceiling in the middle of the church. It was a striking thing to see, especially as we first entered.</p>

<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/img_7719-2.jpeg"></a>

  



<p>After our train trip back from Chichester, we parted with Celeste who returned to campus. Since it was a Saturday night, restaurants were crowded, but we were able to get dinner at a large chain pub, <a href="https://www.jdwetherspoon.com/pubs/all-pubs/england/east-sussex/the-post--telegraph-brighton">Wetherspoons</a>. The pub was noisy and table service was minimal. We ordered via their website and they only cleared the previous patrons’ dirty dishes when they delivered our food. The food was acceptable, but nothing to blog about.</p>

<p>Friday, November 5, 2021</p>



<p>These days, “day 2” after arriving in the UK has a special implication: it is on this day that you must take and report the results of a COVID-19 test. As required, we ordered the tests and had them delivered to our hotel. After breakfast (in our room/apartment, with groceries we picked up previously), we very methodically followed the instructions and 15 minutes later happily had negative test results. You send an image of the test stick next to the information page from your passport and a little while later they send a certificate of your test results. Presumably the results were sent to the authorities as well so they don’t come looking for us.</p>



<p>Celeste had classes at various times (including an 8:30 pm meeting with the Theater Department in Colorado) so Kenna and I were on our own today. We set out to explore Brighton, a city that bears resemblance to both Santa Cruz and Berkeley, California. We took a rather long walk, beginning with  the shore area. We walked out to the end of <a href="https://www.brightonpier.co.uk/">Brighton Palace Pier</a>, which includes a sizable game arcade and a small amusement park with rides at the end.</p>



<p>We decided to continue eastward along the shore and walked a long path toward Brighton Marina. Along the way were a variety of activities, including miniature golf, a sauna, an outdoor studio including a yoga class in session, and an electric railway. There was also quite a bit of construction, which makes sense since it’s off-season.</p>



<p>We arrived at the marina not entirely clear on how to approach it by foot: the major building we saw was a large parking garage. So we continued along the Undercliff Trail, the cliffs being primarily chalk. This is how we picture the White Cliffs of Dover must be (although Dover probably has higher cliffs). At the far end of the marina we found a pedestrian entrance, and walked back through the marina to find some lunch. We ate outdoors at <a href="https://www.bitesussex.com/taste-sussex">Taste Sussex</a>, which was quite good, although our seating area got a little chilly once the sun fell behind a nearby building.</p>

<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/img_4470.jpeg"></a>
Brighton cliffs and marina



<p>Our return took us through the areas of the marina that didn’t look very pedestrian-friendly, but were actually OK. We took a different route back to the hotel through the Kemptown District. We’re not sure we found the main part of Kemptown but we did walk past the Royal Sussex Hospital.</p>



<p>We had heard about the <a href="https://www.brightontoymuseum.co.uk/">Brighton Toy and Model Museum</a>, and had a little time so we went looking for it. The maps indicated that it is located adjacent to the train station, so we went to the train station and wandered around for quite a while before discovering that it’s sort of under the station, accessed through a door on the side of an underpass. The museum is physically small, but they have a very extensive collection of classic toys and model trains, primarily from the early 20th century. The staff was helpful and friendly, even offering suggestions for what else to see while in the area.</p>



<p>We had a late lunch, so instead of going out for dinner we opted for wine/beer and a charcuterie plate from the small bar in the hotel. It included a couple of unusual cheeses (a black-colored cheddar, for example) and met our needs well.</p>



<p>Guy Fawkes Day is traditionally celebrated in the UK with bonfires and fireworks displays to commemorate his 1605 attempt to blow up Parliament. Although our room faces the Channel, we heard but had limited visibility to various fireworks being set off on the shore. So we again set out on foot and saw a few, but since the fireworks are unofficial (set off by random people on the beach), they were widely dispersed and unorganized.</p>



<p>It has been a good day for walking, with over 10 miles traveled.</p>

   Introduction to heredocs in Dockerfiles 
 This is a fantastic upgrade to Dockerfile syntax, enabled by BuildKit and a new frontend for executing the Dockerfile that can be specified with a #syntax= directive. I often like to create a standalone Dockerfile that works without needing other files from a directory, so being able to use &lt;&lt;EOF syntax to populate configure files from inline blocks

<p>Setup Azure App Service</p>



<p>An Azure App Service was created which uses .NET and 64 bit configurations. The Azure App Service is configured to require incoming client certificates and will forward this to the application. By configuring this, any valid certificate will work. The certificate still needs to be validated inside the application. You need to check that the correct client certificate is being used.</p>







<p>Implement the API with certificate authentication for deployment</p>



<p>The AddAuthentication sets the default scheme to CertificateAuthentication. The AddCertificate method adds the required configuration to validate the client certificates used with each request. We use a self signed certificate for the authentication. If a valid certificate is used, the MyCertificateValidationService is used to validate that it is also the correct certificate.</p>


  var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddControllers();
builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();

builder.Services.AddSingleton&lt;MyCertificateValidationService&gt;();

builder.Services.AddAuthentication(CertificateAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddCertificate(options =&gt;
    {
        // https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/certauth
        options.AllowedCertificateTypes = CertificateTypes.SelfSigned;

        options.Events = new CertificateAuthenticationEvents
        {
            OnCertificateValidated = context =&gt;
            {
                var validationService = context.HttpContext.RequestServices.GetService&lt;MyCertificateValidationService&gt;();

                if (validationService != null &amp;&amp; validationService.ValidateCertificate(context.ClientCertificate))
                {
                    var claims = new[]
                    {
                        new Claim(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier, context.ClientCertificate.Subject, ClaimValueTypes.String, context.Options.ClaimsIssuer),
                        new Claim(ClaimTypes.Name, context.ClientCertificate.Subject, ClaimValueTypes.String, context.Options.ClaimsIssuer)
                    };

                    context.Principal = new ClaimsPrincipal(new ClaimsIdentity(claims, context.Scheme.Name));
                    context.Success();
                }
                else
                {
                    context.Fail("invalid cert");
                }

                return Task.CompletedTask;
            }
        };
    });

builder.Host.UseSerilog((hostingContext, loggerConfiguration) =&gt; loggerConfiguration
    .ReadFrom.Configuration(hostingContext.Configuration)
    .Enrich.FromLogContext()
    .MinimumLevel.Debug()
    .WriteTo.Console()
    .WriteTo.File(
        //$@"../certauth.txt",
        $@"D:\home\LogFiles\Application\{Environment.UserDomainName}.txt",
        fileSizeLimitBytes: 1_000_000,
        rollOnFileSizeLimit: true,
        shared: true,
        flushToDiskInterval: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1)));
  


<p>The middleware services are setup so that in development no authentication is used and the requests are validated using basic authentication. If the environment in not development, certificate authentication is used and all API calls require authorization. </p>


  var app = builder.Build();

if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseSwagger();
    app.UseSwaggerUI();
}

app.UseHttpsRedirection();

if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseAuthentication();
    app.UseAuthorization();
    app.MapControllers().RequireAuthorization();
}
else
{
    app.UseAuthorization();
    app.MapControllers();
}

app.Run();
  


<p>The MyCertificateValidationService validates the certificate. This checks if the certificate used has the correct thumbprint and is the same as the certificate used in the client application, in these case the Azure B2C API connector.</p>


  public class MyCertificateValidationService 
{
	private readonly ILogger&lt;MyCertificateValidationService&gt; _logger;

	public MyCertificateValidationService(ILogger&lt;MyCertificateValidationService&gt; logger)
	{
		_logger = logger;
	}

	public bool ValidateCertificate(X509Certificate2 clientCertificate)
	{
		return CheckIfThumbprintIsValid(clientCertificate);
	}

	private bool CheckIfThumbprintIsValid(X509Certificate2 clientCertificate)
	{
		var listOfValidThumbprints = new List&lt;string&gt;
		{
			// add thumbprints of your allowed clients
			"15D118271F9AE7855778A2E6A00A575341D3D904"
		};

		if (listOfValidThumbprints.Contains(clientCertificate.Thumbprint))
		{
			_logger.LogInformation($"Custom auth-success for certificate  {clientCertificate.FriendlyName} {clientCertificate.Thumbprint}");

			return true;
		}

		_logger.LogWarning($"auth failed for certificate  {clientCertificate.FriendlyName} {clientCertificate.Thumbprint}");

		return false;
	}
}
  


<p>Setup Azure B2C API connector with certification authentication</p>



<p>The Azure B2C API connector is setup to use a certificate. You can create the certificate anyway you want. I used the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/CertificateManager/">CertificateManager</a> Nuget package to create a RSA 512 certificate with a 3072 key size. The thumbprint from this certificate needs to be validated in the ASP.NET Core API application.</p>







<p>The Azure B2C API connector is added to the Azure B2C user flow. The use flow requires all the custom claims to be defined and the values can be set in the API Connector service. See the first post in this blog group for <a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/11/15/add-extra-claims-to-an-azure-b2c-user-flow-using-api-connectors/">details</a>.</p>







<p>Creating an RSA 512 with a 3072 size key </p>



<p>You can create certificates using .NET Core using the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/CertificateManager/">CertificateManager</a> Nuget package which provides some helper methods for creating the X509 certificates as required.</p>


  class Program
{
	static CreateCertificates _cc;
	static void Main(string[] args)
	{
		var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()
			.AddUserSecrets&lt;Program&gt;();
		var configuration = builder.Build();

		var sp = new ServiceCollection()
		   .AddCertificateManager()
		   .BuildServiceProvider();

		_cc = sp.GetService&lt;CreateCertificates&gt;();

		var rsaCert = CreateRsaCertificateSha512KeySize2048("localhost", 10);

		string password = configuration["certificateSecret"];
		var iec = sp.GetService&lt;ImportExportCertificate&gt;();

		var rsaCertPfxBytes = iec.ExportSelfSignedCertificatePfx(password, rsaCert);
		File.WriteAllBytes("cert_rsa512.pfx", rsaCertPfxBytes);

		Console.WriteLine("created");
	}

	public static X509Certificate2 CreateRsaCertificateSha512KeySize2048(string dnsName, int validityPeriodInYears)
	{
		var basicConstraints = new BasicConstraints
		{
			CertificateAuthority = false,
			HasPathLengthConstraint = false,
			PathLengthConstraint = 0,
			Critical = false
		};

		var subjectAlternativeName = new SubjectAlternativeName
		{
			DnsName = new List&lt;string&gt;
			{
				dnsName,
			}
		};

		var x509KeyUsageFlags = X509KeyUsageFlags.DigitalSignature;

		// only if certification authentication is used
		var enhancedKeyUsages = new OidCollection
		{
			OidLookup.ClientAuthentication,
			// OidLookup.ServerAuthentication 
			// OidLookup.CodeSigning,
			// OidLookup.SecureEmail,
			// OidLookup.TimeStamping  
		};

		var certificate = _cc.NewRsaSelfSignedCertificate(
			new DistinguishedName { CommonName = dnsName },
			basicConstraints,
			new ValidityPeriod
			{
				ValidFrom = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow,
				ValidTo = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddYears(validityPeriodInYears)
			},
			subjectAlternativeName,
			enhancedKeyUsages,
			x509KeyUsageFlags,
			new RsaConfiguration
			{ 
				KeySize = 3072,
				HashAlgorithmName = HashAlgorithmName.SHA512
			});

		return certificate;
	}
}
  


<p>Running the applications</p>



<p>I setup two user flows for running and testing the applications. One is using ngrok and local development with basic authentication. The second is using certification authentication and the deployed Azure App service. I published the API to the App service and run the UI application. When the user signs in, the API connector is used to get the extra custom claims from the deployed API and is returned.</p>

  <p>Updates to six major projects this week, plus finally some concrete progress towards Datasette 1.0.</p>
 Fixing Datasette's proxy bugs 
<p>Now that Datasette has had its fourth birthday I've decided to really push towards hitting <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/milestone/7">the 1.0 milestone</a>. The key property of that release will be a stable JSON API, stable plugin hooks and a stable, documented context for custom templates. There's quite a lot of mostly unexciting work needed to get there.</p>
<p>As I work through the issues in that milestone I'm encountering some that I filed more than two years ago!</p>
<p>Two of those made it into the <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-59-3">Datasette 0.59.3</a> bug fix release earlier this week.</p>
<p>The majority of the work in that release though related to Datasette's <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/settings.html#base-url">base_url feature</a>, designed to help people who run Datasette behind a proxy.</p>
<p><code>base_url</code> lets you run Datasette like this:</p>
 <code>datasette --setting base_url=/prefix/ fixtures.db
</code> 
<p>When you do this, Datasette will change its URLs to start with that prefix - so the hompage will live at <code>/prefix/</code>, the database index page at <code>/prefix/fixtures/</code>, tables at <code>/prefix/fixtures/facetable</code> etc.</p>
<p>The reason you would want this is if you are running a larger website, and you intend to proxy traffic to <code>/prefix/</code> to a separate Datasette instance.</p>
<p>The Datasette documentation includes <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/deploying.html#running-datasette-behind-a-proxy">suggested nginx and Apache configurations</a> for doing exactly that.</p>
<p>This feature has been <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues?q=is%3Aissue+base_url">a magnet for bugs</a> over the years! People keep finding new parts of the Datasette interface that fail to link to the correct pages when run in this mode.</p>
<p>The principle cause of these bugs is that I don't use Datasette in this way myself, so I wasn't testing it nearly as thoroughly as it needed.</p>
<p>So the first step in finally solving these issues once and for all was to get my own instance of Datasette up and running behind an Apache proxy.</p>
<p>Since I like to deploy live demos to Cloud Run, I decided to try and run Apache and Datasette in the same container. This took a lot of figuring out. You can follow my progress on this in these two issue threads:</p>
 
 <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1521">#1521: Docker configuration for exercising Datasette behind Apache mod_proxy</a> 
 <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1522">#1522: Deploy a live instance of demos/apache-proxy</a> 
 
<p>The short version: I got it working! My Docker implementation now lives in the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/tree/0.59.3/demos/apache-proxy">demos/apache-proxy</a> directory and the live demo itself is deployed to <a href="https://datasette-apache-proxy-demo.fly.dev/prefix/">datasette-apache-proxy-demo.fly.dev/prefix/</a>.</p>
<p>(I ended up deploying it to <a href="https://fly.io/">Fly</a> after running into a bug when deployed to Cloud Run that I couldn't replicate on my own laptop.)</p>
<p>My final implementation uses a Debian base container with Supervisord to manage the two processes.</p>
<p>With a working live environment, I was finally able to track down the root cause of the bugs. My notes on
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1519">#1519: base_url is omitted in JSON and CSV views</a> document how I found and solved them, and updated the associated test to hopefully avoid them ever coming back in the future.</p>
 The big Datasette table refactor 
<p>The single most complicated part of the Datasette codebase is the code behind the table view - the page that lets you browse, facet, search, filter and paginate through the contents of a table (<a href="https://covid-19.datasettes.com/covid/ny_times_us_counties">this page here</a>).</p>
<p>It's got very thorough tests, but the actual implementation is mostly <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/main/datasette/views/table.py#L303-L992">a 600 line class method</a>.</p>
<p>It was already difficult to work with, but the changes I want to make for Datasette 1.0 have proven too much for it. I need to refactor.</p>
<p>Apart from making that view easier to change and maintain, a major goal I have is for it to support a much more flexible JSON syntax. I want the JSON version to default to just returning minimal information about the table, then allow <code>?_extra=x</code> parameters to opt into additional information - like facets, suggested facets, full counts, SQL schema information and so on.</p>
<p>This means I want to break up that 600 line method into a bunch of separate methods, each of which can be opted-in-to by the calling code.</p>
<p>The HTML interface should then build on top of the JSON, requesting the extras that it knows it will need and passing the resulting data through to the template. This helps solve the challenge of having a stable template context that I can document in advance of Datasette 1.0</p>
<p>I've been putting this off for over a year now, because it's a lot of work. But no longer! This week I finally started to get stuck in.</p>
<p>I don't know if I'll stick with it, but my initial attempt at this is a little unconventional. Inspired by how <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/fixture.html#back-to-fixtures">pytest fixtures work</a> I'm experimenting with a form of dependency injection, in a new (very alpha) library I've released called <a href="https://github.com/simonw/asyncinject">asyncinject</a>.</p>
<p>The key idea behind <code>asyncinject</code> is to provide a way for class methods to indicate their dependencies as named parameters, in the same way as pytest fixtures do.</p>
<p>When you call a method, the code can spot which dependencies have not yet been resolved and execute them before executing the method.</p>
<p>Crucially, since they are all <code>async def</code> methods they can be executed in parallel. I'm cautiously excited about this - Datasette has a bunch of opportunities for parallel queries - fetching a single page of table rows, calculating a <code>count(*)</code> for the entire table, executing requested facets and calculating suggested facets are all queries that could potentially run in parallel rather than in serial.</p>
<p>What about the GIL, you might ask? Datasette's database queries are handled by the <code>sqlite3</code> module, and that module releases the GIL once it gets into SQLite C code. So theoretically I should be able to use more than one core for this all.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/simonw/asyncinject/blob/0.2a0/README.md">asyncinject README</a> has more details, including code examples. This may turn out to be a terrible idea! But it's really fun to explore, and I'll be able to tell for sure if this is a useful, maintainable and performant approach once I have Datasette's table view running on top of it.</p>
 git-history and sqlite-utils 
<p>I made some big improvements to my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/git-history">git-history</a> tool, which automates the process of turning a JSON (or other) file that has been version-tracked in a GitHub repository (see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/">Git scraping</a>) into a SQLite database that can be used to explore changes to it over time.</p>
<p>The biggest was a major change to the database schema. Previously, the tool used full Git SHA hashes as foreign keys in the largest table.</p>
<p>The problem here is that a SHA hash string is 40 characters long, and if they are being used as a foreign key that's a LOT of extra weight added to the largest table.</p>
<p><code>sqlite-utils</code> has a <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html#python-api-lookup-tables">table.lookup() method</a> which is designed to make creating "lookup" tables - where a string is stored in a unique column but an integer ID can be used for things like foreign keys - as easy as possible.</p>
<p>That method was previously quite limited, but in <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v3-18">sqlite-utils 3.18</a> and <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v3-19">3.19</a> - both released this week - I expanded it to cover the more advanced needs of my <code>git-history</code> tool.</p>
<p>The great thing about building stuff on top of your own libraries is that you can discover new features that you need along the way - and then ship them promptly without them blocking your progress!</p>
 Some other highlights 
 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/releases/tag/0.6">s3-credentials 0.6</a> adds a <code>--dry-run</code> option that you can use to show what the tool would do without making any actual changes to your AWS account. I found myself wanting this while continuing to work on the ability to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/issues/12">specify a folder prefix</a> within S3 that the bucket credentials should be limited to. 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-publish-vercel/releases/tag/0.12">datasette-publish-vercel 0.12</a> applies some pull requests from Romain Clement that I had left unreviewed for far too long, and adds the ability to customize the <code>vercel.json</code> file used for the deployment - useful for things like setting up additional custom redirects. 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/releases/tag/2.0">datasette-graphql 2.0</a> updates that plugin to <a href="https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene/wiki/v3-release-notes">Graphene 3.0</a>, a major update to that library. I had to break backwards compatiblity in very minor ways, hence the 2.0 version number. 
 
 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/csvs-to-sqlite/releases/tag/1.3">csvs-to-sqlite 1.3</a> is the first relase of that tool in just over a year. William Rowell contributed a new feature that allows you to populate "fixed" database columns on your imported records, see <a href="https://github.com/simonw/csvs-to-sqlite/pull/81">PR #81</a> for details.

<p>A Reader’s&nbsp;Guide</p><p>How should crypto be regulated? And by whom? These are the big questions the industry is grappling with in the wake of the infrastructure bill being signed with the haphazardly expanded definition of a broker dealer for tax reporting provisions. So now the industry is *atwitter* with ideas about where to go from&nbsp;here.</p><p>Three large companies have all come out with policy suggestions: FTX, Coinbase and and A16z. While these proposals differ in approach, they all seek to address a few central policy questions. I’ll break down the proposals based on key subject&nbsp;areas:</p><p>Consumer Protection</p><p>A16: Suggests a framework for DAO’s to provide disclosures.</p><p>Coinbase: Sets a goal to “​​Enhance transparency through appropriate disclosure requirements. Protect against fraud and market manipulation”</p><p>FTX: Similarly suggests framework for “disclosure and transparency standards”</p><p>All three of these make ample mention of consumer protections that seem to begin and end at disclosures. Regulators might want something with a little more teeth. FTX provides a more robust outline for combating fraud, suggesting the use of on-chain analytics tools. This is a smart and concrete suggestion of how to improve existing regulation that relies on SARS reports filed AFTER suspicious activity.</p><p>Exactly how Decentralized?</p><p>A16: Seeks to create a definition and entity status for DAO’s, which would ostensibly require a different kind of regulation than more custodial services.</p><p>Coinbase: ​Platforms and services that do not custody or otherwise control the assets of a customer — including miners, stakers and developers — would need to be treated differently</p><p>FTX- Doesn’t mention decentralization.</p><p>These are really varied approaches. I’m not criticizing FTX here, they are focusing on consumer protections and combating fraud which are good things to highlight. However the core regulatory issues is- can we differentiate between decentralized and centralized products and does that create a fundamentally conflict with existing law. A16z’s approach is novel, a new designation without a new&nbsp;agency.</p><p>The Devil You Know vs The Devil you&nbsp;Don’t</p><p>A16- Suggests the Government Office of Accountability “assess the current state of regulatory jurisdiction over cryptocurrency, digital assets, and decentralized technology, and to compare the costs and benefits of harmonizing jurisdiction among agencies against vesting supervision and oversight with a federally chartered self-regulatory organization or one or more nonprofit corporations.”</p><p>Coinbase- Argues that this technology needs a new regulatory agency and that all digital assets should be under a single regulatory authority. Also suggests coordination with a Self Regulatory Organization.</p><p>FTX- Doesn’t step into that&nbsp;morass.</p><p>Coinbase has the most aggressive position here. I personally am not convinced of the need for a new regulatory agency. We haven’t tried it the old fashioned way yet, where existing agencies offer clarity about what would bring a digital asset into their jurisdiction and what would exclude it. Creating a new agency is a slow and expensive process. And then that agency would need to justify its existence by aggressively cracking down. It’s a bit like creating a hammer and then inevitably complaining that it sees everything as a&nbsp;nail.</p><p>How to achieve regulatory change in the US for&nbsp;crypto:</p>  Stop tweeting aggressively at the people who regulate you. Negative points if you are a billionaire complaining about&nbsp;taxes.  Spend some time developing relationships with policymakers and working collaboratively with communities you want to support. Lotta talk of unbanked communities- any stats on how they are being served by this tech? (Seriously please&nbsp;share)  Consider looking at who is already doing the work you want to accelerate and consider working with them/learning from and supporting existing efforts rather than whipping out your proposal and demanding attention. Examples: CoinCenter, Blockchain Association. At the state level: <a href="https://www.blockadvocacy.org/">Blockchain Advocacy Coalition </a>of course, Cascadia Blockchain Council, Texas Blockchain Council&nbsp;etc.  <p>A16: <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/2021-09-27-andreessen-horowitz-senate-banking-proposals/ec055eb0ce534033/full.pdf#page=9">https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/2021-09-27-andreessen-horowitz-senate-banking-proposals/ec055eb0ce534033/full.pdf#page=9</a></p><p>Coinbase: <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/digital-asset-policy-proposal-safeguarding-americas-financial-leadership-ce569c27d86">https://blog.coinbase.com/digital-asset-policy-proposal-safeguarding-americas-financial-leadership-ce569c27d86</a>c</p><p>FTX: <a href="https://blog.ftx.com/policy/policy-goals-market-regulation/">https://blog.ftx.com/policy/policy-goals-market-regulation/</a></p>

  <p>Summary:      The hype over NFTs and collectibles is blinding us to their true usefulness as trustworthy persistent data objects. How do they sit in the landscape with verifiable credentials and picos?</p>




<p>
    Listening to this <a href="https://www.reality2cast.com/87?t=0">Reality 2.0 podcast about NFTs</a> with <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a>, <a href="https://katherinedruckman.com">Katherine Druckman</a>, and their guest <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/users/greg-bledsoe">Greg Bledsoe</a> got me thinking about NFTs. <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/03/what_we_learn_about_self-sovereignty_from_cryptokitties.shtml">I first wrote about NFTs</a> in 2018 regarding what was perhaps the first popular NFT: Cryptokitties. I bought a few and played with them, examined the contract code, and was thinking about how they might enable self-sovereignty, or not. I wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>[E]ach kitty has some interesting properties:</p>
     
         Each Kitty is distinguishable from all the rest and has a unique identity and existence 
         Each kitty is owned by someone. Specifically, it is controlled by whoever has the private keys associated with the address that the kitty is tied to. 
     
</blockquote>
<p>
    This is a good description of the properties of NFTs in general. Notice that nothing here says that NFTs have to be about art, or collectibles, although that's the primary use case right now that's generating so much hype. Cryptokitties were more interesting than most of the NFT use cases right now because the smart contract allowed them to be remixed to produce new kitties (for a fee).
</p>

<p>
    Suppose I rewrote the quote from my post on Cryptokitties like this:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>[E]ach verifiable credential (VC) has some interesting properties:</p>
     
         Each VC is distinguishable from all the rest and has a unique identity and existence 
         Each VC is owned by someone. Specifically, it is controlled by whoever has the private keys associated with the address that the VC was issued to. 
     
</blockquote>
<p>
    Interesting, no? So, if these properties are true for both NFTs and verifiable credentials, what's the difference? The primary difference is that right now, we envision VC issuers to be institutions, like the DMV, your bank, or employer. And institutions are centralized. In contrast, because NFTs are created using a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, we think of them as decentralized. But, not so fast. As I noted in my post on Cryptokitties, you can't assume an NFT is decentralized without examining the smart contract. 
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>There is one problem with CryptoKitties as a model of self-sovereignty: the CryptoKitty smart contract has a "pause" function that can be executed by certain addresses. This is probably a protection against bugs—no one wants to be the next <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)">theDAO</a>—but it does provide someone besides the owner with a way to shut it all down.</p>
    <p>I have no idea who that someone is and can't hold them responsible for their behavior—I'd guess it's someone connected with CryptoKitties. Whoever has control of these special addresses could shutdown the entire enterprise. I do not believe, based on the contract structure, that they could take away individual kitties; it's an all or nothing proposition. Since they charged money for setting this up, there's likely some contract law that could be used for recourse. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    So, without looking at the code for the smart contract, it's hard to say that a particular NFT is decentralized or not. They may be just as centralized as your bank1.  
</p>

<p>
    To examine this more closely, let's look at a property title, like a car title, as an example. The DMV could decide to issue car titles as verifiable credentials tomorrow. And the infrastructure to support it is all there: well-supported open source code, companies to provide issuing software and wallets, and specifications and protocols for <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/10/ugh_theres_an_app_for_that.shtml">interoperability</a>2. Nothing has to change politically for that to happen. 
</p>

<p>
    The DMV could also issue car titles as NFTs. With an NFT, I'd prove I own the car by exercising control over the private key that controls the NFT representing the car title. The state might do this to provide more automation for car transfers.  Here too, they'd have to find an infrastructure provider to help them, ensure they had a usable wallet to store the title, and interact with the smart contract. I don't know how interoperable this would be.
</p>

<p>
    One of the key features of an NFT is that they can be transfered between owners or controllers. Verifiable credentials, because of their core use cases are not designed to be transferred, rather they are revoked and reissued.
</p>

<p>
    Suppose I want to sell the car. With a verifiable credential, the state would still be there, revoking the VC representing my title to the car and issuing a new VC to the buyer when the title transfers. The record of who owns what is still the database at the DMV. With NFTs we can get rid of that database. So, selling my car now becomes something that might happen in a decentralized way, without the state as an intermediary. Note that they could do this and still retain a regulatory interest in car titling if they control the smart contract.
</p>

<p>
    But, the real value of issuing a car title as an NFT would be if it were done using a smart contract in a way that decentralized car titles. If you imagine a world of self-driving cars that own and sell themselves, then that's interesting.  You could also imagine that we want to remove the DMV from the business of titling cars altogether. That's a big political lift, but if you dream of a world with much smaller government, then NFT-based car titles might be a way to do that. But I think it's a ways off. So, we could use NFTs for car titles, but right now there's not much point besides the automation.  
</p>

<p>
    You can also imagine a much more decentralized future for verifiable credentials. There's no reason a smart contract couldn't issue and revoke verifiable credentials according to rules embodied in the code. Sphereon has an <a href="https://sphereon.com/solution/integration-of-verifiable-credentials-for-daml-workflows/">integration between</a> verifiable credentials and the <a href="https://github.com/digital-asset/daml#readme">Digital Assets Markup Language (DAML)</a>, a smart contract language. Again, how decentralized the application is depends on the smart contract, but decentralized, institution-independent verifiable credentials are possible. 
</p>

<p>
    A decade ago, Lucas, Ballay, and McManus wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B008SGNFJQ/windleyofente-20">Trillions: Thriving in the Emerging Information Ecology</a>. One of the ideas they talked about was something they called a persistent data object (PDO). I was <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2012/12/programing_the_cloud_with_persistent_data_objects.shtml">intrigued by persistent data objects</a> because of the work we'd been doing at Kynetx on personal clouds. In applying the idea of PDOs, I quickly realized that what we were doing was much more than data because our persistent data objects also encapsulated code and the name <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/07/ten_reasons_to_use_picos_for_your_next_decentralized_programming_project.shtml">persistent compute objects, or picos</a> was born.
</p>

<p>
    An NFT is one possible realization of Trillion's PDOs. So are verifiable credentials. Both are <a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/verifiable-credentials-arent-credentials-they-re-containers-fab5b3ae5c0">persistent containers for data</a>. They are both <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X20303067">capable of inspiring confidence</a> that the data they contain has <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/fidelity_provenance_and_trust.shtml">fidelity and, perhaps, a trustworthy provenance</a>. A pico is an agent. Picos can:
    </p> 
         have a wallet that holds and exchanges NFTs and credentials according to the rules encapsulated in the pico.  
         be programmed to interact with the smart contract for an NFT to perform the legal operations. 
         be programmed to receive, hold, and present verifiable credentials according to the proper <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">DIDCommm protocols</a>.3  
     
<p></p>


	<a></a>
	Relationship between NFTs, verifiable credentials, and picos (click to enlarge)


<p>
    NFTs are currently in their awkward, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pets.com">Pets.com</a> stage. Way too much hype and many myopic use cases. But I think they'll grow to have valuable uses in creating more decentralized, trustworthy data objects. If you listen to the reality 2.0 podcast starting about <a href="https://www.reality2cast.com/87?t=3350">56 minutes</a>, Greg, Katherine, and Doc get into some of those. Greg's starting with games—a good place, I think. Supply chain is another promising area. If you need decentralized, automated, trustworthy, persistent data containers, then NFTs fit the bill. 
</p>

<p>
    People who live in a country with a strong commitment to the rule of law, might ask why decentralizing things like titles and supply chains is a good idea. But that's not everyone's reality. Blockchains and NFTs can inspire confidence in systems that would otherwise be too costly or untrustworthy otherwise. Picos are a great way to create distributed systems of entity-oriented compute nodes that are capable of using PDOs. 
</p>

     Note that I'm not saying that Cryptokitties is as centralized as your bank. Just that without looking at the code, you can't tell.  
     Yeah, I know that interop is still a work in progress. But at least it's in progress, not ignored. 
     These are not capabilities that picos presently have, but they do support DIDComm messaging. Want to help add these to picos? Contact me.

  <p>Summary:      Zero-knowledge proofs are a powerful cryptographic technique at the heart of self-sovereign identity (SSI). This post should help you understand what they are and how they can be used.</p>



<p>
    Suppose Peggy needs to prove to Victor that she is in possession of a secret without revealing the secret. Can she do so in a way that convinces Victor that she really does know the secret? This is the question at the heart of one of the most powerful cryptographic processes we can employ in identity systems: zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). Suppose for example that Peggy has a digital driver's license and wants to prove to Victor, the bartender, that she's over 21 without just handing over her driver's license or even showing him her birthdate. ZKPs allow Peggy to prove her driver's license says she's at least 21 in a way that convinces Victor without Peggy having to reveal anything else (i.e., there's zero excess knowledge).
</p>

<p>
    This problem was first explored by MIT researchers Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali and Charles Rackoff in the 1980s as a way of combatting information leakage. The goal is to reduce the amount of extra information the verifier, Victor, can learn about the prover, Peggy.
</p>

<p>
    One way to understand how ZKPs work is the story of the Cave of Alibaba, first published by cryptographers Quisquater, Guillou, and Berson1.  The following diagram provides an illustration.
</p>


	  <a></a>
	  Peggy and Victor in Alibaba's Cave (click to enlarge)


<p>
    The Cave of Alibaba has two passages, labeled A and B, that split off a single passageway connected to the entrance. Peggy possesses a secret code that allows her to unlock a door connecting A and B. Victor wants to buy the code but won't pay until he's sure Peggy knows it. Peggy won't share it with Victor until he pays.</p>

<p>
    The algorithm for Peggy proving she knows the code proceeds as follows:
</p>
 
     Victor stands outside the cave while Peggy enters and selects one of the passages. Victor is not allowed to see which path Peggy takes.  
     Victor enters the cave and calls out "A" or "B" at random. 
     Peggy emerges from the correct passageway because she can easily unlock the door regardless of which choice she made when entering. 
     Of course, Peggy could have just gotten lucky and guessed right, so Peggy and Victor repeat the experiment many times.  
 

<p>
    If Peggy can always come back by whichever passageway Victor selects, then there is an increasing probability that Peggy really knows the code. After 20 tries, there's less than one chance in a million that Peggy is simply guessing which letter Victor will call. This constitutes a probabilistic proof that Peggy knows the secret.
</p>

<p>
    This algorithm not only allows Peggy to convince Victor she knows the code, but it does it in a way that ensures Victor can't convince anyone else Peggy knows the code. Suppose Victor records the entire transaction. The only thing an observer sees is Victor calling out letters and Peggy emerging from the right tunnel. The observer can't be sure Victor and Peggy didn't agree on a sequence of letters in advance to fool observers. Note that this property relies on the algorithm using a good pseudo-random number generator with a high-entropy seed so that Peggy and third-party observers can't predict Victor's choices. 
</p>

<p>
    Thus, while Peggy cannot deny to Victor that she knows the secret, she can deny that she knows the secret to other third parties. This ensures that anything she proves to Victor stays between them and Victor cannot leak it—at least in a cryptographic way that proves it came from Peggy. Peggy retains control of both her secret and the fact that she knows it.
</p>

<p>
    When we say "zero knowledge" and talk about Victor learning nothing beyond the proposition in question, that's not perfectly true. In the cave of Alibaba, Peggy proves in zero knowledge that she knows the secret. But there are many other things that Victor learns about Peggy that ZKPs can do nothing about. For example, Victor knows that Peggy can hear him, speaks his language, walk, and is cooperative. He also might learn things about the cave, like approximately how long it takes to unlock the door. Peggy learns similar things about Victor. So, the reality is that the proof is approximately zero knowledge not perfectly zero knowledge.
</p>

<a></a>
 ZKP Systems 

<p>
    The example of Alibaba's Cave is a very specific use of ZKPs, what's called a zero-knowledge proof of knowledge. Peggy is proving she knows (or possesses something). More generally, Peggy might want to prove many facts to Victor. These could include propositional phrases or even values. ZKPs can do that as well.
</p>

<p>
    To understand how we can prove propositions in zero knowledge, consider a different example, sometimes called the Socialist Millionaire Problem. Suppose Peggy and Victor want to know if they're being paid a fair wage. Specifically, they want to know whether they are paid the same amount, but don't want to disclose their specific hourly rate to each other or even a trusted third party. In this instance, Peggy isn't proving she knows a secret, rather, she's proving an equality (or inequality) proposition.
</p>

<p>
    For simplicity, assume that Peggy and Victor are being paid one of $10, $20, $30, or $40 per hour. The algorithm works like this:
</p>
 
     Peggy buys four lock boxes and labels them $10, $20, $30, and $40.  
     She throws away the keys to every box except the one labeled with her wage.  
     Peggy gives all the locked boxes to Victor who privately puts a slip of paper with a "+" into the slot at the top of the box labeled with his salary. He puts a slip with a "-" in all the other boxes.  
     Victor gives the boxes back to Peggy who uses her key in private to open the box with her salary on it.  
     If she finds a "+" then they make the same amount. Otherwise, they make a different amount. She can use this to prove the fact to Victor. 
 

<p>
    This is called an oblivious transfer and proves the proposition <code>VictorSalary = PeggySalary</code> true or false in zero knowledge (i.e., without revealing any other information).
</p>

<p>
    For this to work, Peggy and Victor must trust that the other will be forthcoming and state their real salary. Victor needs to trust that Peggy will throw away the three other keys. Peggy must trust that Victor will put only one slip with a "+" on it in the boxes.
</p>

<p> 
    Just like digital certificates need a PKI to establish confidence beyond what would be possible with self-issued certificates alone, ZKPs are more powerful in a system that allows Peggy and Victor to prove facts from things others say about them, not just what they say about themselves. For example, rather than Peggy and Victor self-asserting their salary, suppose they could rely on a signed document from the HR department in making their assertion so that both know that the other is stating their true salary. <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/12/verifiable_credential_exchange.shtml?utm_campaign=Technometria&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">Verifiable Credentials</a> provide a system for using ZKPs to prove many different facts alone or in concert, in ways that give confidence in the method and trust in the data.
</p>

<a></a>
 Non-Interactive ZKPs 

<p>
    In the previous examples, Peggy was able to prove things to Victor through a series of interactions. For ZKPs to be practical, interactions between the prover and the verifier should be minimal. Fortunately, a technique called SNARK allows for non-interactive zero knowledge proofs.
</p>

<p>
    SNARKs have the following properties (from whence they derive their name):
</p>
 
     Succinct: the sizes of the messages are small compared to the length of the actual proof. 
     Non-interactive: other than some setup, the prover sends only one message to the verifier.  
     ARguments: this is really an argument that something is correct, not a proof as we understand it mathematically. Specifically, the prover theoretically could prove false statements given enough computational power. So, SNARKs are "computationally sound" rather than "perfectly sound".  
     of Knowledge: the prover knows the fact in question.   
 

<p>
    You'll typically see "zk" (for zero-knowledge) tacked on the front to indicate that during this process, the verifier learns nothing other than the facts being proved.
</p>

<p>
    The mathematics underlying zkSNARKs involves homomorphic computation over high-degree polynomials. But we can understand how zkSNARKs work without knowing the underlying mathematics that ensures that they're sound. If you'd like more details of the mathematics, I recommend <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/12/05/zksnarks-in-a-nutshell/"> Christian Reitwiessner's "zkSNARKs in a Nutshell"</a>.
</p>

<p>
As a simple example, suppose Victor is given a <code>sha256</code> hash, <code>H</code>, of some value. Peggy wants to prove that she knows a value <code>s</code> such that <code>sha265(s) == H</code> without revealing <code>s</code> to Victor.  We can define a function <code>C</code> that captures the relationship:
</p>

 C(x, w) = ( sha256(w) == x )
 

<p>
    So, <code>C(H, s) == true</code>, while other values for <code>w</code> will return <code>false</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Computing a zkSNARK requires three functions <code>G</code>, <code>P</code>, and <code>V</code>. <code>G</code> is the key generator that takes a secret parameter called <code>lambda</code> and the function <code>C</code> and generates two public keys, the proving key <code>pk</code> and the verification key <code>vk</code>. They need only be generated once for a given function <code>C</code>. The parameter <code>lambda</code> must be destroyed after this step since it is not needed again and anyone who has it can generate fake proofs.
</p>

<p>
    The prover function <code>P</code> takes as input the proving key <code>pk</code>, a public input <code>x</code>, and a private (secret) witness <code>w</code>. The result of executing <code>P(pk,x,w)</code> is a proof, <code>prf</code>, that the prover knows a value for <code>w</code> that satisfies <code>C</code>.
</p>

<p>
    The verifier function <code>V</code> computes <code>V(vk, x, prf)</code> which is true if the proof <code>prf</code> is correct and false otherwise.
</p>

<p>
    Returning to Peggy and Victor, Victor chooses a function <code>C</code> representing what he wants Peggy to prove, creates a random number <code>lambda</code>, and runs <code>G</code> to generate the proving and verification keys:
</p>

 (pk, vk) = G(C, lambda)
 

<p>
    Peggy must not learn the value of <code>lambda</code>. Victor shares <code>C</code>, <code>pk</code>, and <code>vk</code> with Peggy.
</p>

<p>
    Peggy wants to prove she knows the value <code>s</code> that satisfies <code>C</code> for <code>x = H</code>. She runs the proving function <code>P</code> using these values as inputs:
</p>
 prf = P(pk, H, s)
 

<p>
    Peggy presents the proof <code>prf</code> to Victor who runs the verification function:
</p>
 V(vk, H, prf)
 

<p>
    If the result is true, then the Victor can be assured that Peggy knows the value <code>s</code>.
</p>

<p>
    The function <code>C</code> does not need to be limited to a hash as we did in this example. Within limits of the underlying mathematics, <code>C</code> can be quite complicated and involve any number of values that Victor would like Peggy to prove, all at one time.
</p>

<p>Setup the Azure B2C App Registration</p>



<p>An Azure App registration is setup for the ASP.NET Core Razor page application. A client secret is used to authenticate the client. The redirect URI is added for the app. This is a standard implementation. </p>







<p>Setup the API connector</p>



<p>The API connector is setup to add the extra claims after a sign in. This defines the API endpoint and the authentication method. Only Basic or certificate authentication is possible for this API service. Both of these are not ideal for implementing and using this service to add extra claims to the identity. I started <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok </a>using the cmd and used the URL from this to configure Azure B2C API connector. Maybe two separate connectors could be setup for a solution, one like this for development and a second one with the Azure App service host address and certificate authentication used.</p>







<p>Azure B2C user attribute</p>



<p>The custom claims are added to the Azure B2C user attributes. The custom claims can be add as required.</p>







<p>Setup to Azure B2C user flow</p>



<p>The Azure B2C user flow is configured to used the API connector. This flow adds the application claims to the token which it receives from the API call used in the API connector.</p>







<p>The custom claims are added then using the application claims blade. This is required if the custom claims are to be added.</p>







<p>I also added the custom claims  to the Azure B2C user flow user attributes.</p>







<p>Azure B2C is now setup to use the custom claims and the data for these claims will be set used the API connector service. </p>



<p>ASP.NET Core Razor Page </p>



<p>The ASP.NET Core Razor Page uses Microsoft.Identity.Web to authenticate using Azure B2C. This is a standard setup for a B2C user flow.</p>


  builder.Services.AddAuthentication(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(builder.Configuration.GetSection("AzureAdB2C"));

builder.Services.AddAuthorization(options =&gt;
{
    options.FallbackPolicy = options.DefaultPolicy;
});
builder.Services.AddRazorPages()
    .AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();

var app = builder.Build();

JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultInboundClaimTypeMap.Clear();
  


<p>The main difference between an Azure B2C user flow and an Azure AD authentication is the configuration. The SignUpSignInPolicyId is set to match the configured Azure B2C user flow and the Instance uses the b2clogin from the domain unlike the AAD configuration definition.</p>


  "AzureAdB2C": {
	"Instance": "https://b2cdamienbod.b2clogin.com",
	"ClientId": "ab393e93-e762-4108-a3f5-326cf8e3874b",
	"Domain": "b2cdamienbod.onmicrosoft.com",
	"SignUpSignInPolicyId": "B2C_1_ExtraClaims",
	"TenantId": "f611d805-cf72-446f-9a7f-68f2746e4724",
	"CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc",
	"SignedOutCallbackPath": "/signout-callback-oidc"
	//"ClientSecret": "--in-user-settings--"
},
  


<p>The index Razor page returns the claims and displays the values in the UI.</p>


  public class IndexModel : PageModel
{
	[BindProperty]
	public IEnumerable&lt;Claim&gt; Claims { get; set; } = Enumerable.Empty&lt;Claim&gt;();

	public void OnGet()
	{
		Claims = User.Claims;
	}
}
  


<p>This is all the end user application requires, there is no special setup here.</p>



<p>ASP.NET Core API connector implementation</p>



<p>The API implemented for the Azure API connector uses a HTTP Post. Basic authentication is used to validate the request as well as the client ID which needs to match the configured App registration. This is weak authentication and should not be used in production especially since the API provides sensitive PII data. If the request provides the correct credentials and the correct client ID,  the data is returned for the email. In this demo, the email is returned in the custom claim. Normal the data would be returned using some data store or whatever.</p>


  [HttpPost]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; PostAsync()
{
	// Check HTTP basic authorization
	if (!IsAuthorized(Request))
	{
		_logger.LogWarning("HTTP basic authentication validation failed.");
		return Unauthorized();
	}

	string content = await new System.IO.StreamReader(Request.Body).ReadToEndAsync();
	var requestConnector = JsonSerializer.Deserialize&lt;RequestConnector&gt;(content);

	// If input data is null, show block page
	if (requestConnector == null)
	{
		return BadRequest(new ResponseContent("ShowBlockPage", "There was a problem with your request."));
	}

	string clientId = _configuration["AzureAdB2C:ClientId"];
	if (!clientId.Equals(requestConnector.ClientId))
	{
		_logger.LogWarning("HTTP clientId is not authorized.");
		return Unauthorized();
	}

	// If email claim not found, show block page. Email is required and sent by default.
	if (requestConnector.Email == null || requestConnector.Email == "" || requestConnector.Email.Contains("@") == false)
	{
		return BadRequest(new ResponseContent("ShowBlockPage", "Email name is mandatory."));
	}

	var result = new ResponseContent
	{
		// use the objectId of the email to get the user specfic claims
		MyCustomClaim = $"everything awesome {requestConnector.Email}"
	};

	return Ok(result);
}

private bool IsAuthorized(HttpRequest req)
{
	string username = _configuration["BasicAuthUsername"];
	string password = _configuration["BasicAuthPassword"];

	// Check if the HTTP Authorization header exist
	if (!req.Headers.ContainsKey("Authorization"))
	{
		_logger.LogWarning("Missing HTTP basic authentication header.");
		return false;
	}

	// Read the authorization header
	var auth = req.Headers["Authorization"].ToString();

	// Ensure the type of the authorization header id `Basic`
	if (!auth.StartsWith("Basic "))
	{
		_logger.LogWarning("HTTP basic authentication header must start with 'Basic '.");
		return false;
	}

	// Get the the HTTP basinc authorization credentials
	var cred = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetString(Convert.FromBase64String(auth.Substring(6))).Split(':');

	// Evaluate the credentials and return the result
	return (cred[0] == username &amp;&amp; cred[1] == password);
}
  


<p>The ResponseContent class is used to return the data for the identity. All custom claims must be prefixed with the extension_ The data is then added to the profile data.</p>


  public class ResponseContent
{
	public const string ApiVersion = "1.0.0";

	public ResponseContent()
	{
		Version = ApiVersion;
		Action = "Continue";
	}

	public ResponseContent(string action, string userMessage)
	{
		Version = ApiVersion;
		Action = action;
		UserMessage = userMessage;
		if (action == "ValidationError")
		{
			Status = "400";
		}
	}

	[JsonPropertyName("version")]
	public string Version { get; }

	[JsonPropertyName("action")]
	public string Action { get; set; }

	[JsonPropertyName("userMessage")]
	public string? UserMessage { get; set; }

	[JsonPropertyName("status")]
	public string? Status { get; set; }

	[JsonPropertyName("extension_MyCustomClaim")]
	public string MyCustomClaim { get; set; } = string.Empty;
}
}
  


<p>With this, custom claims can be added to Azure B2C identities. This can be really useful when for example implementing verifiable credentials using id_tokens. This is much more complicated to implement compared to other IDPs but at least it is possible and can be solved. The technical solution to secure the API has room for improvements.</p>



<p>Testing</p>



<p>The applications can be started and the API connector needs to be mapped to a public IP. After starting the apps, start ngrok with a matching configuration for the HTTP address of the API connector API.</p>


  ngrok http https://localhost:5002
  


<p>This URL in the API connector configured on Azure needs to match this ngrok URL. all good, the applications will run and the custom claim will be displayed in the UI.</p>







<p>Notes</p>



<p>The profile data in this API is very sensitive and you should use maximal security protections which are possible. Using Basic authentication alone for this type of API is not a good idea. It would be great to see managed identities supported or something like this. I used basic authentication so that I could use ngrok to demo the feature, we need a public endpoint for testing. I would not use this in a productive deployment. I would use certificate authentication with an Azure App service deployment and the certificate created and deployed using Azure Key Vault. Certificate rotation would have to be setup. I am not sure how good API connector infrastructure automation can be implemented, I have not tried this yet. A separate security solution would need to be implemented for local development. This is all a bit messy as all these extra steps end up in costs or developers taking short cuts and deploying with less security. </p>

  <p>My main project this week was a 90 minute workshop I delivered about Git scraping at <a href="https://escoladedados.org/coda2021/">Coda.Br 2021</a>, a Brazilian data journalism conference, on Friday. This inspired the creation of a brand new tool, git-history, plus smaller improvements to a range of other projects.</p>
 git-history 
<p>I still need to do a detailed write-up of this one (update: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Nov/15/weeknotes-git-history/">git-history: a tool for analyzing scraped data collected using Git and SQLite</a>), but on Thursday I released a brand new tool called <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/git-history">git-history</a>, which I describe as "tools for analyzing Git history using SQLite".</p>
<p>This tool is the missing link in the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/">Git scraping pattern</a> I described here last October.</p>
<p>Git scraping is the technique of regularly scraping an online source of information and writing the results to a file in a Git repository... which automatically gives you a full revision history of changes made to that data source over time.</p>
<p>The missing piece has always been what to do next: how do you turn a commit history of changes to a JSON or CSV file into a data source that can be used to answer questions about how that file changed over time?</p>
<p>I've written one-off Python scripts for this a few times (here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/cdc-vaccination-history/blob/6f6bcb9437c0d44c4bcf94c111c631cc50bc2744/build_database.py">my CDC vaccinations one</a>, for example), but giving an interactive workshop about the technique finally inspired me to build a tool to help.</p>
<p>The tool has <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/git-history">a comprehensive README</a>, but the short version is that you can take a JSON (or CSV) file in a repository that has been tracking changes to some items over time and run the following to load all of the different versions into a SQLite database file for analysis with <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a>:</p>
 <code>git-convert file incidents.db incidents.json --id IncidentID
</code> 
<p>This assumes that <code>incidents.json</code> contains a JSON array of incidents (reported fires for example) and that each incident has a <code>IncidentID</code> identifier key. It will then loop through the Git history of that file right from the start, creating an <code>item_versions</code> table that tracks every change made to each of those items - using <code>IncidentID</code> to decide if a row represents a new incident or an update to a previous one.</p>
<p>I have a few more improvements I want to make before I start more widely promoting this, but it's already really useful. I've had a lot of fun running it against example repos from the <a href="https://github.com/topics/git-scraping">git-scraping GitHub topic</a> (now at 202 repos and counting).</p>
 Workshop: Raspando dados com o GitHub Actions e analisando com Datasette 
<p>The workshop I gave at the conference was live-translated into Portuguese, which is really exciting! I'm looking forward to watching the video when it comes out and seeing how well that worked.</p>
<p>The title translates to "Scraping data with GitHub Actions and analyzing with Datasette", and it was the first time I've given a workshop that combines Git scraping and Datasette - hence the development of the new git-history tool to help tie the two together.</p>
<p>I think it went really well. I put together four detailed exercises for the attendees, and then worked through each one live with the goal of attendees working through them at the same time - a method I learned from the Carpentries training course I took <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Sep/26/weeknotes-software-carpentry-sqlite/">last year</a>.</p>
<p>Four exercises turns out to be exactly right for 90 minutes, with reasonable time for an introduction and some extra material and questions at the end.</p>
<p>The worst part of running a workshop is inevitably the part where you try and get everyone setup with a functional development environment on their own machines (see <a href="https://xkcd.com/1987/">XKCD 1987</a>). This time round I skipped that entirely by encouraging my students to use <a href="https://gitpod.io/">GitPod</a>, which provides free browser-based cloud development environments running Linux, with a browser-embedded VS Code editor and terminal running on top.</p>

<p></p>

<p>(It's similar to <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">GitHub Codespaces</a>, but Codespaces is not yet available to free customers outside of the beta.)</p>
<p>I demonstrated all of the exercises using GitPod myself during the workshop, and ensured that they could be entirely completed through that environment, with no laptop software needed at all.</p>
<p>This worked so well. Not having to worry about development environments makes workshops massively more productive. I will absolutely be doing this again in the future.</p>
<p>The workshop exercises are available <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TCatZP5gQNfFjZJ5M77wMlf9u_05Z3BZnjp6t1SA6UU/edit">in this Google Doc</a>, and I hope to extract some of them out into official tutorials for various tools later on.</p>
 Datasette 0.58.2 
<p>Yesterday was Datasette's fourth birthday - the four year anniversary of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2017/Nov/13/datasette/">the initial release announcement</a>! I celebrated by releasing a minor bug-fix, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/releases/tag/0.59.2">Datasette 0.58.2</a>, the release notes for which are quoted below:</p>
 
 Column names with a leading underscore now work correctly when used as a facet. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1506">#1506</a>) 
 Applying <code>?_nocol=</code> to a column no longer removes that column from the filtering interface. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1503">#1503</a>) 
 Official Datasette Docker container now uses Debian Bullseye as the base image. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1497">#1497</a>) 
 
<p>That first change was inspired by ongoing work on <code>git-history</code>, where I decided to use a <code>_id</code> underscoper prefix pattern for columns that were reserved for use by that tool in order <a href="https://github.com/simonw/git-history/issues/14">to avoid clashing with column names</a> in the provided source data.</p>
 sqlite-utils 3.18 
<p>Today I released <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v3-18">sqlite-utils 3.18</a> - initially also to provide a feature I wanted for <code>git-history</code> (a way to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/339">populate additional columns</a> when creating a row using <code>table.lookup()</code>) but I also closed some bug reports and landed some small pull requests that had come in since 3.17.</p>
 s3-credentials 0.5 
<p>Earlier in the week I released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/releases/tag/0.5">version 0.5</a> of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials">s3-credentials</a> - my CLI tool for creating read-only, read-write or write-only AWS credentials for a specific S3 bucket.</p>
<p>The biggest new feature is the ability to create temporary credentials, that expire after a given time limit.</p>
<p>This is achived using <code>STS.assume_role()</code>, where STS is <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/welcome.html">Security Token Service</a>. I've been wanting to learn this API for quite a while now.</p>
<p>Assume role comes with some limitations: tokens must live between 15 minutes and 12 hours, and you need to first create a role that you can assume. In creating those credentials you can define an additional policy document, which is how I scope down the token I'm creating to only allow a specific level of access to a specific S3 bucket.</p>
<p>I've learned a huge amount about AWS, IAM and S3 through developming this project. I think I'm finally overcoming my multi-year phobia of anything involving IAM!</p>

<p>
    The other day Lynne called me up and asked a seemingly innocuous question: "How do I share this video?" Ten years ago, the answer would have been easy: copy the URL and send it to them. Now...not so much. In order to answer that question I first had to determine which app she was using. And, since I wasn't that familiar with it, open it and search through the user interface to find the share button. 
</p>

<p>
    One of the features of web browsers that we don't appreciate as much as we should is the consistent user experience that the browser provides. Tabs, address bars, the back button, reloading and other features are largely the same regardless of which browser you use. There's a reason why <a href="https://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/reback">don't break the back button!</a> was a common tip for web designers over the years. People depend on the web's consistent user experience. 
</p>

<p>
    Alas, apps have changed all that. Apps freed developers from the strictures of the web. No doubt there's been some excellent uses of this freedom, but what we've lost is consistency in core user experiences. That's unfortunate. 
</p>

<p>
    The web, and the internet for that matter, never had a consistent user experience for authentication. At least not one that caught on. Consequently, the user experience is very fragmented. Even so, Kim Cameron's <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=352">Seven Laws of Identity</a> speaks for consistent user experience in Law 7: Consistent Experience Across Contexts. Kim says:
</p>
<blockquote>The unifying identity metasystem must guarantee its users a simple, consistent experience while enabling separation of contexts through multiple operators and technologies.
</blockquote>

<p>
    Think about logging into various websites and apps throughout your day. You probably do it way too often. But it's also made much more complex because it's slightly different everywhere. Different locations and modalities, different rules for passwords, different methods for 2FA, and so on. It's maddening.
</p>

<p>
    There's a saying in security: "Don't roll your own crypto." I think we need a corollary in identity: "Don't roll your own interface." But how do we do that? And what should the interface be? One answer is to adopt the user experience people already understand from the physical world: connections and credentials.
</p>

<p>
    Kim Cameron gave us a model back in 2005 when he introduced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_card">Information Cards</a>. Information cards are digital analogs of the credentials we all carry around in the physical world. People understand credentials. Information cards worked on a protocol-mediated identity metasystem so that anyone could use them and write software for them. 
</p>

<p>
    Information cards didn't make it, but the ideas underlying information cards live on in modern self-sovereign identity (SSI) systems. The user experience in SSI springs from the protocol embodied in the <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2021.626726/full">identity metasystem</a>. In an SSI system, people use wallets that manage connections and credentials. They can create relationships with other people, organizations, and things. And they receive credentials from other participants and present those credentials to transfer information about themselves in a trustworthy manner. They don't see keys, passwords, authentication codes, and other artifacts of the ad hoc identity systems in widespread use today. Rather they use familiar artifacts to interact with others in ways that feel familiar because they are similar to how identity works in the physical world. 
</p>

<p>
    This idea feels simple and obvious, but I think that conceals its incredible power. Having a wallet I control where I manage digital relationships and credentials gives me a place to stand in the digital world and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">operationalize my digital life</a>. I think of it as digital embodiment. An SSI wallet gives me an interoperable way to connect and interact with others online as me. I can create both rich, long-lived relationships and service short-lived, ephemeral relationships with whatever degree of trustworthy data is appropriate for the relationship and its context. 
</p>


	<a></a>
	Relationships and Interactions in SSI (click to enlarge)


<p>
    We have plenty of online relationships today, but they are not operational because we are prevented from acting by their anemic natures. Our helplessness is the result of the power imbalance that is inherent in bureaucratic relationships. The solution to the anemic relationships created by administrative identity systems is to provide people with the tools they need to operationalize their self-sovereign authority and act as peers with others online. Consistent user experience is a key enabler of digital embodiment. When we dine at a restaurant or shop at a store in the physical world, we do not do so within some administrative system. Rather, as embodied agents, we operationalize our relationships, whether they be long-lived or nascent, by acting for ourselves. The SSI wallet is the platform upon which people can stand and become embodied online to operationalize their digital life as full-fledged participants in the digital realm.

<p>This article shows how scheduled tasks can be implemented in ASP.NET Core using <a href="https://www.quartz-scheduler.net/">Quartz.NET</a> and then displays the job info in an ASP.NET Core Razor page using SignalR. A concurrent job and a non concurrent job are implemented using a simple trigger to show the difference in how the jobs are run. Quartz.NET provides lots of scheduling features and has an easy to use API for implementing scheduled jobs.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreQuartz">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreQuartz</a></p>



<p>A simple ASP.NET Core Razor Page web application is used to implement the scheduler and the SignalR messaging. The Quartz Nuget package and the Quartz.Extensions.Hosting Nuget package are used to implement the scheduling service. The Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client package is used to send messages to all listening web socket clients. </p>


  &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
  &lt;TargetFramework&gt;net6.0&lt;/TargetFramework&gt;
  &lt;Nullable&gt;enable&lt;/Nullable&gt;
  &lt;ImplicitUsings&gt;enable&lt;/ImplicitUsings&gt;
 &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;

&lt;ItemGroup&gt;
  &lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client" Version="6.0.0" /&gt;
  &lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting" Version="6.0.0" /&gt;
  &lt;PackageReference Include="Quartz" Version="3.3.3" /&gt;
  &lt;PackageReference Include="Quartz.Extensions.Hosting" Version="3.3.3" /&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
  


<p>The .NET 6 templates no longer use a Startup class, all this logic can now be implemented directly in the Program.cs file with no static main. The ConfigureServices logic can be implemented using a WebApplicationBuilder instance. The AddQuartz method is used to add the scheduling services. Two jobs are added, a concurrent job and a non concurrent job. Both jobs are triggered with a simple trigger every five seconds which runs forever. The AddQuartzHostedService method adds the service as a hosted service. The AddSignalR adds the SignalR services.</p>


  using AspNetCoreQuartz;
using AspNetCoreQuartz.QuartzServices;
using Quartz;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddRazorPages();

builder.Services.AddSignalR();

builder.Services.AddQuartz(q =&gt;
{
    q.UseMicrosoftDependencyInjectionJobFactory();

    var conconcurrentJobKey = new JobKey("ConconcurrentJob");
    q.AddJob&lt;ConconcurrentJob&gt;(opts =&gt; opts.WithIdentity(conconcurrentJobKey));
    q.AddTrigger(opts =&gt; opts
        .ForJob(conconcurrentJobKey)
        .WithIdentity("ConconcurrentJob-trigger")
        .WithSimpleSchedule(x =&gt; x
            .WithIntervalInSeconds(5)
            .RepeatForever()));

    var nonConconcurrentJobKey = new JobKey("NonConconcurrentJob");
    q.AddJob&lt;NonConconcurrentJob&gt;(opts =&gt; opts.WithIdentity(nonConconcurrentJobKey));
    q.AddTrigger(opts =&gt; opts
        .ForJob(nonConconcurrentJobKey)
        .WithIdentity("NonConconcurrentJob-trigger")
        .WithSimpleSchedule(x =&gt; x
            .WithIntervalInSeconds(5)
            .RepeatForever()));

});

builder.Services.AddQuartzHostedService(
    q =&gt; q.WaitForJobsToComplete = true);
  


<p>The WebApplication instance is used to add the middleware like the Startup Configure method. The SignalR JobsHub endpoint is added to send the live messages of the running jobs to the UI in the client browser..</p>


  var app = builder.Build();

if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
    app.UseHsts();
}

app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseStaticFiles();

app.UseRouting();

app.UseAuthorization();

app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
{
    endpoints.MapHub&lt;JobsHub&gt;("/jobshub");
});

app.MapRazorPages();

app.Run();
  


<p>The ConconcurrentJob implements the IJob interface and logs messages before and after a time delay. A SignalR client is used to send all the job information to any listening clients. A seven second sleep was added to simulate a slow running job. The jobs are triggered every 5 seconds, so this should result in no change in behavior as the jobs can run in parallel.</p>


  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR;
using Quartz;

namespace AspNetCoreQuartz.QuartzServices
{
    public class ConconcurrentJob : IJob
    {
        private readonly ILogger&lt;ConconcurrentJob&gt; _logger;
        private static int _counter = 0;
        private readonly IHubContext&lt;JobsHub&gt; _hubContext;

        public ConconcurrentJob(ILogger&lt;ConconcurrentJob&gt; logger, 
            IHubContext&lt;JobsHub&gt; hubContext)
        {
            _logger = logger;
            _hubContext = hubContext;
        }

        public async Task Execute(IJobExecutionContext context)
        {
            var count = _counter++;

            var beginMessage = $"Conconcurrent Job BEGIN {count} {DateTime.UtcNow}";
            await _hubContext.Clients.All.SendAsync("ConcurrentJobs", beginMessage);
            _logger.LogInformation(beginMessage);

            Thread.Sleep(7000);

            var endMessage = $"Conconcurrent Job END {count} {DateTime.UtcNow}";
            await _hubContext.Clients.All.SendAsync("ConcurrentJobs", endMessage);
            _logger.LogInformation(endMessage);
        }
    }
}
  


<p>The NonConconcurrentJob class is almost like the previous job, except the DisallowConcurrentExecution attribute is used to prevent concurrent running of the job. This means that even though the trigger is set to five seconds, each job must wait until the previous job finishes.</p>


  [DisallowConcurrentExecution]
public class NonConconcurrentJob : IJob
{
	private readonly ILogger&lt;NonConconcurrentJob&gt; _logger;
	private static int _counter = 0;
	private readonly IHubContext&lt;JobsHub&gt; _hubContext;

	public NonConconcurrentJob(ILogger&lt;NonConconcurrentJob&gt; logger,
		   IHubContext&lt;JobsHub&gt; hubContext)
	{
		_logger = logger;
		_hubContext = hubContext;
	}

	public async Task Execute(IJobExecutionContext context)
	{
		var count = _counter++;

		var beginMessage = $"NonConconcurrentJob Job BEGIN {count} {DateTime.UtcNow}";
		await _hubContext.Clients.All.SendAsync("NonConcurrentJobs", beginMessage);
		_logger.LogInformation(beginMessage);

		Thread.Sleep(7000);

		var endMessage = $"NonConconcurrentJob Job END {count} {DateTime.UtcNow}";
		await _hubContext.Clients.All.SendAsync("NonConcurrentJobs", endMessage);
		_logger.LogInformation(endMessage);
	}
}
  


<p>The JobsHub class implements the SignalR Hub and define methods for sending SignalR messages. Two messages are used, one for the concurrent job messages and one for the non concurrent job messages.</p>


  public class JobsHub : Hub
{
	public Task SendConcurrentJobsMessage(string message)
	{
		return Clients.All.SendAsync("ConcurrentJobs",  message);
	}

	public Task SendNonConcurrentJobsMessage(string message)
	{
		return Clients.All.SendAsync("NonConcurrentJobs", message);
	}

}
  


<p>The microsoft signalr Javascript package is used to implement the client which listens for messages.</p>


  {
  "version": "1.0",
  "defaultProvider": "cdnjs",
  "libraries": [
    {
      "library": "microsoft-signalr@5.0.11",
      "destination": "wwwroot/lib/microsoft-signalr/"
    }
  ]
}
  


<p>The Index Razor Page view uses the SignalR Javascript file and displays messages by adding html elements.</p>


  @page
@model IndexModel
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Home page";
}

&lt;div class="container"&gt;
    &lt;div class="row"&gt;
        &lt;div class="col-6"&gt;
            &lt;ul id="concurrentJobs"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
         &lt;div class="col-6"&gt;
            &lt;ul id="nonConcurrentJobs"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script src="~/lib/microsoft-signalr/signalr.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

  


<p>The SignalR client adds the two methods to listen to messages sent from the Quartz jobs.</p>


  const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
    .withUrl("/jobshub")
    .configureLogging(signalR.LogLevel.Information)
    .build();

async function start() {
    try {
        await connection.start();
        console.log("SignalR Connected.");
    } catch (err) {
        console.log(err);
        setTimeout(start, 5000);
    }
};

connection.onclose(async () =&gt; {
    await start();
});

start();

connection.on("ConcurrentJobs", function (message) {
    var li = document.createElement("li");
    document.getElementById("concurrentJobs").appendChild(li);
    li.textContent = `${message}`;
});

connection.on("NonConcurrentJobs", function (message) {
    var li = document.createElement("li");
    document.getElementById("nonConcurrentJobs").appendChild(li);
    li.textContent = `${message}`;
});


  


<p>When the application is run and the hosted Quartz service runs the scheduled jobs, the concurrent jobs starts every five seconds as required and the non concurrent job runs every seven seconds due to the thread sleep.  Running concurrent or non concurrent jobs by using a single attribute definition is a really powerful feature of Quartz.NET.</p>







<p>Quartz.NET provides great documentation and has a really simple API. By using SignalR, it would be really easy to implement a good monitoring UI.</p>

   A half-hour to learn Rust 
 I haven't tried to write any Rust yet but I occasionally find myself wanting to read it, and I find some of the syntax really difficult to get my head around. This article helped a lot: it provides a quick but thorough introduction to most of Rust's syntax, with clearly explained snippet examples for each one.

  <p>My big project this week was <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Nov/3/s3-credentials/">s3-credentials, described yesterday</a> - but I also put together a fun expermiental Datasette plugin bundling JupyterLite and wrote up my PyGotham talk on Python packaging.</p>
 datasette-jupyterlite 
<p><a href="https://github.com/jupyterlite/jupyterlite">JupyterLite</a> is absolutely incredible: it's a full, working distribution of Jupyter that runs entirely in a browser, thanks to a Python interpreter (and various other parts of the scientific Python stack) that has been compiled to WebAssembly by the <a href="https://pyodide.org//">Pyodide</a> project.</p>
<p>Since it's just static JavaScript (and WASM modules) it's possible to host it anywhere that can run a web server.</p>
<p>Datasette runs a web server...</p>
<p>So, I built <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-jupyterlite">datasette-jupyterlite</a> - a Datasette plugin that bundles JupyterLite and serves it up as part of the Datasette instance.</p>
<p>You can try <a href="https://latest-with-plugins.datasette.io/jupyterlite/">a live demo here</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here's some Python code that will retrieve data from the associated Datasette instance and pull it into a Pandas DataFrame:</p>
 import pandas, pyodide
pandas.read_csv(pyodide.open_url(
  "https://latest-with-plugins.datasette.io/github/stars.csv")
) 
<p>(I haven't yet found a way to do this with a relative rather than absolute URL.)</p>
<p>The best part of this is that it works in <a href="https://datasette.io/desktop">Datasette Desktop</a>! You can install the plugin using the "Install and manage plugins" menu item to get a version of Jupyter running in Python running in WebAssembly running in V8 running in Chromium running in Electron.</p>
<p>The plugin implementation is <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-jupyterlite/blob/0.1a0/datasette_jupyterlite/__init__.py">just 30 lines of code</a> - it uses the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlite/">jupyterlite</a> Python package which bundles a <code>.tgz</code> file containing all of the required static assets, then serves files directly out of that tarfile.</p>
 Also this week 
<p>My other projects from this week are already written about on the blog:</p>
 
 
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Nov/3/s3-credentials/">s3-credentials: a tool for creating credentials for S3 buckets</a> introduces a new CLI tool I built that automates the process of creating new, long-lived credentials that provide read-only, read-write or write-only access to just a single specified S3 bucket. 
 
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Nov/4/publish-open-source-python-library/">How to build, test and publish an open source Python library</a> is a detailed write-up of the 10 minute workshop I presented at PyGotham this year showing how to create a Python library, bundle it up as a package using <code>setup.py</code>, publish it to <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a> and then set up GitHub Actions to test and publish future releases.

  <p>At <a href="https://2021.pygotham.tv/talks/how-to-build-test-and-publish-an-open-source-python-library/">PyGotham</a> this year I presented a ten minute workshop on how to package up a new open source Python library and publish it to <a href="https://pypi.org/">the Python Package Index</a>. Here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMnLXynUqys">the video</a> and accompanying notes, which should make sense even without watching the talk.</p>
 The video 

<p>PyGotham arrange for sign language interpretation for all of their talks, which is really cool. Since those take up a portion of the screen (and YouTube don't yet have a way to apply them as a different layer) I've also made available a copy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SPqMR08VWU">the original video</a> without the sign language.</p>
 Packaging a single module 
<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/CAVaccineInventory/vial/blob/5c5f7eb344d28afb91e947243a6f96b337ea0ce2/vaccinate/core/baseconverter.py">this code</a> which I've been copying and pasting between my own projects for over a decade.</p>
<p><code>BaseConverter</code> is a simple class that can convert an integer to a shortened character string and back again, for example:</p>
  &gt;&gt;&gt; pid = BaseConverter("bcdfghkmpqrtwxyz")
&gt;&gt;&gt; pid.from_int(1234)
"gxd"
&gt;&gt;&gt; pid.to_int("gxd")
1234  
<p>To turn this into a library, first I created a <code>pids/</code> directory (I've chosen that name because it's available on PyPI).</p>
<p>To turn that code into a package:</p>
 
 
<p><code>mkdir pids &amp;&amp; cd pids</code></p>
 
 
<p>Create <code>pids.py</code> in that directory with the contents of <a href="https://github.com/CAVaccineInventory/vial/blob/main/vaccinate/core/baseconverter.py">this file</a></p>
 
 
<p>Create a new <code>setup.py</code> file in that folder containing the following:</p>
 from setuptools import setup

setup(
    name="pids",
    version="0.1",
    description="A tiny Python library for generating public IDs from integers",
    author="Simon Willison",
    url="https://github.com/simonw/...",
    license="Apache License, Version 2.0",    
    py_modules=["pids"],
) 
 
 
<p>Run <code>python3 setup.py sdist</code> to create the packaged source distribution, <code>dist/pids-0.1.tar.gz</code></p>
<p>(I've since learned that it's better to run <code>python3 -m build</code> here instead, see <a href="https://blog.ganssle.io/articles/2021/10/setup-py-deprecated.html"> Why you shouldn't invoke setup.py directly</a>).</p>
 
 
<p>This is all it takes: a <code>setup.py</code> file with some metadata, then a single command to turn that into a packaged <code>.tar.gz</code> file.</p>
 Testing it in a Jupyter notebook 
<p>Having created that file, I demonstrated how it can be tested in a Jupyter notebook.</p>
<p>Jupyter has a <code>%pip</code> magic command which runs <code>pip</code> to install a package into the same environment as the current Jupyter kernel:</p>
 <code>%pip install /Users/simon/Dropbox/Presentations/2021/pygotham/pids/dist/pids-0.1.tar.gz
</code> 
<p>Having done this, I could excute the library like so:</p>
 <code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import pids
&gt;&gt;&gt; pids.pid.from_int(1234)
'gxd'
</code> 
 Uploading the package to PyPI 
<p>I used <a href="https://pypi.org/project/twine/">twine</a> (<code>pip install twine</code>) to upload my new package to <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a>.</p>
<p>You need to create a PyPI account before running this command.</p>
<p>By default you need to paste in the PyPI account's username and password:</p>
 <code>% twine upload dist/pids-0.1.tar.gz
Uploading distributions to https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
Enter your username: simonw
Enter your password: 
Uploading pids-0.1.tar.gz
100%|██████████████████████████████████████| 4.16k/4.16k [00:00&lt;00:00, 4.56kB/s]

View at:
https://pypi.org/project/pids/0.1/
</code> 
<p>The release is now live at <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pids/0.1/">https://pypi.org/project/pids/0.1/</a> - and anyone can run <code>pip install pids</code> to install it.</p>
 Adding documentation 
<p>If you visit the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pids/0.1/">0.1 release page</a> you'll see the following message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The author of this package has not provided a project description</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To fix this I added a <code>README.md</code> file with some basic documentation, written in Markdown:</p>
  # pids

Create short public identifiers based on integer IDs.

## Installation

    pip install pids

## Usage

    from pids import pid
    public_id = pid.from_int(1234)
    # public_id is now "gxd"
    id = pid.to_int("gxd")
    # id is now 1234  
<p>Then I modified my <code>setup.py</code> file to look like this:</p>
 from setuptools import setup
import os

def get_long_description():
    with open(
        os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "README.md"),
        encoding="utf8",
    ) as fp:
        return fp.read()

setup(
    name="pids",
    version="0.1.1",
    long_description=get_long_description(),
    long_description_content_type="text/markdown",
    description="A tiny Python library for generating public IDs from integers",
    author="Simon Willison",
    url="https://github.com/simonw/...",
    license="Apache License, Version 2.0",    
    py_modules=["pids"],
) 
<p>The <code>get_long_description()</code> function reads that <code>README.md</code> file into a Python string.</p>
<p>The following two extra arguments to <code>setup()</code> add that as metadata visible to PyPI:</p>
 long_description=get_long_description(),
long_description_content_type="text/markdown", 
<p>I also updated the version number to <code>0.1.1</code> in preparation for a new release.</p>
<p>Running <code>python3 setup.py sdist</code> created a new file called <code>dist/pids-0.1.1.tar.gz</code> - I then uploaded that file using <code>twine upload dist/pids-0.1.1.tar.gz</code> which created a new release with a visible README at <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pids/0.1.1/">https://pypi.org/project/pids/0.1.1/</a></p>
 Adding some tests 
<p>I like using <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/">pytest</a> for tests, so I added that as a test dependency by modifying <code>setup.py</code> to add the following line:</p>
     extras_require={"test": ["pytest"]}, 
<p>Next, I created a virtual environment and installed my package and its test dependencies into an "editable" mode like so:</p>
 <code># Create and activate environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
# Install editable module, plus pytest
pip install -e '.[test]'
</code> 
<p>Now I can run the tests!</p>
 <code>(venv) pids % pytest
============================= test session starts ==============================

============================ no tests ran in 0.01s =============================
</code> 
<p>There aren't any tests yet. I created a <code>tests/</code> folder and dropped in a <code>test_pids.py</code> file that looked like this:</p>
 import pytest
import pids

def test_from_int():
    assert pids.pid.from_int(1234) == "gxd"

def test_to_int():
    assert pids.pid.to_int("gxd") == 1234 
<p>Running <code>pytest</code> in the project directory now runs those tests:</p>
 <code>(venv) pids % pytest

</code> 
 Creating a GitHub repository 
<p>Time to publish the source code on GitHub.</p>
<p>I created a repository using the form at <a href="https://github.com/new">https://github.com/new</a></p>
<p>Having created the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/pids">simonw/pids</a> repository, I ran the following commands locally to push my code to it (mostly copy and pasted from the GitHub example):</p>
 <code>git init
git add README.md pids.py setup.py tests/test_pids.py
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:simonw/pids.git
git push -u origin main
</code> 
 Running the tests with GitHub Actions 
<p>I copied in a <code>.github/workflows</code> folder from <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-explain/tree/main/.github/workflows">another project</a> with two files, <code>test.yml</code> and <code>publish.yml</code>. The <code>.github/workflows/test.yml</code> file contained this:</p>
  name: Test

on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9]
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - uses: actions/cache@v2
      name: Configure pip caching
      with:
        path: ~/.cache/pip
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/setup.py') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-pip-
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install -e '.[test]'
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        pytest  
<p>The <code>matrix</code> block there causes the job to run four times, on four different versions of Python.</p>
<p>The action steps do the following:</p>
 
 Checkout the current repository 
 Install the specified Python version 
 Configure GitHub's action caching mechanism for the <code>~/.cache/pip</code> directory - this avoids installing the same files from PyPI over the internet the next time the workflow runs 
 Install the test dependencies 
 Run the tests 
 
<p>I added and pushed these new files:</p>
 <code>git add .github
git commit -m "GitHub Actions"
git push
</code> 
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/simonw/pids/actions">Actions tab</a> in my repository instantly ran the test suite, and when it passed added a green checkmark to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/pids/commit/93029ab191c00ab8274a1b88548d279b45411c3a">my commit</a>.</p>
 Publishing a new release using GitHub 
<p>The <code>.github/workflows/publish.yml</code> workflow is triggered by new GitHub releases. It tests them and then, if the tests pass, publishes them up to PyPI using <code>twine</code>.</p>
<p>The workflow looks like this:</p>
  name: Publish Python Package

on:
  release:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:

<p>It contains two jobs: the <code>test</code> job the tests again - we should never publish a package without first ensuring that the test suite passes - and then the <code>deploy</code> job runs <code>python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel</code> followed by <code>twine upload dist/*</code> to upload the resulting packages.</p>

<p>Before publishing a package with this action, I needed to create a <code>PYPI_TOKEN</code> that the action could use to authenticate with my PyPI account.</p>
<p>I used the <a href="https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/">https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/</a> page to create that token:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I copied out the newly created token:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I used the "Settings -&gt; Secrets" tab on the GitHub repository to add that as a secret called <code>PYPI_TOKEN</code>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>(I have since revoked the token that I used in the video, since it is visible on screen to anyone watching.)</p>
<p>I used the GitHub web interface to edit <code>setup.py</code> to bump the version number in that file up to <code>0.1.2</code>, then I navigated to the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/pids/releases">releases tab</a> in the repository, clicked "Draft new release" and created a release that would create a new <code>0.1.2</code> tag as part of the release process.</p>
<p>When I published the release, the <code>publish.yml</code> action started to run. After the tests had passed it pushed the new release to PyPI: <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pids/0.1.2/">https://pypi.org/project/pids/0.1.2/</a></p>
 Bonus: cookiecutter templates 
<p>I've published a lot of packages using this process - <a href="https://pypi.org/user/simonw/">143 and counting</a>!</p>
<p>Rather than copy and paste in a <code>setup.py</code> each time, a couple of years ago I switched over to using <a href="https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter">cookiecutter</a> templates.</p>
<p>I have three templates that I use today:</p>
 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/python-lib">python-lib</a> for standalone Python libraries 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin">datasette-plugin</a> for <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> plugins 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/click-app">click-app</a> for CLI applications built using the <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/">Click</a> package 
 
<p>Back in August I figured out a way to make these available as GitHub repository templates, which I described in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Aug/28/dynamic-github-repository-templates/">Dynamic content for GitHub repository templates using cookiecutter and GitHub Actions</a>. This means you can create a new GitHub repository that implements the <code>test.yml</code> and <code>publish.yml</code> pattern described in this talk with just a few clicks on the GitHub website.</p>

<p>I just read a <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/on-the-horizon-ftcs-slaughter-maps-data-regulations-potential-future">wonderful piece</a> from Joseph Duball,<a>1</a> who reported on the U.S. Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter’s keynote at the IAPP’s “Privacy. Security. Risk 2021” event. According to Duball, Slaughter suggests that we need to change “the way people view, prioritize, and conceptualize their data.”</p>
<p>“Too many services are about leveraging consumer data instead of straightforwardly providing value. For even the savviest users, the price of browsing the internet is being tracked across the web.” – Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, Commissioner, U.S. Federal Trade Commission 2021<a>2</a></p>
<p>According to Slaughter, privacy issues within data-driven markets stem from surveillance capitalism, which is fueled by indiscriminate data collection practices. She suggests that the remedy to curtail these practices is to focus on “purpose and use” restrictions and limitations rather than solely relying on the notice &amp; choice framework. In other words, in the future industry may no longer justify data practice with explanations like “they opted in” and “we got consent” or falling ba</p>
<p>“Collection and use limitations can help protect people’s rights. It should not be necessary to trade one’s data away as a cost of full participation in society and the modern information economy.” – Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, Commissioner, U.S. Federal Trade Commission 2021<a>3</a></p>
 FTC Has Concerns Other Than Privacy 
<p>So that there is no uncertainty or doubt, however, Duball<a>4</a> reports that, while consumer privacy is a chief concern for the commission, it is not the primary concern to the exclusion of other concerns. The commission is also worried about algorithmic bias and “dark patterns” practices. In other words, it is not just about the data, it is about the methods used to “trick” people into giving it up and how it is processed and applied to business decision-making.</p>
 Takeaway 
<p>My takeaway is that it is time for organizations to take a serious look at revamping their end-to-end processes and tech-stacks. This is a c-suite leadership all-hands-on-deck moment. It will take years for the larger organizations to turn their flotilla in the right direction, and for the industry at large to sort everything out. However, rest asserted, the empowered person–the self-sovereign individual–is nigh and will sort it out for industry soon enough.</p>
<p>There is time, but not much, maybe three, five, or seven years, before the people will be equipped with the knowledge and tools to take back control of their data. It is already happening; just look at open banking in the UK. These new tools, aka personal information management systems, will enable people to granularly exchange data on their terms with their stated purpose of use, not the businesses. They will give them the power to process data in a way that protects them from bias or at least helps them know when it is happening.</p>
<p>Why should businesses care about all this? Well, I predict, as do many so I’m not too far out on a limb here, that in the not-too-distant future, the empowered, connected individual will walk with their wallet and only do business with those institutions that respect their sovereignty, both physically and digitally. So, to all out there, it is time, and it is time to prepare for the future.</p>

<p>No civilisation can exist or prosper without the rule of law. The rule of law cannot exist without a proper justice system. In India, criminals have a free reign as justice system is used as a tool to make victims succumb into unfair settlements or withdrawals. Unfortunately, the Indian justice system has gone caput and remains clogged with over 4+ crore cases pending in courts due to following core&nbsp;reasons.</p> Policy gap 1 — Only in India there is zero deterrence to&nbsp;perjury <p>a. In India, perjury law is taken very lightly. 99% of cases are full of lies, deceit and mockery of justice. Affidavits in India do not serve much purpose. There have been various judgments and cries from all levels of judiciary but in&nbsp;vain.</p><p>b. Perjury makes any case 10x more complex and consumes 20x more time to adjudicate. It is akin to allowing a bullock cart in the middle of express highway. It is nothing but an attack on justice delivery system. Historically, perjury used to be punished with death sentence and considered an equally serious crime as&nbsp;murder.</p><p>c. This is against the best international practices and does not make economic sense for&nbsp;India.</p> Policy gap 2 — India has no equivalent laws such as the U.S. Federal Rule 11 enacted in 1983 (as amendment in 1993) to curb the explosion of frivolous litigation. <p>The entire provision of rule 11 of U.S. federal rules can be summarized in the following manner:</p><p>It requires that a district court mandatorily sanction attorneys or parties who submit improper pleadings like pleadings with</p>  Improper purpose  Containing frivolous arguments  Facts or arguments that have no evidentiary support  Omissions and errors, misleading and crafty&nbsp;language  Baseless or unreasonable denials with non-application of&nbsp;mind  Negligence, failure to appear or unreasonable adjournments  <p>All developed countries like UK and Australia also have similar laws to combat frivolous litigation.</p> Police gap 3 — Only in India the lawyers are barred from contingent fee agreements under Bar council&nbsp;rules   Indian lawyers are incentivized to make cases go longer, add complexity and never end. Consequently, they super specialize and become innovators in creating alibis so that the case never&nbsp;ends.  Lawyers in India do not investigate or legally vet the case before&nbsp;filing.  There is no incentive to apply for torts claims or prosecute perjury and therefore there is no deterrence created.  Lawyers are supposed to be gate keepers to prevent frivolous litigation but in India it is actually opposite due to the perverse policy on contingent fee and&nbsp;torts.  <p>Economic modelling suggests that — contingent fee arrangements reduce frivolous suits when compared to hourly fee arrangements. The reasoning is simple: When an attorney’s compensation is based solely on success, as opposed to hours billed, there is great incentive to accept and prosecute only meritorious cases.</p><p>At least one empirical analysis concludes that — “hourly fees encourage the filing of low-quality suits and increase the time to settlement (i.e., contingency fees increase legal quality and decrease the time to settlement).”</p> Negative impact of the 3 policy&nbsp;gaps <p>1. Conviction rates in India are abysmally low below 10% whereas internationally between 60% — 100%.<a>[1]</a></p><blockquote>a. Japan — 99.97%</blockquote><blockquote>b. China — 98%</blockquote><blockquote>c. Russia — 90%</blockquote><blockquote>d. UK — 80%</blockquote><blockquote>e. US — between 65% and&nbsp;80%</blockquote><p>2. Globally the 80%-99% cases get settled before trial but India its actually opposite&nbsp;because</p>  There is absolutely no fear of law and perjury is a&nbsp;norm.  Lawyers have no interest in driving a settlement due to per appearance fee&nbsp;system.  There is an artificial limit of fee shifting (awarding costs), torts and there is no motivation of the part of judges to create deterrence.  <p>3. The contingent fee and tort cannot be enabled till such time the fraternity of lawyers can be relied upon for ethical and moral&nbsp;conduct.</p><p>— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —&nbsp;—</p><blockquote>Easy solution to complex&nbsp;problem</blockquote><p>— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —&nbsp;—</p> Policy 1 — Restricting perjury and making it a non-bailable offence will resolve 50% cases immediately <br>(i.e. 1.5 crore cases within 3&nbsp;months) <p>India must truly embrace “Satyam ev jayate” and make perjury a non-bailable offence. All lawyers and litigants should be given 3 month’s notice to refile their pleadings or settle the cases. They would have to face the mandatory consequences of false evidence or averments later found to be&nbsp;untrue.</p><p>There needs to be a basic expectation reset in Indian courts litigation — the filings are correct, and the lawyer is responsible for prima facie diligence and candor before courts. The role of judiciary is not to distinguish between truth and false but to determine the sequence of events, fix accountability and award penalties. Presenting false evidence or frivolous arguments must be seen as separate offence on its&nbsp;own.</p><blockquote>At a minimum IPC 195(1)(b)(i) must be removed that states the following –</blockquote><blockquote>“No Court shall take cognizance- of any offence punishable under any of the following sections of the IPC (45 of 1860), namely, sections 193 to 196 (both inclusive), 199, 200, 205 to 211 (both inclusive) and 228, when such offence is alleged to have been committed in, or in relation to, any proceeding in any&nbsp;Court”</blockquote><p>Because:</p>  This necessarily makes the judges party to the complaint and therefore all judges are reluctant to prosecute perjury.  This estoppel opens up possibility of corruption in judiciary and public&nbsp;offices.  The intention of this provision has clearly backfired. This restriction is unique to india and against the international norms   Policy 2 — Sanctions on lawyers to streamline the perverse incentives that plague Indian justice&nbsp;system <p>The courts in USA are mandated to compulsorily sanction lawyers for various professional misconduct in litigation (Federal rule 11 of civil procedure) like:</p><p>Remedies and sanctions for lawyer’s misconduct can be categorized into three&nbsp;groups.</p>  Sanctions and remedies for attorney misconduct which are available to public authorities. Such sanctions include professional discipline, criminal liability of lawyers who assist their clients in committing criminal acts, and judicially imposed sanctions such as for contempt of court. Professional discipline is generally the best known sanction for attorney misconduct.  Sanctions which are available to lawyers’ clients. For example, damages for attorney malpractice, forfeiture of an attorney’s fee, and judicial nullification of gifts or business transactions that breach a lawyer’s fiduciary duty to a&nbsp;client.  Remedies that may be available to third parties injured by a lawyer’s conduct on behalf of a client. These include injunctions against representing a client in violation of the lawyer’s duty to a third party, damages for breach of an obligation the attorney assumes to a non-client, and judicial nullification of settlements or jury verdicts obtained by attorney misconduct.   Policy 3 — Contingent Fee and Tort Law making judiciary 3x efficient. <blockquote>(needs perjury law as discussed above to&nbsp;unlock)</blockquote><p>In India Lawyers spend more time in making the case complex and lengthy based on “dehari system” while the western counterparts earn far more money by genuinely solving cases and creating real values for the country. The market economics based on judicial policy on regulating legal profession and ethics in India is however geared towards permanently clogging the system. 3 of the 4 stakeholders benefit by making the litigation never&nbsp;end.</p><p>There is a dire need for the system to be re-incentivized wherein the legal profession can generate 10x more value for the country in catching and penalizing law abusers. This in turn will also attract and create more talented lawyers because then they will be investing more time in investigating and preparing the cases to&nbsp;win.</p><p>Making perjury a non-bailable offence and rules for mandatorily sanctioning lawyer mis-conduct will unlock the contingent fee and tort law in&nbsp;India.</p><p>Allowing contingent fee for lawyers have four principal policy justifications</p><p>Firstly, such arrangements</p>  enable the impecunious (having no money) to obtain representation. Such persons cannot afford the costs of litigation unless and until it is successful. Even members of the middle- and upper-socioeconomic classes may find it difficult to pay legal fees in advance of success and collection of judgment.  This is particularly so today as litigation has become more complex, often involving suits against multiple parties or multinational entities, and concerning matters requiring expert scientific and economic evidence.  <p>Secondly,</p>  Contingent fee arrangements can help align the interests of lawyer and client, as both will have a direct financial stake in the outcome of the litigation.  <p>Third</p>  By predicating an attorney’s compensation on the success of a suit, the attorney is given incentive to function as gatekeeper, screening cases for both merit and sufficiency of proof, and lodging only those likely to&nbsp;succeed.  This provides as an important and genuine signal for litigants to understand the merit of their&nbsp;case.  <p>Fourth</p>  And more generally, all persons of sound mind should be permitted to contract freely, and restrictions on contingent fee arrangements inhibit this&nbsp;freedom.  <p>Three other reasons to justify unlocking of contingent fee:-</p>  Clients, particularly unsophisticated ones, may be unable to determine when an attorney has underperformed or acted irresponsibly;15 in these instances, an attorney’s reputation would be unaffected, and thus the risk of reputational harm would not adequately protect against malfeasance.  Even when clients are aware of an attorney’s poor performance or irresponsibility, they may lack the means, media, or credibility to effectively harm the attorney’s reputation.  The interests of attorney and client are more closely aligned, ceteris paribus, when fee arrangements are structured so as to minimize perverse incentives.   Why contingent fees reduce caseload: <p>Lesser cases better&nbsp;filing</p><p>Complainants get genuine advice about chances of winning. They do not file unless they get lawyer’s&nbsp;buy-in.</p>  Lawyers screen cases for merit and sufficiency of proof before&nbsp;filing.  Lawyers don’t pick up bad cases to manage reputation.  Comprehensive evidence gathering happens before Lawyer decides to file a&nbsp;case.  <p>Lawyers simplify case and only allege charges that can be sustained.</p>  Use simple and concise arguments for the&nbsp;judges.  Lawyers spend more time working hard outside the courts. Thus increasing case&nbsp;quality.  <p>Faster case proceedings</p>  Less adjournments and&nbsp;hearings  They do better preparation and take less adjournments.  Multiple steps get completed in single hearings.  They create urgency for clients to show up at every&nbsp;hearing.  Lawyers do not unnecessarily appeal and stay matters because they do not get paid per hearing and want quick&nbsp;results.  <p>Case withdrawals</p>  There are less takers if a lawyer drops a case when there are surprises by client which will adversely impact the&nbsp;outcome.  Lawyers persuade complainants to settle when appropriate.   Conclusions <p>With 3+ crore cases pending and a dysfunctional justice delivery there is a mass exodus of Ultra High Net worth Individuals (UHNIs) from India. There is an absolute urgent need for above reforms before the situation turns into a complete banana republic.</p><p>It is an absolute embarrassment and national shame to allow Indians to be blatant liars even in courts. Business and survival in India today is a race to the bottom just because there is no bar on falsehood and having corrupt values, it is near impossible to survive without being part of the same&nbsp;culture.</p><p>It is prayed that even more stricter laws be enacted than just global norms such that Indians can be trusted globally to never lie. It’s not just about Indian courts but they could be counted as the most truthful race even in foreign lands and command high respect globally.</p> Restoring justice&nbsp;delivery  Economic benefits of reform in perjury, contingent fee and legal&nbsp;ethics <p>1. Higher quality of litigation work.</p><p>2. Attract better talent to the profession due to higher profitability.</p><p>3. Create more jobs in the&nbsp;economy.</p><p>4. Offer higher pool of qualified people for judiciary.</p><p>5. Drastic reduction in corrupt or criminal activity due to fear of&nbsp;law.</p><p>6. Unlocking of trillions of dollars of wealth/resources stuck in litigation.</p><p>7. Better investment climate due to more reliability in business transactions.</p><p>8. Higher reliability in products and services.</p><p>9. Access to justice for&nbsp;all.</p><p>10.

   I've built a command-line tool called s3-credentials to solve a problem that's been frustrating me for ages: how to quickly and easily create AWS credentials (an access key and secret key) that have permission to read or write from just a single S3 bucket. 
 The TLDR version 
 To create a new S3 bucket and generate credentials for reading and writing to it: 
 % pip install s3-credentials

  <p>I've built a command-line tool called <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials">s3-credentials</a> to solve a problem that's been frustrating me for ages: how to quickly and easily create AWS credentials (an access key and secret key) that have permission to read or write from just a single S3 bucket.</p>
 The TLDR version 
<p>To create a new S3 bucket and generate credentials for reading and writing to it:</p>
 <code>% pip install s3-credentials
% s3-credentials create demo-bucket-for-simonwillison-blog-post --create-bucket
Created bucket: demo-bucket-for-simonwillison-blog-post
Created  user: 's3.read-write.demo-bucket-for-simonwillison-blog-post' with permissions boundary: 'arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess'
Attached policy s3.read-write.demo-bucket-for-simonwillison-blog-post to user s3.read-write.demo-bucket-for-simonwillison-blog-post
Created access key for user: s3.read-write.demo-bucket-for-simonwillison-blog-post
{
    "UserName": "s3.read-write.demo-bucket-for-simonwillison-blog-post",
    "AccessKeyId": "AKIAWXFXAIOZHY6WAJSF",
    "Status": "Active",
    "SecretAccessKey": "...",
    "CreateDate": "2021-12-06 23:54:08+00:00"
}
</code> 
<p>You can now use the that <code>AccessKeyId</code> and <code>SecretAccessKey</code> to read and write files in that bucket.</p>
 The need for bucket credentials for S3 
<p>I'm an enormous fan of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>: I've been using it <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/s3/?page=last">for fifteen years</a> now (since the launch in 2006) and it's my all-time favourite cloud service: it's cheap, reliable and basically indestructible.</p>
<p>You need two credentials to make API calls to S3: an <code>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</code> and a <code>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</code>.</p>
<p>Since I often end up adding these credentials to projects hosted in different environments, I'm not at all keen on using my root-level credentials here: usually a project works against just one dedicated S3 bucket, so ideally I would like to create dedicated credentials that are limited to just that bucket.</p>
<p>Creating those credentials is surprisingly difficult!</p>
 Dogsheep Photos 
<p>The last time I solved this problem was for my <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/dogsheep-photos">Dogsheep Photos</a> project. I built a tool that uploads all of my photos from Apple Photos to my own dedicated S3 bucket, and extracts the photo metadata into a SQLite database. This means I can do some really cool tricks using SQL to analyze my photos, as described in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/May/21/dogsheep-photos/">Using SQL to find my best photo of a pelican according to Apple Photos</a>.</p>
<p>The photos are stored in a S3 private bucket, with <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-image-proxy">a custom proxy</a> in front of them that I can use to grant access to specific photographs via a signed URL.</p>
<p>For the proxy, I decided to create dedicated credentials that were allowed to make read-only requests to my private S3 bucket.</p>
<p>I made <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/dogsheep-photos/issues/4">detailed notes</a> along the way as I figured out to do that. It was really hard! There's one step where you literally have to hand-edit a JSON policy document that looks like this (replace <code>dogsheep-photos-simon</code> with your own bucket name) and paste that into the AWS web console:</p>
  {
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::dogsheep-photos-simon/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}  
<p>I set myself an ambition to try and fix this at some point in the future (that was in April 2020).</p>
<p>Today I found myself wanting new bucket credentials, so I could play with <a href="https://litestream.io/">Litestream</a>. I decided to solve this problem once and for all.</p>
<p>I've also been meaning to really get my head around Amazon's IAM permission model for years, and this felt like a great excuse to figure it out through writing code.</p>
 The process in full 
<p>Here are the steps you need to take in order to get long-lasting credentials for accessing a specific S3 bucket.</p>
 
 Create an S3 bucket 
 Create a new, dedicated user. You need a user and not a role because long-lasting AWS credentials cannot be created for roles - and we want credentials we can use in a project without constantly needing to update them. 
 Assign an "inline policy" to that user granting them read-only or read-write access to the specific S3 bucket - this is the JSON format shown above. 
 Create AWS credentials for that user. 
 
<p>There are plenty of other ways you can achieve this: you can add permissions to a group and assign that user to a group, or you can create a named "managed policy" and attach that to the user. But using an inline policy seems to be the simplest of the available options.</p>
<p>Using the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/">boto3</a> Python client library for AWS this sequence converts to the following API calls:</p>
 import boto3
import json

s3 = boto3.client("s3")
iam = boto3.client("iam")

username = "my-new-user"
bucket_name = "my-new-bucket"
policy_name = "user-can-access-bucket"

policy_document = {
    "... that big JSON document ...": ""
}

# Create the bucket
s3.create_bucket(Bucket=bucket_name)

# Create the user
iam.create_user(UserName=username)

# Assign the policy to the user
iam.put_user_policy(
    PolicyDocument=json.dumps(policy_document),
    PolicyName=policy_name,
    UserName=username,
)

# Retrieve and print the credentials
response = iam.create_access_key(
    UserName=username,
)
print(response["AccessKey"]) 
 Turning it into a CLI tool 
<p>I never want to have to figure out how to do this again, so I decided to build a tool around it.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials">s3-credentials</a> is a Python CLI utility built on top of <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/">Click</a> using my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/click-app">click-app</a> cookicutter template.</p>
<p>It's available through PyPI, so you can install it using:</p>
 <code>% pip install s3-credentials</code> 
<p>The main command is <code>s3-credentials create</code>, which runs through the above sequence of steps.</p>
<p>To create read-only credentials for my existing <code>static.niche-museums.com</code> bucket I can run the following:</p>
 <code>% s3-credentials create static.niche-museums.com --read-only

Created user: s3.read-only.static.niche-museums.com with permissions boundary: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess
Attached policy s3.read-only.static.niche-museums.com to user s3.read-only.static.niche-museums.com
Created access key for user: s3.read-only.static.niche-museums.com
{
    "UserName": "s3.read-only.static.niche-museums.com",
    "AccessKeyId": "AKIAWXFXAIOZJ26NEGBN",
    "Status": "Active",
    "SecretAccessKey": "...",
    "CreateDate": "2021-11-03 03:21:12+00:00"
}
</code> 
<p>The command shows each step as it executes, and at the end it outputs the newly created access key and secret key.</p>
<p>It defaults to creating a user with a username that reflects what it will be able to do: <code>s3.read-only.static.niche-museums.com</code>. You can pass <code>--username something</code> to specify a custom username instead.</p>
<p>If you omit the <code>--read-only</code> flag it will create a user with read and write access to the bucket. There's also a <code>--write-only</code> flag which creates a user that can write to but not read from the bucket - useful for use-cases like logging or backup scripts.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/blob/main/README.md">README</a> has full documentation on the various other options, plus details of the other <code>s3-credentials</code> utility commands <code>list-users</code>, <code>list-buckets</code>, <code>list-user-policies</code> and <code>whoami</code>.</p>
 Learned along the way 
<p>This really was a fantastic project for deepening my understanding of S3, IAM and how it all fits together. A few extra points I picked up:</p>
 
 
<p>AWS users can be created with something called a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html">permissions boundary</a>. This is an advanced security feature which lets a user be restricted to a set of maximum permissions - for example, only allowed to interact with S3, not any other AWS service.</p>
<p>Pemissions boundaries do not themselves grant permissions - a user will not be able to do anything until extra policies are added to their account. It instead acts as defense in depth, setting an upper limit to what a user can do no matter what other policies are applied to them.</p>
<p>There's one big catch: the value you set for a permissions boundary is a very weakly documented ARN string - the <code>boto3</code> documentation simply calls it "The ARN of the policy that is used to set the permissions boundary for the user". I used <a href="https://github.com/search?l=Python&amp;q=iam+PermissionsBoundary&amp;type=Code">GitHub code search</a> to dig up some examples, and found <code>arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess</code> and <code>arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess</code> to be the ones most relevant to my project. <a href="https://github.com/daviddawha/ArchivesSpaceDevUNR/blob/488b5b83f9ac66a6013e9a0a02d25734886dee02/gems/gems/fog-aws-2.0.0/lib/fog/aws/iam/default_policy_versions.json">This random file</a> appears to contain more.</p>
 
 
<p>Those JSON policy documents really are the dark secret magic that holds AWS together. Finding trustworthy examples of read-only, read-write and write-only policies for specific S3 buckets was not at all easy. I made <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/issues/3#issuecomment-958401364">detailed notes in this comment thread</a> - the policies I went with are baked into the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/blob/0.2/s3_credentials/policies.py">policies.py</a> file in the <code>s3-credentials</code> repository. If you know your way around IAM I would love to hear your feedback on the policies I ended up using!</p>
 
 
<p>Writing automated tests for code that makes extensive use of <code>boto3</code> - such that those tests don't make any real HTTP requests to the API - is a bit fiddly. I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/pull/6#issuecomment-958522457">explored a few options</a> for this - potential candidates included the <a href="https://botocore.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/stubber.html">botocore.stub.Stubber</a> class and the <a href="https://vcrpy.readthedocs.io/">VCR.py</a> class for saving and replaying HTTP traffic (see <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/pytest/pytest-recording-vcr">this TIL</a>). I ended up going with Python's <code>Mock</code> class, via <a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock">pytest-mock</a> - here's <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/pytest/pytest-mock-calls">another TIL</a> on the pattern I used for that. (Update: Jeff Triplett <a href="https://twitter.com/webology/status/1455749203595087872">pointed me</a> to <a href="https://github.com/spulec/moto">moto</a> which looks like a really great solution for this.)</p>
 
 
 Feedback from AWS experts wanted 
<p>The tool I've built solves my specific problem pretty well. I'm nervous about it though: I am by no means an IAM expert, and I'm somewhat paranoid that I may have made a dumb mistake and baked it into the tooling.</p>
<p>As such, the README currently <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/tree/0.2#%EF%B8%8F-warning">carries a warning</a> that you should review what the tool is doing carefully before trusting it against your own AWS account!</p>
<p>If you are an AWS expert, you can help: I have <a href="https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials/issues/7">an open issue</a> requesting expert feedback, and I'd love to hear from people with deep experience who can either validate that my approach is sound or help explain what I'm doing wrong and how the process can be fixed.</p>

Critically you only have one go.&nbsp; &nbsp; Try it. Fill a pan with ice and set a target, say 38.4 degrees, use a thermometer and switch off the pan when you think the final temperature will be your target. Did you manage to get within 1.5 degrees of your target?&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/">Peak Paradox framework</a> forces us to think that we cannot optimise for one outcome, one goal, one target or for a one-dimensional framing. To do so would be to ignore other optimisations, visions, ideas or beliefs.&nbsp; When we optimise, for one thing, something else will not have an optimal outcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In business, we are asked to articulate a single purpose, one mission, the single justification that sets out a reason to exist.&nbsp; The more we as a board or senior leadership team optimise for “performance”, the more we become directional. Performance itself, along with the thinking that drives the best allocation of resources, means we are framed to optimise for an outcome. &nbsp; In social sciences and economics, this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_dependence">path dependency</a>. &nbsp; The unintended consequences of our previous decisions that drive efficiency and effectiveness might not directly impact us, but another part of an interdependent system that, through several unconnected actions, will feed into our future decisions and outcomes.&nbsp; Complex system thinking highlights such causes and effects of positive and negative feedback loops.&nbsp;</p><p>By example. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dishwasher_detergent">Dishwasher tablets</a> make me more productive but make the water system less efficient by reducing the effectiveness of the <a href="https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/home-garden/shopping-guide/ethical-dishwasher-detergent">ecosystem</a>. However, I am framed by performance and my own efficiency; therefore, I have to optimise my time, and the dishwasher is a perfect solution.&nbsp; Indeed we are marketed that the dishwasher saves water and energy compared to other washing up techniques. The single narrow view of optimisation is straightforward and easy to understand.&nbsp; The views we hold on battery cars to mobile phones is framed as one of being more productive.&nbsp; Performance as a metric matters more than anything else, why because the story says performance creates economic activity that creates growth that means fewer people are in poverty.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Performance” is a one-dimensional optimisation where economic activity based on financial outcomes wins.&nbsp; You and I are the agents of any increase in performance, and the losses in the equation of equilibrium are somewhere else in the system. We are framed and educated to doubt the long, complex link between the use of anti-bacterial wipes and someone else’s skin condition. Performance as a dimension for measurement creates an optimal outcome for one and a sub-optimal outcome for someone else.&nbsp;</p><p>Performance as a measure creates an optimal outcome for one and a sub-optimal outcome for someone else.&nbsp;</p><p>If it was just me, then the cause and effect relationship are hard to see, but when more of humanity optimises for performance, it is the scale at which we all lose that suddenly comes into effect. Perhaps it is time to question the simple linear ideas of one purpose, one measure, one mission, and try to optimise for different things simultaneously; however, that means simple political messages, tabloid headlines, and social-media-driven advertising will fail.&nbsp; Are leaders ready to lead, or do they enjoy too much power to do the right thing?</p> <br>

  <p>Summary:      The future of computing is moving from the cloud to the edge. How can we create a decentralized, general-purpose computing mesh? Picos provide a model for exploration.</p>



<p>
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004M8SR2O/windleyofente-20">Rainbow's End</a> is one of my favorite books. A work of fiction, Rainbow's End imagines life in a near future world where augmented reality and pervasive IoT technology are the fabric within which people live their lives. This book, from 2006, is perhaps where I first began to understand the nature and importance of computing at the edge. A world where computing is ambient and immersive can't rely only on computers in the cloud.
</p>

<p>
    We have significant edge computing now in the form of powerful mobile devices, but that computing is not shared without roundtrips to centralized cloud computing. One of the key components of 5G technology is <a href="https://stlpartners.com/edge_computing/5g-edge-computing/">compute and storage at the edge</a>—on the cell towers themselves— that distributes computing and reduces latency. Akamai, CloudFront, and others have provided these services for years, but still in a data center somewhere. 5G moves it right to the pole in your backyard.
</p>

<p>
    But the vision I've had since reading Rainbow's End is not just distributed, but decentralized, edge computing. Imagine your persistent compute jobs in interoperable containers moving around a mesh of compute engines that live on phones, laptops, servers, or anywhere else where spare cycles exist.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> does this for storage, decentralizing file storage by putting files in shared spaces at the edge. With IPFS, people act as user-operators to host and receive content in a peer-to-peer manner. If a file gets more popular, IPFS attempts to store it in more places and closer to the need.
</p>

<p>
    You can play with this first hand at <a href="https://nofilter.org">NoFilter.org</a>, which brands itself as a "the world's first unstoppable, uncensorable, undeplatformable, decentralized freedom of speech app." There's no server storing files, just a set of Javascript files that run in your browser. Identity is provided via <a href="https://metamask.io">Metamask</a> which uses an Ethereum address as your identifier. <a href="https://nofilter.org/#/0xdbca72ed00c24d50661641bf42ad4be003a30b84">I created some posts on NoFilter</a> to explore how it works. If you look at the URL for that link, you'll see this:
</p>
 https://nofilter.org/#/0xdbca72ed00c24d50661641bf42ad4be003a30b84 
<p>
    The portion after the <code>#</code> is the Ethereum address I used at NoFilter. If we look at a <a href="https://nofilter.org/#/0xdbca72ed00c24d50661641bf42ad4be003a30b84/QmTn2r2e4LQ5ffh86KDcexNrTBaByyTiNP3pQDbNWiNJyt">single post</a>, you'll see a URL like this:
</p>
 https://nofilter.org/#/0xdbca72ed00c24d50661641bf42ad4be003a30b84/
QmTn2r2e4LQ5ffh86KDcexNrTBaByyTiNP3pQDbNWiNJyt 
<p>
    Note that there's an additional identifier following the slash after my Ethereum address. This is the IPFS hash of the content of that post and is <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTn2r2e4LQ5ffh86KDcexNrTBaByyTiNP3pQDbNWiNJyt">available on IPFS directly</a>. What's stored on IPFS is the JSON of the post that the Javascript renders in the browser.
</p>
 { 
  "author": "0xdbca72ed00c24d50661641bf42ad4be003a30b84", 
  "title": "The IPFS Address", 
  "timestamp": "2021-10-25T22:46:46-0-6:720", 
  "body": "&lt;p&gt;If I go here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/

}
 
<p>
    As far as I can tell, this is completely decentralized. The identity is just an Ethereum address that anyone can create using Metamask, a Javascript application that runs in the browser. The files are stored on IPFS, decentralized on storage providers around the net. They are rendered using Javascript that runs in the browser. So long as you have access to the Javascript files from somewhere you can write and read articles without reliance on any central server.
</p>

 Decentralized Computing 
<p>
    My vision for <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/07/ten_reasons_to_use_picos_for_your_next_decentralized_programming_project.shtml">picos</a> is that they can operate on a decentralized mesh of pico engines in a similar decentralized fashion. Picos are already encapsulations of computation with isolated state and programs that control their operation. There are two primary problems with the <a>current pico engine</a> that have to be addressed to make picos independent of the underlying engine:
</p>
 
     Picos are addressed by URL, so the pico engine's host name or IP address becomes part of the pico's address 
     Picos have a persistence layer that is currently provided by the engine the pico is hosted on.  
 
<p>
    The first problem is solvable using <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">DIDs and DIDComm</a>. We've made progress in this area. You can create and use DIDs in a pico. But they are not, yet, the primary means of addressing and communicating with the pico.
</p>

<p>
    The second problem could be addressed with IPFS. We've not done any work in this area yet. So I'm not aware of the pitfalls or problems, but it looks doable.
</p>

<p>
    With these two architectural issues out of the way, implementing a way for picos to move easily between engines would be straightforward. We have import and export functionality already. I'm envisioning something that picos could control themselves, on demand, programatically. Ultimately, I want the pico to chose where it's hosted based on whatever factors the owner or programmer deems most important. That could be hosting cost, latency, availability, capacity, or other factors. The decentralized directory to discover engines advertising certain features or factors, and a means to pay them would have to be built—possibly as a smart contract. 
</p>

<p>
    A trickier problem is protecting picos from malevolent engines. This is the hardest problem, as far as I can tell. Initially, collections of trusted engines, possibly using staking, could be used.
</p>

<p>
    There are plenty of fun, interesting problems if you'd like to help.
</p>

<p>Long ago a person dear to me disappeared for what would become eight years. When this happened I was given comfort and perspective by his maternal grandfather, a professor of history whose study concentrated on the American South after the Civil War.</p>
<p>“You know what the most common record of young men was, after the Civil War?” he asked.</p>
<p>“You mean census records?”</p>
<p>“Yes, and church records, family histories, all that.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Two words:&nbsp;Went west.”</p>
<p>He went on to explain that that, except for the natives here in the U.S., nearly all of our ancestors had gone west. Literally or metaphorically, voluntarily or not, they went west.</p>
<p>More importantly, most were not going back. Many, perhaps most, were hardly heard from again in the places they left. The break from the past in countless places was sadly complete for those left behind. All that remained were those two words.</p>
<p>Went west.</p>
<p>This fact, he said, is at the heart of American rootlessness.</p>
<p>“We are the least rooted civilization on Earth,” he said. “This is why we have weaker family values than any other country.”</p>
<p>This is also why he also thought political talk about “family values” was especially ironic. We may have those values, but they tend not to keep us from going west anyway.</p>
<p>This comes to mind because I am haunted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Chapin">Harry Chapin</a>‘s song, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etundhQa724">Cat’s in the Cradle</a>.” It’s hard not to be moved by it.</p>

  <p>Summary:      Token-based identity systems move us from talking about who, to thinking about what, so that people can operationalize their digital lives. Token-based identity systems support complex online interactions that are flexible, ad hoc, and cross-domain.</p>


<p>
    I've spent some time thinking about this article from PeterVan on <a href="https://petervan.wordpress.com/2021/08/29/programmable-money-and-identity/">Programmable Money and Identity</a>. Peter references a <a href="https://www.tbstat.com/wp/uploads/2020/08/The-Block-Research-CBDC-Report-From-Iteration-to-Implementation_v1.04.pdf">white paper on central bank digital currencies</a> and one on <a href="https://ath.mirror.xyz/mDu_nGsWpjvF-KaPLADwxeAMfze3UJOtTAQi2CwPwWc">identity composability by Andrew Hong</a> to lead into a discussion of account- and token-based1 identity. In his article, Peter says:
</p>
<blockquote>
    For Account-based identity, you need to be sure of the identity of the account holder (the User ID / Password of your Facebook-account, your company-network, etc.). For Token-based identity (Certified claim about your age for example) you need a certified claim about an attribute of that identity.
</blockquote>

<p>
    In other words, while account-based identity focuses on linking a person in possession of authentication factors to a trove of information, token-based identity is focused on claims about the subject's attributes. More succinctly: account-based identity focuses on who you are whereas token-based identity is focused on what you are. 
</p>

<p>
    One of my favorite scenarios for exploring this is meeting a friend for lunch. You arrive at the restaurant on time and she’s nowhere to be found. You go to the hostess to inquire about the reservation. She tells you that your reservation is correct, and your friend is already there. She escorts you to the table where you greet your friend. You are seated and the hostess leaves you with a menu. Within a few moments, the waitress arrives to take your order. You ask a few questions about different dishes. You both settle on your order and the waitress leaves to communicate with the kitchen. You happily settle in to chat with your friend, while your food is being prepared. Later you might get a refill on a drink, order dessert, and eventually pay.
</p>

<p>
    While you, your friend, the host, and waitstaff recognized, remembered, and interacted with people, places, and things countless times during this scenario, at no time were you required to be identified as a particular person. Even paying with a credit card doesn't require that. Credit cards are a token-based identity system that says something about you rather than who you are. And while you do have an account with your bank, the brilliance of the credit card is that you no longer have to have accounts with every place you want credit. You simply present a token that gives the merchant confidence that they will be paid. Here are a few of the "whats" in this scenario:
</p>
 
     My friend 
     The person sitting at table 3 
     Over 21 
     Guest who ordered the medium-rare steak 
     Someone who needs a refill 
     Excellent tipper 
     Person who owes $179.35 
     Person in possession of a MasterCard 
 

<p>
    You don't need an account at the restaurant for any of this to work. But you do need <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">relationships</a>. Some, like the relationship with your friend and MasterCard, are long-lived and identified. Most are <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/08/ephemeral_relationships.shtml">ephemeral and pseudonymous</a>. While the server at the restaurant certainly "identifies" patrons, they usually forget them as soon as the transaction is complete. And the identification is usually pseudonymous (e.g. "the couple at table three" rather than "Phillip and Lynne Windley").
</p>

<p>
    In the digital realm, we suffer from the problem of not being in proximity to those we're interacting with. As a result, we need a technical means to establish a relationship. Traditionally, we've done that with accounts and identifying, using authentication factors, who is connecting. As a result, all online relationships tend to be long-lived and identified in important ways—even when they don't need to be. This has been a boon to <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/05/life-like_anonymity_and_the_poison_web.shtml">surveillance capitalism</a>.  
</p>

<p>
    In contrast, SSI <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">establishes peer-to-peer relationships using peer DIDs</a> (<a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml#autonomic">autonomic identifiers</a>) that can be forgotten or remembered as needed. These <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">relationships allow secure communication for issuing and presenting credentials</a> that say something about the subject (what) without necessarily identifying the subject (who). This token-based identity system more faithfully mirrors the way identity works in the physical world. 
</p>

<p>
    Account- and token-based identity are not mutually exclusive. In fact, token-based identity often has its roots in an account somewhere, as we discovered about MasterCard. But the key is that you're leveraging that account to avoid being in an administrative relationship in other places. To see that, consider the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/08/youve_had_an_automobile_accident_multi-source_identity_to_the_rescue.shtml">interactions that happen after an automobile accident</a>.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Account and token interactions after an automobile accident  (click to enlarge)


<p>
    In this scenario, two drivers, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/08/youve_had_an_automobile_accident_multi-source_identity_to_the_rescue.shtml">Alice and Bob, have had an accident</a>. The highway patrol has come to the scene to make an accident report. Both Alice and Bob have a number of credentials (tokens) in their digital wallets that they control and will be important in creating the report:
</p>
 
     Proof of insurance issued by their respective insurance companies 
     Vehicle title issued by the state founded on a vehicle original document from the vehicle's manufacturer. 
     Vehicle registration issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) 
     Driver's license issued by the Department of Public Safety (DPS) in Alice's case and the DMV in Bob's 
     In addition, the patrol officer has a badge from the Highway Patrol.  
 
<p>
    Each of these credentials is the fruit of an account of some kind (i.e. the person was identified as part of the process). But the fact that Alice, Bob, and the patrol officer have tokens of one sort or another that stem from those accounts allows them to act autonomously from those administrative systems to participate in a complex, ad hoc, cross-domain workflow that will play out over the course of days or weeks.
</p>

<p>
    Account-based and token-based identity system co-exist in any sufficiently complex ecosystem. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) doesn't replace administrative identity systems, it gives us another tool that enables better privacy, more flexible interactions, and increased autonomy. In the automobile scenario, for example, Alice and Bob will have an ephemeral relationship that lasts a few weeks. They'll likely never see the patrol officer after the initial encounter. Alice and Bob would make and sign statements that everyone would like to have confidence in. The police officer would create an accident report. All of this is so complex and unique that it is unlikely to ever happen within a single administrative identity system or on some kind of platform. 
</p>

<p>
    Token-based identity allows people to <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">operationalize their digital lives</a> by supporting online interactions that are <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/09/multi-source_and_self-sovereign_identity.shtml">multi-source</a>, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/09/fluid_multi-pseudonymity.shtml">fluid multi-pseudonymous</a>, and decentralized. Ensuring that the token-based identity system is also <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">self-sovereign</a> ensures that people can act autonomously without being within someone else's administrative identity system as they go about their online lives. I think of it as digital embodiment—giving people a way to be peers with other actors in online interactions. 
</p>

 
<a></a>
 Notes 
 
     I'm using "token" in the general sense here.  I'm not referring to either cryptocurrency or hardware authentication devices specifically.

<p>Art- A call for New Industry Data Exchange Models, The Trust Chain, and A Connected Individual Transaction And Identity Scoring Scheme: An Interview with Virginie Debris of GMS</p>
<p>I recently sat down with Virginie Debris, the Chief Product Officer for <a href="https://www.gms-worldwide.com/">Global Messaging Service</a> (GMS) and Board Member of the <a href="https://mobileecosystemforum.com/about/global-board/">Mobile Ecosystem Forum</a>, to talk about personal data and identity (PD&amp;I). We had an enlightening discussion (<a href="https://youtu.be/ftJ_4800W2Y">see video of the interview: 46:16 min)</a>). The conversation took us down unexpected paths and brought several insights and recommendations to light.</p>
<p>In our interview, we discussed the role of personal data and identity and how enterprises use it to know and serve their customers and protect the enterprises’ interests. To my delight, we uncovered three ideas that could help us all better protect PD&amp;I and improve the market’s efficiency.</p>
 
 Idea One: Build out and refine “The Trust Chain”, or “chain of trust,” a PD&amp;I industry value chain framework envisioned by Virginie. 
 Idea Two: Refine PD&amp;I industry practices, optimize all of the data that mobile operators are holding on to, and ensure that appropriate technical, legal, and ethical exchange mechanisms are in place to ensure responsible use of PD&amp;I. 
 Idea Three: Standardize a connected individual identity scoring scheme, i.e., a scheme for identity and transaction verification, often centralized around mobile data. This scheme is analogous to credit scoring for lending and fraud detection for credit card purchases. It would help enterprises simultaneously better serve their customers, protect PD&amp;I, mitigate fraud, and improve their regulatory compliance efforts. 
 
<p>According to Virginie, a commercial imperative for an enterprise is knowing their customer–verifying the customer’s identity prior to and during engagements. Knowing the customer helps enterprises not only better serve the customer, but also manage costs, reduce waste, mitigate fraud, and stay on the right side of the law and regulations. Virginie remarked that her customers often say, “I want to know who is my end user. Who am I talking to? Am I speaking to the right person in front of me?” This is hard enough in the physical realm, and in the digital realm it is even more difficult. The ideas discussed in this interview can help enterprises answer these questions.</p>
 Consumer Identity and the Enterprise 
<p>The mobile phone has become a cornerstone for digital identity management and commerce. In fact, Cameron D’Ambrosi, Managing Director of Liminal, has gone as far as to suggest <a>mobile has an irreplaceable role in the digital identity ecosystem</a>.<a>1</a> Mobile can help enterprises be certain whom they are dealing with, and with this certainty help them, with confidence, successfully connect, communicate, and engage people in nearly any transactions.</p>
<p>To successfully leverage mobile as a tool for customer identity management, which is an enabler of what is known as “know your customer” or KYC, enterprises work with organizations like GMS to integrate mobile identity verification into their commercial workflow. In our interview, Virginie notes that GMS is a global messaging aggregator, the “man in the middle.” It provides messaging and related services powered by personal data and identity to enterprises and mobile operators, including KYC services.</p>
 Benefits gained from knowing your customer 
<p>There is a wide range of use cases for why an enterprise may want to use services provided by players like GMS. They can:</p>
 
 Improve customer experience: Knowing the customer and the context of a transaction can help improve the customer experience. 
 Maintain data hygiene: Ensuring data in a CRM or customer system of record that is accurate can improve marketing, save money, reduce fraud, and more. 
 Effectively manage data: Reducing duplicate records, tagging data, and more can reduce costs, create efficiency, and generate new business opportunities (side note: <a>poor data management costs enterprises billions annually</a>).<a>2</a> 
 Ensure regulatory compliance: Industry and government best practices, legislation, and regulation is not just nice to have; it is a business requirement. Staying compliant can mitigate risk, build trust, and help organizations differentiate themselves in the market. 
 Mitigate cybercrime: Cybercrime is costing industry trillions of dollars a year (<a>Morgan (2020) predicts the tally could be as much as $10.5 trillion annually by 2025</a>).<a>3</a>These losses can be reduced with an effective strategy. 
 
 The connected individual identity scoring scheme 
<p>When a consumer signs up for or buys a product or service, an enterprise may prompt them to provide a mobile number and other personal data as part of the maintenance of their profile and to support the transaction. An enterprise working with GSM, in real-time, can ping GMS’s network to verify if the consumer-provided mobile number is real, i.e., operational. Moreover, they can ask GMS to predict, with varying levels of accuracy, if a mobile number and PD&amp;I being used in a transaction is associated with a real person. They can also ask if the presumed person conducting the transaction can be trusted or if they might be a fraudster looking to cheat the business. This is a decision based on relevant personal information provided by the individual prior to or during the transaction, as well as data drawn from other sources.</p>
<p>This type of real-time identity and trust verification is made possible by a process Virginie refers to as “scoring.” I refer to it as “the connected individual identity scoring scheme.” Scoring is an intricate and complex choreography of data management and analysis, executed by GMS in milliseconds. This dance consists of pulling together and analyzing a myriad of personal data, deterministic and probabilistic identifiers, and mobile phone signals. The actors in this dance include GMS, the enterprise, the consumer, and GMS’s strategic network of mobile network operators and PD&amp;I aggregator partners.</p>
<p>When asked by an enterprise to produce a score, GMS, in real-time, combines and analyzes enterprise-provided data (e.g., customer name, addresses, phone number, presumed location, etc.), mobile operator signal data (e.g., the actual location of a phone, SIM card, and number forwarding status), and PD&amp;I aggregator supplied data. From this information, it produces a score. This score is used to determine the likelihood a transaction being initiated by “someone” is legitimate and can be trusted, or not. A perfect score of 1 would suggest that, with one hundred percent certainty, the person is who they say they are and can be trusted, and a score of zero would suggest they are most certainly a cybercriminal.</p>
<p>In our interview, Virginie notes, “nothing is perfect, we need to admit that,” thus suggesting that one should never expect a perfect score. The more certain a business wants to be, i.e.&nbsp;the higher score they require to confirm a transaction, the more the business should expect the possibility of increased transactional costs, time, and friction in the user experience. Keeping this in mind, businesses should develop a risk tolerance matrix, based on the context of a transaction, to determine if they want to accept the current transaction or not. For example, for lower risk or lower cost transactions (e.g., an online pizza order) the business might have a lower assurance tolerance and will accept a lower score. For higher-risk or higher-cost transactions (e.g., a bank wire transfer), they might need a higher assurance tolerance and accept only higher scores.</p>
 Example: Detecting fraud in a banking experience 
<p>Virginie used a bank transaction as an example. She explained that a bank could check if a customer’s mobile phone is near the expected location of a transaction. If it was not, this might suggest there is a possibility of fraud occurring, which would negatively impact the score.</p>
<p>Mobile scoring happens every day, but not always by this name–others refer to it as mobile signaling or mobile device intelligence. However, Virginie alluded to a challenge. There is no industry standard for scoring, which may lead to inconsistencies in execution and bias across the industry. She suggested that more industry collaboration is needed to prevent this.</p>
 The Trust Chain 
<p>During our conversation, Virginie proposed a novel idea which frames what we in the industry could do to optimize the PD&amp;I value and use it responsibly. Virginie said we need to build a chain of trust amongst the PD&amp;I actors, “The Trust Chain”.</p>
<p>I have taken poetic license, based on our conversation, and have illustrated The Trust Chain in the figure below. The figure depicts connected individuals* at the center, resting on a bed of industry players linked to enterprises. A yellow band circles them all to illustrate the flow of personal data and identity throughout the chain.</p>
<p></p>
 
 Defining the connected individual and being phygital: It is so easy in business to get distracted by our labels. It is important to remember the terms we use to refer to the people we serve—prospect, consumer, patient, shopper, investor, user, etc.—are contrived and can distract. These terms are all referring to the same thing: a human, an individual, and more importantly, a contextual state or action at some point along the customer journey, i.e., sometimes I am a shopper considering a product, other times I am a consumer using the product. The shopper and the consumer are not always the same person. Understanding this is important to ensure effective engagement in the connected age. In the context of today’s world and this discussion, the individual is connected. They are connected with phones, tablets, smartwatches, cars, and more. These connections have made us “phygital” beings, merging the digital and physical self. Each and every one of these connections is producing data. 
 
<p>According to Virginie, the key to making the industry more effective and efficient is to tap into more and more of the connected individual data held and managed by mobile network operators. This is because, in her own words, “they know everything.” To tap into this data, Virginie said a number of technical, legal, and ethical complexities must be overcome. In addition, an improved model for data exchange amongst the primary actors of the industry—mobile network operators, enterprises, messaging aggregators (like GMS), and PD&amp;I aggregators—needs to be established. In other words, “The Trust Chain” needs to be refined and built. The presumption behind all of this is that the current models of data exchange can be found wanting.</p>
 What we need to do next 
<p>In summary, the conclusion I draw from my interview with Virginie are that we should come together to tackle:</p>
 
 The technical, legal, and ethical complexities to enable more effective access to the treasure trove of data held by the mobile network operators 
 The standardization of a connected individual scoring scheme 
 The development and integrity for “The Trust Chain” 
 
<p>My takeaway from our discussion is simple, I agree with her ideas. These efforts and more are needed. The use of personal data and identity throughout the industry is accelerating at an exponential rate. To ensure all parties can safely engage, transact, and thrive, it is critical that industry leaders develop a sustainable and responsible, marketplace.</p>

<p>This article shows how Azure AD verifiable credentials can be issued and used in an ASP.NET Core application. An ASP.NET Core Razor page application is used to implement the credential issuer. To issue credentials, the application must manage the credential subject data as well as require authenticated users who would like to add verifiable credentials to their digital wallet. The Microsoft Authenticator mobile application is used as the digital wallet.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/swiss-ssi-group/AzureADVerifiableCredentialsAspNetCore">https://github.com/swiss-ssi-group/AzureADVerifiableCredentialsAspNetCore</a></p>



<p>Blogs in this series</p>



  <a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/03/29/getting-started-with-self-sovereign-identity-ssi/">Getting started with Self Sovereign Identity SSI</a>  <a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/10/11/challenges-to-self-sovereign-identity/">Challenges to Self Sovereign Identity</a>  



<p>Setup</p>



<p>Two ASP.NET Core applications are implemented to issue and verify the verifiable credentials. The credential issuer must administrate and authenticate its identities to issue verifiable credentials. A verifiable credential issuer should never issue credentials to unauthenticated subjects of the credential. As the verifier normally only authorizes the credential, it is important to know that the credentials were at least issued correctly. We do not know as a verifier who or and mostly what sends the verifiable credentials but at least we know that the credentials are valid if we trust the issuer. It is possible to use private holder binding for a holder of a wallet which would increase the trust between the verifier and the issued credentials.</p>



<p>The credential issuer in this demo issues credentials for driving licenses using Azure AD verifiable credentials. The ASP.NET Core application uses Microsoft.Identity.Web to authenticate all identities. In a real application, the application would be authenticated as well requiring 2FA for all users. Azure AD supports this good. The administrators would also require admin rights, which could be implemented using Azure security groups or Azure roles which are added to the application as claims after the OIDC authentication flow.</p>



<p>Any authenticated identity can request credentials (A driving license in this demo) for themselves and no one else. The administrators can create data which is used as the subject, but not issue credentials for others.</p>



<p>Azure AD verifiable credential setup</p>



<p>Azure AD verifiable credentials is setup using the Azure Docs for the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/verifiable-credentials/get-started-request-api">Rest API</a> and the Azure verifiable credential ASP.NET Core sample <a href="https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-verifiable-credentials-dotnet">application</a>. </p>







<p>Following the documentation, a display file and a rules file were uploaded for the verifiable credentials created for this issuer. In this demo, two credential subjects are defined to hold the data when issuing or verifying the credentials. </p>


  {
  "default": {
    "locale": "en-US",
    "card": {
      "title": "National Driving License VC",
      "issuedBy": "Damienbod",
      "backgroundColor": "#003333",
      "textColor": "#ffffff",
      "logo": {
        "uri": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swiss-ssi-group/TrinsicAspNetCore/main/src/NationalDrivingLicense/wwwroot/ndl_car_01.png",
        "description": "National Driving License Logo"
      },
      "description": "Use your verified credential to prove to anyone that you can drive."
    },
    "consent": {
      "title": "Do you want to get your Verified Credential?",
      "instructions": "Sign in with your account to get your card."
    },
    "claims": {
      "vc.credentialSubject.name": {
        "type": "String",
        "label": "Name"
      },
      "vc.credentialSubject.details": {
        "type": "String",
        "label": "Details"
      }
    }
  }
}

  


<p>The rules file defines the attestations for the credentials. Two standard claims are used to hold the data, the given_name and the family_name. These claims are mapped to our name and details subject claims and holds all the data. Adding custom claims to Azure AD or Azure B2C is not so easy and so I decided for the demo, it would be easier to use standard claims which works without custom configurations. The data sent from the issuer to the holder of the claims can be sent in the application. It should be possible to add credential subject properties without requiring standard AD id_token claims, but I was not able to set this up in the current preview version.</p>


  {
  "attestations": {
    "idTokens": [
      {
        "id": "https://self-issued.me",
        "mapping": {
          "name": { "claim": "$.given_name" },
          "details": { "claim": "$.family_name" }
        },
        "configuration": "https://self-issued.me",
        "client_id": "",
        "redirect_uri": ""
      }
    ]
  },
  "validityInterval": 2592001,
  "vc": {
    "type": [ "MyDrivingLicense" ]
  }
}
  


<p>The rest of the Azure AD credentials are setup exactly like the documentation. </p>



<p>Administration of the Driving licenses</p>



<p>The verifiable credential issuer application uses a Razor page application which accesses a Microsoft SQL Azure database using Entity Framework Core to access the database. The administrator of the credentials can assign driving licenses to any user. The DrivingLicenseDbContext class is used to define the DBSet  for driver licenses.</p>


  ublic class DrivingLicenseDbContext : DbContext
{
	public DbSet&lt;DriverLicense&gt; DriverLicenses { get; set; }

	public DrivingLicenseDbContext(DbContextOptions&lt;DrivingLicenseDbContext&gt; options)
		: base(options)
	{
	}

	protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder builder)
	{
		builder.Entity&lt;DriverLicense&gt;().HasKey(m =&gt; m.Id);

		base.OnModelCreating(builder);
	}
}
  


<p>A DriverLicense entity contains the infomation we use to create verifiable credentials.</p>


  public class DriverLicense
{
	[Key]
	public Guid Id { get; set; }
	public string UserName { get; set; } = string.Empty;
	public DateTimeOffset IssuedAt { get; set; }
	public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;
	public string FirstName { get; set; } = string.Empty;
	public DateTimeOffset DateOfBirth { get; set; }
	public string Issuedby { get; set; } = string.Empty;
	public bool Valid { get; set; }
	public string DriverLicenseCredentials { get; set; } = string.Empty;
	public string LicenseType { get; set; } = string.Empty;
}
  


<p></p>



<p>Issuing credentials to authenticated identities</p>



<p>When issuing verifiable credentials using Azure AD Rest API, an IssuanceRequestPayload payload is used to request the credentials which are to be issued to the digital wallet. Verifiable credentials are issued to a digital wallet. The credentials are issued for the holder of the wallet. The payload classes are the same for all API implementations apart from the CredentialsClaims class which contains the subject claims which match the rules file of your definition.</p>


  public class IssuanceRequestPayload
    {
        [JsonPropertyName("includeQRCode")]
        public bool IncludeQRCode { get; set; }

    }

    /// Application specific claims used in the payload of the issue request. 
    /// When using the id_token for the subject claims, the IDP needs to add the values to the id_token!
    /// The claims can be mapped to anything then.
    public class CredentialsClaims
    {
        /// &lt;summary&gt;
        /// attribute names need to match a claim from the id_token
        /// &lt;/summary&gt;
        [JsonPropertyName("given_name")]
        public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;
        [JsonPropertyName("family_name")]
        public string Details { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    }
  


<p>The GetIssuanceRequestPayloadAsync method sets the data for each identity that requested the credentials. Only a signed in user can request the credentials for themselves. The context.User.Identity is used and the data is selected from the database for the signed in user. It is important that credentials are only issued to authenticated users. Users and the application must be authenticated correctly using 2FA and so on. Per default, the credentials are only authorized on the verifier which is probably not enough for most security flows. </p>


  public async Task&lt;IssuanceRequestPayload&gt; GetIssuanceRequestPayloadAsync(HttpRequest request, HttpContext context)
{
	var payload = new IssuanceRequestPayload();
	var length = 4;
	var pinMaxValue = (int)Math.Pow(10, length) - 1;
	var randomNumber = RandomNumberGenerator.GetInt32(1, pinMaxValue);
	var newpin = string.Format("{0:D" + length.ToString() + "}", randomNumber);

	payload.Issuance.Pin.Length = 4;
	payload.Issuance.Pin.Value = newpin;
	payload.Issuance.CredentialsType = "MyDrivingLicense";
	payload.Issuance.Manifest = _credentialSettings.CredentialManifest;

	var host = GetRequestHostName(request);
	payload.Callback.State = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
	payload.Callback.Url = $"{host}:/api/issuer/issuanceCallback";
	payload.Callback.Headers.ApiKey = _credentialSettings.VcApiCallbackApiKey;

	payload.Registration.ClientName = "Verifiable Credential NDL Sample";
	payload.Authority = _credentialSettings.IssuerAuthority;

	var driverLicense = await _driverLicenseService.GetDriverLicense(context.User.Identity.Name);

	payload.Issuance.Claims.Name = $"{driverLicense.FirstName} {driverLicense.Name}  {driverLicense.UserName}";
	payload.Issuance.Claims.Details = $"Type: {driverLicense.LicenseType} IssuedAt: {driverLicense.IssuedAt:yyyy-MM-dd}";

	return payload;
}
  


<p>The IssuanceRequestAsync method gets the payload data and request credentials from the Azure AD verifiable credentials REST API and returns this value which can be scanned using a QR code in the Razor page. The request returns fast. Depending on how the flow continues, a web hook in the application will update the status in a cache. This cache is persisted and polled from the UI. This could be improved by using SignalR.</p>


  [HttpGet("/api/issuer/issuance-request")]
public async Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; IssuanceRequestAsync()
{
	try
	{
		var payload = await _issuerService.GetIssuanceRequestPayloadAsync(Request, HttpContext);

				if (payload.Issuance.Pin.Value != null) 
				{
					response.Pin = payload.Issuance.Pin.Value; 
				}

				response.Id = payload.Callback.State;

				var cacheData = new CacheData
				{
					Status = IssuanceConst.NotScanned,
					Message = "Request ready, please scan with Authenticator",
					Expiry = response.Expiry.ToString()
				};
				_cache.Set(payload.Callback.State, JsonSerializer.Serialize(cacheData));

				return Ok(response);
			}
			else
			{
				_log.LogError("Unsuccesfully called Request API");
				return BadRequest(new { error = "400", error_description = "Something went wrong calling the API: " + response });
			}
		}
		catch (Exception ex)
		{
			return BadRequest(new { error = "400", error_description = "Something went wrong calling the API: " + ex.Message });
		}
	}
	catch (Exception ex)
	{
		return BadRequest(new { error = "400", error_description = ex.Message });
	}
}
  


<p>The IssuanceResponse is returned to the UI.</p>


  public class IssuanceResponse

}
  


<p>The IssuanceCallback is used as a web hook for the Azure AD verifiable credentials. When developing or deploying, this web hook needs to have a public IP. I use ngrok to test this. Because the issuer authenticates the identities using an Azure App registration, everytime the ngrok URL changes, the redirect URL needs to be updated. Each callback request updates the cache. This API also needs to allow anonymous requests if the rest of the application is authenticated using OIDC. The AllowAnonymous attribute is required, if you use an authenticated ASP.NET Core application.</p>

<p>Testing and running the applications</p>



<p>Ngrok is used to provide a public callback for the Azure AD verifiable credentials callback. When the application is started, you need to create a driving license. This is done in the administration Razor page. Once a driving license exists, the View driver license Razor page can be used to issue a verifiable credential to the logged in user. A QR Code is displayed which can be scanned to begin the issue flow. </p>







<p>Using the Microsoft authenticator, you can scan the QR Code and add the verifiable credentials to your digital wallet. The credentials can now be used in any verifier which supports the Microsoft Authenticator wallet. The verify ASP.NET Core application can be used to verify and used the issued verifiable credential from the Wallet.</p>

<p>Prelude: First off, if you haven’t already read <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/papers/2012-BonneauHerOorSta-password--oakland.pdf">The Quest to Replace the Password</a> stop reading this and give that a read first. To paraphrase my computer security professor, If you haven’t read this paper before you design an authentication system you’re probably just reinventing something already created or missing a piece of the puzzle. So go ahead take a read of that paper first before you continue on. In fact, I just re-read this paper before I started working on it because it does an excellent job of framing the problem.</p>

 

<p>Over the past few years, I’ve spent a fair amount of time thinking about what the next generation of authentication and authorization systems will look like from a variety of different perspectives. I started out looking at the problem from a user’s perspective originally just looking to get rid of passwords. Then I looked at it as an attacker working as an intern penetration tester which gave me a unique eye into understanding the attacker mindset. Unfortunately, I didn’t find myself enjoying the red team side of security too much (combined with having a 2-year non-compete as an intern - that was a joke in hindsight) so by happenstance, I found myself into the standards community where the next generation of authentication (AuthN) and authorization (AuthZ) systems have been being built. Combine this with the view of a software engineer attempting to build the standards that are being written by some world-class experts with centuries of combined experience. Throughout this experience, I’ve gotten to view the state of the art while also getting to keep the naiveness that comes with being a fairly new engineer relative to some of the experts I get to work with. During this time I’ve become a bit more opinionated on what makes a good authentication system and this time around I’m going to jot down my current thoughts on what makes something useful.</p>

<p>However, one aspect that I think that paper lacks is that it frames the problem of authentication on the web as something where the next goal is to move to something different other than passwords, but we just haven’t found that better thing yet. While I think this is probably true for some aspects of low-security systems I think that fundamentally passwords or more generally, “Things I know” are here to stay. The problem is that we haven’t done a good enough job of understanding the requirements that the user needs to intuitively use the system as well as making sure that the system sufficiently gets out of the way of the user. As the paper does point out though, this is likely due to our specialization bias which doesn’t allow us to take into considerations the holistic view points necessary to approach the problem. What I’m proposing I think is a way in which we can jump this hurdle through the usage of hard data. Read on and let me know if you think this can solve this issue or if I’m just full of my own implicit biases.</p>

<p>So what’re the important insights that I’ve been thinking about lately? First off, the user experience of authenticating on the web has to be joyful first and foremost. If the user doesn’t have a better experience than what they do with passwords, which is a very low bar to beat when considering all the passwords they have to remember, then it’s simply unacceptable and won’t achieve the uptake that’s needed to overtake passwords.</p>

<p>Secondly, I think it’s important that we recognize that the security of any authentication system is probabilistic, not deterministic. By reframing the problem to understand that with each additional security check we do under the classifications of “what I know”, “what I am”, and “what I have” it allows us to better understand the problem we’re actually trying to solve with security. To put this idea in perspective think about the problem this way. What’s the probability that a security system will be broken for any particular user during a particular period? For example, a user who chooses to reuse their password that’s set to “#1password” for every website is a lot less likely (my intuition - happy to be proven wrong) than a user who can memorize a password like “p2D16U$nClNjqLseKTtnjw” for every website. However, there’s a significant tradeoff on the user’s experience which is why the case where a user reuses an easy to remember is a lot more likely to occur when studying users than the latter case even though we know it’s less secure.</p>

<p>So what gives? This all sounds obvious to a semi-well thought-out engineer, right? The difference is we simply don’t know the probability of a security system failing in an ideal scenario over a pre-determined period. To put this in perspective - can anyone point me to an academic research paper or even some user research that tells me the probability that a user’s password will be discovered by an attacker in the next year? What about the probability that the user shares their password with a trusted person because the system wasn’t deployed with a delegation system? Or how about how the probability will drop as the user reuses their password across many websites? Simply put I think we’ve been asking the wrong question here and until we can have hard data on this we can’t make rigorous choices on the acceptable UX/security tradeoffs that are so hard to decide today.</p>

<p>This isn’t relevant for just passwords either, this extends to many different forms of authentication that fall under the other two authentication classes as well. For example, what’s the probability that a user’s account will be breached when relying on the Open ID Connect protocol rather than a password? Furthermore, what’s the likelihood that the user prefers the Open ID Connect system rather than a password for each website, and is that likelihood worth the increase or decrease in probabilistic security under one or many attack vectors?</p>

<p>The best part of this framing is that it changes how we look at security on the web from the user’s perspective, but that’s not the only part that has to be considered as is rightly pointed in the paper. There’s a very important third factor that has to be considered as well which is deployability, which I like to reframe as “developer experience” or DevX.</p>

<p>By evaluating a constraint of a system in this way we reframe the problem into a measurable outcome that becomes far more tractable and measurable between the variety of constraints that need to be considered including the developer deploying or maintaining the system, the user who’s using it, and the resistance to common threats (Don’t worry about unrealistic threat models for now - mature them over time) which the user expects the designers of the system to protect them from.</p>

<p>Once we’ve got that data let’s sit down and re-evaluate what are the most important principles of designing the system. I’ll make a few predictions to wrap this up as well.</p>

<p>First prediction: I think once we have this data we’ll see a few different things which will be obvious in hindsight. A system that doesn’t prioritize UX over DevX over probabilistic security resilience will be dead in the water since it goes against the “user should enjoy the authentication experience principle”. Additionally, DevX has to come before security because without a good devX it’s less likely to be implemented at all let alone properly.</p>

<p>Second prediction: I’d venture to guess that we’ll learn a few things about the way we frame security on the web with the clear winner being that we should be designing for MFA systems by default, but “what I have” categories need to be the basis of the majority of experiences for the user with the “what I know” categories being an escalated approach with “what I am” categories only being needed in the highest assurance use cases or at the time of more red flags having been raised (e.g. new IP address, new device, etc) and being enforced on-device rather than handled by a remote server.</p>

<p>Final prediction: Recovery is going to be the hardest part of the system to figure out with multi-device flows being only slightly easier to solve. I wouldn’t be surprised if the solution to recovery was actually to not recover and instead make it super easy to “burn and recreate” (as John Jordan has advocated in the decentralized identity community) an account on the web because that’s how hard recovery actually is to get right.</p>

<p>So that’s what I’ve got for now. I’m sure I’m missing something here and I’m sure I’m wrong in a few other cases. Share your comments on this down below or feel free to send me an email and tell me I’m wrong. I do appreciate the thoughtfulness that others put into pointing these things out so let me know what you think and let’s discuss it further. Thanks for reading!</p>

    We spend most of our waking hours being held to account between the guardrails of risk-informed and responsible decision making.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, we often climb over the guardrails and make ill-informed, irresponsible and irrational decisions, but that is human agency. It is also true that we would not innovate, create or discover if we could not explore the other side of our safety guardrails.&nbsp; <p>Today’s perception of responsible decision making is different to that our grandparents held.&nbsp; Our grandchildren will look back at our “risk-informed” decisions with the advantage of hindsight and question why our risk management frameworks were so short-term-focused.&nbsp; However, we need to recognise that our guardrails are established by current political, economic and societal framing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What are we optimising for?”</p><p>I often ask the question, “what are we optimising for?” The reason I ask this question is to draw out different viewpoints in a leadership team.&nbsp; The viewpoints that drive individual optimisation is framed by their experience, ability to understand time-frames and incentives.&nbsp;</p><p>Peak Paradox is a non-confrontational framework to explore our different perceptions of what we are optimising for.&nbsp; We need different and diverse views to ensure that our guardrails don’t become so narrow they look like rail tracks, and we repeat the same mistakes because that is what the process determines.&nbsp; Equally, we must agree together boundaries of divergence which means we can optimise as a team for something that we believe in and has a shared purpose of us and our stakeholders.&nbsp; Finding this dynamic area of alignment is made easier with the Peak Paradox framework.&nbsp;</p><p>However, our model of risk-informed responsible decision making is based on the idea that the majority decides, essentially democracy.&nbsp; If the “majority” is a supermajority, we need 76%; for a simple majority, we need 51%, and for minority protections less than 10%.&nbsp; What we get depends on how someone has previously set up the checks, balances, and control system. And then there is the idea of monarchy or the rich and powerful making the decisions for everyone else, the 0.001%.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, our guardrails for democratic decision making breaks down when there is a need for choices, decisions, judgement that has to be made that people do not like.&nbsp; How do we enable better decisions when hard decisions mean you will lose the support of the majority?&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>We do not all agree with vaccines (even before covid), eating meat, climate change, our government or authority.&nbsp; Vaccines in the current global pandemic period are one such tension of divergence.&nbsp; We see this every day in the news feeds; there is an equal and opposite view for every side.&nbsp; Humanity at large lives at Peak Paradox, but we don’t equally value everyone views. Why do we struggle with the idea that individual liberty of choice can be taken away in the interests of everyone?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Climate change is another.&nbsp; Should the government act in the longer term and protect the future or act in the short term persevering liberty and ensure re-election?&nbsp; Protestors with a cause may fight authority and are portrayed as mavericks and disruptors, but history remembers many as pioneers, martyrs and great leaders.&nbsp; Those who protested in the 1960 and 1970s against nuclear energy may look back today and think that they should have been fighting fossil fuels.&nbsp; Such pioneers are optimising for something outside of the normal guardrails. Whilst they appear to be living outside of the accepted guardrails, they can see they should be adopted.</p><p>Our guardrails work well when we can agree on the consequences of risk-informed and responsible decision making; however, in an age when information is untrusted and who is responsible is questioned, we find that we all have different guardrails.&nbsp; Living at Peak Paradox means we have to accept we will never agree on what is a responsible decision and we are likely to see that our iteration of democracy that maintains power and control is going to end in a revolution if we could only agree on what to optimise for.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>

    Are the consequence of a ½ baked decision that we created (the mess we are in)squared <br><p>This article joins how the #climate outcomes we get may be related to the evidence requirements we set.&nbsp; The audience for this viewpoint is those who are thinking about the long term consequences of our current decisions and the evidence we use to support those decisions. We are hoping to bring a sense of clarity to our community on why we feel frustrated and lost. You should read this because it will make you think and it will raise questions we need to debate over coffee as we search to become better versions of ourselves.&nbsp;</p><p>@yaelrozencwajg @yangbo @tonyfish </p><p>The running order is: Which camp are you in for positioning of the crisis: know and accepted, still questioning or denial. &nbsp; What are the early approaches to solutions?&nbsp; What are policymakers doing and what is their perspective.&nbsp; The action is to accept the invitation to debate at the end.</p><br><p>Part 1. Sustainability set up</p><p>The world appears more opinionated and divided about everything.&nbsp; Climate change: real or not.&nbsp; Vaccination for COVID19 conspiracy and control or in the public best interest.&nbsp; Space travel for billionaires or feeding those in need. Universal basic income policy vs ignoring those aspects of society we find uncomfortable. Equality creates a more fair society or leaves us alone. So many votes are for self-interest, “it is fairer to me.”&nbsp; Transparency will hold those in power to account or it will only make or worse. Open networks might create new business models on the web, but will they be sustainable? Sustainability is a false claim or it is our only option. Like books, and publications it is now complexity that is the tool that ensures power remains with the few.</p><p>We need to unpack the conflictual and tension-filled gaps in our beliefs, opinions and judgment because we depend on evidence to change our views. How evidence is presented and the systematic squeezing out of curiosity frames us and our current views.&nbsp;</p><p>Evidence, in this context, is actually a problem as we have a very divided idea of what evidence is.&nbsp; For some, evidence is a social media post from an influencer with 10 million followers (how can everyone else be wrong).&nbsp; For others a headline on the front of a tabloid newspaper is truth (is it printed.)&nbsp; For others, a statistical peer-reviewed leading journal publication that is cited 100 times is evidence.&nbsp; In terms of evidence for decision making, there is a gap between the evidence requirements for research and the evidence requirements for business decisions.&nbsp; To be clear, it is not that either is better; it is how we frame evidence that matters. The danger is being framed to believe something because there is a mismatch in the evidence requirements for a decision.&nbsp; A single 100% influencer claim without statistical proof say about “fertility” vs a statistical trial with probability highlights both how a claim is only a claim but many will not understand what evidence is.</p><p>Why is this important? Because the evidence we see in journals, TV, media, books and publications have different criteria and credentials to those that inform business decisions.&nbsp; Where is the environmental action being decided; in the board rooms!&nbsp; Is this gap in evidence leading to a sustainability gap?</p><p></p><br><p>Part 2. Analysis from Kahan&nbsp;</p><p>Here is the rub, it turns out that how scientific evidence is presented matters as its very presentation creates division.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://law.yale.edu/dan-m-kahan">Dan Kahan</a>, a Yale behavioural economist, has spent the last decade studying whether the use of reason aggravates or reduces “partisan” beliefs. His research papers are <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=45442">here</a>. His research shows that aggravation and alienation easily win, irrespective of being more liberal or conservative. The more we use our faculties for scientific thought, the more likely we will take a strong position that aligns with our (original) political group (or thought).</p><p>A way through this could be to copy “<a href="https://www.solutionsjournalism.org/">solution journalism</a>”, which reports on ways people and governments meaningfully respond to difficult problems and not on what the data says the problem is. Rather than use our best insights, analysis and thinking to reach the version of the “truth”, we use data to find ways to agree with others opinions in our communities. We help everyone to become curious. Tony Fish has created the <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/">Peak Paradox framework</a> as an approach to remaining curious by identifying where we are aligned and where there is a delta in views without conflict.</p><p>When we use data and science in our arguments and explain the problem, the individuals will selectively credit and discredit information in patterns that reflect their commitment to certain values. They (we) (I) assimilate what they (we)(I) want.</p><p>Kahan, in 2014, asked over <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2459057">1,500 respondents</a> whether they agreed or disagreed with the following statement: “There is solid evidence of recent global warming due mostly to human activity such as burning fossil fuels.” They collected information on individuals' political beliefs and rated their science intelligence.” The analysis found that those with the least science intelligence actually have less partisan positions than those with the most. A Conservative with strong science intelligence will use their skills to find evidence against human-caused global warming, while a Liberal will find evidence for it (cognitive bias.)</p><p></p><p>In the chart above, the y-axis represents the probability of a person agreeing that human activity caused climate change. The x-axis represents the percentile a person scored on the scientific knowledge test. The width of the bars shows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval">confidence interval</a> for that probability.</p><br><p>Part 3. Are our policies being formed by the evidence we like or evidence we have?</p><p>Governments, activists, and the media have gotten better at holding corporations accountable for the societal repercussions of their actions. A plethora of groups score businesses based on their ESG&nbsp; performance, and despite often dubious methodology, these rankings are gathering a lot of attention. As a result, ESG has emerged as an unavoidable concern for corporate executives worldwide. ESG should be for boards for “purpose” or “are we doing the right thing” camp, but instead has ended up in the compliance camp, do the min, tick box.</p><p>For decades businesses have addressed sustainability as an end of pipe problem or afterthought. Rather than fundamentally altering their models to recognise that sustainability and wellbeing are critical parts for long term success, boards have typically delegated social issues to corporate social responsibility, compliance policies, or charitable foundations and associations, thus they publish their findings (which is not evidence) in annual reports. The issue becomes that neither investors nor stakeholders read these sustainability reports. Actually, they shouldn’t either.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Although investors' thinking on sustainability has evolved substantially over the past few decades, sustainability and efficiency leaders have used strategies to pressure corporations to advance a wide range of social concerns such as the SDGs across industries and supply chains, regardless of the financial considerations. As ESG assessments, sustainability reports or guidelines have become more rigorous; this accountability raises essential biases. This “pressure” has resulted in many types of actions and raised many concerns, including in the operational efficiencies supposed to reduce the use of energy and natural resources at the expense of their profitability.</p><p>Whilst it is still unclear if most investors utilise ESGs factors in their investment selection process based on evidence, it is clear that we do side with what we want to hear and not with the science, <a href="https://law.yale.edu/dan-m-kahan">Dan Kahan</a>, in part 2 above, was right.</p><br><p>Part 4. Null Hypothesis H(0) A lack of headspace for most people to think about the complexity of these issues due to meeting performance targets means leadership has to make time. And if it does not, we become the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At what point do people care about something bigger than themselves? This means you as a person have the headspace to move from survival towards thriving. (PeakParadox.com)</p><p>If ⅓ of the world don’t know where the next meal today comes from, they will not have the headspace to worry about sustainability.</p><p>If the next additional ⅓ of the world don’t know where the food will come from for tomorrow, they will not have the headspace to worry about sustainability.</p><p>If the next ⅙ of the world will run out of food and money in 4 weeks - worrying about sustainability is not their most significant concern.</p><p>Less than ⅙ of the world can survive and think beyond four weeks - is that enough to make a difference, and are these people in roles that count?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Between than 0.01% and 0.001%&nbsp; (8m and 80m) people should be able to consider global complexity on the basis that they will never have money or food issues (over $1m in assets), but are they acting together and is their voice enough to make a difference?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Is leadership's first priority to ensure that first ⅚ have enough to survive and worry for them, but are they able to manage this conflict?&nbsp; Which group has the headspace to cope with recycling?&nbsp; What is amazing and worthy of note is that the majority of those who care about the environment, sustainability, recycling have created headspace irrespective of their situation. The argument above was designed to frame your thinking, the reality is we don’t create headspace because we are too busy.</p><p>Part 5.&nbsp; The imposter syndrome: followers are not followers</p><p>Politics (leadership), Business (leadership), Quango/ NGO (leadership), individuals (leadership), influencers (leadership) - all have different agendas, and demands for different outcomes as incentives drive in different directions. &nbsp; We lack sustainable leadership that drives in one direction.&nbsp;</p><p>As a Leader and opinion former, the most troubling finding should be that individuals with more “scientific intelligence” are the quickest to align themselves on subjects they don’t know anything about. In one experiment, Kahan analysed how people’s opinions on an unfamiliar subject are affected when given some basic scientific information, along with details about what people in their self-identified political group tend to believe about that subject. It turned out that those with the strongest scientific reasoning skills were most likely to use the information to develop partisan opinions.</p><p>Critically Kahan’s research shows that people that score well on a measure called “scientific curiosity” actually show less partisanship, and it is this aspect we need to use.</p><p>Do we need to move away from “truth”, “facts”, “data”, and “right decisions” if we want to have a board and senior team who can become aligned? We need to present ideas, concepts, how others are finding solutions and make our teams more curious. Being curious appears to be the best way to bring us together — however counterintuitive that is.&nbsp; But to do that, we have to give up on filling time, productivity, efficiency, effectiveness, keeping people busy and giving more people time to escape survival and work together for the better good.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a systematic squeezing out of curiosity in our current system.&nbsp; Are we to blame through schooling and education, and search engines? Have we lost how to be curious if the fact and truth presented to us is one that just aligns to our natural bias or one that challenges us? &nbsp; Do we spend sufficient time with others' views to be able to improve our own?&nbsp; Has individualism and personalisation created and reinforced our self opinions of our own views are correct?&nbsp; Does the advertising model depend on this divide?<br><br></p><p>Part 6. Conclusion, rationality and irrationality&nbsp; <br><br></p><p>There is a clear message to those in leadership; stop using evidence to create division, push people away or sure up your own camp. How do we take (all) evidence in and use it to ask questions which mean we come together for a common purpose?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Politics becomes irrational as we focus more on the individual and less on society and community. Politicians and policy formation need to be voted in, which means they have to mislead and misrepresent their populations who are acting in their own interests: therefore, we find evidence for decisions for short term gain based on individual preferences and not long term community - this is obvious but has to be said.&nbsp; The same is happening in many corporations.</p><p>Anger is often seen as a rational emotion, but that is because we focus on the evidence we want to justify the action. When you feel under-represented, threatened, or in harm's way - the evidence you want will fit the glove. Understanding how the evidence frames us is what brings value to the process.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Part 7. Call to action: The Road to Sustainability webinar series</p><p>We believe we have to communicate better, talk openly, listen to more, debate to appreciate, be curious and find a route to collaborate. The best way is to do something small.&nbsp; Sign up for the sessions below and bring your evidence, but be prepared to take away different evidence so we can make better decisions together.&nbsp;</p><p>The Road to Sustainability is a content and tool platform and initiative launched in October 2020 that started as a weekly email newsletter providing approaches and strategies to plan sustainability and innovation. We are launching the third edition of our webinar series, following up on the successful two previous versions, “From chaos to recovery: gateway to sustainability”.<br><br>This new series will take place every Monday through 5 meetings from October 4th to November 8th, with a possible extension of the plan.<br><br>The following schedule is based on our approach "<a href="https://event.theroadtosustainability.com.">Roadmap and product management - the new framework for sustainability conversations</a>". The sessions have an informative purpose and constitute sets of criteria to help organisations in their operations towards sustainability:</p><p>Please register here: <a href="https://event.theroadtosustainability.com">https://event.theroadtosustainability.com</a>.</p> <br>

<blockquote>"It was hard to write, it should be hard to use" </blockquote><p>The quote above was something a programmer friend of mine used to say in the '90s and, despite all the advances in user experience or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design">UX design</a>, it appears to remain effectively true. Let's look at the experience over this past weekend with the newly rolled out <a href="https://covid-19.ontario.ca/proof-covid-19-vaccination">enhanced vaccine certificate</a> in Ontario.</p><p>Let me preface this by saying that I appreciate that this may be version 1 of a certificate with a QR code and that my comments are intended for an improved version 1.x or 2 of the proof of vaccination. I should also note that CBC has already pointed out that <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/vaccine-certificate-accessibility-1.6213934">Ontario's enhanced vaccine certificate system is not accessible to marginalized people</a>.</p> Downloading the Certificate <p>You will need to go to <a href="https://covid-19.ontario.ca/get-proof/">https://covid-19.ontario.ca/get-proof/</a> and answer the following questions:</p>  How many doses of the COVID-19 vaccine do you currently have? (required)   Did you get all your doses in Ontario? (required)  Select which health card you have (required)  Do you identify as First Nations, Inuit, or Métis? (required) If you are a non-Indigenous partner or household member of someone in this group, select "Yes."  A couple of more clicks (get the certificate through the website or get it by mail or print it at a local library, ServiceOntario location, or call a friend and you will be asked to agree to the <a href="https://covid19.ontariohealth.ca/app-terms">Terms of Service</a> which includes the following:  <blockquote>By inputting your personal information and personal health information into the COVID-19 Vaccination Services you are agreeing to the ministry's collection, use and disclosure of this information for the purpose of researching, investigating, eliminating or reducing the current COVID-19 outbreak and as permitted or required by law in accordance with PHIPA as set out above. You also agree that your information will be made available to the Public Health Unit(s) in Ontario responsible for your geographic area for the same purpose.</blockquote><blockquote>More specifically, by using COVID-19 Vaccination Services, you consent to the ministry collecting identifying information, including personal health information, about you that you submit through the patient verification page so that the Ministry can ensure that it correctly identifies you for the purpose of administering the COVID-19 vaccination program.</blockquote><blockquote>Neither the ministry nor the Public Health Unit(s) in Ontario will further use or disclose your personal information or personal health information except for the purposes set out above.</blockquote><p>When you click on the "Get a copy" button you may be asked to wait because a virtual queue is being used to throttle traffic. When you get through you will be asked to provide information from your health card. I have a green OHIP card with a photo so I get this screen:</p><p>Assuming the information is correct you will be shown your new certificate, including a QR code (more on this later) as a PDF. At this point, it is on you to print out copies of the two-page certificate and carry them with you. I took it upon myself to crop the certificate to include just my name, birth date &amp; the QR code and print it out small enough that I could put it in a laminating pouch and carry it in my wallet. This enables me to go to my wallet, pull out the laminate and my driving license, and have both ready for presentation. For me, that is the simplest and easiest way. Your mileage may vary since my approach requires being comfortable with basic pdf or graphic editing and having access to a printer. I also put electronic copies on my phone so that I could use that option </p> Verifying the certificate <p>Here is what I observed at brunch (shout out to the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Restaurant_Review-g155019-d796688-Reviews-Sunset_Grill-Toronto_Ontario.html">Sunset Grill on the Danforth</a>).</p>  Staff person asks for Proof of Vaccine  Customer digs out their phone or paper copy of the certificate  The staff person looks at it (or uses the Ontario Verify App)  Staff person asks for a government-issued ID  Customer digs out their driver's license  The staff person looks at the ID and verifies the name   We can do better <p>What I oberved is NOT a user-friendly experience for either the customer or the business. For the experience to be improved it needs to be a single presentation operation of either a paper or digital certificate that the business can verify in one step. Here's an example that I mocked up some months ago (the picture is from <a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/">https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/</a>)</p><p>This provides the following functionality:</p>  The existing QR code will return the same (i.e. green checkmark in the event of a good code)  The verifier (staff person) can compare the photo on the card with the person in front of them rather than asking for a government ID.  Digital verification may have the option of showing the verifier the picture on the verify app for increased assurance. Note that the Ministry of Health is already authorized to have pictures for the current health card.   Privacy and Security <p>The advantage of a paper and ID card presentation ritual is that it is difficult to hack. So if we are going to improve the presentation with a single credential as above, privacy and security MUST be protected. This is why a version 1 that is paper/PDF only is not a bad security and privacy choice. On the <a href="https://covid-19.ontario.ca/verify">Verify Ontario </a>app side, both the <a href="https://covid-19.ontario.ca/verify-terms-of-use">terms of use</a> and <a href="https://covid-19.ontario.ca/verify-privacy">privacy statement</a> are reasonably clear (although the choice to use Google Analytics could be questioned) and make the right commitments &nbsp;</p> Recommendations  Provide retailers with a verifier <p>It's nice that the Ontario Verify app is freely downloadable. I used it to check that the laminated cards that I made from my own certificate were readable. But this puts the burden on the retailer and their staff. When I saw someone come in with their QR code, the waitress had to dig out her personal phone and use that. Not a good solution. Either the provincial government or public health should provide retailers with a low to zero cost option to procure their own tablets for use on entry to the store.</p> Provide Ontarians with options <p>For example:</p>  I'm relatively tech-savvy so I'd be happy with a QR code/certificate I could add to a wallet app on my phone for easy display without fumbling around.  ServiceOntario should provide a service to produce laminated wallet cards WITH photos to any Ontarian who shows up at a ServiceOntario site.  On a go-forward basis, ensure that people attending vaccination clinics get printouts of their QR code based certificates WHEN they get vaccinated since the certificate includes the date of vaccination and presumably the QR code won't return a "Green" until the appropriate dated  <p>With all of the above said, I have to say I'm happy that Ontario's first steps for vaccine certificates appear to have respected Ontarians' privacy and look to be built securely. I look forward to the next couple of weeks because I'm sure that security people will be pounding on the service to find flaws. WHEN they find flaws, let's hope that the province is responsive so that we can all benefit. &nbsp;</p>

This is useful if you have a designated account to manage or create meetings, send emails or would like to provide a service for users without an office account to create meetings. This is a follow up post to part one in this series which creates Teams meetings using delegated permissions. </p>

  <a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/09/20/creating-microsoft-teams-meetings-in-asp-net-core-using-microsoft-graph/">Creating Microsoft Teams meetings in ASP.NET Core using Microsoft Graph</a> (delegated)  



<p>Setup Azure App registration</p>



<p>A simple ASP.NET Core application with no authentication was created and implements a form which creates online meetings on behalf of a designated account using Microsoft Graph with application permissions. The Microsoft Graph client uses an Azure App registration for authorization and the client credentials flow is used to authorize the client and get an access token. No user is involved in this flow and the application requires administration permissions in the Azure App registration for Microsoft Graph. </p>



<p>An Azure App registration is setup to authenticate against Azure AD. The ASP.NET Core application will use application permissions for the Microsoft Graph. The listed permissions underneath are required to create the Teams meetings OBO and to send emails to the attendees using the configuration email which has access to office.</p>



<p>Microsoft Graph application permissions:</p>



  User.Read.All  Mail.Send   Mail.ReadWrite   OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite.All  



<p>This is the list of permissions I have activate for this demo. </p>







<p>Configuration</p>



<p>The Azure AD configuration is used to get a new access token for the Microsoft Graph client and to define the email of the account which is used to create Microsoft Teams meetings and also used to send emails to the attendees. This account needs an office account.</p>


  "AzureAd": {
	"TenantId": "5698af84-5720-4ff0-bdc3-9d9195314244",
	"ClientId": "b9be5f88-f629-46b0-ac4c-c5a4354ac192",
	// "ClientSecret": "add secret to the user secrets"
	"MeetingOrganizer": "--your-email-for-sending--"
},
  


<p>Setup Client credentials flow to for Microsoft Graph</p>



<p>A number of different ways can be used to authorize a Microsoft Graph client and is a bit confusing sometimes. Using the DefaultCredential is not really a good idea for Graph because you need to decide if you use a delegated authorization or a application authorization and the DefaultCredential will take the first one which works and this depends on the environment. For application authorization, I use the  ClientSecretCredential Identity to get the service access token. This requires the .default scope and a client secret or a client credential. Using a client secret is fine if you control both client and server and the secret is stored in an Azure Key Vault. A client certificate could also be used.</p>


  private GraphServiceClient GetGraphClient()
{
	string[] scopes = new[] { "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default" };
	var tenantId = _configuration["AzureAd:TenantId"];

	// Values from app registration
	var clientId = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureAd:ClientId");
	var clientSecret = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureAd:ClientSecret");

	var options = new TokenCredentialOptions
	{
		AuthorityHost = AzureAuthorityHosts.AzurePublicCloud
	};

	// https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.identity.clientsecretcredential
	var clientSecretCredential = new ClientSecretCredential(
		tenantId, clientId, clientSecret, options);

	return new GraphServiceClient(clientSecretCredential, scopes);
}
  


<p>The IConfidentialClientApplication interface could also be used to get access tokens which is used to authorize the Graph client. A simple in memory cache is used to store the access token. This token is reused until it expires or the application is restart. If using multiple instances, maybe a distributed cache would be better. The client uses the “<a href="https://graph.microsoft.com/.default&amp;#8221">https://graph.microsoft.com/.default&amp;#8221</a>; scope to get an access token for the Microsoft Graph client. A GraphServiceClient instance is returned with a value access token. </p>


  public class ApiTokenInMemoryClient
{
	private readonly IHttpClientFactory _clientFactory;
	private readonly ILogger&lt;ApiTokenInMemoryClient&gt; _logger;

	private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;
	private readonly IConfidentialClientApplication _app;
	private readonly ConcurrentDictionary&lt;string, AccessTokenItem&gt; _accessTokens = new();

	private class AccessTokenItem
	{
		public string AccessToken { get; set; } = string.Empty;
		public DateTime ExpiresIn { get; set; }
	}

	public ApiTokenInMemoryClient(IHttpClientFactory clientFactory,
		IConfiguration configuration, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)
	{
		_clientFactory = clientFactory;
		_configuration = configuration;
		_logger = loggerFactory.CreateLogger&lt;ApiTokenInMemoryClient&gt;();
		_app = InitConfidentialClientApplication();
	}

	public async Task&lt;GraphServiceClient&gt; GetGraphClient()
	{
		var result = await GetApiToken("default");

		var httpClient = _clientFactory.CreateClient();
		httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", result);
		httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));

		var graphClient = new GraphServiceClient(httpClient)

		};

		return graphClient;
	}

		{
			var accessToken = _accessTokens.GetValueOrDefault(api_name);
			if (accessToken.ExpiresIn &gt; DateTime.UtcNow)
			{
				return accessToken.AccessToken;
			}
			else
			{
				// remove
				_accessTokens.TryRemove(api_name, out _);
			}
		}

		_logger.LogDebug($"GetApiToken new from STS for {api_name}");

		// add
		var newAccessToken = await AcquireTokenSilent();
		_accessTokens.TryAdd(api_name, newAccessToken);

		return newAccessToken.AccessToken;
	}

		var authResult = await _app
			.AcquireTokenForClient(scopes: new[] { "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default" })

			.ExecuteAsync();

		return new AccessTokenItem

			AccessToken = authResult.AccessToken
		};
	}

	private IConfidentialClientApplication InitConfidentialClientApplication()
	{
		return ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder
			.Create(_configuration["AzureAd:ClientId"])
			.WithClientSecret(_configuration["AzureAd:ClientSecret"])
			.Build();
	}
}
  


<p>OnlineMeetings Graph Service</p>



<p>The AadGraphApiApplicationClient service is used to send the Microsoft Graph requests. This uses the graphServiceClient client with the correct access token. The GetUserIdAsync method is used to get the Graph Id using the UPN. This is used in the Users API to run the requests with the application scopes. The Me property is not used as this is for delegated scopes. We have no user in this application. We run the requests as an application on behalf of the designated user.</p>


  public class AadGraphApiApplicationClient
{
	private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

	public AadGraphApiApplicationClient(IConfiguration configuration)
	{
		_configuration = configuration;
	}

	private async Task&lt;string&gt; GetUserIdAsync()
	{
		var meetingOrganizer = _configuration["AzureAd:MeetingOrganizer"];
		var filter = $"startswith(userPrincipalName,'{meetingOrganizer}')";
		var graphServiceClient = GetGraphClient();

		var users = await graphServiceClient.Users
			.Request()
			.Filter(filter)
			.GetAsync();

		return users.CurrentPage[0].Id;
	}

	public async Task SendEmailAsync(Message message)
	{
		var graphServiceClient = GetGraphClient();

		var saveToSentItems = true;

		var userId = await GetUserIdAsync();

		await graphServiceClient.Users[userId]
			.SendMail(message, saveToSentItems)
			.Request()
			.PostAsync();
	}

	public async Task&lt;OnlineMeeting&gt; CreateOnlineMeeting(OnlineMeeting onlineMeeting)
	{
		var graphServiceClient = GetGraphClient();

		var userId = await GetUserIdAsync();

		return await graphServiceClient.Users[userId]
			.OnlineMeetings
			.Request()
			.AddAsync(onlineMeeting);
	}

	public async Task&lt;OnlineMeeting&gt; UpdateOnlineMeeting(OnlineMeeting onlineMeeting)
	{
		var graphServiceClient = GetGraphClient();

		var userId = await GetUserIdAsync();

		return await graphServiceClient.Users[userId]
			.OnlineMeetings[onlineMeeting.Id]
			.Request()
			.UpdateAsync(onlineMeeting);
	}

	public async Task&lt;OnlineMeeting&gt; GetOnlineMeeting(string onlineMeetingId)
	{
		var graphServiceClient = GetGraphClient();

		var userId = await GetUserIdAsync();

		return await graphServiceClient.Users[userId]
			.OnlineMeetings[onlineMeetingId]
			.Request()
			.GetAsync();
	}

	private GraphServiceClient GetGraphClient()
	{
		string[] scopes = new[] { "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default" };
		var tenantId = _configuration["AzureAd:TenantId"];

		// Values from app registration
		var clientId = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureAd:ClientId");
		var clientSecret = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureAd:ClientSecret");

		var options = new TokenCredentialOptions
		{
			AuthorityHost = AzureAuthorityHosts.AzurePublicCloud
		};

		// https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.identity.clientsecretcredential
		var clientSecretCredential = new ClientSecretCredential(
			tenantId, clientId, clientSecret, options);

		return new GraphServiceClient(clientSecretCredential, scopes);
	}
}


  


<p>The startup class adds the services as required. No authentication is added for the ASP.NET Core application.</p>


  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	services.AddScoped&lt;AadGraphApiApplicationClient&gt;();
	services.AddSingleton&lt;ApiTokenInMemoryClient&gt;();
	services.AddScoped&lt;EmailService&gt;();
	services.AddScoped&lt;TeamsService&gt;();
	services.AddHttpClient();
	services.AddOptions();

	services.AddRazorPages();
}
  


<p>Azure Policy configuration</p>



<p>We need to allow applications to access online meetings on behalf of a user with this setup. This is implemented using the following documentation:</p>



<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/cloud-communication-online-meeting-application-access-policy">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/cloud-communication-online-meeting-application-access-policy</a></p>



<p>Testing</p>



<p>When the application is started, you can create a new Teams meeting with the required details. The configuration email must have an account with access to Office and be on the same tenant as the Azure App registration setup for the Microsoft Graph application permissions. The Email must have a policy setup to allow the Microsoft Graph calls. The Teams meeting is organized using the identity that signed in because we used the applications permissions. </p>







<p>This works really well and can be used for Azure B2C solutions as well. If possible, you should only use delegated scopes in the application, if possible. By using application permissions, the ASP.NET Core is implicitly an administrator of these permissions as well. It would be better if user accounts with delegated access was used which are managed by your IT etc. </p>

<p><br>
The <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=worldwide+shipping+crisis">worldwide shipping crisis</a> is bad. Here are some reasons:</p>
 
 “Just in time” manufacturing, shipping, delivery, and logistics. For several decades, the whole supply system has been optimized for “lean” everything. On the whole, no part of it fully comprehends breakdowns outside the scope of immediate upstream or downstream dependencies. 
 The pandemic, which has been depriving nearly every sector of labor, intelligence, leadership, data, and much else, since early last year. 
 Catastrophes. The largest of these was the <a>2021 Suez Canal Obstruction</a>, which has had countless effects upstream and down. 
 Competing narratives. Humans can’t help reducing all complex situations to stories, all of which require protagonists, problems, and movement toward resolution. It’s how our minds are built, and why it’s hard to look more deeply and broadly at any issue and why it’s here. (For more on that, see <a>Where Journalism Fails</a>.) 
 Corruption. This is endemic to every complex economy: construction, <a href="http://j.mp/adbwars">online advertising</a>, high finance, whatever. It happens here too. (And, like incompetence, it tends to worsen in a crisis.) 
 Bureacracies &amp; non-harmonized regulations. More about this below*. 
 Complicating secondary and tertiary effects. The most obvious of these is inflation. Says <a href="https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/supply-chain-breakdown-its-causes-and-effects>">here</a>, “the spot rate for a 40-foot shipping container from Shanghai to Los&nbsp;Angeles rising from about $3,500 last year to $12,500 as of the end of&nbsp;September.” I’ve since heard numbers as high as $50,000. And, of course, inflation also happens for other reasons, which further complicates things. 
 
<p>To wrap one’s head around all of those (and more), it might help to start with Aristotle’s four “causes” (which might also be translated as “explanations”). Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes">illustrates these</a> with a wooden dining table:</p>
 
 Its material cause is wood. 
 Its efficient cause is carpentry. 
 Its final cause is dining. 
 Its formal cause (what gives it form) is design. 
 
<p>Of those, formal cause is what matters most. That’s because, without knowledge of what a table is, it wouldn’t get made.</p>
<p>But the worldwide supply chain (which is less a single chain than braided rivers spreading outward from many sources through countless deltas) is impossible to reduce to any one formal cause. Mining, manufacturing, harvesting, shipping on sea and land, distribution, wholesale and retail sales are all involved, and specialized in their own ways, dependencies withstanding.</p>
<p>I suggest, however, that the most formal of the supply chain problem’s causes is also what’s required to sort out and solve it: digital technology and the Internet. From <a href="https://bit.ly/make_us">What does the Internet make of us?</a>, sourcing the McLuhans:</p>
<blockquote><p>“People don’t want to know the cause of anything”, Marshall said (and Eric quotes, in&nbsp;Media and Formal Cause). “They do not want to know why radio caused Hitler and Gandhi alike. They do not want to know that print caused anything whatever. As users of these media, they wish merely to get inside…”</p></blockquote>
<p>We are all inside a digital environment that is making each of us while also making our systems. This can’t be reversed. But it can be understood, at least to some degree. And that understanding can be applied.</p>
<p>How? Well, Marshall McLuhan—who died in 1980—saw in the rise of computing the retrieval of what he called “perfect memory—total and exact.” (Laws of Media, 1988.) So, wouldn’t it be nice if we could apply that power to the totality of the world’s supply chains,&nbsp;subsuming and transcending the scope and interests of any part, whether those parts be truckers, laws, standards, and the rest—and do it in real time? Global aviation has some of this, but it’s also a much simpler system than the braided rivers between global supply and global demand.</p>
<p>Is there something like that? I don’t yet know. Closest I’ve found is the UN’s <a href="https://www.imo.org/">IMO (International Maritime Organizaiton)</a>, and that only covers “the safety and security of shipping and the&nbsp;prevention of marine and atmospheric pollution&nbsp;by ships.” Not very encompassing, that. If any of ya’ll know more, fill us in.</p>
<p>[*Added 18 October]&nbsp;Just attended a talk by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oswaldkuyler/">Oswald Kuyler</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/international-chamber-icc-leader-for-digital-standards">Managing Director</a>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href="https://iccwbo.org/">International Chamber of Commerce</a>‘s <a href="https://iccwbo.org/media-wall/news-speeches/icc-digital-initiatives-that-will-equip-business-for-the-next-century-of-global-trade/">Digital Standards initiative</a>, on an “Integrated Approach” by his and allied organizations that addresses “digital islands,” “no single view of available standards” both open and closed, “limited investments into training, change management and adoption,” “lack of enabling rules and regulations,” “outdated regulation,” “privacy law barriers,” “trade standard adoption gaps,” “costly technical integration,” “fragmentation” that “prevents paperless trade,” and other factors. Yet he also says the whole thing is “bent but not broken,” and that (says one slide) “trade and supply chain prove more resilient than imagined.”</p>
<p>Another relevant .org is the <a href="https://www.ics-shipping.org/">International Chamber of Shipping</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, Heather Cox Richardson (whose <a href="https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/">newsletter</a> I highly recommend) <a href="https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/october-13-2021">yesterday</a> summarized what the Biden administration is trying to do about all this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Biden also announced today a deal among a number of different players to try to relieve the&nbsp;supply chain slowdowns that have built up as people turned to online shopping during the&nbsp;pandemic. Those slowdowns threaten the delivery of packages for the holidays, and Biden has&nbsp;pulled together government officials, labor unions, and company ownership to solve the&nbsp;backup.</p>
<p>The Port of Los Angeles, which handles 40% of the container traffic coming into the U.S., has&nbsp;had container ships stuck offshore for weeks. In June, Biden put together a Supply Chain&nbsp;Disruption Task Force, which has hammered out a deal. The port is going to begin operating&nbsp;around the clock, seven days a week. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union has&nbsp;agreed to fill extra shifts. And major retailers, including Walmart, FedEx, UPS, Samsung,&nbsp;Home Depot, and Target, have agreed to move quickly to clear their goods out of the dock&nbsp;areas, speeding up operations to do it and committing to putting teams to work extra hours.</p>
<p>“The supply chain is essentially in the hands of the private sector,” a White House official told&nbsp;Donna Littlejohn of the&nbsp;Los Angeles Daily News, “so we need the private sector…to help solve&nbsp;these problems.” But Biden has brokered a deal among the different stakeholders to end what&nbsp;was becoming a crisis.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hopefully helpful, but not sufficient.</p>

  <br>For the past 50 years, most business leaders in free market-based economies have been taught or trained in a core ideology; "that the purpose of business is to serve only the shareholder". The source was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman">#MiltonFriedman</a>. Whilst shareholder primacy is simple and allows businesses to optimise for one thing, which has an advantage in terms of decision making, it has also created significant damage. It does not stand up to modern critique and challenges such as ESG. Importantly there is an assumption that a shareholder group was a united and unified collective. <br> There is an assumption: shareholders are united and unified  <br>The reality is that in a public or investor-led company, the shareholders are as diverse in terms of vision, rationale, purpose and expectation as any standard group of associated parties. Shareholders as a group rarely have an entirely homogeneous objective. Given the dominance of shareholder primacy, how do we know this concept of non-homogeneous actors is genuine. Because there are conflicts among shareholders, which is so large, it constitutes a topic of high practical relevance for academic interest. Two areas dominate research in this area, board performance and board dynamics. Particular attention has been given to conflict that arises when ownership is shared between a dominant, controlling shareholder and minority shareholders. <br><br><br><br><br>The majority and dominant shareholders have incentives to pursue personal goals through the business as they disproportionately gain the benefits but do not fully bear the economic risks and can misuse their power to exploit minority shareholders. That is, the majority shareholder may push management and the board to pursue objectives that align with their own priorities but that are detrimental for the minority shareholder. Studies have shown that such conflicts negatively affect a firm's performance, valuation, and innovation. In listed companies, market regulators, using minority protection clauses, try to avoid this abuse of power, but in private equity markets, there is no regulator to prevent this conflict.<br><br>Surprisingly, however, far less research has examined whether and how different types of shareholders (even stakeholders) can complement each other so that mutual benefits arise. <br><br>In a recent study examining shareholder relationships in privately held firms, the outcomes of private equity investments in privately held family businesses were compared. This research hypothesis was to test if the objectives of professional investors and family owners differ. PE investors focus on maximising financial returns through a medium-term exit and generally have lower levels of risk aversion. Family shareholders, in contrast, generally have most of their wealth concentrated in a single firm, hold longer time horizons, and are often particularly concerned about non-economic benefits the firm brings to the family (e.g., reputation in the community). What is clear is that the reason to trade and have a purpose is critical for any alignment to emerge. <br><br>We know that boards and management need to be informed and review shareholders' objectives. Shareholders need to be informed and review the extent to which they are still aligned in terms of time horizons, risk preferences, need for cash, prioritising financial goals, and whether control or dominance of an agenda is constructive or destructive. Which is the segway to the Peak Paradox mapping above. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The fundamental issue is that we <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/plotting-how-to-make-better-decisions">cannot make decisions at Peak Paradox</a> and have to move towards a Peak to determine what we are optimising for. For shareholders who optimise for Peak Individual Purpose will want to use a dominant position or minority protection to force an agenda to their own goals. A high performing board, perceived, will optimise towards Peak Work Purpose. This included commercial and noncommercial, where commercial boards will optimise for a single objective such as shareholder primacy. What becomes evident at this point is the question about diversity. Dominant shareholders can create environments where the lack of diversity or thinking, experience, motivation, purpose and incentives serves them and their objectives. This will also be seen as a board that does not ask questions, cannot deal with conflict and avoids tension. Finally, if we move towards optimising for a better society (Peak Social Purpose), we find that we move towards serving stakeholders. <br><br> Will society be better off because this business exists? <br>The critical point here is that stakeholders cannot live with Peak Paradox's decision-making and have to find something to optimise for and align to. This will not be a three or five-year plan but a reason for the business to exist. At Peak Paradox, the most important questions get asked, such as "Will society be better off because this business exists?" Because the same data should present a yes and no answer, and the board needs to justify why it believes it should.

<p>History</p>



<p>2021-10-31 Updated phishing section after feedback.</p>



<p>SSI (Self Sovereign Identity) is very new and a lot of its challenges will hopefully get solved and help to  improve identity management solutions.</p>



<p>Some definitions:</p>



  Digital Identity: This is the ID which represents a user, for example an E-ID issued by the state, this could be a certificate, hardware key, verifiable credential etc.  Identity: This is the user + application trying to access something which usually needs to be authenticated when using a protected user interactive resource.  Authentication: verifying the “Identity” i.e. application + user for user interactive flows.  Authorization: verify that the request presents the required credentials, specifying access rights/privileges to resources. This could mean no verification of who or what sent the request, although this can be built in with every request if required. Solutions exist for this in existing systems.  



<p>The following diagram from the Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0 <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">specification</a> shows a good overview of verifiable credentials with issuers, holders and verifiers. The holder is usually represented through a wallet application which can be any application type, not just mobile applications.</p>







<p>Level of security for user interaction authentication with SSI</p>



<p>Authentication using SSI credentials would have to same level of security as the authenticator apps which you have for existing systems. This is not as safe as using FIDO2 in your authentication process as FIDO2 is the only solution which protects against phishing. The SSI Authentication is also only as good as the fallback process, so if the fallback process, recovery process allows a username or password login, then the level would be passwords. </p>







<p>See this post for more details: </p>



<p><a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/03/17/the-authentication-pyramid/">The authentication pyramid</a></p>



<p>Authentication Issuer</p>



<p>The authentication process is not any better than previous systems, every issuer needs to do this properly. Trust quality of the issuer depends on this. If a verifier wants to use verifiable credentials from a certain issuer, then a trust must exist between the verifier and the issuer. If the issuer of the credentials makes mistakes or does this in a bad way, then the verifier has this problem as well. It is really important that the credential issuer authenticates correctly and only issues credentials to correctly authenticated identities. </p>



<p>SIOP (Self-Issued OpenID Provider) provides one solution for this. With this solution, every issuer requires its own specific IDP (identity provider) clients and OIDC (OpenID Connect) profiles for the credentials which are issued.</p>



<p>When a credential issuer has a data leak or a possible security bug, maybe all credentials issued from this issuer would need to be revoked. This might mean that all data in any verifier applications created from this issuer also needs to be revoked or deleted. This is worse than before where we have many isolated systems. With SSI, we have a chain of trust. A super disaster would be if a government which issues verifiable credentials had to revoke credentials due to a security leak or security bug, then all data, processes created from this would have to evaluate and process the data again, worse case delete and require new proofs.</p>



<p>Authentication/Authorization Verifier</p>



<p>Every verifier application/process has a responsibility for it’s own authorization and the quality of its verification. Depending on what the verifier needs to do, a decision on the required verifiable credentials needs to be taken. A verifier must decide, if it needs only to authorize the verifiable credential it receives from the wallet application, or if it needs to authenticate the digital identity used in the subject of the verifiable credential. If you only authorize a verifiable credential when you should be authenticating the digital identity used in the verifiable credential, this will probably result in false identities in the verifier application or processes run for the wrong user.  Once the verifiable credential is accepted as trustworthy, an identity could be created from the verifiable credential and the digital identity if contained in the subject. </p>



<p>Some solutions move the authentication of the digital identity to the wallet and the verifiers accept verifiable credentials from the wallet without authentication of the digital identity. This would mean that the wallet requires specific authentication steps and restrictions. Another solution would be to use a certificate which is attached to the digital identity for authentication on the verifier and on the wallet. SIOP and OpenID Connect would also provide a solution to this.</p>



<p>Access to Wallets, Authentication &amp; Authorization of the holder of the Wallet</p>



<p>One of the biggest problems is to manage and define what verifiable credentials can be loaded into a wallet. Wallets also need to possibility to import and export backups and also share credentials with other wallets using DIDComm or something like this. Enterprise wallets will be used by many different people. This means that solutions which fix the identity to a specific wallet will not work if shared wallets or backups are to be supported. Wallets would also need to support or load verifiable credentials for other people who are not able to do this themselves or do not have access to a wallet. With these requirements it is very hard to prove that a verifiable credential belongs to the person using the wallet. Extra authentication is required on the wallet and also the issuers and the verifier applications cannot know that the credential issued to wallet x, really belongs to person x, which is the subject of the verifiable credential. Extra authentication would be required. Solutions with certificates, or wallet authentication can help solve this but no one solution will fit all solutions. </p>



<p>If a relationship between the person using the wallet, the credentials in the wallet and how the verifiers use and trust the credentials is managed badly, many security problems will exist. People are people and will lose wallets, share wallets when they should not and so on. This needs to be planned for and the issuer of verifiable credentials and the verifier of these credentials need to solve this correctly. This would probably mean when using verifiable credentials from a wallet, the issuer application and the verifier application would need to authenticate the user as well as the credentials being used. Depending on the use case, the verifier would not always need to do this.</p>



<p>Interoperability between providers  &amp; SSI solutions</p>



<p>At present it is not possible to use any wallet with any SSI solution. Each solution is locked to its own wallet. Some solutions provide a way of exporting verifiable credentials and importing this again in a different vendor wallet but not using wallet vendor 1 together solution vendor 2. Solutions are also not supporting the same specifications, standards. Each implementation I tried supports different standards and have vendor specific solutions which are not compatible to other vendors. </p>



<p>I have a separate wallet installed now for each solution I tried. It cannot be expected that users install many different wallets to use SSI. Also, if a government issues a verifiable credential with a certain wallet, it would be really bad if all verifiers and further credential issuers must use the same wallet. </p>



<p>With JSON-LD and BBS+, the APIs between the wallets and the SSI services should work together but vendor specific details seem to be used in the payloads. If SSI is to work, I believe any wallet which conforms to a standard x must work with any SSI service. Or the services, vendor implementations needs a common standard for issuing and verifying credentials with wallets and the agents used in the wallets. Some type of certification process would probably help here.</p>



<p>Phishing</p>



<p>Users authenticating on HTTPS websites using verifiable credentials stored on your wallet are still vulnerable to phishing attacks. This can be improved by using FIDO2 as a second factor to the SSI authentication. The DIDComm communication between agents has strong protection against phishing.</p>



<p>Self sovereign identity phishing scenario using HTTPS websites:</p>



  User opens a phishing website in the browser using HTTPS and clicks the fake sign-in  Phishing service starts a correct SSI sign-in on the real website using HTTPS and gets presented with a QR Code and the start link for a digital wallet to complete.  Phishing service presents this back on the phishing website to the victim on the phishing website.  Victim scans the QR Code using the digital wallet and completes the authentication using the agent in the digital wallet, DIDComm etc.  When the victim completes the sign-in using the out of band digital wallet and agent, the HTTPS website being used by the attacker gets updated with the session of the victim.  



<p>This can only be prevented by using the browser client-side origin as part of the flow, signing this and returning this back to the server to be validated, thus preventing this type of phishing attack. This cannot be prevented unless the origin from the client browser is used and validated in the authentication process. The browser client-side origin is not used in the SSI login.</p>



<p>PII databases will still be created</p>



<p>Credential Issuers require PII data to create a verifiable credentials. This data is persisted and can be leaked like we see every day on the internet. Due to costs/laws/charges, verifiers will also copy credentials and create central PII databases as well. The applications doing verifications also will save data to a local database. For example, if an insurance company uses verifiable credentials to create a new account, it will save the data from the verifiable credential to a local database as this is required for its requirements. This will have the PII data as well. So even with SSI solutions we will still share and have many databases of PII data. </p>



<p>If BBS+ ZKP is used which does not share the data with the verifier, just a verification, this is a big improvement compared to existing solutions. At the time of testing, this is not supported yet with any of the solutions I tried, but the specifications exist. Most solutions only support selective or compound proofs. If the verifier does not save this data, then SSI has added a big plus compared to existing solutions. A use case for this would be requesting a government document which only requires proof of the digital identity and this can be issued then without storing extra PII data or requiring a shared IDP with the digital identity issuer.</p>



<p>Complexity of the Self Sovereign Identity</p>



<p>I find the complexity when implementing SSI solutions still very high. Implementation of a basic issue credential, verify credential process requires many steps. Dev environments also require some type of callback, webhooks. ngrok solves this good but this is different after each start and needs to be re-configured regularly, which then requires new presentation templates which adds extra costs and so on. If integrating this in DevOps processes with integration testing or system testing, this would become more complex. Due to the overall complexity to set this up and implement this, developers will make mistakes and this results in higher costs. IDP or PKI solutions are easier to implement in a secure way.</p>



<p>Trust</p>



<p>When using the provided solutions, some of these systems are closed source and you have no idea how the solutions manage their data, or handle the secrets in their infrastructure, or how the code is implemented (closed source). For some solutions, I had to share my OpenID Connect client secret for a flow to complete the SSI SIOP credential issuer flow. This was persisted somewhere on the platform which does not feel good. You also don’t know who they share their secrets with and the company provider has different law requirements depending on your country of origin. Implementing a “full” SSI solution does not seem like a good option for most use cases. Open source software improves this trust at least but is not the only factor.</p>



<p>Notes:</p>



<p>I would love feedback on this and will correct, change anything which is incorrect or you believe I should add something extra. These challenges are based on my experiences implementing the solutions and reading the specifications. I really look forward to the new SSI world and how this develops. I think SSI is cool, but people need to know when and how to use it and it is not the silver bullet to identity but does add some super cool new possibilities.</p>

  <p>Today’s <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Main_Page">Project VRM</a> meeting marks
the project’s 15 years anniversary. A good opportunity to list the uses cases that have
emerged over the years. To make them more manageable, I categorize them by the stage of
the relationship between customer and vendor:</p>
 Category 1: Establishing the relationship 
<p>What happens when a Customer or a Vendor wishes to initiate a relationship, or wishes to modify the
terms of the relationship.</p>
 1.1 Customer initiates a new relationship with a Vendor 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to offer initiating a new relationship with a Vendor.”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 The Customer encounters the Vendor’s electronic presence (e.g. their website) 
 The Customer performs a gesture on the Vendor’s site that indicates their interest of establishing
a relationship 
 As part of the gesture, the Customer’s proposed terms are conveyed to the Vendor 
 In response, the Vendor provides acceptance of the proposed relationship and offered terms,
or offers alternate terms in return. 
 If the offered terms are different from the proposed terms, the Customer has the opportunity
to propose alternate terms; this continues until both parties agree on the terms or
abort the initiation. 
 Once the terms have been agreed on, both sides record their agreement. 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 To make this “consumer-grade”, much of the complexity of such concepts as
“proposed terms” needs to be hidden behind reasonable defaults. 
 
 1.2 Vendor initiates a new relationship with a Customer 
<p>“As a Vendor, I want to offer initiating a new relationship with a Customer.”</p>
<p>Similar as for “Customer initiates a new relationship with a Vendor”, but with reversed roles.</p>
 1.3 Customer and Vendor agree on a closer relationship 
<p>“The Customer and the Vendor agree on a closer relationship.”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 The Customer and the Vendor have been in a relationship governed by certain terms for some time. 
 Now, either the Customer or the Vendor propose new terms to the other party, and the other party
accepts. 
 The new terms permit all activities permitted by the old terms, plus some additional
ones. 
 
<p>Example:</p>
 
 The Customer has agreed with the Vendor that the Vendor may send the Customer product updates once a month.
For that purpose, the Customer has provided Vendor an e-mail address (but no physical address). 
 Now, the Customer has decided to purchase a product from Vendor. To ship it, the Vendor needs to have
the Customer’s shipping address. New terms that also include the shipping address are being
negotiated. 
 
 1.4 A Customer wants a more distant relationship 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to limit the Vendor to more restrictive terms.”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 The Customer and the Vendor have been in a relationship governed by certain terms for some time. 
 Now, the Customer wishes to disallow certain activities previously allowed by the terms, without
terminating the relationship. 
 The Customer offers new terms, which the Vendor may or may not accept. The Vendor may offer alternate
terms in turn. This negotiation continues until either mutually acceptable terms are
found, or the relationship terminates. 
 
<p>Examples:</p>
 
 The Customer has agreed with the Vendor that the Vendor may send the Customer product updates. Now the Customer
decides that they do not wish to receive product updates more frequently than once
a quarter. 
 The Customer has agreed to behavioral profiling when visiting Vendor’s website. Now, while the Customer
still wishes to use the website, they do no longer consent to the behavioral profiling. 
 
 2. Category: Ongoing relationship 
<p>What happens during a relationship after it has been established and while no
party has the intention of either modifying the strength of, or even leaving
the relationship.</p>
 2.1 Intentcasting 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to publish, to a selection of Vendors that I trust, that I wish to purchase a
product with description X”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Convenience for Customer 
 Potential for a non-standard deal (e.g. I am a well-known influencer, and the seller
makes Customer a special deal) 
 
<p>Features:</p>
 
 It’s basically a shopping list
 
 free-form text 
 plus “terms” (FIXME: open issue) 
 
 
 Retailers can populate product alternatives for each item in the list
 
 might simply be a search at the retailer site 
 but terms need to be computable 
 
 
 
<p>Issues:</p>
 
 what if a retailer lies and spams with unrelated products, or unavailable products? 
 
 2.2 Automated intentcasting on my behalf 
<p>“As a Customer, I want an ‘AI’ running on my behalf to issue Intentcasts when it is in my interest”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 This is similar to functionality deployed by some retailers today: “We noticed you have
not bought diapers in the last 30 days. Aren’t you about to run low? Here are some offers”.
But this functionality runs on my behalf, and takes data from all sorts of places into
account. 
 
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Convenience, time savings 
 
 2.3 Contextual product reviews and ratings 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to see reviews and ratings of the product and seller alternatives for any
of my shopping list items.”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Same as product reviews in silos, but without the silos: have access to more reviews
and ratings by more people 
 Seller alternatives give Customer more choice 
 
 2.4 Filter offers by interest 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to receive offers that match my implicitly declared interest”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 In Intentcasting, I actively publish my intent to meet a need I know I have by
purchasing a product 
 This is about offers in response to needs, or benefits, that I have not explicitly
declared but that can be inferred. Example: if I have purchased a laser printer
6 months ago, and I have not purchased replacement toner cartridges nor have I declared
an intent to purchase some, I would appreciate offers for such toner cartridges (but
not of inkjet cartridges) 
 
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Convenience for Customer 
 Better response rate for Vendor 
 
 2.5 Full contact record 
<p>“As a Customer, I want a full record of all interactions between Customer and each Vendor accessible in a single place.”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 Trackability 
 Similar to CRM 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 This should cover all modes of communication, from e-mail to trouble tickets,
voice calls and home visits. 
 
 2.6 Manage trusted Vendor’s in a single place 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to see and manage my list of trusted Vendors in a single place”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity 
 Transparency (to Customer) 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 Probably should also have a non-trusted Vendor’s: so my banned vendors are maintained
in the same place — which subset is being displayed is just a filter function 
 Probably should have a list of all Vendor’s ever interacted with 
 
 2.7 Notify of changes about products I’m interested in 
<p>“As a Customer, I want be notified of important changes (e.g. price) in products that I’m interested in.”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 can use my shopping cart as a “price watch list” and purchase when I think the
price is right 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 This should apply to items in my shopping cart, but also items in product lists that
I might have created (“save for later” lists) 
 
 2.8 Personal wallet 
<p>“As a Customer, I want my own wallet that I can use with any Vendor”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 Unified billing 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 Unified ceremony 
 Should be able to delegate to the payment network of my choice 
 
 2.9 Preventative maintenance 
<p>“As a Customer, I would like to be notified of my options when a product I own needs maintenance”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 If I have a water heater, and it is about to fail, I would like to be notified that
it is about to fail, with offers for what to do about it. It’s a kind of
<a>intentcasting</a>
but the intent is inferred from the fact that I own the product, the product is about
to fail, that I don’t want it to fail and I am willing to entertain offers from
the vendor I bought it from and others. 
 
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Convenience for Customer 
 No service interruption 
 
 2.10 Product clouds 
<p>“Each product instance has its own cloud”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Collects information over the lifetime of the product instance 
 Product instance-specific 
 Can change ownership with the product 
 Does not disappear with the vendor 
 
<p>Example:</p>
 
 My water heater has its own cloud. It knows usage, and maintenance events.
It continues to work even if the vendor of the water heater goes out of business. 
 
 2.11 Product info in context 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to access product documentation, available instruction manuals etc in the
context of the purchase that I made”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 Updated documentation, new materials etc show up automatically 
 
 2.12 Set and monitor terms for relationships 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to set terms for my relationship with a Vendor in a single place”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 Privacy &amp; Agency 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 Originally this was only about terms for provided personal data, but it appears
this is a broader issue: I also want to set terms for, say, dispute resolution
(“I never consent to arbitration”) or customer support (“must agree to never let
Customer wait on the phone for more than 30min”) 
 
 2.13 Update information in a single place only 
<p>“As a Customer, I (only) want to update my personal contact information in one place that I control”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 for Customer: convenience 
 for Vendor: more accurate information 
 
<p>Issues:</p>
 
 Should that be a copy and update-copy process (push), or a copy and update-on-need
process (pull with copy) or a fetch-and-discard process (pull without copy)? 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 Originally phrased as only about contact info (name, married name, shipping address,
phone number etc) this probably applies to other types of information was well, such
as, say, credit card numbers, loyalty club memberships, even dietary preferences or
interests (“I gave up stamp collecting”) 
 
 2.14 Single shopping cart 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to use a single shopping cart for all e-commerce sites on the web.”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 I don’t need to create accounts on many websites, or login into many websites 
 I decide when the collection of items in the cart expires and I don’t lose work 
 It makes it easier for Customer to shop at more sites, and I can more easily buy from the long tail of sites 
 
<p>Features:</p>
 
 It shows product and seller 
 It may show alternate sellers and difference in terms (e.g. price, shipping, speed) 
 We may also want to have product lists that aren’t a shopping cart (“save for later”
lists) 
 
 2.15 Unified communications/notifications preferences 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to manage my communication/notification preferences with all Vendors
in a single place”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 In a single place, and in a single manner. I should not have to do things differently
to unsubscribe from the product newsletter of vendors X and Y. 
 
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 
 2.16 Unified product feedback 
<p>“As a Customer, I want a uniform way to submit (positive and negative) product feedback (and
receive responses) with any Vendor”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 Trackability 
 Similar to CRM 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 Should be easy to do this either privately or publicly 
 
 2.17 Unified purchase history 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to have a record of all my product purchases in a single place”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 If I wish to re-order a product I purchased before, I can easily find it and the
vendor that I got it from 
 
 2.18 Unified subscriptions management 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to manage all my ongoing product subscriptions in a single place”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 Expense management 
 
<p>Note:</p>
 
 This is implied by the source, not explicitly mentioned. 
 
<p>Future:</p>
 
 Opens up possibilities for subscription bundle business models 
 
 2.19 Unified support experience 
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 Trackability 
 Similar to CRM 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 Should be multi-modal: trouble tickets, chat, e-mail, voice etc 
 
 3. Category: Beyond binary relationships 
<p>Use cases that involve more than one Customer, or more than one Vendor, or both.</p>
 3.1 Proven capabilities 
<p>“As a Vendor, I want to give another party (Customer or Vendor) the capabilities to perform certain operations”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 This is SSI Object Capabilities 
 Example: I want to give my customer the ability to open a locker 
 The scenario should be robust with respect to confidentiality and accuracy. 
 
 3.2 Silo-free product reviews 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to publish my reviews and ratings about products I own so they can be
used by any other Customer at any point of purchase”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Same as product reviews in silos, but without the silos: broader distribution of
my review for more benefit by more people 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 Rephrased from “express genuine loyalty” 
 
 3.3 Monitoring of terms violation 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to be notified if other Customer’s interacting with a Vendor report a violation of their terms”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 I have a relationship with a Vendor, and we have agreed to certain terms. If the Vendor breaks
those terms, and other Customer’s in a similar relationship with the Vendor notice that, I want
to be notified. 
 
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Trust, security, safety 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 This can of course be abused through fake reports, so suitable measures must be taken. 
 
 3.4 Unified health and wellness records 
<p>“As a Customer, I want my health and wellness records from all sources to be aggregated in a
place that I control.”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Survives disappearance of the vendor 
 Privacy 
 Allows cross-data-source personal analytics and insights 
 Integration across healthcare (regulated industry) and wellness (consumer) 
 
 3.5 Verified credentials 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to be able to tell Vendor 1 that Vendor 2 makes a claim about Customer.”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 This is the SSI verified credential use case 
 Example: I want to tell a potential employer that I have earned a certain degress
from a certain institution 
 The scenario should be robust with respect to confidentiality and accuracy. 
 
 4. Category: Ending the relationship 
<p>What happens when one of the parties wishes to end the relationship.</p>
 4.1 Banning the vendor 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to permanently ban a Vendor from doing business with Customer ever again.”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 This form of ending the relationship means that I don’t want to be told of offers
or responses to Intentcasts etc. by this vendor ever again. 
 
 4.2 Disassociating from the vendor 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to stop interacting with a vendor at this time but I am open to
future interactions.”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 This probably means that data sharing and other interaction reset to the level of
how it was before the relationship was established. However, the Customer and the Vendor do not
need to go through the technical introduction ceremony again when the relationship
is revived. 
 
 4.3 Firing the customer 
<p>“As a Vendor, I want to stop interacting with a particular Customer.”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 For customers (or non-customers) that the Vendor does not wish to serve (e.g. because of
excessive support requests), the VendorVendor may unilaterally terminate the relationship with
the Customer.

   Mark Zuckerberg recently dedicated a
long interview
to the subject, so the metaverse must be a thing. Promptly, the
chatter is exploding. Personally
I believe the metaverse is currently underhyped: it will be A Really Big Thing,
for consumers, and for businesses, and in particular for commerce and
collaboration, far beyond what we can grasp in video games and the likes today.

  <p>Mark Zuckerberg recently dedicated a
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview">long interview</a>
to the subject, so the metaverse must be a thing. Promptly, the
<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=metaverse">chatter</a> is exploding. Personally
I believe the metaverse is currently underhyped: it will be A Really Big Thing,
for consumers, and for businesses, and in particular for commerce and
collaboration, far beyond what we can grasp in video games and the likes today.</p>
<p>So what is it, this metaverse thing? I want to share my definition, because I
think it is simple, and useful.</p>
<p>It’s best expressed in a two-by-two table:</p>

 
  
  
   How you access it:
   <br>
   physically vs. virtually
 
 
  
   Where it is:
   <br>
   in physical or virtual space
  
  
   The virtual world, accessed physically:
   <br>
   Augmented Reality
  
  
   The virtual world, accessed virtually:
   <br>
   today's internet and future virtual worlds
  
 
 
  
   The physical world, accessed physically:
   <br>
   our ancestors exclusively lived here
  
  
   The physical world, accessed virtually:
   <br>
   the Internet of Things
  
 

<p>By way of explanation:</p>
 
 
<p>There is physical space – the physical world around us – and
virtual space, the space of pure information, that only exists on computers.</p>
 
 
<p>Our ancestors, and we so far, have mostly been interacting with physical space
by touching it physically.
But in recent decades, we have learned to access it from the information
sphere, and that’s usually described as the Internet of Things:
if you run an app to control your lights, or open your garage door, that’s
what I’m talking about.</p>
 
 
<p>So far, we have mostly interacted with virtual space through special-purpose
devices that form the gateway to the virtual space: first computers,
now phones and in the future: headsets. I call this accessing virtual space
virtually.</p>
 
 
<p>And when we don our smart glasses, and wave our arms, we interact with
virtual space from physical space, which is the last quadrant.</p>
 
 
<p>In my definition, those four quadrants together form the metaverse:
the metaverse is a superset of both meatspace and cyberspace, so to speak.</p>
<p>This definition has been quite helpful for me to understand what various
projects are working on.</p>

    What are we asking the questions for? <p>This <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/archive">link gives you access to all the articles and archives</a> for &lt;/Hello CDO&gt;</p><p>This article unpacks questions and framing as I tend to focus on the conflicts, tensions, and compromises that face any CDO in the first 100 days — ranging from the effects of a poor job description to how a company’s culture means that data-led decisions are not decisions.</p><br><br><p></p><p><br></p><p>I love this <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/dana_kanze_the_real_reason_female_entrepreneurs_get_less_funding">TED talk</a> from <a href="https://www.london.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-profiles/d/dana-kanze">Dana Kanze</a> at LSE.&nbsp; Dana’s talk builds on the research of <a href="https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/529/HIGGINSADVANCES_1998REG_FOC_.pdf">Tory Higgins</a> who is credited with creating the social theory “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_focus_theory">Regulatory Focus</a>”&nbsp; This is a good <a href="https://psychology.wikia.org/wiki/Regulatory_Focus_Theory">summary</a> if you have not run into it before.</p><p>Essentially the idea behind “Regulatory Focus” is to explore motivations and routes to getting the outcome you want. The context in this article is to explore how a framed approach to questions creates biased outcomes. One framing in Regulatory Focus centres on a “Promotion Focus” which looks for “gain” which can be translated as finding or seeking hope, advancement and accomplishment.&nbsp; The counter is a prevention focus that centres on losses that looks to find safety, responsibility and security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In Dana’s research, which is the basis for her talk about why women get less venture funding, she categorises “Promotion” questions as ones that will ask the following questions as they seek to focus on GAIN. When talking about: customers seeks data about acquisition, income looking for data to confirm sales, Market seeking to understand the size,&nbsp; Balance Sheet will want to know data on assets, projections should focus on growth and questions on strategy will want to understand the vision.&nbsp;</p><p>Dana’s research shows that “Prevention” questions will be framed as LOSSES, therefore a focus on customers would seek data on retention, income questions look for data on margin, market questions would focus on shape, balance sheet questions will centre on liability, projection data wants to confirm stability, and strategy to ensure execution capability.</p><p>Whilst Dana has collected this data as part of a noble and useful study on why women get less funding from venture capital, investors tend to bias and ask women prevention questions with a framing away from gain towards losses and downside risk.&nbsp; However, we should reflect on this data and research for a little longer.</p><p>Does your executive team tend to focus on promotion or prevention questions? &nbsp;Do different executive roles tend to frame their questions based on gain (upside) or loss prevention (risk)?&nbsp; Is the person leading the questions critical to the decision-making unit and will their questions frame promotion or prevention for the company.&nbsp; Whilst a rounded team should ask both, do they?</p><p>As the CDO, our role is to find “all data.” and not data to fit a question. Data that shows your company's approach to how they frame questions for Prevention or Promotion is just data,&nbsp; but this data will help you as a team make better decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>A specific challenge in the first 100 days is to determine what questions we, as a leadership team, ask ourselves and how our framing is biasing our choices and decisions.&nbsp; We are unlikely to like this data and how power aligns with those who prevent or promote a proposal or recommendation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Based on listening to questions and those in communications, I have been building an ontology of questions and been categorising them for a while now.&nbsp; I am interested both in the absolute bias, the bias to people, the bias to project types and also how bais changes depending on who is leading the project and questions.&nbsp; Based on a sample size that is not statistical, I believe that Dana’s work has far wider implications than just venture funding.&nbsp;</p><p>---</p><p>Whilst our ongoing agile iteration into <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-occurs-when-physical-beings-transition-to-information-beings-146ea9dcbca3">information beings</a> is never-ending, there are the first 100 days in the new role. But what to focus on? Well, that rose-tinted period of conflicting priorities is what <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/">&lt;/Hello, CDO!&gt;</a> is all about. Maintaining sanity when all else has been lost to untested data assumptions is a different problem entirely.</p>

<p>The latest version of the â€œOAuth 2.0 Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession at the Application Layer (DPoP)â€ specification adds an option for servers to supply a nonce value to be included in the DPoP proof.  Both authorization servers and resource servers can provide nonce values to clients.</p>
<p>As described in the updated Security Considerations, the nonce prevents a malicious party in control of the client (who might be a legitimate end-user) from pre-generating DPoP proofs to be used in the future and exfiltrating them to a machine without the DPoP private key.  When server-provided nonces are used, actual possession of the proof-of-possession key is being demonstrated — not just possession of a DPoP proof.</p>

  <p>Summary: Interoperability is a fundamental property of tech systems that are generative and respect individual privacy and autonomy. And, as a bonus, it makes people's live easier!</p>





<p>
    I traveled to Munich for European Identity Conference several weeks ago—my first international trip since before the pandemic. Post-pandemic travel can be confusing, international travel even more so. To get into Germany, I needed to prove I had been vaccinated. To get back in the US, I had to show evidence of a negative Covid-19 test conducted no more than three days prior to my arrival in the US. Figuring out how to present these, which forms to fill out, and who cared led to a bit of stress. 
</p>

<p>
    Once in Munich, venturing out of the hotel had its own surprises. Germany, or maybe just Munich, has implemented a contract tracing system. Apparently there's one or more apps you can use, but I had a tough time figuring that out. Restaurants were spotty in their demands and enforcement. After showing them my US vaccination card, one small place just threw up their hands and said "just come in and eat!"
</p>

<p>
    You'd think all this would have been a perfect opportunity for me to use a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/06/building_an_ssi_ecosystem_health_passes_and_the_design_of_an_ecosystem_of_ecosystems.shtml">health pass app</a>, but whose? None of the ones I knew about had a way for me to get my vaccination status into them. Delta airlines didn't accept any that I could tell. Munich has its own—or three. In short, it's an interoperability nightmare. 
</p>

<p>
    Apple recently <a href="https://www.imore.com/you-can-now-store-your-covid-19-vaccination-health-app">announced</a> that you can store your Covid-19 vaccination card in the Health app. And soon you'll be able to put it in the phone's wallet app. Android users have similar options. But there's also hundreds (really) of apps for doing the same thing and each has its own tiny ecosystem. PC Magazine even wrote a guide with <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/does-my-state-have-a-covid-19-vaccine-app">every US state's chosen app</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    The size of Apple and Android may help solve this problem since they already represent huge ecosystems. But then we're stuck with whatever solutions they provide and we may not like what we get. You don't have to look far to see <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-icloud-photo-scan-csam-pause-backlash/">BigTech solutions that have left people scratching their head.</a> We can't continue to count on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictatorship">benevolence of our erstwhile dictators</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/10/255710-competitive-compatibility/fulltext">Writing in Communications of the ACM</a>, Cory Doctorow discusses what can be done and hits upon a conceptually simple answer: enforce interoperability.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>[Interoperability] is the better way. Instead of enshrining Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft as the Internet's permanent overlords and then striving to make them as benign as possible, we can fix the Internet by making Big Tech less central to its future.</p>
    <p>It's possible that people will connect tools to their BigTech accounts that do ill-advised things they come to regret. That is kind of the point, really. After all, people can plug weird things into their car's lighter receptacles, but the world is a better place when you get to decide how to use that useful, versatile ANSI/SAE J56-compliant plug—not GM or Toyota.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
    By enforcing interoperability, we avoid empowering Apple, Google, or anyone else as the sole trusted repositories of health data and then hoping they'll not only do the right thing, but also have all the best ideas. We can let the hundreds of Covid-19 health pass apps thrive (or not), secure in the knowledge that people can pick the app they like from a company they trust and still have it work when they travel across borders—or just across town.
</p>

<p>
    People with decision making authority can help this process by choosing the interoperable solution and avoiding closed, proprietary technology. Why are organizations like <a href="https://www.nascio.org/">NASCIO (National Association of State CIOs)</a>, for example, not doing more to help states find, chose, and use interoperable solutions to common state IT problems? Beyond health pass applications, things like mobile drivers licenses need to be interoperable to be useful.
</p>

<p>
    Fortunately, we have <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2021.626726/full">open-source technology, with multiple commercial providers</a>, that can provide interoperable credentials. Verifiable credential technology and SSI tick all the checkboxes for interoperable data exchange. Several <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/use+cases">production use cases</a> exist that can inform new projects. 
</p>

<p>
    In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/06/building_an_ssi_ecosystem_health_passes_and_the_design_of_an_ecosystem_of_ecosystems.shtml">Health Passes and the Design of an Ecosystem of Ecosystems</a>, I wrote about efforts to create interoperable health passes on principles that respect individual privacy and autonomy. Those efforts have created real apps, with real interoperability. But too many decision makers jettison interoperability in search of profit, dominance, or simply time to market. The lesson of the internet was not that it was the cheapest, easiest way to build global network. We had CompuServe for that. The lesson of the internet was that it was the best way to build a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/01/generative_identity.shtml">network that was generative</a> and provided the most utility for the greatest number of people. Interoperability was the key—and still is.

U.S., Canadian, and European Governments see how this technology can provide superior data protection for its citizens, while enabling global data sharing — that’s why they have invested more than $16 million USD into this space over the past several&nbsp;years.</p><p>On September 15, 2021, I moderated a panel with representatives from the United States Government, the Canadian Government, and the European Commission. Below is an edited excerpt from the panel that included:</p>  Anil John, Technical Director of the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/svip">Silicon Valley Innovation Program</a> which has invested $8 million on R&amp;D, proof of concepts, product development, refinement, and a digital wallet UI competition.  Tim Bouma, Senior Policy Analyst for identity management at the Treasury Board secretariat at of the Government of Canada. The <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/ucvdcc">User-centric Verifiable Digital Credentials Challenge</a> has awarded $4 million CAD in two&nbsp;phases.  Olivier Bringer, Head of the <a href="https://www.ngi.eu/">Next-Generation Internet</a> at the European commission and under his program, he has awarded about € 6 million euros through three open calls for EID and SSI solutions.  Heather Vescent, Co-Chair of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">Credentials Community Group</a> which incubates many of the open standards in this space &amp; an author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Guide-Self-Sovereign-Identity-ebook/dp/B07Q3TXLDP/">The Comprehensive Guide to Self Sovereign Identity</a>.   Policy and Technology <p>Heather Vescent: Policy tends to be squishy while technology and especially technology standards must be precise. What challenges do you face implementing policy decisions into technology?</p><p>Anil John: Our two primary work streams come out of the oldest parts of the U.S. government: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.</p><p>Immigration credentials must be available to anyone regardless of their technical savvy or infrastructure availability. The USCIS team is focused on leaving nobody behind, and do not have the luxury of pivoting to a digital only model. Technology has to provide credentials in electronic format, as well as on paper — each with a high degree of verification validation.</p><p>U.S. Customs has to deal with every single entity that is shipping goods into the U.S. We don’t have any choice but to be globally interoperable, because while we may be the largest customs organization on the planet, we do not want to mandate a single platform or technology stack. Interoperability is critical so that everybody has a choice in the technology that they are&nbsp;using.</p><p>It is easy to get pushback about why we are doing this long public process, rather than put money into a vendor and buy their technology. One of the reasons we made the decision to work in public, under the remit of a global standards organization, was to ensure that we were not repeating past mistakes where we were locked into particular vendors or platforms. In the past, we were locked into proprietary APIs, with high switching costs, left with the care and feeding of legacy systems that were very uniquely government centric. There are benefits to develop technology in the public from a solution choice and a public interest perspective.</p><p>Tim Bouma: The challenge is that you have to deal with short term exigencies, and combine that with a long-term vision to come up with requirements that are fairly timeless. Because once you develop the requirements, they have to last for a decade or more. This forces you to think of what the timeless requirements might be. In order to do that, you have to understand the technology very deeply. You have to understand the abstraction, so you can come up with language that can serve the test of&nbsp;time.</p><p>Olivier Bringer: I agree that it can be a challenge to implement policy choices into technology; but it can also be an opportunity. Innovators have not waited for the European General Data Protection Regulation before developing privacy preserving technologies. This is an opportunity for companies, an opportunity for administration, an opportunity for innovators to develop new technologies and new business&nbsp;models.</p><blockquote>“Policy is an opportunity to implement fundamental rights into technology.” — Olivier&nbsp;Bringer</blockquote><p>In NGI we try to take the policy development, the regulations that we have, as an opportunity to implement our fundamental rights, an opportunity to implement the law into technology. Our program supports innovators, the adoption of their technologies, their solutions, and their integration into standards. We do that firstly in Europe, but our ambition is to link to the global environment and work in cooperation with&nbsp;others.</p> A Benefit to&nbsp;Citizens <p>Vescent: What would you tell your citizens is the most important reason to invest in this infrastructure and businesses that use&nbsp;it?</p><p>Bringer: First that we are funding technologies, which are, this is our motto, human centric. So returning to your first question, going beyond pure policy development, we think it’s really important to develop the technology. So next to the regulation that we put in place in the field of electronic identity, in the field of AI, in the field of data protection, it’s important to fund the technologies that will implement these policies and regulation. This is really what we try to do when we build an internet that’s more trustworthy, that gives more control to the users in terms of the data they disclose, in terms of control of their identity online, in terms of including everyone in this increasingly important digital environment. It is technology geared towards the&nbsp;citizen.</p><p>John: I’m going to answer for myself, rather than speak for my organization. Having said that, I think what I would tell [citizens] would be that we want to make your life more secure, and more privacy-respecting, without leaving anybody behind. These are the first technologies that have come along that give us a hope in ensuring that we’re not trapped by nefarious or corporate or money interests. That there is a choice in the marketplace in what is available to our citizens in how they access it. And we absolutely are not ignoring the people who may not have a level of comfort with digital technologies and leaving them behind, but ensuring that there is a clear bridge with this technology to what their level of comfort&nbsp;is.</p><p>Bouma: We are moving to a notion of a digital economy, and it’s more than some slogan. We are building a digital infrastructure that is becoming a critical infrastructure. It is important that we understand that we develop the capabilities that ensure that the citizens actually feel safe. This is as fundamental as having safe drinking water and a regulated electricity supply. So now we need to start thinking about the digital capabilities, verifiable credentials included, as part of the national and international infrastructure.</p><p>We’re doing proof of concepts and pilots on national digital infrastructure, to understand what it means, to use a Canadian metaphor, create a “set of rails” that goes across the country. What would that look like? What are the capabilities? At the end of the day, we need to build services that can be trusted by Canadians and everyone. And there’s a lot of engineering and a lot of policy work that has to go into&nbsp;that.</p> Most Surprising Lesson <p>Vescent: What’s the most surprising thing you’ve learned since the inception of your investment programs.?</p><p>Bouma: I had a major shift in perspective. There are other technical ecosystems we have to take into account, like the mobile driver’s license, the digital travel credentials, and others. So, we have to figure out how to incorporate all those requirements. The mantra I’ve been using is, we’ve got these different technical ecosystems but we have to focus on the human being — the point of integration is at the digital wallet. So that’s reframed my policy thinking — there’s a multiplicity of technical ecosystems that we have to account from a policy point of&nbsp;view.</p><p>Bringer: I’m impressed by the quality of the innovators. We have people who are very good in technology who understand the political challenges, the policy context in which they intervene and who are able to make excellent contribution to our own policy, and who are really dedicated to our human centric&nbsp;vision.</p><p>John: I’ll give you one positive one, one negative. On the positive side, I am happy there is a community of people that understands there is value in working together to ensure the shared infrastructure that we are all using has a common foundation of security, privacy, and interoperability — that it is not a zero-sum game. They can compete on top of a common foundation.</p><p>On the negative side, I’m fascinated by the shenanigans being pulled by people who use the theater of interoperability in order to pedal proprietary solutions. Fortunately, I think a lot of the public sector entities are getting more educated so that they can see through the interoperability theater.</p><p>Curious for more? Watch the full panel.

<p>I’ve just rediscovered two digital assets that I’d forgotten about.</p>
<p>1. The Reddit username judell, which I created in 2005 and never used. When you visit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/judell">the page</a> it says “hmm… u/judell hasn’t posted anything” but also reports, in my Trophy Case, that I belong to the 15-year club.</p>
<p>2. The Amazon AWS S3 bucket named simply jon, which I created in 2006 for an <a href="http://jonudell.net/udell/2006-03-22-towards-politically-neutral-infrastructure-amazons-s3.html">InfoWorld blog post</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060330221659/https://www.infoworld.com/article/06/03/22/76555_13OPstrategic_1.html">companion column</a> about the birth of Amazon Web Services. As Wikipedia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Amazon_Web_Services#Full_timeline">timeline</a> shows, AWS started in March of that year.</p>
<p>Care to guess the odds that I could still access both of these assets after leaving them in limbo for 15 years?</p>
<p>Spoiler alert: it was a coin flip.</p>
<p>I’ve had no luck with Reddit so far. The email account I signed up with no longer exists. The support folks kindly switched me to a current email but it’s somehow linked to Educational_Elk_7869 not to judell. I guess we may still get it sorted but the point is that I was not at all surprised by this loss of continuity. I’ve lost control of all kinds of digital assets over the years, including the above-cited InfoWorld article which only Wayback (thank you as always!) now remembers. </p>
<p>When I turned my attention to AWS S3 I was dreading a similar outcome. I’d gone to Microsoft not long after I made that AWS developer account; my early cloud adventures were all in Azure; could I still access those long-dormant AWS resources? Happily: yes. </p>
<p>Here’s the backstory from that 2006 blog post:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Naming</p>
<p>The name of the bucket is jon. The bucket namespace is global which means that as long as jon is owned by my S3 developer account, nobody else can use that name. Will this lead to a namespace land grab? We’ll see. Meanwhile, I’ve got mine, and although I may never again top Jon Stewart as Google’s #1 Jon, his people are going to have to talk to my people if they want my Amazon bucket.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not holding my breath waiting for an offer. Bucket names never mattered in the way domain names do. Still, I would love to be pleasantly surprised!</p>
<p>My newfound interest in AWS is, of course, because Steampipe wraps SQL around a <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws/tables">whole bunch of AWS APIs</a> including <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws/tables/aws_s3_bucket">the one for S3 buckets</a>. So, for example, when exactly did I create that bucket? Of course I can log into the AWS console and click my way to the answer. But I’m all about SQL lately so instead I can do this.</p>
 &gt; select name, arn, creation_date from aws_s3_bucket 
+-------+--------------------+---------------------+         
| name  | arn                | creation_date       |         
+-------+--------------------+---------------------+         
| jon   | arn:aws:s3:::jon   | 2006-03-16 08:16:12 |         
| luann | arn:aws:s3:::luann | 2007-04-26 14:47:45 |         
+-------+--------------------+---------------------+  
 
<p>Oh, and there’s the other one I made for <a href="https://www.luannudell.com/">Luann</a> the following year. These are pretty cool ARNs (<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html">Amazon Resource Names</a>)! I should probably do something with them; the names you can get nowadays are more like Educational_Elk_7869. </p>
<p>Anyway I’m about to learn a great deal about the many AWS APIs that Steampipe can query, <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/mods/turbot/aws_compliance">check for policy compliance</a>, and join with <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins">the APIs of other services</a>. Meanwhile it’s fun to recall that I wrote one of the first reviews of the inaugural AWS product and, in the process, laid claim to some very special S3 bucket names.</p>

<p>There’s an economic theory here:&nbsp;Free customers are more valuable than captive ones—to themselves, to the companies they deal with, and to the marketplace. If that’s true, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527">the intention economy</a> will prove it. If not, we’ll stay stuck in the attention economy, where the belief that captive customers are more valuable than free ones prevails.</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22attention+economy%22">attention economy</a> is not native to human attention. It’s native to businesses that&nbsp; seek to grab and manipulate buyers’ attention. This includes the businesses themselves and their agents. Both&nbsp;see human attention as a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy">resource</a>” as passive and ready for extraction as oil and coal. The primary actors in this economy—purveyors and customers of marketing and advertising services—typically talk about human beings not only as mere “users” and “consumers,” but as “targets” to “acquire,” “manage,” “control” and “lock in.” They are also oblivious to the irony that this is the same language used by those who own cattle and slaves.</p>
<p>While attention-grabbing has been around for as long as we’ve had yelling, in our digital age the fields of practice (abbreviated&nbsp;<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=martech">martech</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=adtech">adtech</a>) have become so vast and varied that nobody (really, nobody) can get their head around everything that’s going on in them. (Examples of attempts are <a href="https://informationsciencejournal.org/2021/01/10/fueling-the-adtech-machine-google-analytics-and-the-commodification-of-online-personal-data/">here</a>, <a href="https://cdn.chiefmartec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/martech-landscape-2020-martech5000-slide.jpg">here</a> and <a href="https://lumapartners.com/content/lumascapes/display-ad-tech-lumascape/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>One thing we know for sure is that martech and adtech rationalize taking advantage of absent&nbsp;<a href="http://In%20this%20economy,%20human%20attention%20is%20a%20scarce%20%22resource,%22%20ready%20for%20extraction.%20And%20the%20extraction%20business%20typically%20talks%20about%20human%20beings%20not%20just%20as%20mere%20%22users%22%20or%20%22consumers,%22%20but%20as%20%22targets%22%20to%20%22acquire,%22%20%22manage,%22%20%22control%22%20and%20%22lock%20in%22—oblivious%20to%20the%20irony%20that%20this%20is%20the%20same%20language%20used%20by%20those%20owning%20cattle%20and%20slaves.">personal privacy</a>&nbsp;tech in the hands of their targets. What we need there are the digital equivalents of the privacy tech we call clothing and shelter in the physical world. We also need means to signal our privacy preferences, to obtain agreements to those, and to audit compliance and resolve disputes. As it stands in the attention economy, privacy is a weak promise made separately by websites and services that are highly incentivised not to provide it. Tracking prophylaxis in browsers is some help, but itworks differently for every browser and it’s hard to tell what’s actually going on.</p>
<p>Another thing we know for sure is that the attention economy is thick with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/augustinefou/2020/08/14/my-review-of-ad-fraud-detection-technology-companies/?sh=7314bf2d7172">fraud</a>, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=malware+adtech">malware</a>, and worse. For a view of how much worse, look at any adtech-supported website&nbsp;through <a href="https://pagexray.fouanalytics.com">PageXray</a>&nbsp;and see the hundreds or thousands of ways sthe site and its invisible partners are trying to track you. (For example, <a href="https://pagexray.fouanalytics.com/q/smithsonianmag.com">here’s what Smithsonian Magazine‘s site does</a>.)</p>
<p>We also know that lawmaking to stop adtech’s harms (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act">CCPA</a>) has thus far mostly caused inconvenience for you and me (how many “consent” notices have interrupted your web surfing today?)—while creating a vast new industry devoted to making tracking as easy as legally possible. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gdpr+compliance">Look up GDPR+compliance</a> and you’ll get way over 100 million results. Almost all of those will be for companies selling other companies ways to obey the letter of privacy law while violating its spirit.</p>
<p>Yet all that bad shit is also a red herring, misdirecting attention away from the inefficiencies of an economy that depends on unwelcome surveillance and algorithmic guesswork about what people might want.</p>
<p>Think about this: even if you apply all the machine learning and artificial intelligence in the world to all the personal data that might be harvested, you still can’t beat what’s possible when the targets of that surveillance have their own ways to contact and inform sellers of what they actually want and don’t want, plus ways to form genuine relationships and express genuine (rather than coerced) loyalty, and to do all of that at scale.</p>
<p>We don’t have that yet. But when we do, it will be an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527">intention economy</a>. Here are the opening paragraphs of&nbsp;The Intention Economy: When Customers Take Charge (Harvard Business Review Press, 2012):</p>
<blockquote><p>This book stands with the customer. This is out of necessity, not sympathy. Over the coming years, customers will be emancipated from systems built to control them. They will become free and independent actors in the marketplace, equipped to tell vendors what they want, how they want it, where and when—even how much they’d like to pay—outside of any vendor’s system of customer control. Customers will be able to form and break relationships with vendors, on customers’ own terms, and not just on the take-it-or-leave-it terms that have been pro forma since Industry won the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>Customer power will be personal, not just collective.&nbsp; Each customer will come to market equipped with his or her own means for collecting and storing personal data, expressing demand, making choices, setting preferences, proffering terms of engagement, offering payments and participating in relationships—whether those relationships are shallow or deep, and whether they last for moments or years. Those means will be standardized. No vendor will control them.</p>
<p>Demand will no longer be expressed only in the forms of cash, collective appetites, or the inferences of crunched data over which the individual has little or no control. Demand will be personal. This means customers will be in charge of personal information they share with all parties, including vendors.</p>
<p>Customers will have their own means for storing and sharing their own data, and their own tools for engaging with vendors and other parties.&nbsp; With these tools customers will run their own loyalty programs—ones in which vendors will be the members. Customers will no longer need to carry around vendor-issued loyalty cards and key tags. This means vendors’ loyalty programs will be based on genuine loyalty by customers, and will benefit from a far greater range of information than tracking customer behavior alone can provide.</p>
<p>Thus relationship management will go both ways. Just as vendors today are able to manage relationships with customers and third parties, customers tomorrow will be able to manage relationships with vendors and fourth parties, which are companies that serve as agents of customer demand, from the customer’s side of the marketplace.</p>
<p>Relationships between customers and vendors will be voluntary and genuine, with loyalty anchored in mutual respect and concern, rather than coercion. So, rather than “targeting,” “capturing,” “acquiring,” “managing,” “locking in” and “owning” customers, as if they were slaves or cattle, vendors will earn the respect of customers who are now free to bring far more to the market’s table than the old vendor-based systems ever contemplated, much less allowed.</p>
<p>Likewise, rather than guessing what might get the attention of consumers—or what might “drive” them like cattle—vendors will respond to actual intentions of customers. Once customers’ expressions of intent become abundant and clear, the range of economic interplay between supply and demand will widen, and its sum will increase. The result we will call the Intention Economy.</p>
<p>This new economy will outperform the Attention Economy that has shaped marketing and sales since the dawn of advertising. Customer intentions, well-expressed and understood, will improve marketing and sales, because both will work with better information, and both will be spared the cost and effort wasted on guesses about what customers might want, and flooding media with messages that miss their marks. Advertising will also improve.</p>
<p>The volume, variety and relevance of information coming from customers in the Intention Economy will strip the gears of systems built for controlling customer behavior, or for limiting customer input. The quality of that information will also obsolete or re-purpose the guesswork mills of marketing, fed by crumb-trails of data shed by customers’ mobile gear and Web browsers. “Mining” of customer data will still be useful to vendors, though less so than intention-based data provided directly by customers.</p>
<p>In economic terms, there will be high opportunity costs for vendors that ignore useful signaling coming from customers. There will also be high opportunity gains for companies that take advantage of growing customer independence and empowerment.</p></blockquote>
<p>But this hasn’t happened yet. Why?</p>
<p>Let’s start with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand">supply and demand</a>, which is roughly about price. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/law-of-supply-demand.asp">Wikipedia</a>: “the relationship between the price of a given good or product and the willingness of people to either buy or sell it.” But that wasn’t the original idea. “Supply and demand” was first expressed as “demand and supply” by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Steuart_%28economist%29">Sir James Denham-Steuart</a> in An Inquiry into the Principles of Political Oeconomy, written in 1767. To Sir James, demand and supply wasn’t about price. Specifically, “it must constantly appear reciprocal. If I demand a pair of shoes, the shoemaker either demands money or something else for his own use.” Also, “The nature of demand is to encourage industry.”</p>
<p>Nine years later, in The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith, a more visible bulb in the Scottish Enlightenment, wrote, “The real and effectual discipline which is exercised over a workman is that of his customers. It is the fear of losing their employment which restrains his frauds and corrects his negligence.” Again, nothing about price.</p>
<p>But neither&nbsp;of those guys lived to see the industrial age take off. When that happened, demand became an effect of supply, rather than a cause of it. Supply came to run whole markets on a massive scale, with makers and distributors of goods able to serve countless customers in parallel. The industrial age also ubiquitized standard-form&nbsp;<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/adhesion_contract_%28contract_of_adhesion%29">contracts of adhesion</a> binding all customers to one supplier with a single “agreement.”</p>
<p>But, had Sir James and Adam lived into the current millennium, they would have seen that it is now possible, thanks to digital technologies and the Internet, for customers to achieve scale across many companies, with efficiencies not imaginable in the pre-digital industrial age.</p>
<p>For example, it should be possible for a customer to express her intentions—say, “I need a stroller for twins downtown this afternoon”—to whole markets, but without being trapped inside any one company’s walled garden. In other words, not only inside Amazon, eBay or Craigslist. This is called <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Intentcasting">intentcasting</a>,&nbsp;and among its virtues is what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Cameron_(computer_scientist)">Kim Cameron</a> <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/01/the_laws_of_identity.shtml">calls</a> “minimum disclosure for constrained purposes” to “justifiable parties” through a choice among a “plurality of operators.”</p>
<p>Likewise, there is no reason why websites and services can’t agree to&nbsp;your&nbsp;privacy policy, and your&nbsp;terms of engagement. In legal terms, you should be able to operate as the first party, and to proffer your own terms, to which sites and services can agree (or, as privacy laws now say, consent) as second parties. That this is barely thinkable is a legacy of a time that has sadly not yet left us: one in which only companies can enjoy that kind of scale. Yet it would clearly be a convenience to have privacy as normalized in the online world as it is in the offline one. But we’re slowly getting there; for example with Customer Commons’ <a href="https://customercommons.org/solutions/tools/terms/p2b1/">P2B1, aka #NoStalking</a> term, which readers can proffer and publishers can agree agree to. It says “Just give me ads not based on tracking me.” Also with the IEEE’s <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/project/7012.html">P7012&nbsp;Standard for Machine Readable Personal Privacy Terms</a>&nbsp;working group.</p>
<p>Same with <a href="https://customercommons.org/solving-subscriptions/">subscriptions</a>. A person should be able to keep track of all her regular payments for subscription services, to keep track of new and better deals as they come along, to express to service providers her intentions toward those new deals, and to cancel or unsubscribe. There are lots of tools for this today, for example&nbsp;<a href="https://zdcs.link/Truebill?_ga=2143292681.1599871823&amp;t=lineup-page&amp;el=Truebill&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcmag.com%2Fhow-to%2Fhow-to-track-and-manage-your-paid-subscriptions&amp;cd2=Story%20Slideshow&amp;cd61=lineup&amp;cd62=04H2Trg3sEkVXbHd1PljSHY">Truebill</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bobbyapp.co/">Bobby</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moneydashboard.com/">Money Dashboard</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://mint.intuit.com/">Mint</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/subscriptme-personal-finance/id963594756">Subscript Me</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bill-tracker-pro/id1059461492">BillTracker Pro</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://go.asktrim.com/">Trim</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://subby.online/">Subby</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/card-due-credit-card-bill-tracker/id1073417260">Card Due</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.siftwallet.com/">Sift</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tilicho.subman&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">SubMan</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/subscriptme-bill-tracker/id963594756">Subscript Me</a>. There are also subscription management systems offered by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/how-paypal-works">Paypal</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/magazines-subscription-manager">Amazon</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039">Apple</a>&nbsp;and Google (e.g. with&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/">Google Sheets</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yq4KbccszG71lj0QTStMciiGdFVSgMlspAi4gAomDAY/template/preview">Google Doc templates</a>). But all of them to one degree or another are based more on the felt need by those suppliers for customer captivity than for customer independence.</p>
<p>As Customer Commons unpacks it <a href="https://customercommons.org/solutions/">here</a>, there are many largely or entirely empty market spaces that are wide open for free and independent customers: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity">identity</a>, shopping (e.g. with shopping carts of your own to take from site to site), loyalty (of the genuine kind), property ownership (the real Internet of Things), and <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/EmanciPay">payments</a>, for example.</p>
<p>It is possible to fill all those spaces if we have the capacity to—as Sir James put it—encourage industry, restrain fraud and correct negligence. While there is some progress in some of those areas, the going is still slow on the global scale. After all,&nbsp;The Intention Economy is nine years old and we still don’t have it yet. Is it just not possible, or are we starting in the wrong places?</p>
<p>I think it’s the latter.</p>
<p>Way back in 1995, when the Internet first showed up on both of our desktops, my wife Joyce said, “The sweet spot of the Internet isn’t global. It’s local.” That was the gist of my <a href="https://tedxsantabarbara.com/2018/doc-searls/">TEDx Santa Barbara talk in 2018</a>. It’s also why Joyce and I are now in Bloomington, Indiana, working&nbsp;with the <a href="https://ostromworkshop.indiana.edu/">Ostrom Workshop</a> at Indiana University on deploying a new way for demand and supply to inform each other and get business rolling—and to start locally. It’s called the <a href="https://customercommons.org/a-new-way/">Byway</a>, and it works outside of the old supply-controlled industrial model.&nbsp;<a href="https://customercommons.org/solutions/tools/intention-byway/intention-byway-faq/">Here’s an FAQ</a>.

<p>The article shows how an ASP.NET Core API and a Blazor BBF application can be implemented in the same project and secured using Azure AD with Microsoft.Identity.Web. The Blazor application is secured using the BFF pattern with its backend APIs protected using cookies with anti-forgery protection and same site. The API is protected using JWT Bearer tokens and used from a separate client from a different domain, not from the Blazor application. This API is not used for the Blazor application. When securing Blazor WASM hosted in an ASP.NET Core application, BFF architecture should be used for the Blazor application and not JWT tokens, especially in Azure where it is not possible to logout correctly.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCore6Experiments">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCore6Experiments</a></p>



<p>Setup</p>



<p>The Blazor application consists of three projects. The Server project implements the OpenID Connect user interaction flow and authenticates the client as well as the user authentication. The APIs created for the Blazor WASM are protected using cookies. A second API is implemented for separate clients and the API is protected using JWT tokens. Two separate Azure App registrations are setup for the UI client and the API. If using the API, a third Azure App registration would be used for the client, for example an ASP.NET Core Razor page, or a Power App.</p>



<p>API </p>



<p>The API is implemented and protected with the MyJwtApiScheme scheme. This will be implemented later in the Startup class. The API uses swagger configurations for Open API 3 and a simple HTTP GET is implemented to validate the API security.</p>


  [Route("api/[controller]")]
[ApiController]
[Authorize(AuthenticationSchemes = "MyJwtApiScheme")]
[Produces("application/json")]
[SwaggerTag("Using to provide a public api for different clients")]
public class MyApiJwtProtectedController : ControllerBase
{
	[HttpGet]
	[ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status200OK, Type = typeof(string))]
	[SwaggerOperation(OperationId = "MyApiJwtProtected-Get", 
		Summary = "Returns string with details")]
	public IActionResult Get()
	{
		return Ok("yes my public api protected with Azure AD and JWT works");
	}
}
  


<p>Blazor BFF</p>



<p>The Blazor applications are implemented using the backend for frontend security architecture. All security is implemented in the backend and the client requires a secret or a certificate to authenticate. The security data is stored to an encrypted cookie with same site protection. This is easier to secure than storing tokens in the browser storage, especially since Blazor does not support strong CSPs due to the generated Javascript and also that AAD does not support a proper logout for access tokens, refresh tokens stored in the browser. The following blog post explains this in more details.</p>



<p><a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/03/08/securing-blazor-web-assembly-using-cookies/">Securing Blazor Web assembly using&nbsp;cookies</a></p>



<p>Microsoft.Identity.Web</p>



<p>The Microsoft.Identity.Web Nuget package is used to implement the Azure AD clients. This setup is different to the documentation. The default schemes need to be set correctly when using Cookie (App) authentication and also API Auth together. The AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp method sets up the Blazor authentication for one Azure App registration using configuration from the AzureAd settings. The AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApi method implements the second Azure App registration for the JWT Bearer token Auth using the AzureAdMyApi settings and the MyJwtApiScheme scheme.</p>


  services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt; 
{
	options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
	options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
	options.DefaultSignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;

		Configuration, "AzureAdMyApi", "MyJwtApiScheme");
  


<p>app.settings</p>



<p>The ASP.NET Core project uses app.settings and user secrets in development to configure the Azure AD clients. The two Azure App registrations values are added here.</p>


  "AzureAd": {
	"Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
	"Domain": "damienbodhotmail.onmicrosoft.com",

	"CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc",
	"SignedOutCallbackPath ": "/signout-callback-oidc"
	// "ClientSecret": "add secret to the user secrets"
},
"AzureAdMyApi": {
	"Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
	"Domain": "damienbodhotmail.onmicrosoft.com",

	"ClientId": "b2a09168-54e2-4bc4-af92-a710a64ef1fa"
},
  


<p>Swagger</p>



<p>Swagger is added to make it easier to view and test the API. A simple UI is created so that you can paste your access token into the UI and test the APIs manually if required. You could also implement a user flow directly in the Swagger UI but then you would have to open up the security headers protection to allow this. </p>


  services.AddSwaggerGen(c =&gt;
{
	c.EnableAnnotations();

	// add JWT Authentication
	var securityScheme = new OpenApiSecurityScheme
	{
		Name = "JWT Authentication",
		Description = "Enter JWT Bearer token **_only_**",
		In = ParameterLocation.Header,
		Type = SecuritySchemeType.Http,
		Scheme = "bearer", // must be lower case
		BearerFormat = "JWT",
		Reference = new OpenApiReference
		{
			Id = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
			Type = ReferenceType.SecurityScheme
		}
	};
	c.AddSecurityDefinition(securityScheme.Reference.Id, securityScheme);
	c.AddSecurityRequirement(new OpenApiSecurityRequirement
	{
		{securityScheme, Array.Empty&lt;string&gt;() }
	});
	c.SwaggerDoc("v1", new OpenApiInfo
	{
		Title = "My API",
		Version = "v1",
		Description = "My API"
	});

});
  


<p>The Swagger middleware is added after the security headers middleware. Some people only add this to dev and not production deployments.</p>


  app.UseSwagger(); 
app.UseSwaggerUI(c =&gt;
{
	c.SwaggerEndpoint("/swagger/v1/swagger.json", "MyApi v1");
});

  


<p>Testing</p>



<p>The UITestClientForApiTest Razor Page application can be used to login and get an access token to test the API. Before starting this application, the AzureAD configuration in the settings need to be updated to match your Azure App registration and your tenant. The access token can be used directly in the Swagger UI. The API only accepts delegated access tokens and no CC tokens etc. The configuration in the Blazor server application also needs to match the Azure App registrations in your tenant. </p>







<p>This setup is good for simple projects where you would like to avoid creating a second deployment or you want to re-use a small amount of business logic from the Blazor server. At some stage, it would probably make sense to split the API and the Blazor UI into two separate projects which would make this security setup more simple again but result in more infrastructure.</p>

<p>I’ve been building and working with REST APIs for many years now. Recently, however, I’ve been spending more and more of my time working with (and building) GraphQL-based APIs.</p>

<p>While GraphQL has generally made my life easier, especially as I’ve been building and consuming more data-heavy APIs, there is still one extremely annoying problem I’ve run into over and over again: lack of GraphQL support for third-party APIs I need to consume.</p>

<p>If I’m trying to use a third-party API service that doesn’t have a GraphQL endpoint, I either need to:</p>

 
 Download, install, configure, and learn how to use their custom REST API clients (which takes a lot of time and means my codebase is now a bit cluttered), or 
 Build my own GraphQL proxy for their service… But this is a big task. I’ve got to read through all their REST API docs and carefully define GraphQL schemas for everything, learning all the ins and outs of their API as I go. 
 

<p>In short: it’s a lot of work either way, but if I really want to use GraphQL everywhere I have to work for it.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, every API service would have a GraphQL endpoint, this way I could just use a single GraphQL library to query all the API services I need to talk to.</p>

<p>Luckily, one of my favorite developer tools, <a href="https://stepzen.com/" title="StepZen">StepZen</a> (disclaimer: I advise them), has made this problem a lot less painful.</p>

 What StepZen Does 

<p>StepZen is a platform that lets you host a GraphQL endpoint to use in your applications. But, more importantly, they’ve designed a schema system that lets you import (or build your own) GraphQL wrappers for just about anything: REST APIs, databases, etc. It’s really neat!</p>

<p>Using the StepZen CLI, for example, I can create a new GraphQL endpoint that allows me to talk with the <a href="https://www.airtable.com/" title="Airtable">Airtable</a> and <a href="https://www.fedex.com/en-us/home.html" title="FedEx">FedEx</a> APIs, neither of which support GraphQL natively. The beautiful thing is, I don’t even need to write a GraphQL wrapper for this myself since someone else already did!</p>

<p>Here’s what this looks like (assuming you’ve already got the <a href="https://stepzen.com/docs/cli" title="StepZen CLI">StepZen CLI</a> installed and initialized):</p>

 <code>$ stepzen import airtable
$ stepzen import fedex
$ stepzen start
</code> 

<p>Using the <code>import</code> command, StepZen will download the publicly available GraphQL schemas for these services (Airtable and FedEx) to your local directory. The <code>start</code> command then launches a GraphQL explorer on localhost, port 5000, which you can use to interactively query the Airtable and FexEx APIs using GraphQL! Pretty neat!</p>

<p></p>

 How to Access Public GraphQL Schemas 

<p>So, let’s say you want to use GraphQL to query an API service that doesn’t support GraphQL. If you’re using StepZen, you can find all the publicly available (official) schemas on the <a href="https://github.com/steprz/stepzen-schemas" title="StepZen Schemas on GitHub">StepZen Schemas repo</a> on GitHub. This repo is namespaced, so if you see a folder in the project, you can use the <code>stepzen import</code> command on it directly. At the time of writing, there are 24 publicly available GraphQL schemas you can instantly use.</p>

<p>StepZen currently has support for lots of popular developer services: <a href="https://disqus.com/api/docs/" title="Disqus API">Disqus</a>, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest" title="GitHub API">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://shopify.dev/api/admin/rest/reference" title="Shopify API">Shopify</a>, etc.</p>

<p>You can, of course, create your own GraphQL schemas as well.</p>

 The Problem I Ran Into with GraphQL 

<p>Several months ago I was working on a simple user-facing web app. The entire backend of the app was using GraphQL and I was trying to keep the codebase as pure as possible, which meant not using any REST APIs directly.</p>

<p>In all my years of building web apps, I’ve always used a REST API at some point. So this was a bit of an experiment to see whether or not I could build my app without cluttering my codebase with REST API clients or requests.</p>

<p>As I was working on the app, I went to use one of my favorite free API services, <a href="https://randomuser.me/" title="Random User">Random User</a>. If you haven’t heard of it before, it’s a publicly available REST API you can hit to generate realistic-looking fake users. It’s incredible for building a development environment, using seed data in an app, or creating real-world-looking MVPs. I use it all the time.</p>

<p>I knew going into this process that the Random User API didn’t have a GraphQL endpoint, so I figured I’d spend some time creating one for them.</p>

 How to Convert a REST API to GraphQL 

<p>My goal, as I mentioned above, was to build a GraphQL endpoint for the Random User REST API.</p>

<p>In order to make this work, what you have to do is translate your REST API so the <a href="https://stepzen.com/" title="StepZen">StepZen service</a> can understand which endpoints you are hitting and what types of inputs and outputs they require.</p>

<p>Once you’ve defined all this, StepZen will be able to create a GraphQL endpoint for your app. When your app queries the StepZen GraphQL endpoint, StepZen will translate your GraphQL request into the proper REST API call, execute the request, then translate the response and send it back to your app in standard GraphQL format.</p>

<p>Here’s how you can convert any REST API to GraphQL using StepZen, step-by-step.</p>

 Step 1: Read Through the REST API Docs and Identify Endpoints to Convert 

<p>The first part of converting any REST API to GraphQL is to fully understand what endpoints you want to convert from REST to GraphQL.</p>

<p>In my case, the Random User API only has a single endpoint, so this isn’t complicated. But, let’s say you’re converting a large, popular API like <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api" title="Twilio API">Twilio</a> that has many endpoints… This can be much more difficult.</p>

<p>To make things simpler, here’s what I recommend: when converting a REST API to GraphQL, identify the endpoints you actually need and ignore the rest. Trying to build an entire abstraction layer for a massive API like Twilio would be difficult, so instead, focus only on the key endpoints you need to use. In the future, if you need to use additional endpoints, you can always add support for them.</p>

<p>NOTE: This is especially true if you’re using StepZen. It’s incredibly easy to support additional endpoints in StepZen once you have a basic schema going, so don’t feel bad about focusing on the important ones and ignoring the rest.</p>

<p>Following this just-in-time pattern will help save you time and get you back to working on the important stuff.</p>

 Step 2: Understand the REST Endpoint’s Schema 

<p>Every API endpoint has some sort of schema. For example, the Random User API, when queried, returns a blob of JSON similar to the following:</p>

 <code>{
  "results": [
    {
      "gender": "male",
      "name": {
        "title": "mr",
        "first": "brad",
        "last": "gibson"
      },
      "location": {
        "street": "9278 new road",
        "city": "kilcoole",
        "state": "waterford",
        "postcode": "93027",
        "coordinates": {
          "latitude": "20.9267",
          "longitude": "-7.9310"
        },
        "timezone": {
          "offset": "-3:30",
          "description": "Newfoundland"
        }
      },
      "email": "brad.gibson@example.com",
      "login": {
        "uuid": "155e77ee-ba6d-486f-95ce-0e0c0fb4b919",
        "username": "silverswan131",
        "password": "firewall",
        "salt": "TQA1Gz7x",
        "md5": "dc523cb313b63dfe5be2140b0c05b3bc",
        "sha1": "7a4aa07d1bedcc6bcf4b7f8856643492c191540d",
        "sha256": "74364e96174afa7d17ee52dd2c9c7a4651fe1254f471a78bda0190135dcd3480"
      },
      "dob": {
        "date": "1993-07-20T09:44:18.674Z",
        "age": 26
      },
      "registered": {
        "date": "2002-05-21T10:59:49.966Z",
        "age": 17
      },
      "phone": "011-962-7516",
      "cell": "081-454-0666",
      "id": {
        "name": "PPS",
        "value": "0390511T"
      },
      "picture": {
        "large": "https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/men/75.jpg",
        "medium": "https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/med/men/75.jpg",
        "thumbnail": "https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/thumb/men/75.jpg"
      },
      "nat": "IE"
    }
  ],
  "info": {
    "seed": "fea8be3e64777240",
    "results": 1,
    "page": 1,
    "version": "1.3"
  }
}
</code> 

<p>Since the purpose of the Random User API is to return random user data, I can clearly see in the JSON data many of the fields I might be interested in working with: <code>email</code>, <code>cell</code>, <code>username</code>, etc.</p>

<p>Once you’ve clearly identified the fields you want to make use of, move on to the next step.</p>

 Step 3: Create a Corresponding GraphQL Schema 

<p>Once you’ve figured out which fields you want to make use of, you need to define a <a href="https://graphql.org/learn/schema/" title="GraphQL Schema">GraphQL schema</a> that will tell the StepZen service how to understand the endpoint’s response.</p>

<p>You don’t need to be a wizard to do this, just pick out the important fields (and their types) from a REST API response, then build a corresponding GraphQL type.</p>

<p>For example, here’s the <code>RandomUser</code> type I defined based on the REST API output above:</p>

 <code>type RandomUser {
  gender: String!
  title: String!
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
  streetNumber: Int!
  streetName: String!
  city: String!
  state: String!
  country: String!
  postcode: String!
  latitude: String!
  longitude: String!
  timezoneOffset: String!
  timezoneDescription: String!
  email: String!
  uuid: String!
  username: String!
  password: String!
  salt: String!
  md5: String!
  sha1: String!
  sha256: String!
  dateOfBirth: Date!
  age: Int!
  registeredDate: DateTime!
  registeredAge: Int!
  phone: String!
  cell: String!
  largePicture: String!
  mediumPicture: String!
  thumbnailPicture: String!
  nationality: String!
}
</code> 

<p>As you can see, I simply defined the fields I care about from the REST response, along with their type.</p>

<p>NOTE: The exclamation point after many of these fields is to mark these fields as non-nullable. This means that no matter what, these fields should always be present in a response.</p>

<p>What you’ll want to do is create a new folder in your project and put this code into a file named <code>&lt;servicename&gt;.graphql</code>. In my case, I created the following directory tree and put the code into the <code>randomuser.graphql</code> file.</p>

 <code>randomuser
└─ randomuser.graphql
</code> 

 Step 4: Define a GraphQL Query 

<p>Once your data modeling is complete and you’ve defined your type(s), it’s time to define a special <code>Query</code> type that will tell the StepZen service how to communicate with the REST API you’re converting.</p>

<p>To get started, edit the <code>&lt;servicename&gt;.graphql</code> file and add the following <code>Query</code> definition:</p>

 <code>type Query {
  randomUser: RandomUser
    @rest(
      endpoint: "https://randomuser.me/api"
      resultroot: "results[]"
    )
}
</code> 

<p>This is a barebones query that essentially tells StepZen the <code>randomUser</code> query will return data of type <code>RandomUser</code> (which we defined in the previous step) and will get data by hitting the <code>https://randomuser.me/api</code> endpoint, then parsing the data out of the <code>results</code> JSON array field.</p>

<p>But… That’s not all! We still have more work to do.</p>

<p>When I defined the <code>RandomUser</code> type above, I decided to make all the data flat, and not nested like it was in the original REST API. This is because I don’t need any special nested fields when I generate a random user, I just want the data!</p>

<p>So, the next thing we need to do is explain to StepZen how to convert the nested JSON key/values into the custom schema I defined. To do this, we’ll use the <code>setters</code> REST directive StepZen provides:</p>

 <code>type Query {
  randomUser: RandomUser
    @rest(
      setters: [
        { field: "title", path: "name.title" }
        { field: "firstName", path: "name.first" }
        { field: "lastName", path: "name.last" }
        { field: "streetNumber", path: "location.street.number" }
        { field: "streetName", path: "location.street.name" }
        { field: "city", path: "location.city" }
        { field: "state", path: "location.state" }
        { field: "country", path: "location.country" }
        { field: "postcode", path: "location.postcode" }
        { field: "latitude", path: "location.coordinates.latitude" }
        { field: "longitude", path: "location.coordinates.longitude" }
        { field: "timezoneOffset", path: "location.timezone.offset" }
        { field: "timezoneDescription", path: "location.timezone.description" }
        { field: "uuid", path: "login.uuid" }
        { field: "username", path: "login.username" }
        { field: "password", path: "login.password" }
        { field: "salt", path: "login.salt" }
        { field: "md5", path: "login.md5" }
        { field: "sha1", path: "login.sha1" }
        { field: "sha256", path: "login.sha256" }
        { field: "dateOfBirth", path: "dob.date" }
        { field: "age", path: "dob.age" }
        { field: "registeredDate", path: "registered.date" }
        { field: "registeredAge", path: "registered.age" }
        { field: "largePicture", path: "picture.large" }
        { field: "mediumPicture", path: "picture.medium" }
        { field: "thumbnailPicture", path: "picture.thumbnail" }
        { field: "nationality", path: "nat" }
      ]
      endpoint: "https://randomuser.me/api"
      resultroot: "results[]"
    )
}
</code> 

<p>Using the <code>setters</code> directive, we’re able to tell StepZen which fields in our <code>RandomUser</code> type can be supplied by which nested paths from the raw REST API JSON data. Neat!</p>

<p>There are lots of other things you can define using StepZen, so even if you have an incredibly complex endpoint there are always ways to support it. To learn more about this, you might want to read through the <a href="https://stepzen.com/docs/connecting-backends/how-to-connect-a-rest-service">StepZen docs</a> on the subject.</p>

 Step 5: Define the API Metadata 

<p>Once you’ve finished defining the data model and query, the next thing you’ll want to do is prepare your GraphQL API schema for production!</p>

<p>In my case, I wanted to contribute my schema back to the StepZen developer community, so I forked the <a href="https://github.com/steprz/stepzen-schemas" title="StepZen Schemas Repo">stepzen-schemas repo</a> and created a new top-level folder named <code>randomuser</code> in which I put my query/data model from above.</p>

<p>I then wrote up a README and created  a <code>stepzen.config.json</code> file which provides details about this schema:</p>

 <code>{
  "name": "RandomUser",
  "description": "Generates random users for testing purposes using the randomuser.me API.",
  "categories": ["Dev Tools"]
}
</code> 

<p>Notice how all I’m providing is a <code>name</code>, <code>description</code>, and any relevant <code>categories</code> this schema fits into.</p>

<p>Finally, I opened a pull request to the StepZen repo and the maintainers tested and merged my schema into the repo so anyone could use it!</p>

<p>Now, if you have no interest in creating a public GraphQL schema for the REST API you’re converting, you can obviously skip this step. So long as you have a folder with your service name and your data model/queries defined, you can use StepZen to run your endpoint regardless of whether or not your schema is publicly available to the world.</p>

 Using Your Converted REST API 

<p>Once you’ve built a schema that teaches StepZen how to talk to the REST API, how do you actually use it?</p>

<p>Well, in the example above, I built a public-facing StepZen schema and contributed it back to the community. In this case, I can simply use this schema like I would any other:</p>

 <code>$ stepzen import randomuser
$ stepzen start
</code> 

<p>This will download and install the schema I built, then deploy the code in the current directory to my personal StepZen GraphQL endpoint. It’ll also watch the directory for changes and automatically deploy them if I tweak any of the schema code, etc.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, the <code>start</code> command will open a browser window with the StepZen Schema Explorer that will allow you to test your API by exploring the queries and types available and querying the API running on StepZen.</p>

<p>If you want to start querying your new GraphQL endpoint directly from an application, read through the <a href="https://stepzen.com/docs/connecting-frontends/connecting-to-stepzen" title="Connecting to Your StepZen API">Connecting to Your StepZen API Guide</a> which shows some examples of how to connect/query your new GraphQL API.</p>

 Recap: How to Convert a REST API You Don’t Control to GraphQL 

<p>If you’re trying to find a way to use GraphQL on a REST API, here’s what you should do.</p>

<p>First, check StepZen’s list of <a href="https://github.com/steprz/stepzen-schemas" title="StepZen Publicly Supported Schemas">publicly supported schemas</a> to see if a schema already exists. This means you can use GraphQL to access the API of your choice without doing much.</p>

<p>If there isn’t a public schema available, go build your own! To do this:</p>

 
 Figure out what endpoints you need to use 
 Figuring out what data your endpoints take as input/output 
 Define a GraphQL type to reflect what your endpoints look like in GraphQL 
 Define a StepZen query to explain how the StepZen service can interact with the REST API 
 

<p>Once you have a schema, you can easily deploy it live to the StepZen service, which will give you a dedicated GraphQL endpoint/explorer you can query. And bam, you’re now able to use GraphQL to talk to any REST API, even ones you don’t own/control/etc!</p>

<p>A derived version of this article was published by the <a href="https://mobileecosystemforum.com/?p=103731&amp;preview=1&amp;_ppp=2bb3b8b890">Mobile Ecosystem Forum</a> on October 7, 2021.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you heard? Mobile is a big deal. The <a>majority of the world’s population carries a mobile device</a>, and there are <a>billions of connected devices</a> integrated throughout nearly every part of our daily life. Why does this insight matter? Putting it another way, mobile is the guiding light that leads enterprises down the path of commercial success. Commercial success requires The 3Cs: Connection, Communication, Commerce. One of the four core threads that connect these three stepping stones to commercial success is mobile; the other three are communications, content, and identity (aka personal information). Everyone in an enterprise must understand this, from the c-suite to the staffer. Why? Because today’s connected [mobile] individual is the point of everything along the customer journey. They are the point of discovery. The point of consideration. The point of sales/transaction. The point of engagement. The point of loyalty. Point of exit. And, at each point of engagement, mobile identity plays an irreplaceable role. We’re still early days in mobile identity, but the market is shaping and reshaping up quickly.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We see the mobile device as playing an almost irreplaceable role in terms of this linkage between a physical person in live space, or meatspace, you might say, and the digital realm.” – Cameron D’Ambrosi, Managing Director, Liminal 2021 (MEF PD&amp;I Working Group Guest Speaker, 2021)</p></blockquote>
 Mobile Identity: A Pillar for Commercial Success 
<p>Mobile identity sits at the heart of most commercial experiences. Identity can help organizations know, with varying levels of assurance, who is on the other end of a device (aka “know your customer”); likewise, soon but not just yet, it will enable individuals to know the enterprise too (aka “know the sender”). The ability for enterprises and the connected individual to know, with absolute assurance (aka deterministic identity) or with varying degrees of assurance (aka probabilistic identity), who the human or entity is on the other end of a device is extremely important. When we have identity assurance, we can have transparency in our transactions, communications, and relationships. This transparency fosters trust, which in turn leads to lasting connections, effective communications, and commerce. Moreover, this transparency will allow organizations to better serve people at every stage along the customer lifecycle (acquisition, consideration, conversation, adoption, loyalty, and offboarding), while simultaneously meeting their contractual, legal and regulatory obligations and protecting themselves and their stakeholders from fraud and other cybercrime. With the systematic foundation of trust that mobile identity enables, a world of abundance can lay out our feet.</p>
 Mobile Ecosystem Forum PD&amp;I Working Group 
<p>The <a>Mobile Ecosystem Forum</a> is a global big-tent trade body made of leading cross-sector organizations from around the world. Its mission is to help foster a healthy, responsible, mobile ecosystem, one where mobile can be used as an effective tool to bring social and commercial prosperity to every region, organization, and individual.</p>
<p>It is accomplishing this by engaging in a range of initiatives that generate insights, stimulate interaction, and make a positive impact. Much of the MEFs work happens at a grassroots level in its workgroups. For example, the <a>Personal Data &amp; Identity Working Group</a>, chaired by <a>Andrew Perkin-White</a>, focuses on mobile identity, the emerging personal data economy, the growth and application of people-centric regulations (e.g.&nbsp;<a>GDPR</a>, <a>CCPA</a>), the annual <a>MEF global trust study</a>, and more. The working group meets monthly to discuss and prioritize the effort across all its initiatives.</p>
 MEF PD&amp;I Working Group Guest Speaker 
<p>Periodically the working group invites a guest speaker to the monthly working group meeting. September 20, 2021, the group was fortunate enough to have <a>Cameron D’Ambrosi</a>, Managing Director, <a>Liminal</a>, join the meeting and share his thoughts on the state of the global identity infrastructure market ecosystem, both today and in the years to come.</p>
<p></p>
<p>During his prepared remarks, Cameron shared Liminal’s framework for evaluating identity infrastructure, the “Honeycomb.” He talked through the structure of the Honeycombs, how “anchor” identity solutions sit in the center, adjacent solutions fuse together to support use cases, and various other solutions specialize in the three types of data: deterministic, probabilistic, and self-managed, and their persistent or transitory states. He touched on a number of important topics, including,</p>
 
 The Liminal “Identity Honeycombs” framework 
 The three data types and their two stages 
 Digital ID: A How, not a What 
 Use Case examples 
 Strategies for navigating the landscape 
 Risk/reward management 
 Identity orchestration 
 And more

 An Invitation To Lead 
<p>The conversation with Cameron went on much longer than what you heard in the recording above. Why? Because much of the content is reserved for MEF members. If you’re a MEF member, I encourage you to log in to the MEF site and listen to the engaging Q&amp;A the working group members had with Cameron. If you’re not a member of the MEF, I encourage you to consider becoming one. Through the MEF, you can gain indispensable insight, interact with people, and make a difference that will benefit you and your company professionally and personally. An important thing to remember is that with membership in any community, including the MEF, like anything in life, is that you get out of it what you put in. The more you put into your relationship with the MEF and your fellow members, the more you can get out.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this peek into the identity infrastructure marketplace. If you have thoughts and ideas as to where you think the marketplace is going, please do reach out. With the MEF, I’m working on a personal data &amp; identity market assessment report. I’d love to connect with you, see <a>MEF Personal Data &amp; Market Assessment Project (Schedule Interview and Share Insights)</a> to learn about the project, schedule an interview with me, or share your insights and resources.</p>

<a href="https://equalsdrummond.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/workona-wordmark-logo.png"></a>



<p>This is the first post I’ve made in 2 years—for the simple reason that my day job in SSI (the acronym for  <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/self-sovereign-identity">Self-Sovereign Identity</a>—click the link and read the book if you want to learn more) has been all-consuming (and showing no signs of abating).</p>



<p>So that explains why the last post was a rant about an experience with Lyft. It’s blood-boiling incidents like that which move me past the inertia to actually push out a new post.</p>



<p>This post is similar, but with a different ending. Here’s the story:</p>



<p>For at least four years I had been an inveterate user of The Great Suspender browser extension to help save memory due to the dozens of browser tabs I always had open in Chrome.</p>



<p>Then last March <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-kills-the-great-suspender-heres-what-you-should-do-next/">Google remotely blocked The Great Suspender</a> because it had been sold to a malware company.</p>



<p>A friend recommended I try <a href="https://workona.com/">Workona</a> because “it does much more than just suspend tabs—it will transform how you work with your browser”.</p>



<p>I did a little research and found several more such breathless endorsements, so I decided to give Workona a try.</p>



<p>It worked exactly as advertised. Within 30 minutes “my life in a browser” was changed forever. I was never going back. (I won’t go into how Workona works here—just check out the many <a href="https://www.g2.com/products/workona/reviews">rave reviews</a>.)</p>



<p>I was hooked enough that after a few weeks I tweeted out a love letter to Workona. </p>



<blockquote><p>.<a href="https://twitter.com/WorkonaHQ">@WorkonaHQ</a> It is rare that a browser utility stands out enough to merit a direct personal endorsement. But Workona is that good. I read so many reviews saying “it will change the way you use your browser” that I wondered if that could really be true. It was. Within minutes.</p></blockquote>



<p>When they replied to thank me, I responded.</p>



<blockquote><p>Honestly, you deserve it. Pretty soon I am going to start wondering, “Am I using Workona inside my browser or am I using my browser inside of Workona?”</p></blockquote>



 End of Act 1. 



<p>Act 2 began at about 6PM last Tuesday night when I clicked the “New Version – Upgrade” button that appears in Workona when there’s a new update. As usual, it refreshed in seconds. </p>



<p>Suddenly there was a new icon next to many of my Workona workspaces. I thought, “Cool, I wonder what new feature this is?” I clicked one to find out…</p>



<p>…and up popped a new dialog saying the workspace was now “locked” and the only way to unlock it was to buy a premium subscription (to that point Workona has been completely free).</p>



<p>I went ballistic. This fantastic new tool that had become an integral part of using my browser was suddenly blocking my own work in my own workspaces. I started clicking madly on the links provided in the upgrade dialog to find out who was responsible for this outrage. When I found a Workona contact form, I was almost shouting at the screen as I typed. A sampling:</p>



<blockquote><p>I am beyond upset that after working with&nbsp;Workona&nbsp;for several months now—whose functionality I love and which I have already recommended to several friends and tweeted about—you suddenly, with NO WARNING—lock all but 5 of my workspaces and hold me hostage to upgrade to free them OR require an SSO connection just to export my own data.</p><p>That, my good friends, is highly unethical business behavior.</p></blockquote>



<p>As you can tell, I was livid.</p>



<p>Thankfully, in the time it took me to go take a short walk and blow off steam, Alex Young at Workona sent me a reply via email.</p>



<blockquote><p>We’re sorry for the frustration this has caused. To start, you should be able to access all of your existing workspaces if you click the “Open workspace” button when you see the Upgrade modal. We are not locking any users out of their workspaces.&nbsp;</p><p>As for SSO, this is just needed to authenticate you for security purposes. You signed in via SSO, and as a result, that’s how we need to verify you.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>Alex was right. Despite what the upgrade dialog said, the “Open workspace” button that was greyed out (the universal signal that a button is not functional) did in fact work if you clicked it. So I wasn’t locked out of all-but-5 of my workspaces. They had just made it look that way.</p>



 End of Act 2. 



<p>Act 3 began a few hours later after I finished the work I was under deadline for and finally replied to Alex’s email:</p>



<blockquote><p>Alex, I appreciate the rapid response to my email. I have no idea if&nbsp;Workona&nbsp;has an automatic timer for when that “upgrade prompt” appears for a user or whether&nbsp;Workona&nbsp;just applied the policy today. (If the latter, I worry that you and the rest of the support staff have been flooded with complaints like mine today.)</p><p>Honestly—and feel free to share this within the company—I would have been much more supportive if the whole thing had been messaged differently. For example:</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>First, an advanced notice could have been made that explained the change in policy—there was NO WARNING whatsoever.</p><p>Second, the upgrade could have explained that you can still access the rest of your workspaces, you just have to go through the nag screen.</p><p>But the best way to handle it would have been to be upfront from the start and explain that the free version supports up to 5 workspaces and beyond that, you have to subscribe.</p></blockquote>



<p>That began a dialog in several more rounds of email with Alex where he acknowledged my criticisms and explained the rationale behind the upgrade policy. I particularly appreciated this one:</p>



<blockquote><p>We did send out an email to all of our users that the change would be happening – are you subscribed to receive our emails?&nbsp;</p><p>As for the rest of your feedback, I have passed this along to our product team.&nbsp;<br>Also – a little background regarding our current pricing: We have had to overcome immense technical challenges in the development of what we believe is the world’s best browser&nbsp;work&nbsp;manager.</p><p>Work&nbsp;has steadily moved from the desktop to the cloud, and many people do almost all of their most important&nbsp;work&nbsp;in the browser these days. For people that&nbsp;work&nbsp;in the browser, $7 is a good match to the value our app provides, and our pricing survey data backs this up. If you don’t&nbsp;work&nbsp;in the browser, or don’t feel you need a professional/reliable&nbsp;work&nbsp;management system, then we certainly understand that a different solution may be a better fit. We hope this helps you better understand why&nbsp;Workona&nbsp;has the premium pricing it does.</p></blockquote>



<p>It turns out that Workona had indeed sent out an advance notice (in email, not in their browser extension) of their change in policy in late August. I was on vacation, naturally, so I had missed it. </p>



<p>When I found it and read it—it was perfectly reasonable. And, although I thought $7/mo was a little on the high side for Workona (I use Zoom 6+ hours a day and it’s $15/mo), I really did feel that Workona represented the future of work in the browser.</p>



<p>I was going to wait until the next day to decide about upgrading. But before I went to bed, Alex had assuaged me enough—and most importantly restored my belief in the intent and integrity of Workona as a company—that I went ahead and subscribed for a year.</p>



<p>That was a pretty dramatic turnaround in a single evening. Kudos to Alex for his premium customer service. As I said to him in my final message:</p>



<blockquote><p>Alex, FYI, I subscribed for the 1 year plan. I want to personally thank you for talking me off the ledge. That’s the kind of customer service that makes or breaks a company IMHO.<br>I have high hopes for&nbsp;Workona. Keep being awesome.</p></blockquote>



 EPILOG 



<p>Today there was another upgrade message from Workona. When I clicked on it, a screen popped up (I had the foresight to take a screenshot) that offered an apology directly to Workona users right there in the browser. It contained a link to <a href="https://workona.com/blog/update-to-premium-plans/">this page on the Workona website</a>, the start of which I’ll excerpt here:</p>



 An Apology From Our CEO 



 



<p>September 24, 2021</p>



<blockquote><p>This week, we made some serious missteps while launching Workona’s premium plans. Please allow me to personally apologize and explain exactly what what we’ve done to make it right.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>We assumed that a detailed email sent a month ago announcing the changes was enough advance notice for users. Clearly, we were wrong. Your feedback has made it obvious that this was a major mistake. We should have announced this in the product, multiple times. We messed up, and we’re sorry.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Many users were caught off guard by the restrictions of the Free plan and wondered whether Workona was still a good option for them. This was exacerbated by the unclear language we used in our popup, which made them believe they were locked out of their workspaces. This was not the case (and not our intention), but that doesn’t change the damage it did to our users’ trust in Workona.</p></blockquote>



<p>There’s more. I encourage you to go to the Workona website and read the rest.</p>



<p>I took the time to write this post—my first one in two years—because when you screw up as a company—no matter how big or small—this is how you make it right. You bite the bullet, admit your mistake, and fix it, no matter how much work it takes.</p>



<p>The faster and more transparently you do it, the faster you repair the damage and start restoring faith in your company.</p>



<p>Good job, Workona. (And great job, Alex.) My faith in you has been restored, and I’ll continue to recommend you as a browser work management tool. Keep growing it into something even more amazing.</p>

<p>A few months back, I wrote about some of the edge points of the verifiable credentials data model and briefly mentioned that the authorization capabilities for linked data (ZCAP-LD) data model was a useful technology for addressing these edges for building better distributed authorization systems. So what are the differences between these two data models and why am I advocating for the separation of concerns for the two of them? The three main points I want to highlight are the conceptual differences in usages and how the data models assist with enforcing those concepts. Then I’ll highlight the differences in the data models and finally, I’ll connect it all to show how these differences make a difference when building distributed authorization systems.</p>

<p>Conceptually verifiable credentials exist to make provenanced assertions. What does this mean though? Basically, a verifiable credential is a way to know who is making the claims, what the claims are, and who the claims are about and it’s done in a standard way so that all parties who issue, hold, and verify the provenance of the claims can do so without having to pre-coordinate their software design. On the other hand, authorization capabilities (ZCAPs) are designed around removing the concept of who the statements are about and rather building around the concept of an “invoker”. And it’s this difference that allows for an emergence of a different authorization system called object capabilities authorization systems. It’s my personal opinion that object-capability systems are better for most security models being designed today due to the simplicity for relying parties, but we’ll have to save that discussion for a later post.</p>

<p>What’s the difference between a subject and an invoker then? The difference is all in the practicality of pairing the claims with the entity. In the verifiable credential by tying all the claims to a subject there’s an inherent coupling of the claims to identity by the issuer. In technical terms, it’s being paired to an identifier which is the “credentialSubject.id” property which means that the claims that are made should only be extended to a single entity which is the subject of the claims. Anything which extends beyond the original claims made by the issuer is a new credential that needs to be evaluated independently of the original veracity of the claims made by the first issuer.</p>

<p>For example, let’s look at a proof of assets credential:</p>

   <code>{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
    {
        "@vocab": "https://bank.com/vocab#"
    }
  ],
  "id": "http://example.edu/credentials/1872",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "ProofOfAssetsCredential"],
  "issuer": "did:web:bank.com:branch:id:565049",
  "issuanceDate": "2021-06-04T20:50:09Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:bankAccountOwner",
    "TotalAccountValueInUSD": 4156.62,
  },
  "proof": {
    "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
    "created": "2021-06-04T20:50:29Z",
    "verificationMethod": "did:example:bankAccountOwner#key-0",
    "proofPurpose": "authentication",
    "proofValue": "..."
  }
}
</code>   

<p>In this example, we can see that a bank branch is asserting on behalf of the bank that the bank account owner has a total account value with this bank of $4156.62. Now, let’s say the bank account owner has decided to chain their credential to their child so that their child can spend up to $50:</p>

   <code>{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
    {
        "@vocab": "https://bank.com/vocab#"
    }
  ],
  "id": "http://example.edu/credentials/1872",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "ProofOfAssetsCredential"],
  "issuer": "did:example:bankAccountOwner",
  "issuanceDate": "2010-01-01T20:54:24Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:child",
    "TotalAccountValueInUSD": 50.00,
  },
  "proof": {
    "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
    "created": "2017-06-18T21:19:10Z",
    "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
    "verificationMethod": "did:example:bankAccountOwner#key1",
    "proofValue": "..."
  }
}
</code>   

<p>and with this the child is now able to create a verifiable presentation like this:</p>

   <code>{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
   {
    "@vocab": "https://bank.com/vocab"

</code>   

<p>Let’s break down what is being asserted here, who the verifier needs to trust, and how the verifier would go about processing this verifiable presentation. From what we can see here, the bank is asserting that the bank account owner has a total account value of $4156.62, the bank account owner is asserting that their child is authorized to spend $50.00. Seems to make sense, right? Yeah, but the problem here is how is the verifier supposed to be able to trust that the bank account owner verified the child has that money as well, but why should the verifier trust the bank account owner? From their perspective, there are two problems here. First, they don’t trust any random person to make assertions about the amount of money in another person’s bank account. Second, the verifier is unable to correlate the relationship between the bank account owner and the child. From their perspective, the <code>credentialSubject.id</code> should be expected to be two opaque identifiers assuming all they’ve received is this verifiable presentation. So, the problem here is that the verifier is expected to infer knowledge about what is being stated here which presents risks in the business processes being encoded into software. Are they to assume that they’ll be paid by the bank account owner if the child doesn’t pay? The reality is the verifier shouldn’t rely upon this verifiable presentation because there’s no way to chain the trust and figure out the capabilities that the child should have based only on this verifiable presentation. Sure, they could manage some state about the relationships of the identifiers and coordinate with the bank to know that they’ll make sure someone pays, but that leads to bespoke authorization systems built specifically to the business logic which is unlikely to scale to the size of the internet today within a reasonable time frame. Coordination costs are incredibly expensive (look at how long it takes to make a standard) and managing state makes it nearly impossible to generalize the system outside the particular business process it’s designed for.</p>

<p>How do ZCAPs address this problem then? First off, it’s important to recognize that the model of capabilities lends itself to different statements being made. In the verifiable credential model, traditionally most people using them are making claims about “what the subject is”. Whereas with ZCAP-LD I’ve seen the focus of the statements on what the invoker can do. This slight shift combined with the change from a subject to an invoker changes the focus of the verifier to simplify what needs to be checked and makes the checks more explicit for what they’re checking.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at an example to see what I mean by this:</p>

   <code>{
  "@context": ["https://w3id.org/security/v2",
  {
      "@vocab": "https://bank.com/vocab#"
  }],

  // The identifier of this specific zcap object
  "id": "https://example.com/zcap/id/1",

  // Since this is the first delegated capability, the parentCapability
  // points to the target this capability will operate against
  // (in this case, a payment gateway)
  "parentCapability": "https://example.com/paymentGateway",
  
  // the bank account owner is only allowed to spend the amount in their account
  "caveat": [{
       "type": "MaxPayment",
        "maxPaymentValue": 4156.62
  }],

  // We are granting authority to any of bankAccountOwner's verification methods
  "invoker": "did:example:bankAccountOwner",
  
  // Finally we sign this object with cryptographic material from
  // Alyssa's Car's capabilityDelegation field, and using the
  // capabilityDelegation proofPurpose.
  "proof": {
    "type": "Ed25519Signature2018",
    "created": "2018-02-13T21:26:08Z",
    "capabilityChain": [

    "proofValue": "...",
    "proofPurpose": "capabilityDelegation",
    "verificationMethod": "did:web:bank.com:branch:id:565049#key1"
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Now for the bank account owner to authorize their child to spend $50.00 they need to produce the following delegated capability:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": ["https://w3id.org/security/v2",
    {
        "@vocab": "https://bank.com/vocab#"
    }],

    // The identifier of this specific delegated zcap object
    "id": "https://example.com/zcap/id/2",

    // Pointing up the chain at the capability from
    // which the bank Account Owner was initially 
    // granted authority by their bank
    "parentCapability": "https://example.com/zcap/id/1",

    // Bank account owner adds a caveat:
    // child can spend a maximum of 50.00
    "caveat": [{
       "type": "MaxPayment",
        "maxPaymentValue": 50.00
    }],

    // bank account owner grants authority to any
    // verification method of their child's DID
    "invoker": "did:example:child",

    // Finally the bank account owner signs this 
    // object with the key she was granted the 
    // authority with
    "proof": {
        "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
        "proofPurpose": "capabilityDelegation",
        "created": "2018-02-13T21:26:08Z",
        "creator": "did:example:bankAccountOwner#key1",
        "signatureValue": "..."
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Now for the ZCAP to be invoked by the child at the payment gateway to spend $50 they need to produce a ZCAP that looks like the following:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": ["https://w3id.org/security/v2",
    {
        "@vocab": "https://bank.com/vocab#"
    }],

    // The identifier of this specific delegated zcap object
    "id": "https://example.com/zcap/id/3",

    // Pointing up the chain at the capability from
    // which the bank Account Owner was initially 
    // granted authority by their bank
    "parentCapability": "https://example.com/zcap/id/2",

    // bank account owner grants authority to any
    // verification method of their child's DID
    "invoker": "did:example:child",

    // the chain of capabilities from the trusted entity
    // making the intial authorization to the current 
    // capability being invoked 
    "capabilityChain": [{
        "@context": ["https://w3id.org/security/v2",
        {
            "@vocab": "https://bank.com/vocab#"
        }],
        "id": "https://example.com/zcap/id/1",
        "parentCapability": "https://example.com/paymentGateway",
        "caveat": [{
            "type": "MaxPayment",
                "maxPaymentValue": 4156.62
        }],
        "invoker": "did:example:bankAccountOwner",
        "proof": {
            "type": "Ed25519Signature2018",
            "created": "2018-02-13T21:26:08Z",
            "capabilityChain": [
            "https://example.com/paymentGateway"
            ],
            "proofValue": "...",
            "proofPurpose": "capabilityDelegation",
            "verificationMethod": "did:web:bank.com:branch:id:565049#key1"
        }
    },
    {
        "@context": ["https://w3id.org/security/v2",
        {
            "@vocab": "https://bank.com/vocab#"
        }],
        "id": "https://example.com/zcap/id/2",
        "parentCapability": "https://example.com/zcap/id/1",
        "caveat": [{
            "type": "MaxPayment",
            "maxPaymentValue": 50.00
        }],
        "invoker": "did:example:child",
        "proof": {
            "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
            "proofPurpose": "capabilityDelegation",
            "created": "2018-02-13T21:26:08Z",
            "creator": "did:example:bankAccountOwner#key1",
            "signatureValue": "..."
        }
    }],
    "proof": {
        "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
        "proofPurpose": "capabilityInvocation",
        "created": "2018-02-13T21:27:09Z",
        "creator": "did:example:child#key1",
        "signatureValue": "..."
    }
}
</code>   

<p>To verify this ZCAP, the payment gateway verifier needs to do the following:</p>

 
   verify the proof of the original capability 
   verify the original invoker is authorized to delegate the original capability on behalf of the payment gateway 
   verify the original capability meets or exceeds the authorities necessary to perform the request 
   verify the proof that the bank account owner delegated the original capability to the invoker 
   verify the caveats allow the delegated capability to still meet or exceed the authorities necessary to perform the request 
   verify the proof in the capability invoked by the child 
 

<p>So this is a bit simpler for the payment gateway verifying the chain and makes it explicit what’s being delegated through the different parties. The question of the relationship between the different parties has now been eliminated which means that the payment gateway can operate in a stateless method. Additionally, there’s less coordination between the original delegator and the payment gateway verifier. In the object capabilities model, the authorization semantics are all predetermined by what is possible to be authorized which keeps the claims tightly scoped to the purpose of the capabilities being invoked.</p>

<p>The difference here is that the basis of all authority stems from the verifier rather than building off the statements that existed before the verifier did who may not have designed the original claims for authorization systems. And this key difference is what allows for the simplicity of the verifier system to exist. It moves the model back to having the sole authority set by the verifier rather than the verifier having to adapt and potentially misinterpret the original veracity and the chained veracity of the claims.</p>

<p>So what are the drawbacks of the object-capability paradigm and more specifically of the ZCAP-LD data model? Well first and foremost, ZCAPs are fit for building object-capability authorization models and are unlikely to be applicable beyond that intended scope. For me, that’s alright because I like the idea of designing technology to do one thing well. Especially when dealing with security and access control. Whereas the verifiable credentials data model allows for generic statements to be made which are far more useful for verifiable data ecosystems to emerge. Additionally, it’s worth mentioning that the ZCAPs data model is a relatively immature draft report at the credentials community group whereas the verifiable credentials data model has a much more stable recommendation having completed the process to become an international standard recommended by the W3C. This means there’s far more likely to be interoperability between verifiable credential processors than there would be between ZCAPs.</p>

<p>Why put the time and effort into ZCAP-LD when we’ve already got VCs? Simply put because security is hard and trying to push square pegs into round holes oftentimes leads to bugs that are elevated to mission-critical authentication/authorization bypass vulnerabilities. By designing around a fit-for-purpose data model with a well-defined problem being solved it allows for us to be much more precise about where we believe extensibility is important versus where normative statements should be made to simplify the processing of the data models. By extension, this leads to a simpler security model and likely a much more robust design with fewer vulnerabilities. And that’s the reason that I’m a fan of ZCAP-LD.</p>

      <br>  Can we live at the peak paradox?  <br> <p><a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/">Peak Paradox</a> is the middlemost point of the model. It is the point where everything has equal weight in terms of policy, priority, resources, commitment, interest, data and consequences.&nbsp; It is the area of a perfect storm.&nbsp; It is a magical (or imaginary) place where you can have everything, everyone else can have everything, no one is fighting for survival, and every work situation thrives.&nbsp; In reality, the converse is probably also true. It is where everyone fights for survival; I cannot get what I want, others have nothing and work is just meaningless. It is in between these two states of euphoria and despair that we spend our time.&nbsp; Never reaching utopia but somehow constantly individual’s individual’s feeling one step closer to dystopia.&nbsp; In this state, we have to decide how to allocate the limited resources we have to be able to change the situation (for the better.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Whilst hard to accept, we actually don’t have the data, model or ability to allocate resources for better outcomes as we live in a complex system. In our ecosystem and economy, our actions have consequences that we cannot see. In the USA, they reintroduced wolves and have found that Wolves play a crucial role in keeping ecosystems healthy. They help keep deer and elk populations in check, benefiting individual’s many other plant and animal species. The carcasses of their prey also help to redistribute nutrients and provide food for other wildlife species, like grizzly bears and scavengers. Scientists are just beginning to fully understand the positive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_effect">ripple effects</a> that wolves have on ecosystems. The removal of the wolves was forecast to create a more vibrant and healthy ecosystem, but it turns out it collapses without them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The Ripple Effect is when an initial disturbance to a system propagates outward to disturb an increasingly more significant portion of the system, like ripples expanding across the water when an object is dropped into it.&nbsp; The ripple effect is often used colloquially to mean a multiplier in macroeconomics. For example, an individual's reduction in spending reduces the incomes of others and their ability to spend. Unions negotiating for a pay rise drives prosperity for everyone. In sociology, the ripple effect can be observed in how social interactions can affect situations not directly related to the initial interaction and in charitable activities where information can be disseminated and passed from community to community to broaden its impact.&nbsp; The concept has been applied in computer science within the field of software metrics as a complexity measure.</p><p>Living at peak paradox and making decisions at this central point creates ripples. However, we find it easy to predict the positive consequences of ripples we want to see in the direction of the peak purpose we are aiming for on the Peak Paradox model.&nbsp; We are blinded to the adverse effects because we believe we have understood the risks and concluded this is the best action, given where we are and our resources.&nbsp; Equally, we find it near impossible to see any good or bad consequences that can occur in other directions.&nbsp; The point here is that we cannot see how a ripple in a different direction will come back (forward) and change the situation we forecast.&nbsp; This is the complexity of modelling dependent systems that we do not understand, yet believing we have a risk model that does.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The purpose of the Peak Paradox model is to shine a light on the other views, other perspectives, other consequences, other risks - not to change the decision, but to clarify how our decision will affect others and we are affected by theirs.&nbsp; With the same thinking, others acting with their own agency will optimise for a different peak and, in doing so, create ripples in our tank, highlighting why resilience has become such an important but widely misunderstood topic.&nbsp; We must agree on what we are trying to be resilient for, as it is often hidden.&nbsp;</p><p>The article on <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/plotting-how-to-make-better-decisions">how to make better decisions</a> using the Peak Pardox framework suggests that we have to move from the Peak Paradox if we can clarify what we are optimising for and bring the team together.&nbsp; However, the further we become aligned to a Purpose, whilst the easier the decision, the more unified the culture, the less resilient we become to others ripples.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Balancing simplicity of decision making, with the allocation of resources and understanding risk and consequences is the optimisation model a board now has to wrestle with. Decision making has never been more challenging.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p></p><br><br>

  <p>Summary: JSON has its place. But I think we're overusing it in places where a good notation would serve us better.</p>



<p>
    JSON is robot barf. Don't get me wrong. JSON is a fine serialization format for data and I have no problem with it in that context. My beef is with the use of JSON for configuration files, policy specs, and so on. If JSON were all we had, then we'd have to live with it. But we've been building parsers for almost 70 years now. The technology is well understood. There are multiple libraries in every language for parsing. And yet, even very mature, well supported frameworks and platforms persist in using JSON instead of a human-friendly notation. 
</p>

<p>
    When a system requires programmers to use JSON, what they're effectively asking developers to use an "abstract" syntax instead of a "concrete" syntax. Here's what I mean. This is a function definition in concrete syntax:
</p>



<p>
    And here's the same function definition expressed as an abstract syntax tree (AST) serialized as JSON:
</p>



<p>
    I don't know any programmer who'd prefer to write the abstract syntax instead of the concrete. Can you imagine an entire program expressed like that? Virtually unreadable and definitely not maintainable. <a href="https://blog.sessionstack.com/how-javascript-works-parsing-abstract-syntax-trees-asts-5-tips-on-how-to-minimize-parse-time-abfcf7e8a0c8"> Parsing can take as much as 20% of the time taken to compile code</a>, so there's a clear performance win in using abstract syntax over concrete, but even so we, correctly, let the machine do the work. 
</p>

<p>
    I get that systems often start out simply with simple configuration. Some inputs are just hierarchies of data. But that often gets more complicated over time. And spending time figuring out the parser when you're excited to just get it working can feel like a burden. But taking the shortcut of making developers and others write the configuration in abstract syntax instead of letting the computer do the work is a mistake. 
</p>

<p>
    I'd like to say that the problem is that not enough programmers have a proper CS education, but I fear that's not true. I suspect that even people who've studied CS aren't comfortable with parsing and developing notations. Maybe it's because we treat the subject too esoterically—seemingly useful for people designing a programming language, but not much else. And students pick up on that and figure this is something, like calculus, they're unlikely to ever use IRL. What if programming langauge classes helped students learn the joy and benefit of building little languages instead? 
</p>

<p>
    I'm a big believer in the power of notation. And I think we too often shy away from designing the right notation for the job. As I wrote about <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2007/11/domain_specific_language.shtml">Domain Specific Languages</a> (DSLs) in 2007:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        I'm in the middle of reading Walter Isaacson's new biography of Einstein. It's clear that notation played a major role in his ability to come up with the principle of general relativity. He demurred at first, believing that the math was for someone else to come along later and tidy up. But later in his life, after the experience of working on general relativity, Einstein became an ardent convert.</p>
    <p>
        Similarly, there is power in notation for computing tasks. Not merely the advantage of parameterized execution but in it's ability to allow us to think about problems, express them so that other's can clearly and unambiguously see our thoughts, and collaborate to create joint solutions. What's more, languages can be versioned. GUI configurations are hard to version. Notation has advantages even when it's not executed.</p>
    <p>
        The DSL becomes the focal point for design activities. The other day, I was having a discussion with three friends about a particular feature. Pulling out pencil and paper and writing what the DSL would need to look like to support the feature helped all of us focus and come up with solutions. Without such a tool, I'm not sure how we would have communicated the issues or whether we'd have all had the same conception of them and the ultimate solution we reached.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
    As this points out, clear notations have advantages beyond being easier to write and understand. They also provide the means to easily share and think about the problem. I think system designers would be better off if we spent more time thinking about the notation developers will use when they configure and use our systems, making it clear and easy to read and write. Good notation is a thinking tool, not just a way to control the system. The result will be increased expressiveness, design leverage, and freedom.

<p>This article shows how to create Microsoft Teams online meetings in ASP.NET Core using Microsoft Graph. Azure AD is used to implement the authentication using Microsoft.Identity.Web and the authenticated user can create teams meetings and send emails to all participants or attendees of the meeting.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/TeamsAdminUI">https://github.com/damienbod/TeamsAdminUI</a></p>



<p>Blogs in this series</p>



  <a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/09/20/creating-microsoft-teams-meetings-in-asp-net-core-using-microsoft-graph/">Creating Microsoft Teams meetings in ASP.NET Core using Microsoft Graph</a> (delegated)  <a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/10/18/creating-microsoft-teams-meetings-in-asp-net-core-using-microsoft-graph-application-permissions-part-2/">Creating Microsoft Teams meetings in ASP.NET Core using Microsoft Graph application permissions part 2</a>  



<p>Setup Azure App registration</p>



<p>An Azure App registration is setup to authenticate against Azure AD. The ASP.NET Core application will use delegated permissions for the Microsoft Graph. The listed permissions underneath are required to create the teams meetings and to send emails to the attendees. The account used to login needs access to office and should be able to send emails.</p>



  User.Read   Mail.Send   Mail.ReadWrite   OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite  



<p>This is the list of permissions I have activate for this demo. </p>







<p>The Azure App registration requires a user secret or a certificate to authentication the ASP.NET Core Razor page application. Microsoft.Identity.Web uses this to authenticate the application. You should always authenticate the application if possible. </p>



<p>Setup ASP.NET Core application</p>



<p>The Microsoft.Identity.Web Nuget packages with the MicrosoftGraphBeta package are used to implement the Azure AD client. We want to implement Open ID Connect code flow with PKCE and a secret to authenticate the identity and the Microsoft packages implements this client for us. </p>


  &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
&lt;PackageReference 
	Include="Microsoft.Identity.Web" 
	Version="1.16.1" /&gt;
&lt;PackageReference 
	Include="Microsoft.Identity.Web.UI" 
	Version="1.16.1" /&gt;
&lt;PackageReference 
	Include="Microsoft.Identity.Web.MicrosoftGraphBeta" 
	Version="1.16.1" /&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
  


<p>The ConfigureServices method is used to add the required services for the Azure AD client authentication and the Microsoft Graph client for the API calls. The AddMicrosoftGraph is used to initialize the required permissions.</p>


  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	// more services ...

	var scopes = "User.read Mail.Send Mail.ReadWrite OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite";

	services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(Configuration)
		.EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi()
		.AddMicrosoftGraph("https://graph.microsoft.com/beta", scopes)
		.AddInMemoryTokenCaches();

	services.AddRazorPages().AddMvcOptions(options =&gt;
	{
		var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
			.RequireAuthenticatedUser()
			.Build();
		options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
	}).AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();
}
  


<p>The AzureAd configuration is read from the app.settings file. The secrets are read from the user secrets in local development.</p>


  "AzureAd": {
	"Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
	"Domain": "damienbodsharepoint.onmicrosoft.com",
	"TenantId": "5698af84-5720-4ff0-bdc3-9d9195314244",
	"ClientId": "a611a690-9f96-424f-9ea5-4ba99a642c01",
	"CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc",
	"SignedOutCallbackPath ": "/signout-callback-oidc"
	// "ClientSecret": "add secret to the user secrets"
},
  


<p>Creating a Teams meeting using Microsoft Graph</p>



<p>The OnlineMeeting class from Microsoft.Graph is used to create the teams meeting. In this demo, we added a begin and an end DateTime in UTC and the name (Subject) of the meeting. We want that all invited attendees can bypass the lobby and enter directly into the meeting. This is implemented with the LobbyBypassSettings property. The attendees are added to the meeting using the Upn property and setting this with the email of each attendee. The organizer is automatically set to the identity signed in. </p>


  public OnlineMeeting CreateTeamsMeeting(
	string meeting, DateTimeOffset begin, DateTimeOffset end)
{

	var onlineMeeting = new OnlineMeeting
	{
		StartDateTime = begin,
		EndDateTime = end,
		Subject = meeting,
		LobbyBypassSettings = new LobbyBypassSettings
		{
			Scope = LobbyBypassScope.Everyone
		}
	};

	return onlineMeeting;
}

public OnlineMeeting AddMeetingParticipants(
	OnlineMeeting onlineMeeting, List&lt;string&gt; attendees)
{
	var meetingAttendees = new List&lt;MeetingParticipantInfo&gt;();
	foreach(var attendee in attendees)
	{
		if(!string.IsNullOrEmpty(attendee))
		{
			meetingAttendees.Add(new MeetingParticipantInfo
			{
				Upn = attendee.Trim()
			});
		}
	}

	if(onlineMeeting.Participants == null)
	{
		onlineMeeting.Participants = new MeetingParticipants();
	};

	onlineMeeting.Participants.Attendees = meetingAttendees;

	return onlineMeeting;
}
  


<p>A simple service is used to implement the GraphServiceClient instance which is used to send the Microsoft Graph requests. This uses the Microsoft Graph as described by the docs.</p>


  public async Task&lt;OnlineMeeting&gt; CreateOnlineMeeting(
	OnlineMeeting onlineMeeting)
{
	return await _graphServiceClient.Me
		.OnlineMeetings
		.Request()
		.AddAsync(onlineMeeting);
}

public async Task&lt;OnlineMeeting&gt; UpdateOnlineMeeting(
	OnlineMeeting onlineMeeting)
{
	return await _graphServiceClient.Me
		.OnlineMeetings[onlineMeeting.Id]
		.Request()
		.UpdateAsync(onlineMeeting);
}

public async Task&lt;OnlineMeeting&gt; GetOnlineMeeting(
	string onlineMeetingId)
{
	return await _graphServiceClient.Me
		.OnlineMeetings[onlineMeetingId]
		.Request()
		.GetAsync();
}
  


<p>A Razor page is used to create a new Microsoft Teams online meeting. The two services are added to the class and a HTTP Post method implements the form request from the Razor page. This method creates the Microsoft Teams meeting using the services and redirects to the created Razor page with the ID of the meeting. </p>


  [AuthorizeForScopes(Scopes = new string[] { "User.read", "Mail.Send", "Mail.ReadWrite", "OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite" })]
public class CreateTeamsMeetingModel : PageModel
{
	private readonly AadGraphApiDelegatedClient _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient;
	private readonly TeamsService _teamsService;

	public string JoinUrl { get; set; }

	[BindProperty]
	public DateTimeOffset Begin { get; set; }
	[BindProperty]
	public DateTimeOffset End { get; set; }
	[BindProperty]
	public string AttendeeEmail { get; set; }
	[BindProperty]
	public string MeetingName { get; set; }

	public CreateTeamsMeetingModel(AadGraphApiDelegatedClient aadGraphApiDelegatedClient,
		TeamsService teamsService)
	{
		_aadGraphApiDelegatedClient = aadGraphApiDelegatedClient;
		_teamsService = teamsService;
	}

	public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnPostAsync()
	{
		if (!ModelState.IsValid)
		{
			return Page();
		}

		var meeting = _teamsService.CreateTeamsMeeting(MeetingName, Begin, End);

		var attendees = AttendeeEmail.Split(';');
		List&lt;string&gt; items = new();
		items.AddRange(attendees);
		var updatedMeeting = _teamsService.AddMeetingParticipants(
		  meeting, items);

		var createdMeeting = await _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient.CreateOnlineMeeting(updatedMeeting);

		JoinUrl = createdMeeting.JoinUrl;

		return RedirectToPage("./CreatedTeamsMeeting", "Get", new { meetingId = createdMeeting.Id });
	}

	public void OnGet()
	{
		Begin = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow;
		End = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddMinutes(60);
	}
}
  


<p>Sending Emails to attendees using Microsoft Graph</p>



<p>The Created Razor page displays the meeting JoinUrl and some details of the Teams meeting. The page implements a form which can send emails to all the attendees using Microsoft Graph. The EmailService class implements the email logic to send plain mails or HTML mails using the Microsoft Graph.</p>

<p>The CreatedTeamsMeetingModel class is used to implement the Razor page logic to display some meeting details and send emails using a form post request. The OnGetAsync uses the meetingId to request the Teams meeting using Microsoft Graph and displays the data in the UI. The OnPostAsync method sends emails to all attendees.</p>


  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using TeamsAdminUI.GraphServices;
using Microsoft.Graph;

namespace TeamsAdminUI.Pages
{
    public class CreatedTeamsMeetingModel : PageModel
    {
        private readonly AadGraphApiDelegatedClient _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient;
        private readonly EmailService _emailService;

        public CreatedTeamsMeetingModel(
            AadGraphApiDelegatedClient aadGraphApiDelegatedClient,
            EmailService emailService)
        {
            _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient = aadGraphApiDelegatedClient;
            _emailService = emailService;
        }

        [BindProperty]
        public OnlineMeeting Meeting {get;set;}

        [BindProperty]
        public string EmailSent { get; set; }

        public async Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; OnGetAsync(string meetingId)
        {
            Meeting = await _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient.GetOnlineMeeting(meetingId);
            return Page();
        }

        public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnPostAsync(string meetingId)
        {
            Meeting = await _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient.GetOnlineMeeting(meetingId);
            foreach (var attendee in Meeting.Participants.Attendees)
            {
                var recipient = attendee.Upn.Trim();
                var message = _emailService.CreateStandardEmail(recipient, Meeting.Subject, Meeting.JoinUrl);
                await _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient.SendEmailAsync(message);
            }

            EmailSent = "Emails sent to all attendees, please check your mailbox";
            return Page();
        }

    }
}
  


<p>The created Razor page implements the HTML display logic and adds a form to send the emails. The JoinUrl is displayed as this is what you need to open the meeting a Microsoft Teams application.</p>


  @page "{handler?}"
@model TeamsAdminUI.Pages.CreatedTeamsMeetingModel
@{
}

&lt;h4&gt;Teams Meeting Created: @Model.Meeting.Subject&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Meeting Id:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Model.Meeting.Id&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;JoinUrl&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Model.Meeting.JoinUrl&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Participants&lt;/h4&gt;

@foreach(var attendee in Model.Meeting.Participants.Attendees)
{
	&lt;p&gt;@attendee.Upn&lt;/p&gt;
}

&lt;form method="post"&gt;
    &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;input type="hidden" value="@Model.Meeting.Id" /&gt;
        &lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary"&gt;&lt;i class="fas fa-save"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Send Mail to attendees&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Model.EmailSent&lt;/p&gt;
  


<p>Testing</p>



<p>When the application is started, you can create a new Teams meeting with the required details. The logged in user must have an account with access to Office and be on the same tenant as the Azure App registration setup for the Microsoft Graph permissions. The Teams meeting is organized using the identity that signed in because we used the delegated permissions. </p>







<p>Once the meeting is created, the created Razor page is opened with the details. You can send an email to all attendees or use the JoinUrl directly to open up the Teams meeting.</p>







<p>Creating Teams meetings and sending emails in ASP.NET Core is really useful and I will do a few following up posts to this as there is so much more you can do here once this is integrated.</p>

 I enjoyed reading The Code of Capital by Katharina Pistor.  I liked this book because it provides what seems like a rare perspective that is required to reveal the DNA of capitalism rather than the more common unintended obfuscation from books that are lacking.

<p>I enjoyed reading <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691178974/the-code-of-capital">The Code of Capital</a> by <a href="https://www.law.columbia.edu/faculty/katharina-pistor">Katharina Pistor</a>.  I liked this book because it provides what seems like a rare perspective that is required to reveal the DNA of capitalism rather than the more common unintended obfuscation from books that are lacking.  A benefit is that emerging technologies related to assets can be considered in a more coherent way and we can see that issues which seem new often resemble those of the past.</p>

<p>For instance, Pistor asks the genesis question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How should the initial allocation of property rights in the digital world be achieved, and who is in charge?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While my mind somehow retrieves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWiwYApseDk">Otisburg</a>, Pistor more helpfully notes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These are the same questions the commoners disputed with the landlords and the settler challenged the First Peoples about, as discussed in Chapter 2.  Ultimately, these issues were resolved by establishing legal priority rights, backed by the coercive powers of the state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Law relating to capital is often created in private law offices but is dependent on the state for the legal modules used to assemble these legal codes.  The most important of these modules are contract law, property rights, collateral law, trust, corporate and bankruptcy law.</p>

<p>These legal codes transform an asset (object, claim, skill or idea) into capital.  Because the legal coding gives the asset attributes of priority, durability, universality and convertability, the asset can create wealth for its holder while surviving challenging economic circumstances and externalizing associated risks to others.  The book goes into detail as the legal modules are applied to new assets over time.</p>

<p>Following the evolution of these legal codes helped me understand things that had been a mystery to me.  I wish I could have read a book like this a long time ago.</p>

  <p>Summary:    Identity finds its way into everything—even toothbrushes. Careful planning can overcome privacy concerns to yield real benefits to businesses and customers alike.</p>


<p>
    I have a Philips Sonicare toothbrush. One of the features is a little yellow light that comes on to tell me that the head needs to be changed. The first time the light came on, I wondered how I would reset it once I got a new toothbrush head. I even googled it to find out. 
</p>

<p>
    Turns out I needn't have bothered. Once I changed the head the light went off. This didn't happen when I just removed the old head and put it back on. The toothbrush heads have a unique identity that the toothbrush recognizes. This identity is not only used to signal head replacement, but also to put the toothbrush into different modes based on the type of head installed. 
</p>

<p>
    Philips calls this <a href="https://www.electricteeth.com/sonicare-brushsync/">BrushSync</a>, but it's just RFID technology underneath the branding. Each head has an RFID chip embedded in it and the toothbrush body reads the data off the head and adjusts its internal state in the appropriate way.
</p>

<p>
    I like this use case RFID because it's got clear benefits for both Philips and their customers. Philips sells more toothbrush heads—so the internet of things (IoT) use case is clearly aligned with business goals. Customers get reminders to replace their toothbrush head and can reset the reminder by simply doing what they'd do anyway—switch the head
</p>

<p>
    There aren't many privacy concerns at present. But as more and more products include RFID chips, you could imagine scanners on garbage trucks that correlate what gets used and thrown out with an address. I guess we need garbage cans that can disable RFID chips when they're thrown away. 
</p>

<p>
    I was recently talking to a friend of mine, Eric Olafson, who is a founding investor in <a href="https://www.riotinsight.com">Riot</a>. Riot is another example of how thoughtfully applied RFID-based identifiers can solve business and customer problems. Riot creates tech that companies can use for RFID-based, in-store inventory management. This solves a big problem for stores that often don't know what inventory they have on hand. With Riot, a quick scan of the store each morning updates the inventory management system, showing where the inventory data is out of sync with the physical inventory. As more and more of us go to the physical store because the app told us they had the product we wanted, it's nice to know the app isn't lying. Riot puts the RFID on the tag, not the clothing, dealing with many of the privacy concerns.
</p>

<p>
    Both BrushSync and Riot use identity to solve business problems, showing'that unique identifiers on individual products can be good for business and customers alike. This speaks to the breadth of identity and its importance in areas beyond associating identifiers with people. I've noticed an uptick in discussions at <a href="http://internetidentityworkshop">IIW</a> about identity for things and the impact that can have. The next IIW is Oct 12-14—online—join us if you're interested.

<p>Since <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/intro-to-dids-for-people-5ebe620b5a15">the beginning</a> of our journey here at MATTR, decentralization and digital identity have been central to our approach to building products. As part of this, we’ve supported Decentralized Identifiers (or <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/docs/platform/core/dids/overview">DIDs</a>) since the <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-the-mattr-platform-91db4925c773">earliest launch of our platform</a>. We’ve also considered how we might give you more options to <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/did-extensibility-on-the-mattr-platform-14c73c7a798e">expand the utility</a> of these identities over&nbsp;time.</p> An important milestone <p>The W3C working group responsible for Decentralized Identifiers <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/9179">recently published</a> the DID v1.0 specification under “Proposed Recommendation” status. This is a significant milestone as DIDs approach global standardization with the pending approval of the W3C Advisory Committee.</p><p>DIDs are maturing, but so is the environment and context in which they were originally designed. With a complex ecosystem consisting of dozens of different methodologies and new ones emerging on a regular basis, it’s important to balance the potential of this decentralized approach with a realistic approach for defining the real utility and value of each <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods">DID method</a>. For example, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/NOTE-did-rubric-20210826/">DID Method Rubric</a> provides a good frame of reference for comparing different approaches.</p><p>Different types of DIDs can be registered and anchored using unique rules specific to the set of infrastructure where they’re stored. Since DIDs provide provenance for keys which are controlled by DID owners, the rules and systems that govern each kind of DID method have a significant impact on the trust and maintenance model for these identifiers. This is the key thing to remember when choosing a DID method that makes sense for your&nbsp;needs.</p> Our supported DID&nbsp;methods <p>In MATTR VII, by supporting a variety of DID methods — deterministic or key-based DIDs, domain-based DIDs, and ledger-based DIDs — we are able to provide tools which can be customized to fit the needs of individual people and organizations.</p>  Key-based DIDs — Largely static, easy to create, and locally controlled. This makes them a natural choice for applications where there’s a need to manage connections and interactions with users directly.  DIDs anchored to web domains — These have a different trust model, where control over the domain can bootstrap a connection to a DID. This makes a lot of sense for organizations with existing domain names that already transact and do business online, and can extend their brand and reputation to the domain of&nbsp;DIDs.  Ledger-based DIDs — These offer a distributed system of public key infrastructure which is not centrally managed or controlled by a single party. While ledgers differ in their governance and consensus models, they ultimately provide a backbone for anchoring digital addresses in a way which allows them to be discovered and used by other parties. This can be a useful feature where a persistent identifier is needed, such as in online communication and collaboration.  <p>There is no single DID method or type of DID (which at the moment) should be universally applied to every situation. However, by using the strengths of each approach we can allow for a diverse ecosystem of digital identifiers enabling connections between complex networks of people, organizations and machines.</p><p>To date, we’ve provided support for three main DID methods in our platform: <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">DID Key</a>, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">DID Web</a>, and <a href="https://sovrin-foundation.github.io/sovrin/spec/did-method-spec-template.html">DID Sovrin</a>. These align with three of the central types of infrastructure outlined&nbsp;above.</p> Introducing DID&nbsp;ION <p>We’re proud to announce that as of today we’ve added support for <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">DID ION</a>, a DID method which is anchored to IPFS and Bitcoin. We’ve <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/sidetree-protocol-reaches-v1-9b565cf92db3">supported the development of the Sidetree protocol</a> that underpins DID ION for some time as it has matured in collaboration with working group members at the Decentralized Identity Foundation.</p><p>With contributions from organizations such as Microsoft, Transmute, and SecureKey, <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree</a> and DID ION have emerged as a scalable and enterprise-ready solution for anchoring DIDs. The <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/decoding-the-sidetree-protocol-18d8bfa39257">core idea</a> behind the Sidetree protocol is to create decentralized identifiers that can run on any distributed ledger system. DID ION is an implementation of that protocol which backs onto the Bitcoin blockchain, one of the largest and most used public ledger networks in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Sidetree possesses some unique advantages not readily present in other DID methods, such as low cost, high throughput, and built-in portability of the identifier. This provides a number of benefits to people and organizations, especially in supporting a large volume of different kinds of connections with the ability to manage and rotate keys as needed. We have added end-to-end capabilities for creating and resolving DIDs on the ION network across our platform and wallet products.</p><p>Although DID ION is just one implementation of the Sidetree protocol, we see promise in other DID methods using Sidetree and will consider adding support for these over time as and when it makes sense. We’ll also continue to develop Sidetree in collaboration with the global standards community to ensure that this protocol and the ION Network have sustainable futures for a long time to&nbsp;come.</p><p>At the same time, the community around DID Sovrin is developing a new kind of interoperability by designing a <a href="https://hackmd.io/@icZC4epNSnqBbYE0hJYseA/S1eUS2BQw">DID method</a> that can work for vast networks of Indy ledgers, rather than focusing on the Sovrin-specific method that’s been used to date. As DID Sovrin gets phased out of adoption, we’re simultaneously deprecating standard support for DID Sovrin within MATTR VII. We’ll be phasing this out shortly with upcoming announcements for customers building on our existing platform.</p><p>If you’ve got any use cases that utilize DID Sovrin or want to discuss extensibility options, please reach out to us on any of our social channels or at info@mattr.global and we’ll be happy to work with&nbsp;you.</p> Looking ahead <p>We believe this a big step forward in providing a better set of choices when it comes to digital identity for our customers. From the start, we have designed our platform with flexibility and extensibility in mind, and will continue to support different DID methods as the market&nbsp;evolves.</p><p>We look forward to seeing how these new tools can be used to solve problems in the real world and will keep working to identify better ways to encourage responsible use of digital identity on the&nbsp;web.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/adding-did-ion-to-mattr-vii-d56bdb7a2fde">Adding DID ION to MATTR VII</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Over the past several years, the world of messaging has morphed in front of our very eyes. There are now more than six messaging channel categories, including text (inc. SMS, MMS, RCS), email, social media, chatbots (i.e. for support and conversational commerce), proximity alerts, and more than a dozen over-the-top apps (WhatsApp, WeChat, Viber, Apple Business Chat, Line, iMessage, Facebook Messenger, Pinterest, YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, and more). What does this mean for organizations? Well, for some they may think it means that their organization has a variety of channels to choose from to reach the people they serve (aka consumers, shoppers, patients, investors, etc.). On the surface, this is true. But what it really means is that organizations must start developing their multi-channel messaging muscles so that they can reach individuals not on the organization’s preferred time and medium of communication, but on the individual’s preferred time and medium of communication.</p>
<p>To effectively manage a messaging program, the most important thing to realize is that messaging channels are NOT all created equal. Every channel has a different audience profile, audience expectations, norms, message lengths, message formats, ways to send and receive messages, and methods for reporting across the engagement continuum (e.g., transaction through relationship). Messaging is an ecosystem all of its own that must be nurtured if you want to find success.</p>
 Need I say more? Of course, I do! 
<blockquote><p>“The customer is everywhere and nowhere.” Todd Harrison, SVP of Digital at Skechers&nbsp;(Harrison, 2021)</p></blockquote>
<p>You may find yourself with prospects and customers and few ways to reach them? You may find yourself with tired campaigns that simply do not perform the way you want them to? You may find yourself losing touch with your most valuable asset, your first-party database. You may ask yourself, how did I get here? You may ask yourself, which channel should I use to achieve the best results?</p>
<p>Todd is right, “the customer is everywhere, and nowhere.” The way to address this problem is to put your customer at the heart of your business. What does this mean? It means you must learn to collect and listen to their preferences? To interact and engage them, not just barrage them with mono-directional messages that basically say, “I have an idea, why don’t you buy more stuff from us?” People want to be respected, heard, and served. You need to treat them as the hero of your story. To make this happen, you need to understand them. You need to focus on building out an end-to-end communication strategy, which includes building a preference-based opt-in database, often referred to as a customer data platform (CDP). Depending on your needs you’ll need dedicated messaging platforms (e.g. SMS, 10DLC, Email, etc.) or possibly a multichannel communication platform as a service (CPasS) to manage real-time messaging across all channels. Moreover, you’ll need a content strategy. And soon, to meet the expectations of those you serve, you’ll need to build the capability to deliver predictive, personalized, contextually aware content and offers, with real-time feedback loops so that you can listen to customers and respond to them when they reply or initiate a conversation with you. In the near future, we will find that messaging has become the cornerstone of the vast majority of businesses’ engagement strategies, but we have a long way to go as only six to ten percent of companies are actively nurturing and running commercial messaging programs today (Ruppert, 2021).</p>
<p>Yes, you can succeed with the tried and true tactics, but for how long? The marketplace and consumer sentiments are changing, and you must change with them, or you’ll be left behind.</p>
<blockquote><p>“By 2030, society will no longer tolerate a business model that relies on mass transactions of increasingly sensitive personal data: a different system will be in place.”&nbsp;(Data 2030, 2020)</p></blockquote>
<p>We’ll cover more on the bigger picture in future articles, let’s get back to messaging.</p>
 What it takes to run a successful messaging program 
<p>The key to a successful messaging program is to start simple and build from there.</p>
<p>You should not be frightened by the sea of mobile messaging opportunities. Embrace them, and take them one step at a time. Take it from us, with the simplest of messaging programs you have the potential to see material success. For example, we are aware of a retail company that, in 12 months after launching a text-based SMS program sprinkled with the occasional MMS message, acquired 700,000 subscribers and is now generating over $1.4M in monthly sales.</p>

 Where do you start? 
<p>SMS, or text messaging, is the most straightforward, omnipresent, and ubiquitous messaging channel that you can use to engage people anywhere in the world. And, best of all, it is proven.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephanieburns/2019/09/06/9-clever-ways-to-use-text-messaging-in-your-business/?sh=2aa3edb62951">Open rates in SMS are often 95% and higher</a>.</p>
<p>Text messaging is not just about driving sales, and although this is the end-game, it is about being of service to your audience throughout every stage of the relationship they have with you. Text messaging provides at the most basic level more engagement not just as a utility but as a consumer relationship tool – securing interactions, driving pre and post-sales engagements, gathering feedback through surveys, and fostering loyalty and support. You can, and should, use it across every stage of the purchase funnel: discovery, awareness, consideration, conversation, onboarding and adoption, loyalty, support, and offboarding.</p>
<p>NOTE: Keep an eye out for 10DLC, a new messaging standard the kicked off in June 2021. Our next article will be on this.</p>
 But What if? 
<p>Yes, text messaging, aka SMS, is ubiquitous, but what should you do when you need to grow beyond what texting has to offer? Remember, “the medium is the message” (Marshall McLuhan, 1964). Text messaging is not the right channel for every engagement.</p>
<p>What if you needed to reach and engage people in China, Brazil, Germany, or Australia? What if your product was best suited to be explained via a picture or a video? What are the best channels to reach these consumers? Text is not always the answer!</p>
  
<p><a href="https://unsplash.com/@epicantus?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Photo by Nathan Dumlao on Unsplash</a></p>
<p>Facebook Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, and other messaging channels are making a considerable play at being complementary messaging options for consumers and, in some cases, the primary channel. Geographic location is the main driver for these channel decisions as well as the use case. But the numbers don’t lie in regards to the global user base of over 2 billion consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/258749/most-popular-global-mobile-messenger-apps/">OTT Messaging Leaders.&nbsp;</a></p>
  
 Where Should You Start? 
<p>Sounds like a lot? Sounds complicated? It’s really not if you think about these few items and take them one at a time in your messaging and engagement roadmap.</p>
<p>Here are a few things for you to consider that will help mold your direction. First, start with a few pillars: Message type (use-case, transactional, marketing, support…), Geolocation(s), Staffing, and Existing Partners. Consider,</p>
 
 Are you currently offering text transactional or marketing messaging? 
 Which markets and countries are you looking to reach? 
 How much is your social media advertising budget? 
 Are you considering messaging for support (don’t just think SMS, think OTT)? 
 Do you have internal staff to manage your messaging programs? 
 Are you currently using a Marketing Automation platform? 
 Are you working with external guides and mentors (Remember:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6841097885103341568/">coaches and mentors are required if you want to be an expert</a>&nbsp;)? 
 
 Enter Personal Data &amp; Identity 
<p>It is critical for you to remember that all effective commerce starts with a meaningful connection and relevant and consistent communication. The path to relevance is through data, particularly personal data, in fact, a new asset class that you need to wield with precision.</p>
 The Bottomline 
<p>For the majority SMS (text) will be your first entry into the messaging space. But, depending on how you answered the questions above, the odds are you will be a perfect candidate to implement one of the other messaging channels too. Your next step is to evaluate your current programs and roadmap of “Needs” vs ’Wants” and map out the use cases, i.e., the experience you want to offer your customers, prior to finding a good technology and solutions partner.</p>
<p>Your “Needs’ may have to do with driving revenue, loyalty sign-ups, gathering preference data, support efficiencies, personalization, and could be as simple as mapping out your KPI’s and creating efficiencies of your current messaging strategy. Day, time, type of message, MMS vs.&nbsp;SMS, frequency, and more have a say in the results in your program. Remember, planning before tactics!</p>
<p>Messaging has proven to be the most effective tool, especially when used in a thoughtful and meaningful experience, for people-centric engagement programs. But in the age of the connected individual, the bottom line is that it is a necessity, not a nice to have.</p>
<p>There is a lot to navigate, but this is nothing like any other part of your business. You can do it. Create a roadmap. Find your partners. Take one step at a time!</p>

<p>現地（ミュンヘン）時間13日午後7時半、European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021で GAIN – Global Assured Identity Network を発表しました。これは、すべての参加者が身元確認済みであるオーバレイネットワークです。</p>



<p>使用したスライドは以下からご覧になっていただけます。</p>



<p>ホワイトペーパー自体は、<a href="https://gainforum.org/">https://gainforum.org/</a> からダンロードしていただけます。</p>

 GAINとは 



<p>詳細は以下の英文ブログに譲りますが、その下にDeepLによる機械翻訳も参考までに載せておきます。（検証していないので間違いや割愛等結構あるかもしれません。が、なんとなく概要を見るのには良いでしょう。原本は英語ですので、詳しく見るにはそちらを御覧ください。）</p>



 
<blockquote><a href="https://nat.sakimura.org/2021/09/14/announcing-gain/">Announcing GAIN: Global Assured Identity Network</a></blockquote>
 



<p>インターネットの始まりには、信頼がありました。誰もが参加している組織に知られており、誰もが責任（Accountability）を負わされることを知っていたのです。</p>



<p>しかし、90年代にインターネットが商業的に利用できるようになると、信頼は失われました。参加者の大半が匿名になり、責任を問われないと認識するようになったのです。その結果、多くの犯罪者やバッドアクターがネットワーク上で活躍するようになりました。インターネットのワイルド・ワイルド・ウエストの時代が到来したのです。</p>



<p>それ以来、状況を改善し、信頼を回復するために多くの努力が払われてきました。しかし、あまり効果はありませんでした。金融犯罪は、人への影響が計り知れない不正行為から生まれ、世界経済に年間GDPの最大5％もの損失を与えています。マネーロンダリング防止やテロ資金対策に莫大な費用がかけられていますが、今のところ効果はありません。金融システム内の1,000ドルの「違法な資金」に対して、コンプライアンスに100ドルが費やされていますが、傍受されるのはわずか1ドル。わずか0.1％です。</p>



<p>このコインの裏側には金融包摂の問題もあります。</p>



<p>多くの人々は、口座開設に関わる本人確認コストのために商業的にとりこむことができず、経済的に排除されています。</p>



<p>匿名で行動できることは、原理的にはプライバシーの面で大きなメリットがあります。しかし、私たちが実現しているのは、個人データが危険にさらされ、善良な行為者が悪質な行為者に容易に追跡されるという状況です。いわば熟練した悪質な行為者のためのプライバシーであり、われわれ「それ以外の人」のためのプライバシーはありません。</p>



<p>30年の時間とコストをかけたにもかかわらず、なぜ私たちはこれらを阻止することに成功しないのでしょうか。</p>



<p>それは、アイデンティティとアカウンタビリティという根本的な問題に取り組んでこなかったからです。</p>



<p>私たちが必要としているのは、エコシステム内のすべての参加者のアカウンタビリティを再確立することです。</p>



<p>このようなエコシステムは、比較可能性と相互承認の原則に基づいて相互に接続することができ、最終的にはサイバーワールドの人口の大部分をカバーする説明責任のあるエコシステムのネットワークを形成することができます。</p>



<p>そのようなエコシステムのひとつが、今日、私たちが提案するものです。GAIN（Global Assured Identity Network）です。</p>



<p>GAINは、アカウンタビリティのある参加者のみで構成されるインターネット上のオーバーレイネットワークです。すべての参加者は、主に銀行やその他の規制対象組織からなるホスティング組織で口座を開設する際に、規制を満たすための身元確認を受けています。これらの高保証属性は、エンドユーザーの指示に基づいて アイデンティティ情報提供者から依拠当事者(RP)に渡される アイデンティティ情報の基礎として使用されます。</p>



<p>エンド・ユーザーは、自己申告ではなく、信頼できるエンティティによって証明された年齢などの属性を証明できるようになります。これは非常に強力です。</p>



<p>例えば、「私は18歳以上です」ということを、「私を信じてください」と言うだけでなく、銀行の証明書を使って証明することができます。</p>



<p>これは、プライバシーの観点からも非常に良いことです。</p>



<p>自己申告の場合、情報の受け手は自分の言っていることが信じられないので、通常、それを証明するために運転免許証などの身分証明書を提示しなければなりません。この時点で、彼女は年齢よりもはるかに多くの属性を開示していることになります。</p>



<p>このような能力は、以前に行われた 身元確認にかかっています。身元確認は非常にコストのかかるプロセスです。</p>



<p>この目的のためだけにそれを行おうとすると、法外な費用がかかる可能性があります。</p>



<p>本業のために身元確認を行う必要がある銀行やその他の規制機関は、この点で有利です。これは、ある巨大なオンライン小売業者が、ホリデーシーズンにしか必要とされない冗長機能をより有効に活用するために、クラウドコンピューティングサービスを提供し始めたようなものです。他のホスティングベンダーは太刀打ちできませんでした。</p>



<p>アイデンティティ情報提供者によってIDが証明されたからといって、個人がGAINで匿名で行動できないわけではありません。個人は、マーチャントやネットワークの他の参加者に対して、匿名または偽名で行動することができます。実際、個人の属性の開示は最小限にとどめるのが普通である。ただし、不正行為を行った場合には、正当な手続きに基づいて個人を追跡し、責任を追及することができるようになっています。指定されたオープナーと呼ばれるエンティティは、取引の履歴を開き、その時の人物を指し示すことができる。</p>



<p>ネットワーク上のすべてのビジネスエンティティは、ホスティング組織でのビジネスアカウントの作成と維持の一環として審査されており、匿名のままでいることはできません。彼らには説明責任があります。その結果、消費者は安心して取引を行うことができ、依拠当事者にとってはビジネスの拡大につながります。すべての善良なアクターが利益を得ることができるのです。</p>



<p>この効果はグローバルなものです。マーチャントは、一度登録して契約するだけで、世界中のネットワーク参加者にアクセスできるようになります。</p>



<p>個人は、エコシステム内のすべての依拠当事者が存在し、説明責任を果たしているという安心感を持ってアクセスすることができます。確かに悪質な業者はまだ存在するでしょうが、その範囲はより限定されたものになります。エコシステムは、現在のインターネットよりもはるかに安全になります。参加者がアクションを起こすのに十分なものになるでしょう。信頼が再び確立されます。</p>



<p>完璧なプロセスはありません。GAINにおいても、悪質な行為者は確実に存在しますが、それは標準ではなく例外となるため、問題ははるかに扱いやすくなります。行動を起こすには「十分」でしょう。</p>



<p>つまり、信頼が再確立されたのです。</p>

<p>This posts shows how an Angular application can be secured using Open ID Connect code flow with PKCE and <a href="https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider">node-oidc-provider</a> identity provider. This requires the correct configuration on both the client and the identity provider.</p>



<p>The node-oidc-provider clients need a configuration for the public client which uses refresh tokens. The grant_types ‘refresh_token’, ‘authorization_code’ are added as well as the offline_access scope.</p>


  clients: [ 
	{ 
		client_id: 'angularCodeRefreshTokens', 
		token_endpoint_auth_method: 'none', 
		application_type: 'web', 
		grant_types: [
			'refresh_token', 
			'authorization_code'
		], 
		response_types: ['code'],
		redirect_uris: ['https://localhost:4207'],
		scope: 'openid offline_access profile email',
		post_logout_redirect_uris: [ 'https://localhost:4207' ] 
	}
,]
  


<p>The Angular client is implemented using <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/angular-auth-oidc-client">angular-auth-oidc-client</a>. The offline_access scope is requested as well as the prompt=consent. The nonce validation after a refresh is ignored.</p>


  import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { AuthModule, LogLevel } from 'angular-auth-oidc-client';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    AuthModule.forRoot({
      config: {
        authority: 'http://localhost:3000', 
		redirectUrl: window.location.origin, 
		postLogoutRedirectUri: window.location.origin, 
		clientId: 'angularCodeRefreshTokens', 
		scope: 'openid profile offline_access', 
		responseType: 'code', 
		silentRenew: true, 
		useRefreshToken: true, 
		logLevel: LogLevel.Debug, 
		ignoreNonceAfterRefresh: true, 
		customParams: { 
			prompt: 'consent', // login, consent 
		}, 
      },
    }),
  ],
  exports: [AuthModule],
})
export class AuthConfigModule {}
  


<p>That’s all the configuration required.</p>

It did not just emerge in 2016 after a blog post was written. It did not fail to exist when wikipedia editors denied it subject integrity with the stated message: "good luck with that".</p><p>Self-Sovereign Identity is a structural result of accurate Sovereign source authority, expressive by Individuals. People, using tools, can do many amazing things.</p><p>The social telling of information:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html</a>&nbsp;constructed to socialize access to methods being advanced by social <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">groups</a> of one <a href="https://identity.foundation/">form</a> or <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">another</a>, can do nothing to alter the root ownership and expression of "<a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2021/08/self-sovereign-rights.html">self-sovereign rights</a>". Capturing a social opportunity, or servicing a social service deployed for public benefit, has structural requirements. The "proof is in the pudding" is a digital data result now in the real world. Data literacy is a functional requirement of baseline participation in a "civil society". Root Sovereignty is a design outcome with living data results that must be evaluated for accuracy &amp; integrity. Functional literacy is a requirement for system integrity.</p><p>Words carry meaning; literary abstractions of often real and digital objects, methods, processes, ideas. When a word's meaning is not accurate, or not accurate enough, language is negatively affected, and as a result, communication of integrity between people is affected. People, Individuals all, living among one another, is the only actual reality of human existence in the Universe. This structural requirement for accuracy can only translate accurately enough by using the right words. "We the people", if not structurally referring to the Individuals walking in local communities with blood running through their veins, but instead translated via legalese into a legal abstraction giving force to Government administration methods, represents a perversion of human intent.</p><p>While amendments have been offered to fix past perversions of human intent and accurate use of language, the <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2021/07/recursive-signatory.html">root error of omission</a> providing cover for the mis-translation of "We The People" in the United States of America in 2021 is not a construct of words, or literary amendments. Instead, it is a restructuring of baseline participation in the administration of human authority within a Sovereign territory. "We The People", Individuals All, give administrative integrity to the Government derived "of, by, for" our consenting authority. Our <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2012/02/what-is-sovereign-source-authority.html">Sovereign source authority</a>, represented as Individuals, by our own self-Sovereign identity is the means by which this Nation came into existence, and the only means by which it continues.</p><p>America can not be provisioned from a database. People own root authority, personally, or not at all.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

<p>Monday will be my first day as community lead for Steampipe, a young open source project that normalizes APIs by way of Postgres foreign data wrappers. The project’s taglines are select * from cloud and query like it’s 1992; the <a href="https://steampipe.io/">steampipe.io home page</a> nicely illustrates these ideas. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I’ve been thinking about API normalization for a long time. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html">original proposal</a> for the World Wide Web says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Databases</p>
<p>A generic tool could perhaps be made to allow any database which uses a commercial DBMS to be displayed as a hypertext view.
</p></blockquote>
<p>We ended up with standard ways for talking to databases — ODBC, JDBC — but not for expressing them on the web. </p>
<p>When I was at Microsoft I was bullish on <a href="https://www.odata.org/">OData</a>, an outgrowth of Pablo Castro’s wonderful <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2007/07/03/a-conversation-with-pablo-castro-about-astorias-restful-data-services/">Project Astoria</a>. Part of the promise was that every database-backed website could automatically offer basic API access that wouldn’t require API wrappers for everybody’s favorite programming language. The API was hypertext; a person could navigate it using links and search. Programs wrapped around that API could be useful, but meaningful interaction with data would be possible without them. </p>
<p>(For a great example of what that can feel like, jump into the middle of one of Simon Willison’s datasettes, for example <a href="https://san-francisco.datasettes.com/food-trucks/Mobile_Food_Facility_Permit?Applicant=1">san-francisco.datasettes.com</a>, and start clicking clicking around.)</p>
<p>Back then I wrote a couple of posts on this topic[<a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2009/11/18/odata-is-grease-to-cut-data-friction/">1</a>, <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2010/01/29/odata-for-collaborative-sense-making/">2</a>]. Many years later OData still hasn’t taken the world by storm. I still think it’s a great idea and would love to see it, or something like it, catch on more broadly. Meanwhile Steampipe takes a different approach. Given a proliferation of APIs and programming aids for them, let’s help by providing a unifying abstraction: SQL.</p>
<p>I’ve done a deep dive into the SQL world over the past few years. The <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/21/a-virtuous-cycle-for-analytics/">first post</a> in a series I’ve been writing on my adventures with Postgres is what connected me to Steampipe and its sponsor (my new employer) <a href="https://turbot.com/">Turbot</a>. When you install Steampipe it brings Postgres along for the ride. Imagine what you could do with data flowing into Postgres from many different APIs and filling up tables you can view, query, join, and expose to tools and systems that talk to Postgres. Well, it’s going to be my job to help imagine, and explain, what’s possible in that scenario. </p>
<p>Meanwhile I need to give some thought to my Twitter tag line: patron saint of trailing edge technologies. It’s funny and it’s true. At BYTE I explored how software based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_News_Transfer_Protocol">Net News Transfer Protocol</a> enabled my team to <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-internet-groupware/1565925378">do things</a> that we use Slack for today. At Microsoft I built a system for <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/elmcity-project-faq/">community-scale calendaring</a> based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">iCalendar</a>. When I picked up NNTP and iCalendar they were already on the trailing edge.  Yet they were, and especially in the case of iCalendar still are, capable of doing much more than is commonly understood. </p>
<p>Then of course came web annotation. Although Hypothesis recently shepherded it to <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/blog/annotation-is-now-a-web-standard/">W3C standardization</a> it goes all the way back to the <a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q2/0416.html">Mosaic browser</a> and is exactly the kind of generative tech that fires my imagination. With Hypothesis now well established in education, I hope others will continue to explore the breadth of what’s possible when every document workflow that needs to can readily connect people, activities, and data to selections in documents. If that’s of interest, here are some <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/09/03/notes-for-an-annotation-sdk/">signposts</a> pointing to scenarios I’ve envisioned and prototyped.</p>
<p>And now it’s SQL. For a long time I set it aside in favor of object, XML, and NoSQL stores. Coming back to it, by way of Postgres, has shown me that:</p>
<p>– Modern SQL is more valuable as a programming language than is commonly understood</p>
<p>– So is Postgres as a programming environment</p>
<p>The tagline query like it’s 1992 seems very on-brand for me. But maybe I should let go of the trailing-edge moniker. Nostalgia isn’t the best way to motivate fresh energy. Maybe query like it’s 2022 sets a better tone? In any case I’m very much looking forward to this next phase.</p>

Here’s the <a href="https://twitter.com/TheMatrixMovie/">@TheMatrixMovie</a>‘s new <a href="https://twitter.com/TheMatrixMovie/status/1435951131071500296">pinned tweet of the first trailer</a>.</p>
<p>Yeah, it’s a sequel, and sequels tend to sag. Even The&nbsp;Godfather Part 2. (But that one only sagged in the relative sense, since Part 1 was perfect.)</p>
<p>If anything bothers me about this next Matrix it’s that what had seemed an untouchable Classic is now a Franchise. Not a bad beast, the Franchise. Just different: same genus, different species.</p>
<p>Given the way these things go, my expectations are low and my hopes high.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I’m wondering why Laurence Fishburne, Hugo Weaving, and Lilly Wachowski don’t return in Resurrections. Not being critical here. Just curious.</p>

<p>My own thoughts about the original Matrix (that it was a metaphor for marketing, basically) are <a href="http://weblog.searls.com/2000/08/18">here</a>, <a href="http://weblog.searls.com/2000/08/29">here</a> and <a href="http://weblog.searls.com/2000/08/29">here</a>.†</p></blockquote>
<p>That was back when blogging was blogging. Which it&nbsp;will be again, at least for some of us, when <a href="http://scripting.com">Dave Winer</a> is finished rebooting the practice with <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer">Drummer</a>.</p>
<p>† I know those two links are duplicates, but I don’t have the time to hunt down the originals. And Google is no help, because it ignores lots of old material, including much of my first seven years of blogging.</p>

<p>Passwords are hell.</p>
<p>Worse, to make your hundreds of passwords safe as possible, they should be nearly impossible for others to discover—and for you to remember.</p>
<p>Unless you’re a wizard, this all but requires using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager">password manager</a>.†</p>
<p>Think about how hard that job is. First, it’s impossible for developers of password managers to do everything right:</p>
 
 Most of their customers and users need to have logins and passwords for hundreds of sites and services on the Web and elsewhere in the networked world 
 Every one of those sites and services has its own gauntlet of methods for registering logins and passwords, and for remembering and changing them 
 Every one of those sites and services has its own unique user interfaces, each with its own peculiarities 
 All of those UIs change, sometimes often. 
 
<p>Keeping up with that mess while also keeping personal data safe from both user error and determined bad actors, is about as tall as an order can get. And then you have to do all that work for each of the millions of customers you’ll need if you’re going to make the kind of money required to keep abreast of those problems and providing the solutions required.</p>
<p>So here’s the thing: the best we can do with passwords is the best that password managers can do. That’s your horizon right there.</p>
<p>Unless we can get past logins and passwords somehow.</p>
<p>And I don’t think we can. Not in the <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2021/08/15/beyond-the-web">client-server ecosystem that the Web has become</a>, and that industry never stopped being, since long before the Internet came along. That’s the real hell. Passwords are just a symptom.</p>
<p>We need to work around it. That’s my work now. Stay tuned <a href="http://customercommons.org">here</a>, <a href="http://projectvrm.org">here</a>, and here for more on that.</p>
 
<p>† We need to fix that Wikipedia page.</p>

<p>R0ml Lefkowitz’s <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/21/postgres-functional-style/">The Image of Postgres</a> evokes the Smalltalk experience: reach deeply into a running system, make small changes, see immediate results. There isn’t yet a fullblown IDE for the style of Postgres-based development I describe in this series, though I can envision a VSCode extension that would provide one. But there is certainly a REPL (read-eval-print loop), it’s called psql, and it delivers the kind of immediacy that all REPLs do. In our case there’s also Metabase; it offers a complementary REPL that enhances its power as a <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/09/05/metabase-as-a-lightweight-app-server/">lightweight app server</a>. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/repl/introduction">Clojure docs</a> it says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The Clojure REPL gives the programmer an interactive development experience. When developing new functionality, it enables her to build programs first by performing small tasks manually, as if she were the computer, then gradually make them more and more automated, until the desired functionality is fully programmed. When debugging, the REPL makes the execution of her programs feel tangible: it enables the programmer to rapidly reproduce the problem, observe its symptoms closely, then improvise experiments to rapidly narrow down the cause of the bug and iterate towards a fix.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I feel the same way about the Python REPL, the browser’s REPL, the Metabase REPL, and now also the Postgres REPL. Every function and every materialized view in the analytics system begins as a snippet of code pasted into the psql console (or Metabase). Iteration yields successive results instantly, and those results reflect live data. In <a href="https://blog.bracha.org/exemplarDemo/exemplar2021.html">How is a Programmer Like a Pathologist</a> Gilad Bracha wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
A live program is dynamic; it changes over time; it is animated. A program is alive when it’s running. When you work on a program in a text editor, it is dead.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Tudor Girba amplified the point in a tweet. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In a database-backed system there’s no more direct way to interact with live data than to do so in the database. The Postgres REPL is, of course, a very sharp tool. Here are some ways to handle it carefully.</p>
 Find the right balance for tracking incremental change 
<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/26/working-in-a-hybrid-metabase-postgres-code-base/">Working in a hybrid Metabase / Postgres code base</a> I described how version-controlled files — for Postgres functions and views, and for Metabase questions — repose in GitHub and drive a concordance of docs. I sometimes write code snippets directly in psql or Metabase, but mainly compose in a “repository” (telling word!) where those snippets are “dead” artifacts in a text editor. They come to life when pasted into psql.</p>
<p>A knock on Smalltalk was that it didn’t play nicely with version control. If you focus on the REPL aspect, you could say the same of Python or JavaScript. In any such case there’s a balance to be struck between iterating at the speed of thought and tracking incremental change. Working solo I’ve been inclined toward a fairly granular commit history. In a team context I’d want to leave a chunkier history but still record the ongoing narrative somewhere.</p>
 Make it easy to understand the scope and effects of changes 
<p>The doc concordance has been the main way I visualize interdependent Postgres functions, Postgres views, and Metabase questions. In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/28/working-with-interdependent-postgres-functions-and-materialized-views/">Working with interdependent Postgres functions and materialized views</a> I mentioned Laurenz Albe’s <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/tracking-view-dependencies-in-postgresql/">Tracking View Dependencies in Postgres</a>. I’ve adapted the view dependency tracker he develops there, and adapted related work from others to track function dependencies. </p>
<p>This tooling is still a work in progress, though. The concordance doesn’t yet include Postgres types, for example, nor the tables that are upstream from materialized views. My hypothetical VSCode extension would know about all the artifacts and react immediately when things change.</p>
 Make it easy to find and discard unwanted artifacts 
<p>Given a function or view named foo, I’ll often write and test a foo2 before transplanting changes back into foo. Because foo may often depend on bar and call baz I wind up also with bar2 and baz2. These artifacts hang around in Postgres until you delete them, which I try to do as I go along. </p>
<p>If foo2 is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">memoized</a> function (see <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/19/postgres-set-returning-functions-that-self-memoize-as-materialized-views/">this episode</a>), it can be necessary to delete the set of views that it’s going to recreate. I find these with a query.</p>
 select 
  'drop materialized view ' || matviewname || ';' as drop_stmt
from pg_matviews 
where matviewname ~* {{ pattern }}
 
<p>That pattern might be question_and_answer_summary_for_group to find all views based on that function, or _6djxg2yk to find all views for a group, or even [^_]{8,8}$ to find all views made by memoized functions. </p>
<p>I haven’t yet automated the discovery or removal of stale artifacts and references to them. That’s another nice-to-have for the hypothetical IDE. </p>
 The Image of Postgres 
<p>I’ll give R0ml the last word on this topic.</p>
<blockquote><p>
This is the BYTE magazine cover from August of 1981. In the 70s and the 80s, programming languages had this sort of unique perspective that’s completely lost to history. The way it worked: a programming environment was a virtual machine image, it was a complete copy of your entire virtual machine memory and that was called the image. And then you loaded that up and it had all your functions and your data in it, and then you ran that for a while until you were sort of done and then you saved it out. And this wasn’t just Smalltalk, Lisp worked that way, APL worked that way, it was kind of like Docker only it wasn’t a separate thing because everything worked that way and so you didn’t worry very much about persistence because it was implied. If you had a programming environment it saved everything that you were doing in the programming environment, you didn’t have to separate that part out. A programming environment was a place where you kept all your data and business logic forever.</p>
<p>So then Postgres is kind of like Smalltalk only different.</p>
<p>What’s the difference? Well we took the UI out of Smalltalk and put it in the browser. The rest of it is the same, so really Postgres is an application delivery platform, just like we had back in the 80s.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/21/a-virtuous-cycle-for-analytics/">A virtuous cycle for analytics</a> I said this about Metabase:</p>
<blockquote><p>
It’s all nicely RESTful. Interactive elements that can parameterize queries, like search boxes and date pickers, map to URLs. Queries can emit URLs in order to compose themselves with other queries. I came to see this system as a kind of lightweight application server in which to incubate an analytics capability that could later be expressed more richly.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s explore that idea in more detail. Consider this query that finds groups created in the last week.</p>
 with group_create_days as (
  select
     to_char(created, 'YYYY-MM-DD') as day
  from "group"
  where created &gt; now() - interval '1 week'
)
select 
  day,
  count(*)
from group_create_days
group by day 
order by day desc 
 
<p>A Metabase user can edit the query and change the interval to, say, 1 month, but there’s a nicer way to enable that. Terms in double squigglies are Metabase variables. When you type {{interval}} in the query editor, the Variables pane appears. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Here I’m defining the variable’s type as text and providing the default value 1 week. The query sent to Postgres will be the same as above. Note that this won’t work if you omit ::interval. Postgres complains: “ERROR: operator does not exist: timestamp with time zone – character varying.” That’s because Metabase doesn’t support variables of type interval as required for date subtraction. But if you cast the variable to type interval it’ll work.</p>
<p>That’s an improvement. A user of this Metabase question can now type 2 months or 1 year to vary the interval. But while Postgres’ interval syntax is fairly intuitive, this approach still requires people to make an intuitive leap. So here’s a version that eliminates the guessing. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The variable type is now Field Filter; the filtered field is the created column of the group table; the widget type is Relative Date; the default is Last Month. Choosing other intervals is now a point-and-click operation. It’s less flexible — 3 weeks is no longer an option — but friendlier.</p>
<p>Metabase commendably provides URLs that capture these choices. The default in this case is METABASE_SERVER/question/1060?interval=lastmonth. For the Last Year option it becomes interval=lastyear. </p>
<p>Because all Metabase questions that use variables work this way, the notion of Metabase as rudimentary app server expands to sets of interlinked questions. In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/26/working-in-a-hybrid-metabase-postgres-code-base/">Working in a hybrid Metabase / Postgres code base</a> I showed the following example.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A Metabase question, #600, runs a query that selects columns from the view top_20_annotated_domains_last_week. It interpolates one of those columns, domain, into an URL that invokes Metabase question #985 and passes the domain as a parameter to that question. In the results for question #600, each row contains a link to a question that reports details about groups that annotated pages at that row’s domain.</p>
<p>This is really powerful stuff. Even without all the advanced capabilities I’ve been discussing in this series — pl/python functions, materialized views — you can do a lot more with the Metabase / Postgres combo than you might think.</p>
<p>For example, here’s a interesting idiom I’ve discovered. It’s often useful to interpolate a Metabase variable into a WHERE clause.</p>
 select * 
from dashboard_users
where email = {{ email }} 
 
<p>You can make that into a fuzzy search using the case-insensitive regex-match operator ~*.</p>
 select * 
from dashboard_users
where email ~* {{ email }}
 
<p>That’ll find a single address regardless of case; you can also find all records matching, say, ucsc.edu. But it requires the user to type some value into the input box. Ideally this query won’t require any input. If none is given, it lists all addresses in the table. If there is input it does a fuzzy match on that input. Here’s a recipe for doing that. Tell Metabase that {{ email }} a required variable, and set its default to any. Then, in the query, do this:</p>
 select * 
from dashboard_users
where email ~*
  case 
    when {{ email }} = 'any' then ''
    else {{ email}}
  end
 
<p>In the default case the matching operator binds to the empty string, so it matches everything and the query returns all rows. For any other input the operator binds to a value that drives a fuzzy search.</p>
<p>This is all very nice, you may think, but even the simplest app server can write to the database as well as read from it, and Metabase can’t. It’s ultimately just a tool that you point at a data warehouse to SELECT data for display in tables and charts. You can’t INSERT or UPDATE or ALTER or DELETE or CALL anything. </p>
<p>Well, it turns out that you can. Here’s a Metabase question that adds a user to the table.</p>
<p>select add_dashboard_user( {{email}} )</p>
<p>How can this possibly work? If add_dashboard_user were a Postgres procedure you could CALL it from psql, but in this context you can only SELECT.</p>
<p>We’ve seen the solution in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/19/postgres-set-returning-functions-that-self-memoize-as-materialized-views/">Postgres set-returning functions that self-memoize as materialized views</a>. A Postgres function written in pl/python can import and use a Python function from a plpython_helpers module. That helper function can invoke psql to CALL a procedure. So this is possible.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We’ve used Metabase for years. It provides a basic, general-purpose UX that’s deeply woven into the fabric of the company. Until recently we thought of it as a read-only system for analytics, so a lot of data management happens in spreadsheets that don’t connect to the data warehouse. It hadn’t occurred to me to leverage that same basic UX for data management too, and that’s going to be a game-changer. I always thought of Metabase as a lightweight app server. With some help from Postgres it turns out to be a more capable one than I thought.</p>

  <p>Prompted by this exchange on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Functionality attached to the context-defining data object. Instead of an “app” silo. Now here’s a thought. :-)</p>— Johannes Ernst (@Johannes_Ernst) <a href="https://twitter.com/Johannes_Ernst/status/1434044253835980803?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 4, 2021</a></blockquote> 
<p>Let me unpack this a bit. Let’s say that I’d like to send a message to
some guy, let’s call him Tom for this example.</p>
<p>The messaging app vendors go like: “Oh yes, we’ll make it super-easy for
him (Johannes) to send a message to Tom, so we give him an extra short
handle (say @tom) so he doesn’t need to type much, and also add a ‘reply’
button to previous messages so he won’t even have to type that.”</p>
<p>Which is myopic, because it completely misunderstands or ignores the context
of the user. The user doesn’t think that way, at least most of the time.</p>
<p>As a user, I think the pattern is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I need to tell (person) about (news) related to
(common context), how do I best do that (i.e. which app)?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three concepts and a sub-concept:</p>
 
 
<p>Who do I want to tell. In Joshua’s example: the person(s) I’m about to meet
with.</p>
 
 
<p>What’s the news I want to tell them. Here it is “I am running late”.</p>
 
 But this news only makes sense in the common context of “we agreed to meet
today”. If the receiver doesn’t have that context, they will receive
my message and it will be pointless and bewildering to them. 
 
 
 
<p>What’s the best way of conveying that news. It might be a text, a phone call,
or pretty much anything. This item is the least important in this entire
scenario, as long as the receiver gets the message.</p>
 
 
<p>So thre are two primary “entry” points for this scenario:</p>
 
 
<p>It starts with a person. The user thinks “Tom, I need to tell Tom that I’ll
be late”, and the frantically tries to find a way of contacting them while
hurring in the subway or driving really fast. (We have all been there.)</p>
 
 
<p>It starts with the shared context object. The user looks at the calendar and
thinks “Oh darn, this meeting, it’s now, I’ll be late, I need to tell them”.
(They might not even remember who exactly will be in the meeting, but then likely
the calender event has that info.)</p>
 
 
<p>The entry point is almost never: “how convenient, I have all people I’m about
to meet with in the current window of the messaging app, they all know what
whatever I’m going to type into that window next is about the meeting, and
I can just simply say that I’ll be late.”</p>
<p>So … if we were to put the user, and their experience, at the center of
messaging, messaging wouldn’t be an app. (Well, it might also be an app,
but mostly it wouldn’t.)</p>
<p>Instead, the messaging would be a “system service” attached to the context
objects in which I’d like to message. In Joshua’s example that is:</p>
 
 
<p>the person I’m about to meet with (but this only works if there is a
single person; if there are a dozen this does not work).</p>
 
 
<p>the shared context about which I am conveying the news: here, the
(hopefully shared) calendar event. Joshua’s original point.</p>
 
 
<p>Now in my experience, this is just an example for a more general pattern. For example:</p>
 
 
<p>meeting notes. In which meeting any meeting notes were taken is
of course supremely important. Which is why most meeting minutes start
with a title, a date/time and a list of attendees. Instead, they should be
attached to the calendar event, just like the message thread. (Yes,
including collaborative editing.)</p>
<p>And by “attached” I don’t mean: there’s a URL somewhere in the calendar
dialog form that leads to a Google Doc. No, I mean that the calendar can
show them, and insert the to-do-items from the meeting, and future meetings
from that document, and the other way around: that when you look at
the meeting notes, I can see the calendar event, and find out it is
a biweekly meeting, and the notes for the other meetings are over there.</p>
 
 
<p>projects. Software development is the worst offender, as far as I
know. If you and I and half a dozen other people work on a project to
implement functionality X, that is our primary shared context. All
communication and data creation should occur in that context. But instead
we have our code in Github, our bugs in Confluence, our APIs … test
cases … screen mockups … video calls … chats … in a gazillion
different places, and one of these days I’m sure somebody is going to
prove that half of software budgets in many places are consumed by context
switching between tools that blissfully ignore that the user thinks not
like a vendor does. (And the other half by trying to make the so-called
“integrations” between services work.)</p>
 
 
<p>There are many more examples. (In a previous life, I ran around with the
concept of “situational computing” – which takes context-aware computing
to something much more dynamic and extreme; needless to say it was decades
before its time. But now with AR/VR-stuff coming, it will probably become
part of the mainstream soon.)</p>
<p>The 100 dollar question is of course: if this is the right thing for users, why aren’t apps doing that?</p>
<p>Joshua brought up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDoc">OpenDoc</a> in a subsequent
post. Yep, there is a similarity here, and apps don’t do this kind of thing for
the same reason OpenDoc failed. (It didn’t fail because it was slow as molasses
and Steve Jobs hated it.)</p>
<p>OpenDoc failed because it would have disintermediated big and powerful
companies such as Adobe, who would have had to sell 100 little OpenDoc
components, instead of one gigantic monolith containing those 100 components
as a take-it-or-leave-it package at “enterprise” pricing. No adoption by
Adobe, Adobe feeling Apple proactively attacked their business model, it
would have killed Apple right afterwards.</p>
<p>But having OpenDoc would have sooo much better for users. We would have gotten
much more innovation, and yes, lower prices. But software vendors, like all
businesses, primarily do what is right for them, not their customers.</p>
<p>Which is why we get <a href="https://indieweb.org/silo">silos</a> everwhere we look.</p>
<p>If we wanted to change that situation, about OpenDoc-like things, or
messaging attached, in context, to things like calendar events, we have
to change the economic situation in which the important vendors find
themselves.</p>
<p>Plus of course the entire technology stack, because if all you know is
how to ship an <code>int main(argv, argc)</code> on your operating system, something
componentized and pluggable and user-centric and context-centric is never
able to emerge, even if you want to.</p>
<p>(*) The title is meant to be sarcastically, in case you weren’t sure.</p>

<p>While helping Hypothesis find its way to ed-tech it was my great privilege to explore ways of adapting annotation to other domains including bioscience, journalism, and scholarly publishing. Working across these domains showed me that annotation isn’t just an app you do or don’t adopt. It’s also a service you’d like to be available in every document workflow that connects people to selections in documents.</p>
<p>In my talk Weaving the Annotated Web I showcased four such services: <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2017/05/05/weaving-the-annotated-web/#sitc">Science in the Classroom</a>, <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2017/05/05/weaving-the-annotated-web/#digipo">The Digital Polarization Project</a>, <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2017/05/05/weaving-the-annotated-web/#scibot">SciBot</a>, and <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2017/05/05/weaving-the-annotated-web/#claimchart">ClaimChart</a>. Others include tools to <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/blog/annotation-powered-questionnaires/">evaluate credibility signals</a>, or <a href="https://misinfocon.com/lets-use-the-annotated-web-to-coordinate-the-struggle-against-fake-news-1627ff4919a3">review claims</a>, in news stories. </p>
<p>As I worked through these and other scenarios, I accreted a set of tools for enabling any annotation-aware interaction in any document-oriented workflow. I’ve wanted to package these as a coherent software development kit, that hasn’t happened yet, but here are some of the ingredients that belong in such an SDK. </p>
 Creating an annotation from a selection in a document 
<p>Two core operations lie at the heart of any annotation system: creating a note that will bind to a selection in a document, and binding (anchoring) that note to its place in the document. A tool that creates an annotation reacts to a selection in a document by forming one or more selectors that describe the selection.</p>
<p>The most important selector is TextQuoteSelector. If I visit <a href="http://www.example.com">http://www.example.com</a> and select the phrase “illustrative examples” and then use Hypothesis to annotate that selection, the payload sent from the client to the server includes this construct.</p>
 {
  "type": "TextQuoteSelector", 
  "exact": "illustrative examples", 
  "prefix": "n\n    This domain is for use in ", 
  "suffix": " in documents. You may use this\n"
}
 
<p>The Hypothesis client formerly used an NPM module, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dom-anchor-text-quote">dom-anchor-text-quote</a>, to derive that info from a selection. It no longer uses that module, and the equivalent code that it does use isn’t separately available. But annotations created using TextQuoteSelectors formed by dom-anchor-text-quote interoperate with those created using the Hypothesis client, and I don’t expect that will change since Hypothesis needs to remain backwards-compatible with itself.</p>
<p>You’ll find something like TextQuoteSelector in any annotation system. It’s formally defined by the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#text-quote-selector">here</a>. In the vast majority of cases this is all you need to describe the selection to which an annotation should anchor. </p>
<p>There are, however, cases where TextQuoteSelector won’t suffice. Consider a document that repeats the same passage three times. Given a short selection in the first of those passages, how can a system know that an annotation should anchor to that one, and not the second or third? Another selector, TextPositionSelector (<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dom-anchor-text-position">https://www.npmjs.com/package/dom-anchor-text-position</a>), enables a system to know which passage contains the selection.</p>
 {
  "type": "TextPositionSelector", 
  "start": 51
  "end": 72, 
}
 
<p>It records the start and end of the selection in the visible text of an HTML document. Here’s the HTML source of that web page.</p>
 &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Example Domain&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents. You may use this
    domain in literature without prior coordination or asking for permission.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.iana.org/domains/example"&gt;More information...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
 
<p>Here is the visible text to which the TextQuoteSelector refers.</p>
<blockquote><p>
\n\n    Example Domain\n    This domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents. You may use this\n    domain in literature without prior coordination or asking for permission.\n    More information…\n\n\n\n
</p></blockquote>
<p>The positions recorded by a TextQuoteSelector can change for a couple of reasons. If the document is altered, it’s obvious that an annotation’s start and stop numbers might change. Less obviously that can happen even if the document’s text isn’t altered. A news website, for example, may inject different kinds of advertising-related text content from one page load to the next. In that case the positions for two consecutive Hypothesis annotations made on the same selection can differ. So while TextPositionSelector can resolve ambiguity, and provide hints to an annotation system about where to look for matches, the foundation is ultimately TextQuoteSelector.</p>
<p>If you try the first example in the README at <a href="https://github.com/judell/TextQuoteAndPosition">https://github.com/judell/TextQuoteAndPosition</a>, you can form your own TextQuoteSelector and TextPositionSelector from a selection in a web page. That repo exists only as a wrapper around the set of modules — dom-anchor-text-quote, dom-anchor-text-position, and wrap-range-text — needed to create and anchor annotations.</p>
<p>Building on these ingredients, <a href="https://github.com/judell/HelloWorldAnnotated">HelloWorldAnnotated</a> illustrates a common pattern.</p>
 
  Given a selection in a page, form the selectors needed to post an annotation that targets the selection.
   Lead a user through an interaction that influences the content of that annotation.
   Post the annotation.
  
<p>Here is an example of such an interaction. It’s a content-labeling scenario in which a user rates the emotional affect of a selection. This is the kind of thing that can be done with the stock Hypothesis client, but awkwardly because users must reliably add tags like WeakNegative or StrongPositive to represent their ratings. The app prompts for those tags to ensure consistent use of them. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Although the annotation is created by a standalone app, the Hypothesis client can anchor it, display it, and even edit it. </p>
<p></p>
<p>And the Hypothesis service can search for sets of annotations that match the tags WeakNegative or StrongPositive. </p>
<p>There’s powerful synergy at work here. If your annotation scenario requires controlled tags, or a prescribed workflow, you might want to adapt the Hypothesis client to do those things. But it can be easier to create a standalone app that does exactly what you need, while producing annotations that interoperate with the Hypothesis system.</p>
 Anchoring an annotation to its place in a document 
<p>Using this same set of modules, a tool or system can retrieve an annotation from a web service and anchor it to a document in the place where it belongs. You can try the second example in the README at <a href="https://github.com/judell/TextQuoteAndPosition">https://github.com/judell/TextQuoteAndPosition</a> to see how this works.</p>
<p>For a real-world demonstration of this technique, see <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2017/05/05/weaving-the-annotated-web/#sitc">Science in the Classroom</a>. It’s a project sponsored by The American Association for the Advancement of Science. Graduate students annotate research papers selected from the Science family of journals so that younger students can learn about the terminology, methods, and outcomes of scientific research.</p>
<p>Pre-Hypothesis, annotations on these papers were displayed using Learning Lens, a viewer that color-codes them by category. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Nothing about Learning Lens changed when Hypothesis came into the picture, it just provided a better way to record the annotations. Originally that was done as it’s often done in the absence of a formal way to describe annotation targets, by passing notes like: “highlight the word ‘proximodistal’ in the first paragraph of the abstract, and attach this note to it.” This kind of thing happens a lot, and wherever it does there’s an opportunity to adopt a more rigorous approach. Nowadays at Science in the Classroom the annotators use Hypothesis to describe where notes should anchor, as well as what they should say. When an annotated page loads it searches Hypothesis for annotations that target the page, and inserts them using the same format that’s always been used to drive the Learning Lens. Tags assigned by annotators align with Learning Lens categories. The search looks only for notes from designated annotators, so nothing unwanted will appear. </p>
 An annotation-powered survey 
<p>The <a href="https://credibilitycoalition.org/">Credibility Coalition</a> is “a research community that fosters collaborative approaches to understanding the veracity, quality and credibility of online information.” We worked with them on a project to test a set of <a href="https://credweb.org/reviewed-signals-20200224/">signals</a> that bear on the credibility of news stories. Examples of such signals include: </p>
 
 Title Representativeness (Does the title of an article accurately reflect its content?)
  Sources (Does the article cite sources?)
  Acknowledgement of uncertainty (Does the author acknowledge uncertainty, or the possibility things might be otherwise?)
  
<p>Volunteers were asked these questions for each of a set of news stories. Many of the questions were yes/no or multiple choice and could have been handled by any survey tool. But some were different. What does “acknowledgement of uncertainty” look like? You know it when you see it, and you can point to examples. But how can a survey tool solicit answers that refer to selections in documents, and record their locations and contexts? </p>
<p>The answer was to create a <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/blog/annotation-powered-questionnaires/">survey tool</a> that enabled respondents to answer such questions by highlighting one or more selections. Like the HelloWorldAnnotated example above, this was a bespoke client that guided the user through a prescribed workflow. In this case, that workflow was more complex. And because it was defined in a <a href="https://github.com/judell/AnnotationPoweredSurvey/blob/master/questions.js">declarative way</a>, the same app can be used for any survey that requires people to provide answers that refer to selections in web documents.</p>
 A JavaScript wrapper for the Hypothesis API 
<p>The HelloWorldAnnotated example uses functions from a library, <a href="https://github.com/judell/hlib">hlib</a>, to post an annotation to the Hypothesis service. That library includes functions for searching and posting annotations using the Hypothesis API. It also includes support for interaction patterns common to annotation apps, most of which occur in <a href="https://github.com/judell/facet">facet</a>, a standalone tool that searches, displays, and exports sets of annotations. Supported interactions include:</p>
<p>– Authenticating with an API token</p>
<p>– Creating a picklist of groups accessible to the authenticated user</p>
<p>– Assembling and displaying conversation threads</p>
<p>– Parsing annotations</p>
<p>– Editing annotations</p>
<p>– Editing tags</p>
<p>In addition to facet, other tools based on this library include <a href="https://github.com/judell/CopyAnnotations">CopyAnnotations</a> and <a href="https://github.com/judell/TagRename">TagRename</a></p>
 A Python wrapper for the Hypothesis API 
<p>If you’re working in Python, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/hypothesis-api/">hypothesis-api</a> is an alternative API wrapper that supports searching for, posting, and parsing annotations. </p>
 Notifications 
<p>If you’re a publisher who embeds Hypothesis on your site, you can use a <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/blog/new-search-capability/">wildcard search</a> to find annotations. But it would be helpful to be notified when annotations are posted. <a href="https://github.com/judell/h_notify">h_notify</a> is a tool that uses the Hypothesis API to watch for annotations on individual or wildcard URLs, or from particular users, or in a specified group, or with a specified tag. </p>
<p>When an h_notify-based watcher finds notes in any of these ways, it can send alerts to a Slack channel, or to an email address, or add items to an RSS feed.</p>
<p>At Hypothesis we mainly rely on the Slack option. In this example, user nirgendheim highlighted the word “interacting” in a page on the Hypothesis website. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The watcher sent this notice to our #website channel in Slack. </p>
<p></p>
<p>A member of the support team (Hypothesis handle mdiroberts) saw it there and responded to nirgendheim as shown above. How did nirgendheim know that mdiroberts had responded? The core Hypothesis system sends you an email when somebody replies to one of your notes. h_notify is for bulk monitoring and alerting.</p>
<p><a></a></p>
 A tiny Hypothesis server 
<p>People sometimes ask about connecting the Hypothesis client to an alternate server in order to retain complete control over their data. It’s doable, you can follow the instructions <a href="https://h.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing/install/">here</a> to build and run your own server, and some people and organizations do that. Depending on need, though, that can entail more effort, and more moving parts, than may be warranted.</p>
<p>Suppose for example you’re part of a team of investigative journalists annotating web pages for a controversial story, or a team of analysts sharing confidential notes on web-based financial reports. The documents you’re annotating are public, but the notes you’re taking in a Hypothesis private group are so sensitive that you’d rather not keep them in the Hypothesis service. You’d ideally like to spin up a minimal server for that purpose: small, simple, and easy to manage within your own infrastructure.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://github.com/judell/MinimalHypothesisServer">proof of concept</a>. This tiny server clocks in just 145 lines of Python with very few dependencies. It uses Python’s batteries-include SQLite module for annotation storage. The web framework is Pyramid only because that’s what I’m familiar with, but could as easily be Flask, the ultra-light framework typically used for this sort of thing. </p>
<p>A <a href="https://github.com/judell/MinimalHypothesisServer/blob/main/service.py">tiny app</a> wrapped around those ingredients is all you need to receive JSON payloads from a Hypothesis client, and return JSON payloads when the client searches for annotations to anchor to a page.</p>
<p>The service is dockerized and easy to deploy. To test it I used the <a href="https://fly.io/">fly.io</a> <a href="https://fly.io/docs/speedrun/">speedrun</a> to create an instance at <a href="https://summer-feather-9970.fly.dev">https://summer-feather-9970.fly.dev</a>. Then I made the handful of small tweaks to the Hypothesis client shown in <a href="https://github.com/judell/MinimalHypothesisServer/blob/main/client-patches.txt">client-patches.txt</a>. My method for doing that, typical for quick proofs of concept that vary the Hypothesis client in some small way, goes like this:</p>
 
  Clone the Hypothesis client.
   Edit gulpfile.js to say const IS_PRODUCTION_BUILD = false. This turns off minification so it’s possible to read and debug the client code.
   Follow the instructions to <a href="https://h.readthedocs.io/projects/client/en/latest/developers/developing/#running-the-client-from-the-browser-extension">run the client from a browser extension</a>. After establishing a link between the client repo and browser-extension repo, as per those instructions, use this build command — make build SETTINGS_FILE=settings/chrome-prod.json — to create a browser extension that authenticates to the Hypothesis production service.
   In a Chromium browser (e.g. Chrome or Edge or Brave) use chrome://extensions, click Load unpacked, and point to the browser-extension/build directory where you built the extension.
  
<p>This is the easiest way to create a Hypothesis client in which to try quick experiments. There are tons of source files in the repos, but just a handful of bundles and loose files in the built extension. You can run the extension, search and poke around in those bundles, set breakpoints, make changes, and see immediate results. </p>
<p>In this case I only made the changes shown in client-patches.txt:</p>
 
  In options/index.html I added an input box to name an alternate server.
   In options/options.js I sync that value to the cloud and also to the browser’s localStorage.
   In the extension bundle I check localStorage for an alternate server and, if present, modify the API request used by the extension to show the number of notes found for a page.
   In the sidebar bundle I check localStorage for an alternate server and, if present, modify the API requests used to search for, create, update, and delete annotations.
  
<p>I don’t recommend this cowboy approach for anything real. If I actually wanted to use this tweaked client I’d create branches of the client and the browser-extension, and transfer the changes into the source files where they belong. If I wanted to share it with a close-knit team I’d zip up the extension so colleagues could unzip and sideload it. If I wanted to share more broadly I could upload the extension to the Chrome web store. I’ve done all these things, and have found that it’s feasible — without forking Hypothesis — to maintain branches that maintain small but strategic changes like this one. But when I’m aiming for a quick proof of concept, I’m happy to be a cowboy.</p>
<p>In any event, here’s the proof. With the tiny server deployed to summer-feather-9970.fly.dev, I poked that address into the tweaked client. </p>
<p></p>
<p>And sure enough, I could search for, create, reply to, update, and delete annotations using that 145-line SQLite-backed server.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The client still authenticates to Hypothesis in the usual way, and behaves normally unless you specify an alternate server. In that case, the server knows nothing about Hypothesis private groups. The client sees it as the Hypothesis public layer, but it’s really the moral equivalent of a private group. Others will see it only if they’re running the same tweaked extension and pointing to the same server. You could probably go quite far with SQLite but, of course, it’s easy to see how you’d swap it out for a more robust database like Postgres.</p>
 Signposts 
<p>I think of these examples as signposts pointing to a coherent SDK for weaving annotation into any document workflow. They show that it’s feasible to decouple and recombine the core operations: creating an annotation based on a selection in a document, and anchoring an annotation to its place in a document. Why decouple? Reasons are as diverse as the document workflows we engage in. The stock Hypothesis system beautifully supports a wide range of scenarios. Sometimes it’s helpful to replace or augment Hypothesis with a custom app that provides a guided experience for annotators and/or an alternative display for readers. The annotation SDK I envision will make it straightforward for developers to build solutions that leverage the full spectrum of possibility.</p>

    <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/archive">This link gives you access to all the articles and archives</a> for &lt;/Hello CDO&gt; <p>“Prevention or Correction” is something society has wrestled with for a very long time. This article focuses on why our experience of “prevention or correction” ideas frames the CDO’s responsibilities and explores a linkage to a company’s approach to data.</p><p></p> <br>Almost irrespective of where you reside, we live with police, penal, and political systems that cannot fully agree on preventing or correcting.  It is not that we disagree with the “why”; is it the “how” that divides us! I am a child of an age when lefthandedness was still seen as something to correct, so we have made some progress.   <br>A fundamental issue is that prevention is the best thinking; but if you prevent it, it does not occur.  We are then left with the dilemma, “did you prevent it, or was it not going to occur anyway?” The finance team now ask, “Have we wasted resources on something that would not have happened?”<br><br>When something we don’t like does occur, we jump into action as we can correct it.  We prioritise, allocate resources and measure them.  We (humanity) appear to prefer a problem we can solve (touch, feel, see) and can measure rather than prevent.  A proportion of crime is driven by the poor economic situation of a population with no choice. Yet, we keep that same population in the same economic conditions as we have limited resources committed to correction (control.) It is way more messy and complex, and we need both, but prevention is not an easy route.  Just think about our current global pandemic, climate change or sustainability.  Prevention was a possibility in each case, but we kick into action now correction is needed. <br><br>In our new digital and data world, we are facing the same issues of prevention vs correction.  Should we prevent data issues or correct data issues, and who owns the problem?  <br><br>In the data industry right now, we correct and just like the criminal services, we have allocated all our budget to correction, so we don’t have time or resources for prevention. I would be rich if I had a dollar for every time I hear, “We need results, Fish, not an x*x*x*x data philosophy.” <br><br>For anyone who follows my views and beliefs, I advocate data quality founded on lineage and provenance (prevention). I am not a fan of the massive industry that has been built up to correct data (correction). I see it as a waste on many levels, but <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#">FUD</a> sells to a naive buyer. I am a supporter of having a presence at the source of data to <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#">guarantee attestation</a> and assign rights.  I cannot get my head around the massive budgets set aside to correct “wrong” data.  We believe that data quality is knowing the data is wrong and thinking we can correct it!  We have no idea if the correction is correct, and the updated data still lacks attestation.  We measure this madness and assign KPI to improve our corrective powers.  In this case, because it is data and not humans, prevention is the prefered solution as neither a cure nor correction work at any economic level that can be justified other than your a provider of the service or one of the capital providers. But as already mentioned, prevention is too hard to justify. The same analogy is a recurring theme in the buy (outsource) vs build debate for the new platform, but that is another post.  <br> Unpacking to expose and explore some motivations.  We know that the CDO job emerged in 2002, and some 20 years on, it is still in its infancy.  Tenures are still short (less than three years), and there is a lack of skills and experience because this data and digital thing are all new compared to marketing, finance, or accounting.  As I have written before, our <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#">job descriptions for the CDO remain poorly defined</a>, with mandates too broad and allocated resources too limited.  All many articles at <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#">&lt;/Hello CDO&gt;</a> I focus on the conflicts CDO’s have because of the mandates we are given.<br><br>Whilst mandates are too broad, thankfully, security and privacy are becoming new roles with their own mandates. The CDO is still being allocated a data transformation mandate but being asked to correct the data whilst doing it.   Not surprisingly, most data projects fail as the board remains fixated that the data we have is of value, and we should allocate all our resources correcting and securing it.   A bit like the house built on sand,  we endlessly commit resources to unpin a house without foundations because it is there, rather than moving to the more secure ground and building the right house.   Prevention or correction?   <br><br>All CDO’s face the classic problem of being asked to solve the world’s debt famine crisis with no budget, no resources and yesterday would be good.  Solve the data quality problem by correcting the waste at the end.  Because of this commitment to correct data, we find we are trapped.  “We should just finish the job as we have gone so far,”  is what the finance team says,  “prevention is like starting all over again”; it will be too expensive, wreck budgets and we will miss our bonus hurdle as it means a total re-start.  The budget is too big so let’s just put in some more foundations into the house built on sand.<br><br>It is one of my favourite saying “the reason it is called a shortcut, it because it is a short cut and it misses something out”  I often use it when we boil a decision down to an <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#">ROI number</a>, believing that all the information needed can be presented in a simple single dimensional number.  The correction ideals will always win when we use shortcuts, especially ROI.<br><br> Prevention is a hard sell.  Correction is a simple sell.   Who benefits from an endless correction policy? Probably the CDO!  We get to look super busy, it is easy to get the commitment, and no one will argue at the board/ senior leadership team to do anything else. It might take three years to see the transformation has not happened, and there is plenty of demand for CDO’s? Why would a CDO want to support prevention? Why is the CDO role so in question?<br><br>Prevention takes time, is complex, and you may not see results during your tenure. I often reflect on what <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#">will be my CDO legacy</a>?  Correction is instant, looks busy and gets results that you can be measured on.   Correction means there is always work to be done.  Prevention means you will eventually be out of a job.  Since prevention cannot be measured and is hard to justify with an ROI calculation,  maybe the CEO needs to focus on measuring the success of analytics?<br> Note to the CEO Data is complex, and like all expert discipline areas, you will seek advice, opinion and counsel from various sources to help form a balanced view.  Data quality is a thorny one as most of those around you will inform you of the benefits of correction over prevention.  Correction wins, and it is unlikely any balanced view arguing for prevention. <br><br>Perhaps it is worth looking at the CDO job description, focusing on what the KPIs are for and how you shift a focus to the outcomes of the analysis.  To improve analysis and outcomes demands better data quality, which correction can only get you so far. You get prevention by the back door.

<p>The UK&nbsp;<a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/ico-codes-of-practice/age-appropriate-design-a-code-of-practice-for-online-services/">Information Commission’s (ICO) Children’s Code</a>, officially known as the“Age Appropriate Design Code: a code of practice for online services,” after a year grace period, goes into effect Thursday, Sept. 2, 2021. The code, which falls under section 125(1)(b) of the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (the Act), looks to protect UK children, i.e., people under the age of eighteen (18).</p>
<p>Are you ready? I hope so; this code applies to any business, in and out of the UK, that provides digital services to UK children. And, it is not the only one of its kind around the world.</p>
 What You Need to Know 
<p>In the digital age, people’s digital footprint is first established months before they’re born, grows exponentially throughout their lives, and carries on after their death. Kids are especially vulnerable to being influenced by digital services; moreover, they are more likely to befall cybercrime. For instance, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/_files/pdfs/reports/2011/child-identity-theft.pdf">2011 study by Carnegie Mellon SyLab&nbsp;</a>study found that children were 51% more likely to have their security number used by someone else.</p>
 What is it for? 
<p>The code is designed to ensure that service providers of apps, programs, toys, or any other devices that collect and process children’s data “are appropriate for use by, and meet the development needs of, children.” It calls for 15 independent and interdependent legal, service design, and data processing principles and standards to be followed. Specifically, as called out in the code, these are:</p>
<p>• Best interests of the child • Data protection impact assessments • Age appropriate application• Transparency&nbsp;• Detrimental use of data • Policies and community standard • Default settings • Data minimization • Data sharing • Geolocation • Parental controls • Profiling • Nudge techniques • Connected toys and devices • Online tools</p>
 Who must comply? Risk of non-compliance 
<p>Information society services (ISS) that cater to UK children under the age of 18 or whose services are likely to be accessed by children must adhere to the code or risk ICO public assessment and enforcement notices, warnings, reprimands, and penalty notices (aka administrative fines). Serious code breaches may lead to fines of up to €20 million (or £17.5 million when the UK GDPR comes into effect) or 4% of the provider’s annual worldwide turnover, whichever is higher.</p>
 What you need to do 
<p>Ensuring the digital future and safety of children and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/elderjustice/prosecutors/statutes">venerable adults</a>&nbsp;(people over 18 who cannot meet their own needs or seek help without assistance) is a founding principal of a healthy society and for running a sustainable business. There are several recommended steps you can take to get into and maintain alignment with the code:</p>
<p>1. Consider the likelihood that a child (or vulnerable adult) might use your service,&nbsp;the liability is on the service provider to determine the likelihood a child will use their service. You should conduct user testing, surveys, market research (inc. competitive analysis), and professional and academic literature reviews.</p>
<p>2. Document your data flows (i.e. conduct a data protection impact assessment (DPIA)),&nbsp;your DPIA should consist of data and systems flow diagrams and detailed descriptions of these systems (inc. services, process, and interfaces), all the data flowing through them, and how data is handled. The flow diagram should illustrate each engagement swim lane (e.g., individual, client, company, third-party) and the direction of data flow. The supporting documentation should define each data element and clearly spell out how it will be collected, used and managed. Take it from me and my firsthand experience. The DPIA lens is an invaluable tool for strategic product development. I highly recommend that you not look at the DIPA process as a legal necessity but rather as a valuable framework for learning about and assessing how your products and services work, exactly what they do and why. Performed with the right lens, the DPIA can be a fertile ground for creative inspiration and innovation.</p>
<p>3. Make it a team sport,&nbsp;effective data management is a company-wide, multi-disciplinary activity. It is important that you ensure all key stakeholders, not just legal, IT, security, and compliance, but also marketing, user experience, customer experience, design, support, product, sales, and third-party compliance partners (experts that can help you and your team succeed) all play a role in ensuring your products and services do not just meet legal requirements but exceed people’s expectations.</p>
 But There Is More 
<p>The above steps are extremely useful; however, there are two more considerations that should not be neglected- 1) things are just getting started, and 2) people’s sentiment—“the opportunity to differentiate.”</p>
<p>First,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-09-14-gartner-says-by-2023--65--of-the-world-s-population-w">Gartner</a>&nbsp;estimates that 10% of the world’s population is currently protected under people-centric regulation, i.e. regulations like&nbsp;<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">Europe’s GDPR</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=3.&amp;part=4.&amp;lawCode=CIV&amp;title=1.81.5">California’s CPPA</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://lgpd-brazil.info/">Brazil’s LGPD</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/china-passes-data-protection-law/">China’s data production law</a>&nbsp;which takes effect Nov. 1 2021. By 2023 Gartner estimate this number will rise to 65%. Moreover, keep in mind, it will not just be omnibus rules that take effect; sectoral-specific rules will apply as well. For example, in the United States, the Federal Trade Commission is reevaluating its child protection laws (<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions-0">COPPA</a>) and the U.S. Department of Education Department will more than likely be updating the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (<a href="https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html">FERPA</a>). Moreover, there are state-specific regulations similar to the CCPA being enacted. For Instance, in July 2021, Colorado just enacted their people-centric regulations, “<a href="http://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2021A/bills/2021a_190_enr.pdf">Privacy Act of 2021</a>.”</p>
<p>Second, globally, as evidenced by the last seven years of the&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileecosystemforum.com/mefs-7th-annual-global-trust-report/">MEF Global Consumer Trust studies</a>, people are waking up to industry data practices. Simply saying they’re unhappy about them is an understatement. People are connected, they’re concerned, and they want control of their data. The problem is, they’re not exactly sure how to go about it.</p>
<p>There is more to win than just staying on the right side of the law. There is an opportunity for companies to go beyond the law, to recognize that digital privacy, the controls and flows of one’s personal data, should be treated as sacred as one’s physical privacy. Privacy should not be a luxury good obtained only by a select minority; it’s a human right. All three major societal constituents (individuals, private sector organizations, and public sector institutions) need to play their part. There is an opportunity for each to weigh in on this debate, especially public sector players who can differentiate themselves by actively and publicly providing people not just with the utility of the company’s service but with tools and education that help people proactively enact their data rights and to secure and gain agency over their digital footprint, not just now but throughout their entire life. Like global warming, if we each do our part, we can get data back under control and achieve a healthy equilibrium throughout the world’s markets.</p>

Building on the earlier works from Kim Cameron, and Christopher Allen, these principles layout what must be foundational principles around any self-sovereign identity system. The evolution of the Principles of SSI came about through the need to differentiate what is ‘true’ SSI versus marketing forces twisting the concept.  This market driven motivator can bring cultish overtones to the process.</p><p>With this event we had a bit of fun in what is otherwise 'serious' business.</p><p>A few themes that come out of the discussion:</p><p>- The position of the holder of the credential - when does the holder become the source of truth and the key to value creation?  In most current business value conversations the holder appears to incidental; the focus is on how to incent the verifiers and issuers with little regard to the position and influence of the holder.  While the SSI ‘triangle’ puts the holder at the ‘top’ of the triangle, the lack of consideration of the trust and value equation there, implies the triangle should be inverted elevating the issuers and verifiers and putting the holder on the bottom.</p><p>- When principles become a means of “locking in” a definition, they become a means of “locking out” those that do not meet the “bar”.  A concern voiced was that with this mental model, and the implication of the moral ‘righteousness’ of this position, the real commercial values of SSI are lost and those not in the ‘cult’ turn away.</p><p>The panelists are:</p>  <p>Simone Ravaioli, Director Digitary</p>  <p>Rob van Kranenberg, IoT Council and NGI Forward</p>  <p>Nicky Hickman, Chair of the ID4All WG, Sovrin Foundation</p>  <p>Michael Shea, Moderator of Vienna Digital Identity Meetup</p>  <p></p><p>To listen to a recording of the event please check out the link: <a href="https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/580329620">https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/580329620</a></p> Time markers:    <p>0:05:00  - Introduction </p>  <p>0:10:07   - Simone Ravaioli </p>  <p>0:17:09   - Nicky Hickman</p>  <p>0:25:44  - Rob van Kranenburg</p>  <p>0:35:00  - General Discussion</p>  <p>1:15:07   - Rob van Kranenburg</p>  <p>1:23:45  - Wrap up </p>   Resources <p>Slide decks:</p>  <p>Simone Ravaioli : Principles vs Cult (Simone)</p>  <p>Nicky Hickman : Principles vs Cult (Nicky)</p>  <p>Rob van Kranenburg : Slide Deck 1  Slide Deck 2</p>  <p>Blog Posts:</p>  <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/stoic-sovereign-identity-ssi-simone-ravaioli/">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/stoic-sovereign-identity-ssi-simone-ravaioli/</a></p>  <p>If interested in getting notifications of upcoming events please join the event group at: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Vienna-Digital-Identity-Meetup/">https://www.meetup.com/Vienna-Digital-Identity-Meetup/</a> </p><p>The Vienna Digital Identity Meetup is hosted by The Dingle Group and is focused on educating business, societal, legal and technologists on the new opportunities that arise with  a high assurance digital identity created by the reduction risk and strengthened provenance.

<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/27/working-with-postgres-types/">Working with Postgres types</a> I showed an example of a materialized view that depends on a typed set-returning function. Because Postgres knows about that dependency, it won’t allow DROP FUNCTION foo. Instead it requires DROP FUNCTION foo CASCADE.</p>
<p>A similar thing happens with materialized views that depend on tables or other materialized views. Let’s build a cascade of views and consider the implications.</p>
 create materialized view v1 as (
  select 
    1 as number,
    'note_count' as label 
);
SELECT 1

select * from v1;

number | label
-------+-------
     1 | note_count
 
<p>Actually, before continuing the cascade, let’s linger here for a moment. This is a table-like object created without using CREATE TABLE and without explicitly specifying types. But Postgres knows the types.</p>
 \d v1;

Materialized view "public.v1"

Column  | Type 
--------+-----
number  | integer
label   | text
 
<p>The read-only view can become a read-write table like so.</p>
 create table t1 as (select * from v1);
SELECT 1

select * from t1;

number | label
-------+-------
     1 | note_count

\d t1

Table "public.v1"

Column  | Type 
--------+-----
number  | integer
label   | text
 
<p>This ability to derive a table from a materialized view will come in handy later. It’s also just interesting to see how the view’s implicit types become explicit in the table.</p>
<p>OK, let’s continue the cascade.</p>
 create materialized view v2 as (
  select 
    number + 1,
    label
  from v1
);
SELECT 1

select * from v2;

number | label
-------+-------
     2 | note_count

create materialized view v3 as (
  select 
    number + 1,
    label
  from v2
);
SELECT 1

select * from v3;

number | label
-------+-------
     3 | note_count
 
<p>Why do this? Arguably you shouldn’t. Laurenz Albe makes that case in <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/tracking-view-dependencies-in-postgresql/">Tracking view dependencies in PostgreSQL</a>. Recognizing that it’s sometimes useful, though, he goes on to provide code that can track recursive view dependencies. </p>
<p>I use cascading views advisedly to augment the use of CTEs and functions described in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/21/postgres-functional-style/">Postgres functional style</a>. Views that refine views can provide a complementary form of the chunking that aids reasoning in an analytics system. But that’s a topic for another episode. In this episode I’ll describe a problem that arose in a case where there’s only a single level of dependency from a table to a set of dependent materialized views, and discuss my solution to that probem.</p>
<p>Here’s the setup. We have an annotation table that’s reloaded nightly. On an internal dashboard we have a chart based on the materialized view annos_at_month_ends_for_one_year which is derived from the annotation table and, as its name suggests, reports annotation counts on a monthly cycle. At the beginning of the nightly load, this happens: DROP TABLE annotation CASCADE. So the derived view gets dropped and needs to be recreated as part of the nightly process. But that’s a lot of unnecessary work for a chart that only changes monthly.</p>
<p>Here are two ways to protect a view from a cascading drop of the table it depends on. Both reside in a SQL script, monthly.sql, that only runs on the first of every month. First, annos_at_month_ends_for_one_year.</p>
 drop materialized view annos_at_month_ends_for_one_year;
create materialized view annos_at_month_ends_for_one_year as (
  with last_days as (
    select 
      last_days_of_prior_months( 
        date(last_month_date() - interval '6 year')
      ) as last_day
    ),
    monthly_counts as (
      select
        to_char(last_day, '_YYYY-MM') as end_of_month,
        anno_count_between( 
          date(last_day - interval '1 month'), last_day
        ) as monthly_annos
      from last_days
    )
    select
      end_of_month,
      monthly_annos,
      sum(monthly_annos) over 
        (order by end_of_month asc rows 
           between unbounded preceding and current row
        ) as cumulative_annos
    from monthly_counts
) with data;
 
<p>Because this view depends indirectly on the annotation table  — by way of the function anno_count_between — Postgres doesn’t see the dependency. So the view isn’t affected by the cascading drop of the annotation table. It persists until, once a month, it gets dropped and recreated.</p>
<p>What if you want Postgres to know about such a dependency, so that the view will participate in a cascading drop? You can do this.</p>
 create materialized view annos_at_month_ends_for_one_year as (
  with depends as (
    select * from annotation limit 1
  )
  last_days as (
    ),
  monthly_counts as (
    )
  select
    *
  from monthly_counts;
 
<p>The depends CTE doesn’t do anything relevant to the query, it just tells Postgres that this view depends on the annotation table.</p>
<p>Here’s another way to protect a view from a cascading drop. This expensive-to-build view depends directly on the annotation table but only needs to be updated monthly. So in this case, cumulative_annotations is a table derived from a temporary materialized view.</p>
 create materialized view _cumulative_annotations as (
  with data as (
    select 
      to_char(created, 'YYYY-MM') as created
    from annotation
    group by created
  ) 
  select 
    data.created, 
    sum(data.count) 
      over ( 
        order by data.created asc 
        rows between unbounded preceding and current row
      )
    from data
    group by data.created 
    order by data.created 

drop table cumulative_annotations;

create table cumulative_annotations as (
  select * from _cumulative_annotations
);

drop materialized view _cumulative_annotations;
 
<p>The table cumulative_annotations is only rebuilt once a month. It depends indirectly on the annotation table but Postgres doesn’t see that, so doesn’t include it in the cascading drop.</p>
<p>Here’s the proof.</p>
 -- create a table
create table t1 (number int);

insert into t1 (number) values (1);
INSERT 0 1

select * from t1;

number
-------
     1

-- derive a view from t1
create materialized view v1 as (select * from t1);
SELECT 1

select * from v1

number
-------
     1

-- try to drop t1
drop table t1;

ERROR: cannot drop table t1 because other objects depend on it
DETAIL: materialized view v1 depends on table t1
HINT: Use DROP ... CASCADE to drop the dependent objects too.

-- derive an independent table from t1 by way of a matview
drop materialized view v1;

create materialized view v1 as (select * from t1);
SELECT 1

create table t2 as (select * from v1);
SELECT 1

-- drop the matview
drop materialized view v1;

-- drop t1
drop table t1;

-- no complaint, and t2 still exists
select * from t2;

number
-------
     1
 
<p>These are two ways I’ve found to protect a long-lived result set from the cascading drop of a short-lived table on which it depends. You can hide the dependency behind a function, or you can derive an independent table by way of a transient materialized view. I use them interchangeably, and don’t have a strong preference one way or another. Both lighten the load on the analytics server. Materialized views (or tables) that only need to change weekly or monthly, but were being dropped nightly by cascade from core tables, are now recreated only on their appropriate weekly or monthly cycles.</p>

<p>In this series I’m exploring how to work in a code base that lives in two places: Metabase questions that encapsulate chunks of SQL, and Postgres functions/procedures/views that also encapsulate chunks of SQL. To be effective working with this hybrid collection of SQL chunks, I needed to reason about their interrelationships. One way to do that entailed the creation of a documentation generator that writes a concordance of callers and callees.</p>
<p>Here’s the entry for the function sparklines_for_guid(_guid).</p>
<p></p>
<p>The called by column says that this function is called from two different contexts. One is a Metabase question, All courses: Weekly activity. If you’re viewing that question in Metabase, you’ll find that its SQL text is simply this:</p>
 select * from sparklines_for_guid( {{guid}} )
 
<p>The same function call appears in a procedure, cache warmer, that preemptively memoizes the function for a set of the most active schools in the system. In either case, you can look up the function in the concordance, view its definition, and review how it’s called.</p>
<p>In the definition of sparkline_for_guid, names of other functions (like guid_hashed_view_exists) appear and are linked to their definitions. Similarly, names of views appearing in SELECT or JOIN contexts are linked to their definitions. </p>
<p>Here’s the entry for the function guid_hashed_view_exists. It is called by sparklines_for_guid as well as by functions that drive panels on the school dashboard. It links to the functions it uses: hash_for_guid and exists_view. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s the entry for the view lms_course_groups which appears as a JOIN target in sparklines_for_guid. This central view is invoked — in SELECT or JOIN context — from many functions, from dependent views, and from Metabase questions. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Metabase questions can also “call” other Metabase questions. In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/21/a-virtuous-cycle-for-analytics/">A virtuous cycle for analytics</a> I noted: “Queries can emit URLs in order to compose themselves with other queries.” Here’s an example of that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This Metabase question (985) calls various linked functions, and is called by two other Metabase questions. Here is one of those.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Because this Metabase question (600) emits an URL that refers to 985, it links to the definition of 985. It also links to the view, top_annotated_domains_last_week, from which it SELECTs.</p>
<p>It was straightforward to include Postgres functions, views, and procedures in the concordance since these live in files that reside in the fileystem under source control. Metabase questions, however, live in a database — in our case, a Postgres database that’s separate from our primary Postgres analytics db. In order to extract them into a file I use this SQL snippet.</p>
 select
  r.id,
  m.name as dbname,
  r.name,
  r.description,
  r.dataset_query
from report_card r
join metabase_database m
  on m.id = cast(r.dataset_query::jsonb-&gt;&gt;'database' as int)
where not r.archived
order by r.id;
 
<p>The doc generator downloads that Metabase data as a CSV file, queries.csv, and processes it along with the files that contain the definitions of functions, procedures, and views in the Postgres data warehouse. It also emits queries.txt which is a more convenient way to diff changes from one commit to the next. </p>
<p>This technique solved a couple of problems. First, when we were only using Metabase — unaugmented by anything in Postgres — it enabled us to put our Metabase SQL under source control and helped us visualize relationships among queries.</p>
<p>Later, as we augmented Metabase with Postgres functions, procedures, and views, it became even more powerful. Developing a new panel for a school or course dashboard means writing a new memoized function. That process begins as a Metabase question with SQL code that calls existing Postgres functions, and/or JOINs/SELECTs FROM existing Postgres views. Typically it then leads to the creation of new supporting Postgres functions and/or views. All this can be tested by internal users, or even invited external users, in Metabase, with the concordance available to help understand the relationships among the evolving set of functions and views.</p>
<p>When supporting functions and views are finalized, the SQL content of the Metabase question gets wrapped up in a memoized Postgres function that’s invoked from a panel of a dashboard app. At that point the concordance links the new wrapper function to the same set of supporting functions and views. I’ve found this to be an effective way to reason about a hybrid code base as features move from Metabase for prototyping to Postgres in production, while maintaining all the code under source control.</p>
<p>That foundation of source control is necessary, but maybe not sufficient, for a team to consider this whole approach viable. The use of two complementary languages for in-database programming will certainly raise eyebrows, and if it’s not your cup of tea I completely understand. If you do find it appealing, though, one thing you’ll wonder about next will be tooling. I work in VSCode nowadays, for which I’ve not yet found a useful extension for pl/pgsql or pl/python. With <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/13/pl-python-metaprogramming/">metaprogramming</a> life gets even harder for aspiring pl/pgsql or pl/python VSCode extensions. I can envision them, but I’m not holding my breath awaiting them. Meanwhile, two factors enable VSCode to be helpful even without deep language-specific intelligence.</p>
<p>The first factor, and by far the dominant one, is outlining. In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2019/09/05/products-and-capabilities/">Products and capabilities</a> I reflect on how I’ve never adopted an outlining product, but often rely on outlining capability infused into a product. In VSCode that’s “only” basic indentation-driven folding and unfolding. But I find it works remarkably well across SQL queries, views and functions that embed them, CTEs that comprise them, and pl/pgsql or pl/python functions called by them. </p>
<p>The second factor, nascent thus far, is GitHub Copilot. It’s a complementary kind of language intelligence that’s aware of, but not bounded by, what a file extension of .sql or .py implies. It can sometimes discern patterns that mix language syntaxes and offer helpful suggestions. That hasn’t happened often so far, but it’s striking when it does. I don’t yet know the extent to which it may be <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/11/working-with-intelligent-machines/">training me while I train it</a>, or how those interactions might influence others. At this point I’m not a major Copilot booster, but I am very much an interested observer of and participant in the experiment.</p>
<p>All in all, I’m guardedly optimistic that existing or feasible tooling can enable individuals and teams to sanely navigate the hybrid corpus of source code discussed in this series. If you’re along for the ride, you’ll next wonder about debugging and monitoring a system built this way. That’s a topic for a future episode.</p>

   America has fallen; taken hostage by political cults, our once great bastion of "Individual Liberty" has fallen victim to the mobs ruled by media disinformation, inadequate education, and technical gerrymandering by algorithm. People have become operational devotees to artificial participatory groupings functioning as mobs of influence. This "devotion" to practice has yielded a system at odds with Constitutional integrity.  <br>  How did this happen?  <br>  Why did Individual people cede authority to a system that abstracts them into legal definitions out of step with observable reality? "We The People" no longer function as actual people, Individuals all. Instead, "We" are a legal abstraction duly represented by a Government once established "of, by, for people". This legalese slight of hand has manifested a bureaucratic system of artificial intelligence, and cult-based political control, wherein Individuals are regarded as a threat to stability.  <br>  People in the real world can observe that the only human beings they ever meet or come to know are all Individuals. It is our choices which form cults, our methods that make mobs. Once made, these are hard to unmake for any one person. For they exist to defy and destroy the integrity of Individual empowerment. Groups harvest people by consent, or manipulation, and the harvesting creates a new intent. Seeing clearly this new intent is useful in understanding how/why cults come into power.  <br>  In Government funded education, a cult of practice or pedagogy is limited by credentialed membership. The support of one cult member for another is advanced by a caring community of social influence all in harmony with the manner by which their credentialed membership is enforced, and employed. The unionization of labor within this cult of pedagogy further entrenches the practices and support structure that any student or family in any zip code can anticipate receiving education from. Where methods of functional literacy fall short due to rapidly evolving practices in the real world, the structure of practice and labor serves to enforce the pace of available change/progress offered to students and families.  <br>  Everyone can see this happening for themselves, and many Individual Teachers will openly and adamantly acknowledge this operational fact, and their support for the stability of labor value tied to their cult of practice is hard to argue with, for as people, they certainly deserve respect for their working efforts. This then is the point wherein the structural outcomes derived by cults begins its insidious assault on communities, cultures, Nations and people, Individuals all.  <br>  Cults are not made by "bad people". Cults are made by "bad choices". Enforcing bad choices is the problem of greatest consequence. Look around, where does the enforcement of bad choices come from? How is our civil Society being forced into bad choices that yield outcomes out of step with our intent as a people who create their own way, in life, liberty and the pursuits of happiness guaranteed by our Governing assemblage?&nbsp;  <br>  This is our enemy America.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2020/08/kill-cult.html">People must kill the tendency towards cults.</a>  <br>  Cult rule never solves problems.. it just increases costs on infinite horizon of mass delusion for bureaucratic control.&nbsp;  <br>  Corporate bureaucracies extending from DOD, US CONGRESS, DOE, and every other department of every Federal and State Government all follow this same line of structural management by cult of practice. After retiring, contractors provide service of relationships between the same Government offices and personnel that they once worked with, enabling the efficient processing of opportunity by trust and devotion to a cult of practice. One political cult is elected and operational devotees arrive en masse to take their seats in the administrative machinery availed to their servicing mandates. With each Presidential election, this process can be experienced anew in Washington DC. A city emerges from the cults of influence that give operational meaning to time.&nbsp;  <br>  Taken to its extreme, the predictive outcomes that cult behaviors of practice/behavior/attention produce are easily harvested by propaganda-inducing algorithms used to influence mass sentiment. <a href="https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/08/10/how-the-daily-wire-uses-facebooks-targeted-advertising-to-build-its-brand">Advertising methods in social media systems</a> designed to produce cult behavior tendencies for ease of tracking attention and gaining access to social graphs where people influence one another as friends, brothers, sisters, daughters, sons, grandmas &amp; grandpas.. all for the purpose of producing cult outcomes for the predictable harvesting of management value. Any purpose, trackable cult behaviors. Any intent, trackable cult attention. Any manipulation, trackable cult influence.&nbsp;  <br>  Individual liberty that gives rise to a Nation and civil Society derived of, by, for people, Individuals all must be protected, at all costs. This is a structural requirement. People are not "people"; abstractions are not accurate enough. People are Individuals, and their operational participation is founded in the local mud, by the blood running through their veins for the integrity of their local community, culture and way of life.  <br>  Individual liberty has enemies, both well documented ones and new ones that appear from time to time. The Chinese Communist Party is one such enemy. Cults that remove Individual responsibility and induce group think are another. A systemic bureaucracy run by harvesting big data under surveillance technologies operating with artificial intelligence across time and space is another. These are insidious organizations of destructive intent, hell bent on capturing the loyalty of people, in lieu of allowing for actual free will expressed by people. Families must guard and protect the light of freedom found inside of each of us as people.&nbsp;  <br>  Bureaucracies around the world are racing towards the use of data aggregated for profound purposes, and are rapidly constituting a new type of "artificial intelligence" that is out of step with the inherent Rights of people, Individuals all.  <br>  Unless this aggregated effect of "We" is challenged to show its hand, to prove it exists to empower people, Individuals all, rather than replace them with an abstraction of literature or computer science &amp; engineering, everything that "We The People" hold dear will come to an end, replaced by a new version existing not "of, by, for" each of us, but instead.  <br>  The benefits of this transition will be cast broadly; Government-issued welfare benefits, a creator economy preying on the vanities of youth, and the destruction of work in favor of administration, delegation, crowdsourcing, and monetization of the cult attention graph. People will get rich for their compliant participation, while civil society gets weaker, less credulous, and more apt to extreme swings of behavior based on cult support for policies of the day.  <br>  You either stand for your Individual Rights, or you have none in the end. Standing means understanding how your Rights came to be, and how the source of your authority is the only protection you possess from cult rule. Mobs are spawning, and data aggregation via social-technical tools graphing the attention of people, and segmenting them by algorithm into easily targeted groups that can be harvested for financial and political gain is rampant. General data illiteracy is Nation-wide, around the entire globe. Political cults feed lies via media disinformation keeping people occupied trying to figure out how to be part of the group they agree with, most of the time.. some of the time.. today, for a specific reason.. always by cult association. Left cult, Right cult.. no people, no Individuals anywhere.  <br>  ID is the control parameter of freedom and security in a civil society. The source of your ID matters. In a civil society derived "of, by, for people", the source is obvious; ID comes from you.&nbsp;  <br>  Are you a database? Do you exist in a State Trust?  <br>  Rights are for people, not birth certificates. The law knows this, but it can not seem to figure out how to manifest this accurately without falsifying the inherent human authority required to resolve source integrity.  <br>  People own root. Individuals all, people are the source of Sovereign integrity, or there is none.  <br>  <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2012/02/what-is-sovereign-source-authority.html">Sovereign source authority</a> has been corrupted, and <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2021/07/recursive-signatory.html">only people can fix it in America</a>.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

<p>The OAuth 2.0 JWT-Secured Authorization Request (JAR) specification has been published as <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9101">RFC 9101</a>.  Among other applications, this specification is used by the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0.html">OpenID Financial-grade API (FAPI)</a>.  This is another in the series of RFCs bringing <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>-defined functionality to OAuth 2.0.  Previous such RFCs included “OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol” [<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7591.html">RFC 7591</a>] and “OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata” [<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8414.html">RFC 8414</a>].</p>
<p>The abstract of the RFC is:</p>
<blockquote><p><br>
The authorization request in OAuth 2.0 described in RFC 6749 utilizes query parameter serialization, which means that authorization request parameters are encoded in the URI of the request and sent through user agents such as web browsers. While it is easy to implement, it means that a) the communication through the user agents is not integrity protected and thus, the parameters can be tainted, b) the source of the communication is not authenticated, and c) the communication through the user agents can be monitored. Because of these weaknesses, several attacks to the protocol have now been put forward.</p>
<p><br>
This document introduces the ability to send request parameters in a JSON Web Token (JWT) instead, which allows the request to be signed with JSON Web Signature (JWS) and encrypted with JSON Web Encryption (JWE) so that the integrity, source authentication, and confidentiality properties of the authorization request are attained. The request can be sent by value or by reference.<br>
</p></blockquote>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>My dual premises in this series are:</p>
<p>– Modern SQL is more valuable as a programming language than you might think (see Markus Winand’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEDZQtAHpX8">Modern SQL: A lot has changed since SQL-92</a>)</p>
<p>– Postgres is more valuable as a programming environment than you might think. (see R0ml Lefkowitz’s <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/01/24/the-image-of-postgres/">The Image of Postgres</a>)</p>
<p>As the patron saint of trailing edge technology it is my duty to explore what’s possible at the intersection of these two premises. The topic for this episode is Postgres functional style. Clearly what I’ve been doing with the combo of pl/python and pl/pgsql is very far from pure functional programming. The self-memoization technique shown in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/19/postgres-set-returning-functions-that-self-memoize-as-materialized-views/What%20I%20showed">episode 7</a> is all about mutating state (ed: this means writing stuff down somewhere). But it feels functional to me in the broader sense that I’m using functions to orchestrate behavior that’s expressed in terms of SQL queries.</p>
<p>To help explain what I mean, I’m going to unpack one of the Postgres functions in our library. </p>
 count_of_distinct_lms_students_from_to(_guid text, _from date, _to date)
 
<p>This is a function that accepts a school id (aka guid), a start date, and an end date. Its job is to:</p>
<p>– Find all the courses (groups) for that school (guid)</p>
<p>– Filter to those created between the start and end date</p>
<p>– Find all the users in the filtered set of courses</p>
<p>– Filter to just students (i.e. omit instructors)</p>
<p>– Remove duplicate students (i.e., who are in more than one course)</p>
<p>– Return the count of distinct students at the school who annotated in the date range</p>
<p>The production database doesn’t yet store things in ways friendly to this outcome, so doing all this requires some heavy lifting in the analytics data warehouse. Here’s the function that orchestrates that work.</p>
 create function count_of_distinct_lms_students_from_to(_guid text, _from date, _to date) 
  returns bigint as $$
  declare count bigint;
  begin
 1  -- all groups active for the guid in the date range
 2  with groups as (
 3    select pubid from groups_for_guid(_guid)
 4    where group_is_active_from_to(pubid, _from, _to)
 5  ),
 6  -- usernames in those groups
 7  usernames_by_course as (
 8    select
 9      pubid,
10      (users_in_group(pubid)).username 
11  from groups 
12  ),
13  -- filtered to just students
14  students_by_course as (
15    select * from usernames_by_course
16    where not is_instructor(username, pubid)
17  )
18  select 
19    count (distinct username) 
20  from students_by_course
    into count;
    return count;
  end;
$$ language plpgsql;
 
<p>If you think pl/pgsql is old and clunky, then you are welcome to do this in pl/python instead. There’s negligible difference between how they’re written and how fast they run. It’s the same chunk of SQL either way, and it exemplifies the functional style I’m about to describe. </p>
<p>Two kinds of chunking work together here: CTEs (aka common table expressions, aka WITH clauses) and functions. If you’ve not worked with SQL for a long time, as I hadn’t, then CTEs may be unfamiliar. I think of them as pipelines of table transformations in which each stage of the pipeline gets a name. In this example those names are groups (line 2), usernames_by_course (line 7), and students_by_course (line 14). </p>
<p>The pipeline phases aren’t functions that accept parameters, but I still think of them as being function-like in the sense that they encapsulate named chunks of behavior. The style I’ve settled into aims to make each phase of the pipeline responsible for a single idea (“groups active in the range”, “usernames in those groups”), and to express that idea in a short snippet of SQL. </p>
<p>As I’m developing one of these pipelines, I test each phase. To test the first phase, for example, I’d do this in psql or Metabase.</p>
 -- all groups active for the guid in the date range
with groups as (
  select pubid from groups_for_guid('8anU0QwbgC2Cq:canvas-lms')
  where group_is_active_from_to(pubid, '2021-01-01', '2021-05-01')
)
select * from groups;
 
<p>And I’d spot-check to make sure the selected groups for that school really are in the date range. Then I’d check the next phase.</p>
 -- all groups active for the guid in the date range
with groups as (
),
-- usernames in those groups
usernames_by_course as (
  select
    pubid,
    (users_in_group(pubid)).username 
  from groups 
)
select * from usernames_by_course;
 
<p>After another sanity check against these results, I’d continue to the next phase, and eventually arrive at the final result. It’s the same approach I take with regular expressions. I am unable to visualize everything that’s happening in a complex regex. But I can reason effectively about a pipeline of matches that occur in easier-to-understand named steps.</p>
<p>Ideally each phase in one of these pipelines requires just a handful of lines of code: few enough to fit within the 7 +- 2 limit of working memory. Postgres functions make that possible. Here are the functions used in this 20-line chunk of SQL.</p>
<p>– groups_for_guid(guid): Returns a table of course ids for a school.</p>
<p>– group_is_active_from_to(pubid, _from, _to): Returns true if the group was created in the range.</p>
<p>– users_in_group(pubid): Returns a table of user info for a course.</p>
<p>– is_instructor(username, pubid): Returns true if that user is an instructor.</p>
<p>Two of these, groups_for_guid and users_in_group, are set-returning functions. As noted in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/27/working-with-postgres-types/">Working with Postgres types</a>, they have the option of returning an explicit Postgres type defined elsewhere, or an implicit Postgres type defined inline. As it happens, both do the latter.</p>
 create or replace function groups_for_guid(_guid text)
  returns table(
    pubid text
  ) as $$
 
 create or replace function users_in_group (_pubid text)
  returns table (
    groupid text, 
    username text, 
    display_name text
  ) as $$
 
<p>The other two, group_is_active_from_to and is_instructor, return boolean values.</p>
<p>All this feels highly readable to me now, but the syntax of line 10 took quite a while to sink in. It helps me to look at what users_in_group(pubid) does in a SELECT context.</p>
 select * from users_in_group('4VzA92Yy')

groupid   | username    | display_name
----------+-------------+----------------
4VzA92Yy  | 39vA94AsQp  | Brendan Nadeau
 
<p>Here is an alternate way to write the usernames_by_course CTE at line 7.</p>
 -- usernames in those groups
usernames_by_course as (
  select
    g.pubid,
    u.username
from groups g 
join users_in_group(g.pubid) u on g.pubid = u.groupid
)
select * from usernames_by_course;
 
<p>Both do exactly the same thing in very close to the same amount of time. Having mixed the two styles I’m leaning toward the first, but you could go either way or both. What matters more is the mental leverage you wield when writing CTEs and functions together to compose pipelines of transformations, and that others wield when reading and debugging.</p>
<p>I hope I’ve made the case for writing and reading. There’s a case to be made for debugging too, but that’s another episode.</p>

And, the problem is only going to get worse as we become more and more connected in the coming years, one estimate predicts that by 2025 people will be interacting with and leaking their identity and data to IoT devices 4,800 times a day, i.e.&nbsp;about every 3.3 seconds&nbsp;(Reinsel et al., 2017), and the ITRC predicts in 2021 we’ll experience the most data breaches ever in a single year; the good news is the number of people impacted will be lower than in previous years (“Data Breaches Are Up 38 Percent in Q2 2021; The ITRC Predicts a New All-Time High by Year’s End,” 2021).</p>
<p>People lack and want control over their physical and digital self (aka data)&nbsp;(DMA &amp; Acxiom, 2015). They want their privacy, they don’t know where to start, they lack the tools and education to manage their data&nbsp;(Babun et al., 2019;&nbsp;“Computer&nbsp;Services&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;The Harris Poll,”&nbsp;2019).</p>
 Identity Protection Services Is Not Enough: The Harms &amp; Costs Caused by a Data Breach 
<p>Identity protection services, like those being offered to the affected, can remind us that we have a problem, that the “Cows” have gotten out of the barn, but they don’t offer a solution. These services will tell someone that a personal attribute, e.g.&nbsp;an email address or social security or government ID number, has been found on the dark web. They rarely tell someone much more, e.g.&nbsp;how their data got leaked in the first place or any other meaningful, actionable insight<a href="http:/#fn2">2</a>. Moreover, they don’t address the emotional, time, economic, physical (inc. life), reputational, relationship, chilling effect, discrimination, thwarted expectations, control, data quality, informed choice, vulnerability, disturbance, autonomy, social, civic, and political harms that people may immediately experience following a breach or that may befall them years after a breach has occurred&nbsp;(Calo, 2010; Citron &amp; Solove, 2021), i.e.&nbsp;long after the identity protection monitoring service bandaid has dried up and fallen off.</p>
<p>The total cost of the potential immediate and long-term harm exposure from a breach far exceeds the $39.99/year value of the identity protection service bandaid. For many, it can take days, weeks, or even years to find out their data was compromised, and it can take many hundreds of hours and upwards of thousands of dollars to recover&nbsp;(“Data&nbsp;Breaches Are Up&nbsp;38&nbsp;Percent&nbsp;in&nbsp;Q22021;&nbsp;The ITRC Predicts&nbsp;a&nbsp;New All-Time High&nbsp;by&nbsp;Year’s&nbsp;End,”&nbsp;2021)&nbsp;from a severe breach or misuse of their data.</p>
<p>And so far we’ve just been talking about “material” past or current harms. What about future harm, i.e. lost opportunity? For example, the lost opportunity to buy a car or house, but you can’t because the breach trashed your credit score and you can’t get the inaccuracies removed. The FTC reported that 20% of people have at least one error in their credit report (Fiano, 2019). Or, the opportunity that can be gained by having control over one’s data (e.g. in the form a personal data store or personal information management system) and using it to learn about one’s self, to more efficiently navigate life, or even profit from one’s own records, attributes, labor, or capital data?</p>
 It’s time to give people a seat at the table 
<p>The elephant in the room, and one not taken nearly seriously enough, is that our personal data has value and this data and value should be in control of the data subject, i.e. the person that it relates to or is generated by. As the former EU commissioner Maglena Kuneva noted as far back as 2009,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Personal data is the new oil of the internet and the new currency of the digital world”&nbsp;“Meglena&nbsp;Kuneva&nbsp;–&nbsp;European Consumer Commissioner&nbsp;–&nbsp;Keynote Speech&nbsp;–&nbsp;Roundtable&nbsp;on&nbsp;Online Data Collection,&nbsp;Targeting&nbsp;and&nbsp;Profiling”&nbsp; Meglena&nbsp;Kuneva&nbsp;–&nbsp;European Consumer Commissioner&nbsp;–&nbsp;Keynote Speech&nbsp;–&nbsp;Roundtable&nbsp;on&nbsp;Online Data Collection,&nbsp;Targeting&nbsp;and&nbsp;Profiling”&nbsp;(2009).</p></blockquote>
<p>Why is it not addressed? Possibly, because the industry says people don’t care about their data? Or, we think regulations will take care of it. More likely, it is because it threatens the efficiency of existing operations and business models and that it is just not practical at scale today and is too hard to implement at this time (Pinarbasi &amp; Pavagadhi, 2020). In aggregate, people’s data is worth trillions of dollars. Corporations are taking the lion’s share of the benefits while individuals are left holding unmitigated risks.&nbsp;<a href="https://identitypraxis.com/the-identity-nexus/">The Identity Nexus</a>&nbsp;equation, the equilibrium state where benefit and risk is equally shared throughout society, is out of balance.</p>
<p>It is time we empower people and give them a share of the riches they are generating, which is worth far more than a free account, recommendation, or article they are getting today. It is time we get The Identity Nexus equation back into balance. Our privacy should not be a luxury good, as it is today. Today people are the entre being served up to industry, primarily in the form of marketing, risk mitigation, and people search&nbsp;(Dixon &amp; Gellman, 2014;&nbsp;“FTC&nbsp;to&nbsp;Study Data Broker Industry’s&nbsp;Collection&nbsp;and&nbsp;Use&nbsp;of&nbsp;Consumer Data,”&nbsp;2012). It is time we move them off the table, and give them a seat at the table. If we enable them to be active participants in the collection, management, and exchange of their data, the personal, civic, social, and commercial bounties will be plentiful. This is not an idea problem, nor a technology problem, it is an imagination and will problem. The ideas have been with us for decades&nbsp;(Bush, 1945; Laudon, 1996;&nbsp;Personal&nbsp;Data, 2011), and the technology is maturing at a breakneck pace. There are pockets of innovation happening today where people are working on putting people in control of their data, like&nbsp;<a href="https://mydata.org/">MyData</a>&nbsp;(see Langford et al. (2020) MyData operators report), the&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileecosystemforum.com/personal-data-identity/">Mobile Ecosystem Forum PD&amp;I working group</a>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshops</a>, and the many self-sovereign identity working groups at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/#:~:text=The%20mission%20of%20the%20Decentralized,requirements%20for%20DID%20Method%20specifications.">W3C Ddecentrailized Identity</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Trust over IP Foundation</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">The Good Health Pass Collaborative</a>&nbsp;(a group working on a self-sovereign COVID testing credential), to name just a few. The problem is, we’ve simply gotten too comfortable with the status quo and the collective we simply can’t imagine a different world.</p>
 We need systemic change. 
<blockquote><p>“We’re entering an age of personal big data, and its impact on our lives will surpass that of the Internet”&nbsp;(Maney, 2014).</p></blockquote>
<p>Being reminded that there is a problem is not enough to address the problem. We need to prevent harm, or at least mitigate it, before it occurs, as well as address other harms, i.e.&nbsp;the illicit and legal misuses or non-permitted use of our data, and the lost opportunity that people may realize from having cross-sector access and control of their data. In the end, the individual can be the only one that has a complete view of themselves&nbsp;(Brohman et al., 2003). We need to create opportunities for personal fulfillment. Identity protection is a start. But, what people need is control. Contracts, terms of service, and privacy policies are not enough.&nbsp;Regulation is not enough. Trust in commercial and non-commercial institutions to do “the right thing” is not enough. People need to be in a position where they can “trust but verify.”</p>
 Five-pillars of digital sovereignty for the phygital human 
<p>To control their digital self, people need a systematic framework to embrace the five pillars of digital sovereignty–awareness, intention &amp; behavior, insurance, rights, and technology–all of which rests on education. People need education to understand the problem, to know how and when to use the utilities and services, and how and when to take specific actions that suit their personal circumstances, their context. Moreover, regarding rights, they need regulation that recognizes privacy harm, not just privacy law&nbsp;(Gilliland, 2019).</p>
<p>As an industry, we should not just be offering bandaids; we should be providing a suite of convenient, unobtrusive, passive and active, value-generating utilities, services and education (aka privacy-enhancing technologies and personal identity management capabilities) that help people take back control of their data, their digital self. We need to put in the time to build exceptional customer experience, user experience, and contextually relevant content.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Content is King, but Context is God”&nbsp;(Vaynerchuk, 2017)</p></blockquote>
<p>We live in a connected digital age. We have become phygital beings (physical + digital). Today, for many, the digital part of us has more personal, social, and economic value than the physical self. It is time for people to have control of what matters most–their digital self, alongside their physical self. We need to be whole again.</p>
 ENDNOTES 
 
 Bernard (2020)&nbsp;reported that only 1 in 10 Americans took advantage of the settlement offered following the 2017 Equifax data breach that impacted 147 million Americans. 
 The reality is that due to the prevalence of data sharing and exchange and the sheer number of data breaches tracked insect 2005, it is nearly impossible to track the original source of breached data. It is estimated that there have been well over 10,000 data breaches since 2005&nbsp;(2020 in Review&nbsp;Data Breach Report, 2021;&nbsp;“Data&nbsp;Breaches,”&nbsp;2021;&nbsp;U.S. Data Breaches and Exposed Records 2020, 2021). And, according to the ITRC, 2021 is on track to be a record year for data breaches. The number of breaches in Q2 2021 was up 38 percent over Q1 2021. For the year, the H1 2021 breaches account for 76 percent of the 2020 totals. The good news, however, is the total number of people impact in 2021 is going down&nbsp;(“Data&nbsp;Breaches Are Up&nbsp;38&nbsp;Percent&nbsp;in&nbsp;Q2&nbsp;2021;&nbsp;The ITRC Predicts&nbsp;a&nbsp;New All-Time High&nbsp;by&nbsp;Year’s&nbsp;End,”&nbsp;2021)

<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/24/pl-pgsql-versus-pl-python-heres-why-im-using-both-to-write-postgres-functions/">episode 2</a> I mentioned three aspects of pl/python that are reasons to use it instead of pl/pgsql: access to Python modules, metaprogramming, and introspection. In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/13/pl-python-metaprogramming/">episode 5</a> I discussed metaprogramming, by which I mean using pl/python to compose and run SQL code. This episode features introspection, by which I mean taking advantage of Python’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#module-inspect">inspect</a> module to enable a pl/python function to discover its own name. </p>
<p>Why do that? In this context, so that the function can create a materialized view by joining its own name with the value of its first parameter. Here’s the example from episode 5. </p>
 questions_and_answers_for_group(_group_id text)
  returns setof question_and_answer_for_group as $$
  from plpython_helpers import (
    exists_group_view,
    get_caller_name,
    memoize_view_name
  )
  base_view_name = get_caller_name()
  view_name = f'{base_view_name}_{_group_id}'
  if exists_group_view(plpy, view_name):
    sql = f""" select * from {view_name} """
  else:
    sql = f"""
    -- SQL THAT RETURNS A SETOF QUESTION_AND_ANSWER_FOR_GROUP
    """
    memoize_view_name(sql, view_name)
    sql = f""" select * from {view_name} """
  return plpy.execute(sql)
$$ language plpython3u;
 
<p>The function drives a panel on the course dashboard. An initial call to, say, questions_and_answers_for_group('P1mQaEEp'), creates the materialized view questions_and_answers_for_group_p1mqaeep and returns SELECT * from the view. Subsequent calls skip creating the view and just return SELECT * from it. </p>
<p>Note that the even though the group name is mixed case; the view name created by Postgres is all lowercase. For example:</p>
 create materialized view test_AbC as (select 'ok') with data;
SELECT 1

\d test_AbC
Materialized view "public.test_abc"
 
<p>I want to think of this as a form of capability injection, but it’s really more like a capability wrapper. The capability is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">memoization</a>. A function endowed with it can run a SQL query and cache the resulting rows in a materialized view before returning them to a SQL SELECT context. The wrapper is boilerplate code that discovers the function’s name, checks for the existence of a corresponding view, and if it isn’t found, calls memoize_view_name(sql, view_name) to run an arbitrary chunk of SQL code whose result set matches the function’s type. So in short: this pattern wraps memoization around a set-returning pl/python function.</p>
<p>As noted in episode 5, although memoize_view_name is called from pl/python, it is not itself a pl/python function. It’s a normal Python function in a module that’s accessible to the instance of Python that the Postgres pl/python extension is using. In my case that module is just a few small functions in file called plpython_helpers.py, installed (cough, copied) to user postgres‘s ~/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/plpython_helpers.py.</p>
<p>So far, there are only two critical functions in that module: get_caller_name() and memoize_view_name.</p>
<p>Here is get_caller_name().</p>
 import re
base_view_name = inspect.stack()[1][3].replace('__plpython_procedure_', '')
return re.sub(r'_\d+$', '', base_view_name)
 
<p>The internal name for a pl/python function created by CREATE FUNCTION foo() looks like __plpython_procedure_foo_981048462. What get_caller_name() returns is just foo.</p>
<p>Here’s memoize_view_name().</p>
 def memoize_view_name(sql, view_name):
  sql = sql.replace('\n', ' ')
  encoded_bytes = base64.b64encode(sql.encode('utf-8'))
  encoded_str = str(encoded_bytes, 'utf-8')
  cmd = f"""psql -d h_analytics -c "call memoizer('{encoded_str}', '{view_name}')" """
  result = os.system(cmd)
  print(f'memoize_view_name: {cmd} result: {result}')
 
<p>Given a chunk of SQL and the name of a view, it converts newlines to spaces, base64-encodes the query text, and invokes psql to call a procedure, memoizer, that does the work of running the SQL query and creating the materialized view from those results. So for example the function that yields <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/05/the-tao-of-unicode-sparklines/">sparkline</a> data for a school might look like sparkline_data_for_school('af513ee'), and produce the view sparkline_data_for_school_af513ee.</p>
<p>Why shell out to psql here? It may not be necessary, there may be a way to manage the transaction directly within the function, but if so I haven’t found it. I’m very far from being an expert on transaction semantics and will appreciate guidance here if anyone cares to offer it. Meanwhile, this technique seems to work well. memoizer is a Postgres procedure, not a function. Although “stored procedures” is the term that I’ve always associated with in-database programming, I went pretty far down this path using only CREATE FUNCTION, never CREATE PROCEDURE. When I eventually went there I found the distinction between functions and procedures to be a bit slippery. This <a href="https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/2357/what-are-the-differences-between-stored-procedures-and-stored-functions">StackOverflow answer</a> matches what I’ve observed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PostgreSQL 11 added stored procedures as a new schema object. You can create a new procedure by using the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createprocedure.html"><code>CREATE PROCEDURE</code></a> statement.</p>
<p>Stored procedures differ from functions in the following ways:</p>
 
 
<p>Stored procedures do not have to return anything, and only return a single row when using <code>INOUT</code> parameters.</p>
 
 
<p>You can commit and rollback transactions inside stored procedures, but not in functions.</p>
 
 
<p>You execute a stored procedure using the <code>CALL</code> statement rather than a <code>SELECT</code> statement.</p>
 
 
<p>Unlike functions, procedures cannot be nested in other DDL commands (<code>SELECT</code>, <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, <code>DELETE</code>).</p>
 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Here is the memoizer procedure. It happens to be written in pl/python but could as easily have been written in pl/pgsql using the built-in Postgres decode function. Procedures, like functions, can be written in either language (or others) and share the <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/27/working-with-postgres-types/">common Postgres type system</a>.</p>
 create procedure memoizer(_sql text, _view_name text) as $$
  import base64
  decoded_bytes = base64.b64decode(_sql)
  decoded_str = str(decoded_bytes, 'utf-8')
  create = f"""
    create materialized view if not exists {_view_name} as (
      {decoded_str}
    ) with data;
    """
  plpy.execute(create)
  permit = f"""
    grant select on {_view_name} to analytics;
  """
  plpy.execute(permit)
$$ language plpython3u;
 
<p>There’s no plpy.commit() here because psql takes care of that automatically. Eventually I wrote other procedures, some of which do their own committing, but that isn’t needed here. </p>
<p>Of course it’s only possible to shell out to psql from a function because pl/python is an “untrusted” language extension. Recall from <a>episode 1</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The ability to wield any of Python’s built-in or loadable modules inside Postgres brings great power. That entails great responsibility, as the Python extension is “untrusted” (that’s the ‘u’ in ‘plpython3u’) and can do anything Python can do on the host system: read and write files, make network requests.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Using Python’s os.system() to invoke psql is another of those superpowers. It’s not something I do lightly, and if there’s a better/safer way I’m all ears.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this approach is delivering much value. We have two main dashboards, each of which displays a dozen or so panels. The school dashboard reports on annotation activity across all courses at a school. The course dashboard reports on the documents, and selections within documents, that instructors and students are discussing in the course’s annotation layer. Each panel that appears on the school or course dashboard is the output of a memoized function that is parameterized by a school or course id. </p>
<p>The data warehouse runs on a 24-hour cycle. Within that cycle, the first call to a memoized function takes just as long as it takes to run the SQL wrapped by the function. The cached view only comes into play when the function is called again during the same cycle. That can happen in a few different ways.</p>
<p>– A user reloads a dashboard, or a second user loads it.</p>
<p>– A panel expands or refines the results of another panel. For example, questions_and_answers_for_group() provides a foundation for a family of related functions including:</p>
<p>– questions_asked_by_teacher_answered_by_student()</p>
<p>– questions_asked_by_student_answered_by_teacher()</p>
<p>– questions_asked_by_student_answered_by_student()</p>
<p>– A scheduled job invokes a function in order to cache its results before any user asks for them. For example, the time required to cache panels for school dashboards varies a lot. For schools with many active courses it can take minutes to run those queries, so preemptive memoization matters a lot. For schools with fewer active courses it’s OK to memoize on the fly. This method enables flexible cache policy. Across schools we can decide how many of the most-active ones to cache. Within a school, we can decide which courses to cache, e.g. most recent, or most active. The mechanism to display a dashboard panel is always the same function call. The caching done in support of that function is highly configurable.</p>
<p>Caches, of course, must be purged. Since these materialized views depend on core tables it was enough, early on, to do this for views depending on the annotation table.</p>
<p>drop table annotation cascade;</p>
<p>At a certain point, with a growing number of views built during each cycle, the cascade failed.</p>
 ERROR:  out of shared memory
HINT:  You might need to increase max_locks_per_transaction.
 
<p>That wasn’t the answer. Instead we switched to enumerating views and dropping them individually. Again that afforded great flexibility. We can scan the names in the pg_matviews system table and match all the memoized views, or just those for a subset of schools, or just particular panels on school or course dashboards. Policies that govern the purging of cached views can be as flexible as those that govern their creation.</p>

<p>My parents (that’s them, Eleanor and Allen Searls) were married on 17 August 1946, seventy-five years and two days ago. I would have posted something then, but I was busy—though not too busy to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/docsearls/posts/10157908630421573">drop something</a> in Facebook, where much of the readership for this blog, plus the writership of others listed in my <a href="http://weblog.searls.com/">old blogroll</a>, has drifted in the Age of Social Media. Alas, blogging is less social than Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=list+of+all+chat+apps">chatterteriat</a>. But that doesn’t stop me from blogging anyway.</p>
<p>The wedding took place in&nbsp;Minneapolis, for the convenience of Mom’s family of second and third generation Swedish members of the homesteading diaspora, scattered then around Minnesota, North Dakota and Wisconsin. Pop was from New Jersey, and all his immediate kin were there and in New York. After the wedding the couple came east to briefly occupy the home they rented in North Bergen, New Jersey while mostly hanging at Grandma Searls’ house in Fort Lee (where Pop grew up with his two sisters), and then a short drive west of there in Maywood, where Jan and I grew up. I was born less than a year later, and my sister Jan less than two years after that.</p>
<p>In a comment under my Facebook post, Jan writes,</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157627459328424">Mom</a> from ND and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157627459297180">Pop</a> from NJ met in <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/424260609/in/album-72157600005052861/">Alaska</a> in the middle of WWII. He’d already served in the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157626063363207">Costal Artillery</a> in the early 30s but after D-Day came home to join up. They courted by mail after the war while he was with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Headquarters_Allied_Expeditionary_Force">SHAEFE (he loved that acronym: Supreme HQ Allied Expeditionary Forces Europe)</a>, and Mom <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/424261085/in/album-72157627459328424/">with the Red Cross</a> at a Naval Hospital in Oregon. When he got home, she flew to NJ for 6 days of courtship – at a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157626246795005">small shack</a> at the NJ shore with Pop’s entire family! He came to MN the night before the wedding. They fell in love with the dream of having a family and future together, and always said they really fell in love with each other on their honeymoon and were devoted to each other. Mom was 33, Pop was 38, and they’d already lived lives of adventure, full of friends and family. We grew up knowing were blessed to have them as our parents.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve added links. The Shack is still there, by the way.</p>
<p>Alas, Mom passed in ’03 and Pop in ’79. But they were exceptionally fine parents and grandparents. Not all kids are so lucky.</p>
<p>So, a belated toast, in pixels.</p>

<p>To be a mobile marketer is to be a marketer.</p>
<p>Mobile is table stakes to marketers, as evidenced by the ubiquitous adoption of mobile devices and services throughout the world in every aspect of our lives. As a marketer, it is important to remember that mobile is not used just for commercial activities; it is used throughout every facet of our lives. We use our mobile devices for everything, from work, play, social, banking, shopping, sex, taxes, death, and religion. No industry, no company, no relationship is immune to mobile. Mobile contributes nearly $4.4 trillion to the world’s GDP&nbsp;(The&nbsp;Mobile Economy&nbsp;2021, 2021). Mobile plays a role in every customer experience and journey; what&nbsp;Julie Ask (2014)&nbsp;considers micro-moments. With mobile, people are connected, and it is important to recognize that the connected individual is the media, is the point-of-sale display. The connected individual is the future of your business. You must learn to be of service to the connected individual and eventually engage them on their terms (more on this later).</p>
 By the Numbers 
<p>The numbers are clear. There are,</p>
 
 5.22 billion unique mobile users (66% of the global population&nbsp;(Kemp et al., 2021), which is estimated to grow to 5.7 billion by 2025&nbsp;(The&nbsp;Mobile Economy&nbsp;2021, 2021). 
 The mobile device is the great unifying digital platform across all racial groups, at least in the U.S.&nbsp;(Atske &amp; Perrin, 2021). 
 8.02 billion mobile connections (yes, many of us have more than one mobile device)&nbsp;(Kemp et al., 2021), which is predicted to grow to 8.8 billion by 2025&nbsp;(The&nbsp;Mobile Economy&nbsp;2021, 2021), and if you take connected devices (devices without a direct mobile network connection) into account the theoretical connections map goes even higher, 24 billion by 2025&nbsp;(The&nbsp;Mobile Economy&nbsp;2021, 2021). 
 Time spent online and in mobile apps is going through the roof; the average person worldwide spends 6h 54m a day on the Internet, 4h 10m a day in mobile apps&nbsp;(Kemp et al., 2021). 
 As of Oct.&nbsp;2020, mobile device market share (aka web traffic) exceeds desktop computers, today mobile accounts for 55.7% of web traffic compared to 41.5% for desktops and 2.73% for tablets&nbsp;(“Desktop Vs&nbsp;Mobile&nbsp;Vs&nbsp;Tablet Market Share Worldwide,”&nbsp;2021). 
 Mobile accounts for 31% of retail e-commerce sales in the U.S.&nbsp;(Coppola, 2021) 
 
<p>We could list stat after stat, but the story will be the same. Mobile, connectivity, is here, and it is not going anywhere.</p>
 Three Favorite Resources 
<p>I was asked were by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stukent.com/">Stukent</a>,“What are your three top favorite mobile marketing resources?”&nbsp;Sidebar: I’m a co-author of Mobile Marketing Essentials&nbsp;(Hanley et al., 2021).</p>
<p>This is a difficult question to answer, not because I don’t have favorite resources, but because of all of the follow-up questions that come to mind. Resources for what? Understanding the people and their sentiments, needs, wants, and desires? Understanding the connected individual’s behavior? Understanding a specific market sector? Understanding the latest and greatest technologies, where they’ve been, where they are, and where they’re going? Understanding and influencing change on organizational leadership, structure and management? Steps for building out and executing on a multi-channel comms matrix? Methods for measurement and tracking? Estimates for building out a mobile presence—web, apps, messaging? Different engagement tactics at each step along the customer journey? Strategies for mobile enhancing physical media? Understanding the regulatory front and what’s going to happen to all the data to which we’ve become so addicted to, Remember, people are connected, they are concerned, and they want control of their data. Pretty soon, you’ll be accessing data on the connected individual’s terms, not yours. By 2023, per a Gartner prediction, 65% of the world’s population will be protected by modern privacy legislation, that’s up from 10% in 2020&nbsp;(“Gartner&nbsp;Says By&nbsp;2023, 65% of the&nbsp;World’s&nbsp;Population Will Have Its Personal Data Covered Under Modern Privacy Regulations,”&nbsp;2020).</p>
<p>To be an exceptional mobile marketer is to be a polymath. You must be able to look at and evaluate the market and serve your customers through these five lenses—technology, economics, law and regulation, culture, and politics—if you are going to effectively serve people, at scale, and on their terms.</p>
<p>As for what my favorite resources are, rather than pointing specifically to three specific resources, I’d prefer to suggest three resource categories:</p>
 
 The people you serve, the people you serve, are your greatest and most important resource. You must do everything in your power to understand them and fulfill their needs. Keep in mind, as the tools of surveillance capitalism are pulled apart&nbsp;(Zuboff, 2019), it will be even more important for you to find ways to build direct, trusted, bi-directional channels of communications. Your customer database will become your most valued asset. 
 Government and non-governmental organizations, governments, non-governmental organizations, agencies, media properties, and schools (trade groups, sector analysts, consumer advocates, think-tanks/fact tanks, like the PEW Research Center&nbsp;(“Pew&nbsp;Research Center,”&nbsp;2021)&nbsp;or Chiefmartc&nbsp;(“Chief&nbsp;Marketing Technologist&nbsp;–&nbsp;Marketing Technology Management,”&nbsp;2021), and working professors and libraries, etc.) are an invaluable treasure-trove of specific and directional consumer and market insight that you can tap into, often for free. 
 MarTech vendors, vendors provide insights on how to engage the connected (mobile) individual by providing blogs, research, and reports. Yes, they’re there to sell you their services, so you need to be careful and try to read through the hyperbole at times, but if you want to learn about a mobile channel, engage the vendor. Get your hands dirty, subscribe to a free trial of their service. Read their reports. Attend their webinars. Build a relationship with them.

     <p><a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/archive">Click here to access all the articles and archive</a> for &lt;/Hello CDO&gt;</p><p>Day zero, you have arrived and you have 100 days to plan. (H0) How do you determine if your new company is addressing the underlying issues that hold back data from being what they imagine it can be?&nbsp;</p><p>The issues that hold back an organisation from really capturing the value of data are at a&nbsp; minimum: org structures, people issues, a lack of accountability, and incentives. Whilst having a CDO, doing data science, having analytics, using artificial intelligence, testing data quality, and a world class data governance structure make a difference; true transformation will remain a struggle if the structural issues remain.</p><p>The question is how do we, as a CDO, test the fitness of our organisation's preparedness for data.&nbsp; If the results are acceptable to the leadership team is one of politics and is way beyond&nbsp; the scope of this article.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To test the fitness of your organisation's preparedness for data, it is worth looking at four areas. Is there a preparedness plan? How they put data to work today. Organizational Capability, and finally Culture.</p><p>Is there a preparedness plan?</p><p>This is really simple, ask the CEO if there is a preparedness plan. If there is, ask for a copy of it and review it with the framing of data. If there is not one, probably best to ask why not.&nbsp; There may be one, but check the data of publication (issue), and if it does not address all the areas of responsibility that come under the CDO,&nbsp; you need to flag that it needs work.</p><p>How they put data to work today.</p><p>Does the company equally value “<a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2021/04/what-superpowers-does-cdo-need.html">small data</a>” as well as big data and data science? Does it hold small data with the same level of importance and priority as big data. Small data is also termed <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/what-superpowers-does-a-cdo-need-7f7361a1f20">thick data</a>.&nbsp; It is small in size but has depth of insights.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The media attention on data science makes it appear far easier than it is. You need to determine if this organisation is based on data science from social media posts or on data science from the commitment of time and resources.&nbsp; It is worth investigating if there is built-in structural animosity between the data science teams which are invested in driving change, and the rest of the business , which is driven by KPI and incentives.&nbsp; Where do the teams sit and how are they bridged?</p><p>Lastly review past management and board papers and recommendations to determine if there is <a href="https://opengovernance.net/updating-board-paper-for-a-data-attestation-section-db59d736ccc5">attestation of data</a> or if the blind are leading the blind.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Organizational Capability</p><p>A company’s organisation is supposed, amongst other things, to make it possible for people to do their work, with control in place to ensure they are doing the right work. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/organizational-capabilities-dr-hisham-salah/">Organisational capability</a> can be a major hurdle when it comes to making data work, as divisions are often organised to optimise for different objectives.&nbsp;</p><p>There are numerous issues including management’s confusion and conflation of data, technology, data silos, and the lack of clear responsibility around data roles. When there is a lack of skilled data architects, data engineers, and data quality professionals the organisation just does not have the capability or structure.&nbsp;</p><p>All regular readers of this column know that I often verbally fight against leaders who opine that <a href="https://opengovernance.net/data-is-data-90ba0b803178">data is the new oil</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/why-framing-data-as-an-asset-or-liability-is-dangerous-fbce0342e66d">preach that data is an asset</a>, and demand <a href="https://www.digital20.com/masterclass">data-driven decisions</a> - as they don’t have a clue. The reality for most employees is that “data” to them is just another thing they need in order to do their jobs. Companies don’t sort out ways to create value from data as they don’t teach people how to use it to make better decisions. (<a href="https://www.digital20.com/masterclass">my masterclass does)&nbsp;</a></p><p>Organisation changes needed to address the structural issues are the responsibility of a company’s senior leadership. Yet most leaders appear to be sitting on the sidelines, perhaps fearful themselves or unsure of what to do and waiting for McKinsey, Deloitte, Accenture, PWC, BCG or one of the other global consulting firms to give them an answer.&nbsp; This is want you are seeking to determine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Culture</p><p>The implications for all those interested in advancing data for better decisions are profound. Culture is often cited as the biggest barrier to progress with data, I will argue and my analysis confirms it, that it is in fact <a href="https://opengovernance.net/data-for-better-decisions-nature-or-nurture-79e6531dbe3a">ontology</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/cdo-day-0-the-many-faces-of-evidence-56ca92430e36">epistemology</a> that holds companies back.&nbsp; The questions to ask the organisation is, “Is there a top level ontology?” and “How do we know what we know is true”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>Note to the CEO</p><p>“Testing the fitness of your organisation's preparedness for data”is one of the most important jobs you will delegate.&nbsp; When interviewing for your next CDO, ask them the question “how would they test this organisation for preparedness?” &nbsp; There is no point in asking about their data expertise and capability, they would not be sat in front of you if they were not top of their game. &nbsp; How will they address the politics and policies based on their review.&nbsp; The point here is that if you like their smooth approach, they are likely the wrong person as you will just get more compromises and not the action focussed delivery required to become that data company you desire.&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>Whilst our ongoing agile iteration into <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-occurs-when-physical-beings-transition-to-information-beings-146ea9dcbca3">information beings</a> is never-ending, there are the first 100 days in the new role. But what to focus on? Well, that rose-tinted period of conflicting priorities is what <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/">&lt;/Hello, CDO!&gt;</a> is all about. Maintaining sanity when all else has been lost to untested data assumptions is a different problem entirely.</p> <br>

<p>The Web is a haystack.</p>
<p>This isn’t what <a href="https://customercommons.org/a-new-way/">Tim Berners-Lee</a> had in mind when he invented the Web. Nor is it what Jerry Yang and David Filo had in mind when they invented&nbsp;<a href="https://money.cnn.com/gallery/technology/2015/03/03/yahoo-20-years-hits-flops/10.html">Jerry and David’s Guide to the World Wide Web</a>, which later became&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!">Yahoo</a>. Jerry and David’s model for the Web was a library, and Yahoo was to be the first catalog for it. This made sense, given the prevailing conceptual frames for the Web at the time:&nbsp;real estate and publishing.</p>
<p>Both of those are still with us today. We frame the Web as real estate when we speak of “sites” with “locations” in “domains” with “addresses” you can “visit” and “browse”—then shift to publishing when we speak of “files” and “pages,” that we “author,” “edit,” “post,” “publish,” “syndicate” and store in “folders” within a “directory.” Both frames suggest durability, if not permanence. Again, kind of like a library.</p>
<p>But once we added personal movement (“surf,” “browse”) and a vehicle for it (the browser), the Web became a World Wide Free-for-all. Literally. Anyone could publish, change and remove whatever they pleased, whenever they pleased. The same went for organizations of every kind, all over the world. And everyone with a browser could find their way to and through all of those spaces and places, and enjoy whatever “content” publishers chose to put there. Thus the Web grew into billions of sites, pages, images, databases, videos, and other stuff, with most of it changing constantly.</p>
<p>The result was a heaving heap of fuck-all.*</p>
<p>How big is it? According to <a href="https://www.worldwidewebsize.com/">WorldWebSize.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://google.com">Google</a>&nbsp;currently indexes about 41 billion pages, and&nbsp;<a href="https://bing.com">Bing</a>&nbsp;about 9 billion. They also peaked together at about 68 billion pages in late 2019. The Web is surely larger than that, but that’s the practical limit because search engines are the practical way to find pieces of straw in that thing. Will the haystack be less of one when approached by other search engines, such as the new <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/opinion/sway-kara-swisher-sridhar-ramaswamy.html?showTranscript=1">ad-less</a> (subscription-funded)&nbsp;<a href="https://neeva.com/">Neeva</a>? Nope. Search engines do not give the Web a card catalog. They certify its nature as a haystack.</p>
<p>So that’s one practical limit. There are others, but they’re hard to see when the level of optionality on the Web is almost indescribably vast. But we can see a few limits by asking some questions:</p>
 
 Why do you always have to accept websites’ terms? And why do you have no record of your own of what you accepted, or when‚ or anything? 
 Why do you have no way to proffer your own terms, to which websites can agree? 
 Why did <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">Do Not Track</a>, which was never more than a polite request not to be tracked off a website, get no respect from 99.x% of the world’s websites? And how the hell did Do Not Track turn into the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2011/tracking-protection/drafts/tracking-dnt.html">Tracking Preference Expression</a> at the W2C, where the standard never did get fully baked? 
 Why, after Do Not Track failed, did hundreds of millions—or <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2019/03/23/2billion/">perhaps billions</a>—of people start blocking ads, tracking or both, on the Web, amounting to <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2015/09/28/beyond-ad-blocking-the-biggest-boycott-in-human-history/">the biggest boycott in world history</a>? And then why did the advertising world, including nearly all advertisers, their agents, and their dependents in publishing, treat this as a problem rather than a clear and gigantic message from the marketplace? 
 Why are the choices presented to you by websites called&nbsp;your choices, when all those choices are provided by&nbsp;them? And why don’t you give them choices? 
 Why would <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2021/05/29/apple-vs-or-plus-adtech/">Apple’s way of making you private on your phone</a> be to “Ask App Not to Track,” rather than “Tell App Not to Track,” or “Prevent App From Tracking You”? 
 Why does the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a> call people “data subjects” rather than people, or human beings, and then assign the roles “data controller” and “data processor” only to other parties?* 
 Why are nearly all the 200+million results in <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gdpr+compliance">a search for GDPR+compliance</a> about how companies can obey the letter of the law while violating its spirit by continuing to track people through the giant loophole you see in every cookie notice? 
 Why does the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act">CCPA</a> give you the right to ask to have back personal data others have gathered about you on the Web, rather than forbid its collection in the first place? (Imagine a law that assumes that all farmers’ horses are gone from their barns, but gives those farmers a right to demand horses back from those who took them. It’s kinda like that.) 
 Why, 22 years after <a href="http://cluetrain.com">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a> said, we are not seats or eyeballs or end users or consumers. we are human beings and our reach exceeds your grasp. deal with it. —is that statement still not true? 
 Why, 9 years after Harvard Business Review Press published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527">The Intention Economy: When Customers Take Charge</a>, has that not happened? (Really, what are you in charge of in the marketplace that isn’t inside companies’ silos and platforms?) 
 
<p>It’s easy to blame&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">the cookie</a>, which&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Montulli">Lou Montulli</a> invented in 1994 as a way for sites to remember their visitors by planting reminder files—cookies—in visitors’ browsers. Cookies also gave visitors a way to remember where they were when they last visited. For sites that require logins, cookies take care of that as well.</p>
<p>What matters, however, is not the cookie. It’s what makes the cookie necessary in the first place: the Web’s architecture. It’s called&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model">client-server</a>, and is represented graphically like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model"></a></p>
<p>This architecture was born in the era of centralized mainframes, which “users” accessed through client devices called “dumb terminals”:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-dcom/9781449307011/ch01s01.html"></a></p>
<p>On the Web, as it was in the old mainframe world, we clients—mere users—are as subordinate to servers as are calves to cows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>(In fact I’ve been told that client-server was originally a euphemism for “slave-master.” Whether true or not, it makes sense.)</p>
<p>In the client-server paradigm, our agency—our ability to act with effect in the world—is restricted to what servers allow or provide for us. Our choices are what they provide. We are independent only to the degree that we can also be clients to other servers. In this paradigm, a free market is “your choice of captor.”</p>
<p>Want privacy? You have to ask for it. And, if you go to the trouble of doing that—which you have to do separately with every site and service you encounter (each a mainframe of its own)—your client doesn’t keep a record of what you “agreed” to. The server does. Good luck finding whatever it is the server or its third parties remember about that agreement.</p>
<p>Want to control how your data (or data about you) gets processed by the servers of the world? Good luck with that too. Again, Europe’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a> says “natural persons” are just “data subjects,” while “data controllers” and “data processors” are roles reserved for servers.</p>
<p>Want a shopping cart of your own to take from site to site? My wife asked for that in 1995. It’s still barely thinkable in 2021. Want a dashboard for your life where you can gather all your expenses, investments, property records, health information, calendars, contacts, and other personal information? She asked for that too, and we still don’t have it, except to the degree that large server operators (e.g. Google, Apple, Microsoft) give us pieces of it, hosted in their clouds, and rigged to keep you captive to their systems.</p>
<p>That’s why we don’t yet have an Internet of Things (IoT), but rather an Apple of Things, a Google of Things, and an Amazon of Things.</p>
<p>Is it possible to do stuff on the Web that isn’t client-server? Perhaps some techies among us can provide examples, but practically speaking, here’s what matters:&nbsp;If it’s not thinkable by the owners of the servers we depend on, it doesn’t get made.</p>
<p>From our position at the bottom of the Web’s haystack, it’s hard to imagine there might be a world where it’s possible for us to have full agency: to not be just users of clients enslaved to as many servers as we deal with every day.</p>
<p>But that world exists. It’s called the Internet, and it can support a helluva lot more than the Web, with many ways to interact other than those possible in the client-server world alone.</p>
<p>Digital technology as we know it has only been around for a few decades, and the Internet for maybe half that time. Mobile computers that run apps and presume connectivity everywhere have only been with us for a decade or less. And all of those will be with us for many decades, centuries, or millennia to come. We are not going to stop living digital lives, any more than we are going to stop speaking, writing, or using mathematics. Digital technology and the Internet are granted wishes that won’t go back into the genie’s bottle.</p>
<p>So yes, the Web is wonderful, but not boundlessly so. It has limits. Thanks to the client-server architecture that prevails there, full personal agency is not a grace of life on the Web. For the thirty-plus years of the Web’s existence, and for its foreseeable future, we will&nbsp;never have more agency than its servers allow clients and users.</p>
<p>It’s time to think and build outside the haystack. Models for that do exist, and some have been around a long time.</p>
<p>Email, for example. While you can look at your email on the Web, or use a Web-based email service (such as Gmail), email itself is independent of those. My own&nbsp;<a href="http://searls.com" title="http://searls. ">searls.com</a> email has been at servers in my home, on racks elsewhere, and in a hired cloud. I can move it anywhere I want. You can move yours as well. All the services I hire to host my email are substitutable. That’s just one way we can enjoy full agency on the Internet.</p>
<p>My own work outside the Web is currently happening at <a href="http://customercommons.org">Customer Commons</a>, on what we call the <a href="https://customercommons.org/a-new-way/">Byway</a>. Go there and follow along as we work to toward better answers to the questions above than you’ll get from inside the haystack.</p>
<p>[Later…] More on the Web as a haystack is in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684730/students-file-folder-directory-structure-education-gen-z">FILE NOT FOUND: A generation that grew up with Google is forcing professors to rethink their lesson plans</a>, by Monica Chin (<a href="https://twitter.com/@mcsquared96">@mcsquared96</a>) in The Verge, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/students-dont-know-what-files-and-folders-are-professors-say/">Students don’t know what files and folders are, professors say</a>, by Jody MacGregor in PC Gamer, which sources Monica’s report.</p>
 
<p>*I originally had “heaving haystack of fuck-all” here, but some remember it as the more alliterative “heaving heap of fuck-all.” So I decided to swap them. If comments actually worked here, I’d ask for a vote. But feel free to write me instead, at first name at last name dot com.</p>

<p>One of the compelling aspects of <a href="https://modern-sql.com/">modern SQL</a> is the JSON support built into modern engines, including Postgres. The <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/functions-json.html">documentation</a> is well done, but I need examples to motivate my understanding of where and how and why to use such a capability. The one I’ll use in this episode is something I call document hotspots.</p>
<p>Suppose a teacher has asked her students to annotate Arthur Miller’s The Crucible. How can she find the most heavily-annotated passages? They’re visible in the Hypothesis client, of course, but may be sparsely distributed. She can scroll through the 154-page PDF document to find the hotspots, but it will be helpful to see a report that brings them together. Let’s do that.</p>
<p>The Hypothesis system stores annotations using a blend of SQL and JSON datatypes. Consider this sample annotation:</p>
<p></p>
<p>When the Hypothesis client creates that annotation it sends a JSON payload to the server. Likewise, when the client subsequently requests the annotation in order to anchor it to the document, it receives a similar JSON payload.</p>

<p>The server mostly shreds this JSON into conventional SQL types. The tags array, for example, is hoisted out of the JSON into a SQL array-of-text. The expression to find its length is a conventional Postgres idiom: array_length(tags,1). Note the second parameter; array_length(tags) is an error, because Postgres arrays can be multidimensional. In this case there’s only one dimension but it’s still necessary to specify that.</p>
<p>A target_selectors column, though, is retained as JSON. These selectors define how an annotation anchors to a target selection in a document. Because selectors are used only by the Hypothesis client, which creates and consumes them in JSON format, there’s no reason to shred them into separate columns. In normal operation, selectors don’t need to be related to core tables. They can live in the database as opaque blobs of JSON.</p>
<p>For some analytic queries, though, it is necessary to peer into those blobs and relate their contents to core tables. There’s a parallel set of functions for working with JSON. For example, the target_selectors column corresponds to the target[0]['selector'] array in the JSON representation. The expression to find the length of that array is jsonb_array_length(target_selectors).</p>
<p>Here’s a similar expression that won’t work: json_array_length(target_selectors). Postgres complains that the function doesn’t exist.</p>
 ERROR: function json_array_length(jsonb) does not exist 
Hint: No function matches the given name and argument types.
 
<p>In fact both functions, json_array_length and jsonb_array_length, exist. But Postgres knows the target_selectors column is of type jsonb, not json which is the correct type for the json_array_length function. What’s the difference between json and jsonb?</p>
<blockquote><p>The json and jsonb data types accept almost identical sets of values as input. The major practical difference is one of efficiency. The json data type stores an exact copy of the input text, which processing functions must reparse on each execution; while jsonb data is stored in a decomposed binary format that makes it slightly slower to input due to added conversion overhead, but significantly faster to process, since no reparsing is needed. jsonb also supports indexing, which can be a significant advantage.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/datatype-json.html">https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/datatype-json.html</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Although I tend to use JSON to refer to data in a variety of contexts, the flavor of JSON in the Postgres queries, views, and functions I’ll discuss will always be jsonb. The input conversion overhead isn’t a problem for analytics work that happens in a data warehouse, and the indexing support is a tremendous enabler.</p>
<p>To illustrate some of the operators common to json and jsonb, here is a query that captures the target_selectors column from the sample annotation.</p>
 with example as (
  select 
    id,
    target_selectors as selectors
  from annotation
  where id = '54b52170-fd7e-11eb-879f-931b9c6809d3'
  )
  select * from example;
 
<p></p>
<p>Here are some other queries against example</p>
 select selectors from example;

[{"end": 44483, "type": "TextPositionSelector", "start": 44392}, { ... } ]
 
<p>The result is a human-readable representation, but the type of selectors is jsonb.</p>
 select pg_typeof(selectors) from example;

jsonb
 
<p>The array-indexing operator, -&gt;, can yield the zeroth element of the array.</p>
 select selectors-&gt;0 from example;

{"end": 44483, "type": "TextPositionSelector", "start": 44392}
 
<p>The result is again a human-readable representation of a jsonb type.</p>
 select pg_typeof(selectors-&gt;0) from example;

jsonb
 
<p>Another array-indexing operator, -&gt;&gt;, can also yield the zeroth element of the array, but now as type text.</p>
 select selectors-&gt;&gt;0 from example;

{"end": 44483, "type": "TextPositionSelector", "start": 44392}
 
<p>The result looks the same, but the type is different.</p>
 select pg_typeof(selectors-&gt;&gt;0) from example;

text
 
<p>The -&gt; and -&gt;&gt; operators can also index objects by their keys. These examples work with the object that is the zeroth element of the array.</p>
 select selectors-&gt;0-&gt;'type' from example;

"TextPositionSelector"

select pg_typeof(selectors-&gt;0-&gt;'type') from example;

jsonb

select selectors-&gt;0-&gt;&gt;'type' from example;

TextPositionSelector

select pg_typeof(selectors-&gt;0-&gt;&gt;'type') from example;

text
 
<p>The Hypothesis system stores the location of a target (i.e, the selection in a document to which an annotation refers) in the target_selectors column we’ve been exploring. It records <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#selectors">selectors</a>. TextQuoteSelector represents the selection as the exact highlighted text bracketed by snippets of context. TextPositionSelector represents it as a pair of numbers that mark the beginning and end of the selection. When one range formed by that numeric pair is equal to another, it means two students have annotated the same selection. When a range contains another range, it means one student annotated the containing range, and another student made an overlapping annotation on the contained range. We can use these facts to surface hotspots where annotations overlap exactly or in nested fashion.</p>
<p>To start, let’s have a function to extract the start/end range from an annotation. In a conventional programming language you might iterate through the selectors in the target_selectors array looking for the one with the type TextPositionSelector. That’s possible in pl/pgsql and pl/python, but Postgres affords a more SQL-oriented approach. Given a JSON array, the function jsonb_array_elements returns a table-like object with rows corresponding to array elements.</p>
 select jsonb_array_elements(selectors) from example;

{"end": 44483, "type": "TextPositionSelector", "start": 44392}
{"type": "TextQuoteSelector", "exact": " am not some preaching farmer with a book under my arm; I am a graduate of Harvard College.", "prefix": " sixty-six pound, Mr. Proctor! I", "suffix": " Giles: Aye, and well instructed"}
 
<p>A function can convert the array to rows, select the row of interest, select the start and end values from the row, package the pair of numbers as an array, and return the array.</p>
 create function position_from_anno(_id uuid) returns numeric[] as $$
  declare range numeric[];
  begin
    with selectors as (
      select jsonb_array_elements(target_selectors) as selector
      from annotation
      where id = _id
    ),
    position as (
      select
        selector-&gt;&gt;'start'::numeric as startpos,
        selector-&gt;&gt;'end'::numeric as endpos
      from selectors
      where selector-&gt;&gt;'type' = 'TextPositionSelector'
    )
    select array[p.startpos, p.endpos] 
    from position p
    into range;
    return range;
  end;  
$$ language plpgsql;
 
<p>Using it for the sample annotation:</p>
 select position_from_anno('54b52170-fd7e-11eb-879f-931b9c6809d3')

position_from_anno
------------------
{44392,44483}
 
<p>I’ll show how to use position_from_anno to find document hotspots in a later episode. The goal here is just to introduce an example, and to illustrate a few of the JSON functions and operators.</p>
<p>What’s most interesting, I think, is this part.</p>
<p>where selector-&gt;&gt;'type' = 'TextPositionSelector'</p>
<p>Although the TextPositionSelector appears as the first element of the selectors array, that isn’t guaranteed. In a conventional language you’d have to walk through the array looking for it. SQL affords a declarative way to find an element in a JSON array.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2012/02/what-is-sovereign-source-authority.html">Self-Sovereign Rights</a>, And The Function of USER:ID In Rights &amp; Derivative Laws For Mankind.</p><p>People never required a definition of the word "People" until recently. A Governed Civil Society constituted "of, by, for" people, seems obvious in its implications for design, interpretation, and amendment procedures. But apparently, this is not the case. The data structure of participation in a "Governed Civil Society" is very dependent on some baseline, foundational accuracies about the source origin of "Sovereign Rights".</p><p>This is not optional anymore. People, being organized as "People" and written into databases, contracts, and Governed State Trusts, represented as both paper &amp; digital artifacts, have become abstractions representing the original source authority required for the accurate processing of Sovereign authority. As these abstractions, written into documents via non-computational languages with historic precedent, become the priority mission for resolving "Civil Rights" in any Governed system designed "of, by, for" people, or "people", it is critical that the structure intended and inferred by language, become operational in the data structure that yields precedent in the real world where all Sovereign Rights matter. Rights are for people after all, not birth certificates.</p><p>Blood, mud, local community.. this is the home of Sovereign Rights. There is no alternative. It may seem as though digital technology is creating a new "metaverse" where new laws of nature are possible. Everything, as it will become obvious to understand in time, is made of data, and even emits data endlessly unto non-existence. People, you are the context. You are the reason data is being discovered, valued, harvested, manipulated, controlled, inspected, regulated, judicially reviewed, and entrepreneured in all the myriad ways possible to do, commercial, civic, social, health, education... the list is endless in time.</p><p>One thing never changes. One thing stays consistent. One thing matters for the sake of Humanity.</p><p>People own root authority, locally. Systems derived "of, by, for" people have a design constraint, and requirement for operational integrity. Words come and go, literature makes perfect what life makes real. You, an Individual person, are the only "people" that will ever actually exist. "We The People" may be a literary abstraction of reality, and it may be translated by a legal abstraction in time, but at the design and intent root level of it's meaning, "We The People" refers only to local people, in the real world, Individuals all.</p><p>That is the structural requirement. Our masses, our ability to coordinate as "We", or be perceived as "They", to form teams, to collaborate and build more perfect unions.. all of us, as Individuals, living among one another.. this is the only accurate structure of Sovereign Rights that are accurate to the design intent within a civil society derived "of, by, for" people, Individuals all.</p><p>Equality is a starting point of civil society. An accurate data structure yields accurate results in the hands of people. Individuals choose their path to happiness. Individuals choose to express their liberty. Individuals live life. Individuals are the only people alive on this planet, and at the data structure start of a Governed Civil System, all people are equal. Thats accurate law, thats accurate data structure.</p><p>Systems do not possess people. Systems are derived of, by for people. This is accurate fact. All formats of artificial intelligence known to mankind are derived from people, for people. Any data structure routine that runs counter to this accurate fact violates basic structural rights that people possess, as Individuals. Governments exist to enforce those Rights of, by for people, Individuals all.</p><p>In the year 2020++, there is great structural confusion about these words. One day, people will read these words and see them clearly. Clearly, they carry meaning. Clearly, they carry intent. All Human Rights are self-Sovereign in origin of authority, and this ultimate human authority is always locally expressed by Individuals. All limited liability structures derived by the consent of the people Governing Civil Society, and operationally participating in the accurate design of "Civil Society', are responsible for the return of value to the people, of, by, for and from which they emit. Any legal abstraction that removes the Sovereign Rights of people from "people" commits a crime of fraud on the people who civil society is "of, by, for", and their treatment under the derived Law of their Sovereign consent must transact "accurate authority" for people.</p><p>Currently, upon entering a unique relationship with Governed civil society via a USER:ID, discoverable within any IAM ID Management system in the world, and in use by Government processes to transact the Rights and permissions of citizens in their local purview, the data structure of your participation becomes "legal" and inaccurate. Governments, deriving their consent from the Governed, may design any data structure they wish in time. All Governments are to be held accountable for the accurate abstraction of human Rights and laws derived of, by for the people who produce it's authority of consent. People, Individuals All, is the only living reality.</p><p>Self-Sovereign Rights represent this accurate data structure of Governed Civil Society, whereby USER:ID is utilized to confer Rights Administration capabilities upon a populace of contextual people operating with local authority as Individual citizens, and non-citizen people with innate self-Sovereign Human Rights. A Nation such as America could not come into existence by any other data structure, and history itself serves as the ultimate precedent for establishing an operational context used in the very interpretation of Constitutional literature.</p><p>Working Groups, operating within non-governmental organizations or non-profit public benefit charities, exist as a layered dependency of such Governed systems. Their work is derived by the consent of the people, Individuals all, and as such, the accurate translation of their efforts is directly accountable to the accurate data structure outcomes of their local jurisdictional translations. America is not Europe, California is not New York. People, Individuals All, Always Local, Always Root Authority.</p><p>Data structure in a computational society Governed accurately "of, by, for" people requires local consent in all transactions and derived uses. The concept of an "open society" and a "secured society" can only co-exist if people are accurately represented. Otherwise, exploitation is the default condition of participation. Evidence can be found in the identity theft data, where babies with a social security number occupy a precarious artifact condition in a society construed as "Governed" and "Civil" as the #1 risk vector and systemic victim. The produced results of the current data structure of people in THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA is a travesty currently, and does not reflect the accurate data structure of the American people. An <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2021/07/recursive-signatory.html">error of omission</a> sits at the base of the stack affecting how Rights and Laws are translated, and conditioned as necessary.</p><p>People, Individuals All, operationally accurate as a data structure derived of, by for self-Sovereign human authority, expressed locally by people. This is the goal of work groups; consent receipts are an example of such work. Their accurate translation of contextual jurisdictional meaning will only be possible with a starting foundation of accurate self-Sovereign Rights, expressed by people locally. Systems must conform to reality.&nbsp;</p><p>People pursue lives of happiness, liberty, life... for people, in the real world, not as "people" abstractions required to conform to system designs that are computationally inaccurate. Data structures yield operational results. People own root authority in civil systems. It is not optional. Inaccuracy is unconstitutional, literally and operationally.</p><p>The Supreme Court is required to translate the meaning of the Law of THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, but has no self-comprehension of the inaccuracies present within the data structure of its jurisdictional authority. Systems don't think, systems don't innovate, systems don't iterate, amend, or get human intent correct in their design. People do, Individuals do, teams of Individuals do. Local people are the Self-Sovereign Rights holders and creators of Governed Civil Society, and in the absence of their accurate participation using an accurate data structure for expressing their human and civil Rights under Laws derived "of, by, for" their consent... well, welcome to 2020++ .. enjoy the loop.</p><p>An accurate operational data structure is a pre-requirement for the accurate translation of Sovereign Rights, Laws, and permissions administered in a civil system. All corporations and corporate systems are derived via the Governed process of Rights, Laws and permissions within a designed civil system, and the accurate translations of Laws affects the limitation of liability and expression of benefits for people within any and all local jurisdictions.</p><p>In short, until the data structure of the world is accurately represented in the Governed Civil Systems where USER:ID confers operational meaning to people, any civil system claiming to be derived "of, by, for" people is currently non-compliant, and unconstitutional in operational design. Self-Sovereign Rights are the origin of Governed Civil Systems derived "of, by, for" people, Individuals all.&nbsp;</p><p>Data structure yields operational results.. people own root.</p><p>I repeat, People, Individuals All, own root authority in any/all "Civil Systems" of Rights/Law administration.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/24/pl-pgsql-versus-pl-python-heres-why-im-using-both-to-write-postgres-functions/">episode 2</a> I mentioned three aspects of pl/python that are reasons to use it instead of pl/pgsql: access to Python modules, metaprogramming, and introspection.</p>
<p>Although this episode focuses on metaprogramming — by which I mean using Python to dynamically compose and run SQL queries — my favorite example combines all three aspects.</p>
<p>The context for the example is an analytics dashboard with a dozen panels, each driven by a pl/plython function that’s parameterized by the id of a school or a course. So, for example, the Questions and Answers panel on the course dashboard is driven by a function, questions_and_answers_for_group(group_id), which wraps a SQL query that:</p>
<p>– calls another pl/python function, questions_for_group(group_id), to find notes in the group that contain question marks</p>
<p>– finds the replies to those notes</p>
<p>– builds a table that summarizes the question/answer pairs</p>
<p>Here’s the SQL wrapped by the questions_and_answers_for_group(group_id) function.</p>
 sql = f"""
  with questions as ( 
    select *
    from questions_for_group('{_group_id}')
    ),
  ids_and_refs as (
    select 
      id,
      unnest ("references") as ref
      from annotation
      where groupid = '{_group_id}'
  ),
  combined as (
    select
      q.*,
      array_agg(ir.id) as reply_ids
    from ids_and_refs ir
    inner join questions q on q.id = ir.ref
    group by q.id, q.url, q.title, q.questioner, q.question, q.quote
  ),
  unnested as (
    select
      c.url,
      c.title,
      c.quote,
      c.questioner,
      c.question,
      unnest(reply_ids) as reply_id
    from combined c
  )
  select distinct
    course_for_group('{_group_id}') as course,
    teacher_for_group('{_group_id}') as teacher,
    clean_url(u.url) as url,
    u.title,
    u.quote,
    u.questioner,
    (regexp_matches(u.question, '.+\?'))[1] as question,
    display_name_from_anno(u.reply_id) as answerer,
    text_from_anno(u.reply_id) as answer,
    app_host() || '/course/render_questions_and_answers/{_group_id}' as viewer
  from unnested u
  order by course, teacher, url, title, questioner, question
 
<p>This isn’t yet what I mean by pl/python metaprogramming. You could as easily wrap this SQL code in a pl/pgsql function. More easily, in fact, because in pl/pgsql you could just write _group_id instead of '{_group_id}'.</p>
<p>To get where we’re going, let’s zoom out and look at the whole questions_and_and_answer_for_group(group_id) function.</p>
 questions_and_answers_for_group(_group_id text)
  returns setof question_and_answer_for_group as $$
  from plpython_helpers import (
    exists_group_view,
    get_caller_name,
    memoize_view_name
  )
  base_view_name = get_caller_name()
  view_name = f'{base_view_name}_{_group_id}'
  if exists_group_view(plpy, view_name):
    sql = f""" select * from {view_name} """
  else:
    sql = f"""
    &lt;SEE ABOVE&gt;
    """
    memoize_view_name(sql, view_name)
    sql = f""" select * from {view_name} """
  return plpy.execute(sql)
$$ language plpython3u;
 
<p>This still isn’t what I mean by metaprogramming. It introduces introspection — this is a pl/python function that discovers its own name and works with an eponymous materialized view — but that’s for a later episode.</p>
<p>It also introduces the use of Python modules by pl/python functions. A key thing to note here is that this is an example of what I call a memoizing function. When called it looks for a materialized view that captures the results of the SQL query shown above. If yes, it only needs to use a simple SELECT to return the cached result. If no, it calls memoize_view_name to run the underlying query and cache it in a materialized view that the next call to questions_and_answers_for_group(group_id) will use in a simple SELECT. Note that memoize_view_name is a special function that isn’t defined in Postgres using CREATE FUNCTION foo() like a normal pl/python function. Instead it’s defined using def foo() in a Python module called plpython_helpers. The functions there can do things — like create materialized views — that pl/python functions can’t. More about that in another episode.</p>
<p>The focus in this episode is metaprogramming, which is used in this example to roll up the results of multiple calls to questions_and_answers_for_group(group_id). That happens when the group_id refers to a course that has sections. If you’re teaching the course and you’ve got students in a dozen sections, you don’t want to look at a dozen dashboards; you’d much rather see everything on the primary course dashboard.</p>
<p>Here’s the function that does that consolidation.</p>
 create function consolidated_questions_and_answers_for_group(group_id text)
  returns setof question_and_answer_for_group as $$
  from plpython_helpers import (
    get_caller_name,
    sql_for_consolidated_and_memoized_function_for_group
  )
  base_view_name = get_caller_name()
  sql = sql_for_consolidated_and_memoized_function_for_group(
    plpy, base_view_name, 'questions_and_answers_for_group', _group_id)
  sql += ' order by course, url, title, questioner, answerer'
  return plpy.execute(sql)
$$ language plpython3u;
 
<p>This pl/python function not only memoizes its results as above, it also consolidates results for all sections of a course. The memoization happens here.</p>
 def sql_for_consolidated_and_memoized_function_for_group(plpy, 
    base_view_name, function, group_id):
  view_name = f'{base_view_name}_{group_id}'
  sql = f""" select exists_view('{view_name}') as exists """
  exists = row_zero_value_for_colname(plpy, sql, 'exists')
  if exists:
    sql = f""" select * from {view_name} """
  else:
    sql = consolidator_for_group_as_sql(plpy, group_id, function)
    memoize_view_name(sql, view_name)
    sql = f""" select * from {view_name} """
  return sql
 
<p>The consolidation happens here, and this is finally what I think of as classical metaprogramming: using Python to compose SQL.</p>
 def consolidator_for_group_as_sql(plpy, _group_id, _function):
  sql = f"select type_for_group('{_group_id}') as type"
  type = row_zero_value_for_colname(plpy, sql, 'type')
  if type == 'section_group' or type == 'none':
    sql = f"select * from {_function}('{_group_id}')"
  if type == 'course_group' or type == 'course':
    sql = f"select has_sections('{_group_id}')"
    has_sections = row_zero_value_for_colname(plpy, sql, 'has_sections')
    if has_sections:
      sql = f"""
        select array_agg(group_id) as group_ids 
        from sections_for_course('{_group_id}')
      """
      group_ids = row_zero_value_for_colname(plpy, sql, 'group_ids')
      selects = [f"select * from {_function}('{_group_id}') "]
      for group_id in group_ids:
        selects.append(f"select * from {_function}('{group_id}')")
      sql = ' union '.join(selects)
    else:
      sql = f"select * from {_function}('{_group_id}')"
  return sql

 
<p>If the inbound _groupid is p1mqaeep, the inbound _function is questions_and_answers_for_group, and the group has no sections, the SQL will just be select * from questions_and_answers_for_group('p1mqaeep').</p>
<p>If the group does have sections, then the SQL will instead look like this:</p>
 select * from questions_and_answers_for_group('p1mqaeep')
union 
select * from questions_and_answers_for_group('x7fe93ba')
union
select * from questions_and_answers_for_group('qz9a4b3d')
 
<p>This is a very long-winded way of saying that pl/python is an effective way to compose and run arbitarily complex SQL code. In theory you could do the same thing using pl/pgsql, in practice it would be insane to try. I’ve entangled the example with other aspects — modules, introspection — because that’s the real situation. pl/python’s maximal power emerges from the interplay of all three aspects. That said, it’s a fantastic way to extend Postgres with user-defined functions that compose and run SQL code.</p>

  <p>Individual Rights are hard to come by historically. Strong people make them possible. First requirement of their existence is thus, strong people. Weak and fearful people tend to group together for support initially, and then like crabs in a bucket, to prevent others from escaping the huddle of their security perception. For the purposes of "Individual Rights", this tribal, fearful, mob enforced compliance and perceptual safety is an enemy of fulfilling the experience of those "Individual Rights".&nbsp;</p><p>Individual liberty is the expression of "Individual Rights". A Sovereign Nation derived "of, by, for" people with "Individual Rights" defined broadly as "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness", and given contextual authority as "unalienable" and "self-evident" in nature, must inherently emit from the Individual people that such a Sovereign Nation is composed of. This is the foundational reality of America.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, mob rule is an expression of mob authority. When a "Bill Of Rights" sets out the 1st Right as the "freedom of speech", it is further evidence of the foundational intent of it's authors, all Individual people expressing "Individual Rights" in defining their own Sovereign authority. Therefore, when the Government derived "of, by, for" such people yields corporate charters, and under incorporated Sovereign State Law produces administrative methods of corporate employment, such that "freedom of speech" no longer belongs directly to people, Individuals all, but instead, administratively recasts a person as an employee with provisioned Rights of the State, something is askew. Many such "provisioned Rights" exist, but of greater consequence to the civil society resulting from the original founding intent and structural declarations with Constitutional authority, this administrative process enforces a new type of "mob rule" onto people, and their infrastructure supporting their "Rights" under Sovereign Law.</p><p>Mob rule can thus operate with 50.1% efficiency. A bicameral legislative body can be socially engineered into an expression of mob rule via a two party political system, whereby the people, Individuals all, no longer are the authorities in expressing their Sovereign Rights, except by replacement of new members who inherently are leveraged into joining existing mob rule parties. Independent people, Individual people with "Individual Rights" who serve their peers and civil Society are reduced to functionaries of the mob ruling political party system. All consensus is among the two parties, and the Institution of Governance is no longer directly representative of the best interests of the people, Individuals All. Instead, people reduce their participation to fit into the priorities of the two parties with mob rule authority in the bicameral legislative body.</p><p>Lookup "Republican" and "Democrat" in the text of the Constitution of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA and Declaration of Independence for yourself. What "Rights" are conveyed "of, by, for" these political parties as representations of the people?</p>  <br><p>Mob Rule is the "Way We Go Down". Individual Rights is our victory, and salvation.</p><p>All of human history is reducible to the fight between mob rule and the Individual expression of human Rights. Mobs hate people. Let it set in.. mobs are afraid of people, Individuals all. Movies as esoteric as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footloose_(1984_film)">Footloose</a> document repeatedly the fear the mob holds for Individuals expressing their freedoms. Mobs are the reduction of human intelligence, to the common baseline of fear, control, subservience, and domination of the human spirit within every Individual.</p><p>The fight for Individual Rights is one of control; how do Individuals control their own authority? The struggle against mob rule, against communist or socialist practices that squander human freedom in search for mob security, is one of eternal merit protecting that which makes humanity redeemable. Enslavement of humans by humans, written into the DNA of progress itself, manifesting destinies for all people, is only redeemable, forgivable, and teachable if the value it produces extends the power of Individual Rights to all people.</p><p>[Revised Appropriately]:</p><p>"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all mankind is created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are life, liberty and the personal pursuit of happiness. Governments exist to guarantee the Rights of, by, and for such people, Individuals all, and no abstraction of literary, or mathematical form, shall in any way distort the meaning of such human authority by people, Individuals all."</p><p>America has a literary problem; "We the People" is a term of abstraction. "We the People" has been abstracted by legalese into a meaning that is out-of-step with observable reality. "We the People" are not a data aggregation algorithmic result, "We the People" are not a legal entity/State or one-off representation of authority. "We the people" are Individuals all, and together as people, Individuals all living among one another, our personal authority has constructed a Government that must work by the efforts of the people it is for&nbsp;as was declared, constituted and enforced by great personal action on the part of many people, Individuals all.</p><p>Degradation of people, Individuals all, to instruments of mob rule is out-of-step with the intent for the existence of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, and the use of political parties to induce cult-like mob authority in lieu of accountability to the actual structural integrity of people must be amended. The people must be defined accurately. As it was unacceptable to declare "All men equal.." and not include women or non-white people in that definition, so too is it inappropriate to cause "We the People" to be translated in any way other than may be observed by a child in nature. People exist as Individuals only, and any Union made more perfect must reflect this fact in its operational constraints, dependencies, protocols, policies, Laws and methods of enforcing human Rights.</p><p>America's greatest power is it's conceptualization of people with Individual Rights. Our "more perfect Union" is materialized only through the expression of these Individual Rights for all of it's people, as well as the opportunity for it's expression for all the people of planet Earth. Like a siphon pulling the greatest minds towards its gravitational center, to compete on a planet where American Rights for all exist is the greatest human opportunity to build upon human empowerment the world has ever known.</p><p>The American people, Individuals all, have enemies lined up against them. This is unlikely to change so long as fearful, greedy, an life-reducing bureaucrats are in a position to exercise their contrived authority resulting from practices of mob rule. All that any person need do to observe the reality of any "leader" extending any "policy" or practice affecting the lives of people is to interrogate the operation to find out how human power is distributed. If power is taken from people and given to a central power-processing entity to re-distribute to people defined differently than all others are by default, you are looking at a function of mob rule. If a person suggests that people, Individuals all, are not accountable for their own freedom, and can shirk their personal responsibilities to care for the babies, toddlers, young people, or elderly in need of human guardianship evoked from the sustaining love that gave them life, you are listening to an agent of mob rule.</p><p>Any act that induces mob rule is in support of mob rule.</p><p>Any act that sustains Individual Liberty is in support of Individual Rights.</p><p>Can you interpret reality?</p><p>Data is the dirt of digital existence; everything is made of data. Data is the carbon of digital existence; everything that matters to Humanity is made of data. Individual Rights are made of data, and when it comes to Individual Rights, structure yields results. Human authority is sourced directly from people, Individuals all. People are the source of Sovereign authority, or mob rule is being leveraged. It is that simple.</p><p>When designing a data structure to operate the Rights mechanisms of a Governing entity within a civil society enabled "of, by, for" people, Individuals all, both in bureaucratic Terms as well as in the processing of managing a Governance body composed of an Executive, Legislate and Judicial branch, the key constraint is the source of "useful identity". The useful identity is the primary key of both freedom and security for people within their own Governance bureaucracy where data is leveraged contextually of, by, for all making such a more perfect Union possible.</p><p>America's "Founding Fathers" gave the origin of this procession physical form, both for a King, as well as for every King's Administration System, or Government, that would ever exist henceforth. John Hancock made sure to write it large so no one would miss it. These people got it right the first time around, but an error of omission has caused the same procession to fail to keep repeating.

<p>A Response to the&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060930021810/http://www.livingworlds.com/">Documentation of the Living Worlds Working Group</a><br>1997-02-27</p>



<p>[A post by Douglas Crockford, recovered from the internet archive.]</p>



 Introduction 



<p>The Livings Worlds Initiative is the work of a small but dedicated group of&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060930021810/http://vag.vrml.org/consort/">VRML</a>&nbsp;developers who have a deep interest in extending VRML into the basis for interconnected virtual worlds. This project has been inextricably bound to a very effective public relations campaign and standards setting effort. The project is still in development, but is already being promoted as an industry standard for virtual worlds.</p>



<p>The Living Worlds Working Group has been signing up a large number of companies as&nbsp;supporters&nbsp;of the effort, including IBM and Apple. What is not clear to most observers is that&nbsp;support&nbsp;means nothing more than agreeing that standards are desirable.</p>



<p>Within the industry, there is common misunderstanding of what support for Living Worlds means, even among the supporters. The result is that support for a Livings Worlds Standard is starting to snowball. It is being regarded as a proposed standard, but it has not had to face any sort of rigorous review. The purpose of this response is to begin the belated review of the Living Worlds Documentation as a proposed standard.</p>



 Premature Standardization 



<p>There is a growing list of companies that are developing VRML-based virtual worlds. The sector is attracting a lot of attention. Even so, most of the social activity on the Internet today is in IRC and the chat rooms of&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060930021810/http://www.aol.com/">AOL</a>. The most successfully socialized avatar worlds are&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060930021810/http://www.worldsaway.com/">WorldsAway</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060930021810/http://www.thepalace.com/">The Palace</a>, neither of which are VRML-based. The VRML worlds have seen a lot of churn, but are not creating significant sustaining communities.</p>



<p>The weakness of community formation in many of the VRML worlds may be the result of the newness of the worlds and the inexperience of the world designers, who have hampered themselves by putting 3D graphics ahead of socialization.</p>



<p>It is too early to be standardizing 3D social architecture. More experimentation is required. If the Living Worlds Initiative is an experiment conducted by a group of cooperating companies, then it is a good thing. If it is a standard-setting activity, then it is premature and harmful.</p>



<p>The operation of 3D worlds has not been shown to be a profitable activity. The business model is driven by affection for Neal Stephenson’s satiric cyberpunk novel,&nbsp;Snow Crash. Snow Crash&nbsp;describes a virtual world called the Metaverse. Some day, we may have a real Metaverse, and it might even be as important in our world as it was in the novel.</p>



<p>Living Worlds does not implement the Metaverse. It only makes something that looks like it, a meta-virtual world.</p>



<p>VRML itself is still new. VRML 2.0 was announced at Siggraph 96, and complete implementations are only now coming on line. The VRML 2.0 initiative was as frenzied as the Living Worlds Initiative, and because of the haste, the result was suboptimal. A consequence is that part of the Living Worlds Initiative contains some workarounds for VRML 2.0 limitations.</p>



 Security 



<p>The word “security” does not occur in the Living Worlds Documentation except to point out a security hole in VRML 2.0. The lack of attention to security by the Living Worlds Working Group is not a problem if the Initiative is viewed as an experiment. One of the benefits of the experiment will be to demonstrate why security is critical in the design of distributed systems. If the Living Worlds Initiative is setting a standard, then it is harmful.</p>



<p>Security is a very complicated and subtle subject. Absolute security is never achievable, but diligent design and application can produce systems which are worthy of trust.</p>



<p>The Living Worlds Documentation identifies three issues in which distributed security is critical.</p>



  handle everything via dynamically downloaded Java applets  protect the local scene from damage by imported objects  support authentication certificates (dice, business cards)  



<p>The Documentation does not adequately address any of those issues.</p>



<p>Lacking security at the lowest levels, Living Worlds is not strong enough to offer a credible trust model at the human-interaction level. In systems which can be hacked, concepts like identity, credentials, and accountability are meaningless.</p>



<p>This severely limits the application scope of Living Worlds. Environments which permit interpersonal commerce or confidential collaboration should not be implemented in Living Worlds.</p>



 Secure software distribution 



<p>Software is the lifeblood of virtual communities. The value and diversity of these systems depend on the ability to dynamically load and execute software from the network. Unfortunately, this raises a huge security concern. Software from the network could contain viruses, trojan horses, and other security threats. Because of the dynamic and interconnected nature of virtual communities,&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060930021810/http://www.cs.princeton.edu/sip/pub/secure96.html">the protection mechanisms provided by Java are not adequate.</a></p>



<p>The Living Worlds Documentation notes that</p>



<blockquote><p>…at present, most systems prohibit Java from accessing local files, which makes it impossible, for example, to connect to locally installed third party software features. Until this problem is generically solved by the Java community, the management of downloads and local access are left to proprietary MUtech solutions.</p></blockquote>



<p>The proprietary MUtech solutions will create a security hole, and possibly compromise the goal of interoperability at the same time. In order for the dynamic, distributed virtual community to be viable, the issue of secure software distribution must be solved from the outset.&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060930021810/http://www.packet.com/garfinkel/96/47/index2a.html">Class signing is not a solution.</a>&nbsp;A secure, distributed architecture is required. It is doubtful that credible security mechanisms can be retrofitted later.</p>



 Protect the local scene 



<p>Related to the problem of software distribution is the question of rights granted to objects. Objects that are valued in some places might be obnoxious or dangerous in others. The Living Worlds Documentation describes&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060930021810/http://www.livingworlds.com/draft_1/lw_ideas.htm#Requirements">an incontinent puppy</a>&nbsp;as an example of such an object. A secure architecture needs to deal with these sorts of issues from the outset. The Living Worlds Documentation identifies the problem, but does not solve it.</p>



 Authentication 



<p>The Living Worlds Documentation calls for the use of authentication certificates as a mechanism for assuring confidence in certain objects. Unfortunately, if the architecture is not secure, there is not a reliable context in which certificates can be trusted. Because Living Worlds is hackable, certified objects can be compromised.</p>



 Community 



<p>Communities need tools with which they can create policies to regulate the social order. Different communities will have different needs, conventions, standards. The Living Worlds Documentation says this about the task of designing those tools:</p>



<blockquote><p>Two things seem clear. First, that designing a persuasively complete infrastructure for managing user rights, roles and rules is an essentially open-ended task. Second that building a simple, open-ended framework for the same domain can probably be completed with very little effort.</p></blockquote>



<p>Unfortunately, the Working Group does not adequately understand the issues involved. They will create a tool based on a limited understanding of the problem, attempt to drive it into a standard, and leave to others the social and administrative headaches it will cause.</p>



<blockquote><p>This general strategy applies to the rest of the Living Worlds effort as well. Our goal is to reach quick consensus on a minimal subset, and then to encourage the rapid creation of several reference implementations of that proposed feature set. Refinement of the concepts can then proceed in an atmosphere usefully disciplined by implementation experience.</p></blockquote>



<p>Problems of this kind cannot be solved by refinement.</p>



 Incomplete 



<p>If the Living Worlds Documentation were just the work in progress of a working group, then it is appropriate that they publish their materials on the net for comment by interested parties, and it would be absurd to point out that the work is unfinished. But because it is also being presented publicly as a networking standard, and because the Living Worlds Working Group has already begun the work of standard setting, the Documentation needs to be tested for its fitness as a standard.</p>



<p>If the Living Worlds Documentation is read as a proposed standard, then it should be rejected out-of-hand, simply because it is incomplete. In its present form, the Living Worlds Documentation is not even complete enough to criticize.</p>



 Principles 



<p>The Living Worlds Working Group selected a set of principles to guide the development process. Membership in the working group is open to anyone who can accept the principles. This is a reasonable way for a working group to define itself. Unfortunately, the principles of the Working Group are problematic for a standards body. While the Living World Documentation is not complete enough to criticize, the principles and basic architecture can be criticized.</p>



  Build on VRML 2.0.Use VRML 2.0&nbsp;would have been a better first principle. By&nbsp;Building on VRML 2.0, the Working Group is hoping to work some or all of the Livings Worlds work into the VRML 3.0 standard, thereby increasing the importance of the Living Worlds Standard.This component-oriented principle led the Working Group to put the display processor in the center of a distributed architecture, ignoring decades of experience in the separation of I/O from other computational goals.Fortunately, the recent moderating influence of the Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratory (MERL) has opened the Living Worlds Working Group to the possibility of other presentation models. Unfortunately, the Living Worlds Architecture is already fixed on a set of unwieldy interfaces which were motivated by a VRML-centric design space.  Standards, not designs.The second principle is intended to give implementers a large amount of leeway in realizing the standard. The amount of leeway is so great that it might not be possible for independent implementations to interoperate with implementations developed by the Working Group. Since that is specifically what a standard is supposed to accomplish, the second principle is self-defeating.The other benefit of the second principle to the Working Group is to provide an expedient method of dealing with disputes. When the members of the Working Group do not agree on an architectural point, they agree to disagree and leave the choice to the implementer. Sometimes the reason they do not agree is because they were confronting an essential, hard problem.  Architectural Agnosticism.The third principle concerns the question of centralized (server-based) or decentralized (distributed) architecture. Centralized social networking systems often suffer from performance problems because the server can become a bottleneck. The Working Group therefore wants to keep the option of decentralization open: A centralized architecture cannot be transformed into a decentralized architecture simply by being vague about the role of the server. Decentralized design requires the solution of a large number of hard problems, particularly problems of security. An insecure architecture can facilitate the victimization of avatar owners by miscreants. Insecurity will also limit the architecture to supporting only limited interactions, such as chat. Higher value services like cooperative work and interpersonal commerce require a secure platform. Such a platform is not a goal or result of the Living Worlds Initiative.Because the third principle does not explicitly call for the solution to the problems of secure decentralization, it is self-defeating, resulting in an implementations which are either insecure or devoutly centralist or both.  Respect the role of the market.In the fourth principle, the Working Group chooses this unfortunate non-goal: The process does not pay adequate attention to the consequences of the design. The goal of the Working Group is to establish a standard early, relying on iteration in the maintenance of the standard to make it, if not the best imaginable, then good enough for commercial use. The process is not forward-looking enough to provide confidence that the standard can be corrected later. Significant architectural features, such as security, are extremely difficult to insert compatibly into existing systems.  Require running code.The fifth principle appears to be the most respectable, but when coupled with the urgency and recklessness of the fourth principle, it becomes the most dangerous.A standards development process that requires demonstration of new techniques before incorporating them into the standard can be a very good thing because it provides assurance that the standard is implementable. It can also provide early evidence of the utility of the new techniques.But if such a process is driven by extreme time pressure, as the Living Worlds Working Group is, then the fifth principle has a terrible result: only ideas with quick and dirty implementations can be considered. The Working Group will finish its work before hard problems can be understood and real solutions can be produced.So, by principle, the Working Group is open, but not to good ideas that will require time and effort to realize.  



 Conclusion 



<p>The software industry sometimes observes that its problems are due to not having standards, or to having too many standards. Often, its problems are due to having standards that are not good enough.</p>



<p>Premature standardization in the area of virtual worlds will not assure success.</p>



<p>The Living Worlds Initiative is a model for cooperative research, and as such it should be encouraged. The Working Group is using the net to create a virtual community of software developers working together on a common project. This is very good.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the Living Worlds Initiative is also a standards-setting initiative, building on the momentum of the recent VRML 2.0 standard. It would be harmful to adopt the Living Worlds Initiative as a standard at this time.</p>

<p>I’ve long been enamored of the <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR">sparkline</a>, a graphical device which its inventor Edward Tufte defines thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>A sparkline is a small intense, simple, word-sized graphic with typographic resolution. Sparklines mean that graphics are no longer cartoonish special occasions with captions and boxes, but rather sparkline graphics can be everywhere a word or number can be: embedded in a sentence, table, headline, map, spreadsheet, graphic.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nowadays you can create sparklines in many tools including Excel and Google Sheets, both of which can use the technique to pack a summary of a series of numbers into a single cell. By stacking such cells vertically you can create views that compress vast amounts of information.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/21/a-virtuous-cycle-for-analytics/">A virtuous cycle for analytics</a> I noted that we often use Metabase to display tables and charts based on extracts from our Postgres warehouse. I really wanted to use sparklines to summarize views of activity over time, but that isn’t yet an option in Metabase.</p>
<p>When Metabase is connected to Postgres, though, you can write Metabase questions that can not only call built-in Postgres functions but can also call user-defined functions. Can such a function accept an array of numbers and return a sparkline for display in the Metabase table viewer? Yes, if you use Unicode characters to represent the variable-height bars of a sparkline.</p>
<p>There’s a page at rosettacode.org devoted to <a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Sparkline_in_unicode">Unicode sparklines</a> based on this sequence of eight characters:</p>



U+2581
▁
LOWER ONE EIGHTH BLOCK


U+2582
▂
LOWER ONE QUARTER BLOCK


U+2583
▃
LOWER THREE EIGHTHS BLOCK


U+2584
▄
LOWER HALF BLOCK


U+2585
▅
LOWER FIVE EIGHTHS BLOCK


U+2586
▆
LOWER THREE QUARTERS BLOCK


U+2587
▇
LOWER SEVEN EIGHTHS BLOCK


U+2588
█
FULL BLOCK



<p>Notice that 2581, 2582, and 2588 are narrower than the rest. I’ll come back to that at the end.</p>
<p>If you combine them into a string of eight characters you get this result:</p>
<p>▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█</p>
<p>Notice that the fourth and eight characters in the sequence drop below the baseline. I’ll come back to that at the end too.</p>
<p>These characters can be used to define eight buckets into which numbers in a series can be quantized. Here are some examples from the rosettacode.org page:</p>
<p>“1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1” -&gt; ▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█▇▆▅▄▃▂▁<br>
“1.5, 0.5 3.5, 2.5 5.5, 4.5 7.5, 6.5” -&gt; ▂▁▄▃▆▅█▇<br>
“0, 1, 19, 20” -&gt; ▁▁██<br>
“0, 999, 4000, 4999, 7000, 7999” -&gt; ▁▁▅▅██</p>
<p>To write a Postgres function that would do this, I started with the Python example from rosettacode.org:</p>
 bar = '▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█'
barcount = len(bar)
 
def sparkline(numbers):
    mn, mx = min(numbers), max(numbers)
    extent = mx - mn
    sparkline = ''.join(bar[min([barcount - 1,
                                 int((n - mn) / extent * barcount)])]
                        for n in numbers)
    return mn, mx, sparkline
 
<p>While testing it I happened to try an unchanging sequence, [3, 3, 3, 3], which fails with a divide-by-zero error. In order to address that, and to unpack the algorithm a bit for readability, I arrived at this Postgres function:</p>
 create function sparkline(numbers bigint[]) returns text as $$

    def bar_index(num, _min, barcount, extent):
        index = min([barcount - 1, int( (num - _min) / extent * bar_count)])
        return index

    bars = '\u2581\u2582\u2583\u2584\u2585\u2586\u2587\u2588'
    _min, _max = min(numbers), max(numbers)
    extent = _max - _min 

    if extent == 0:  # avoid divide by zero if all numbers are equal
        extent = 1

    bar_count = len(bars)
    sparkline = ''
    for num in numbers:
        index = bar_index(num, _min, bar_count, extent)
        sparkline = sparkline + bars[index]

    return sparkline

$$ language plpython3u;
 
<p>Here’s a psql invocation of the function:</p>
 analytics=# select sparkline(array[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]);
    sparkline
-----------------
▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█▇▆▅▄▃▂▁
(1 row) 
<p>And here’s an example based on actual data:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Each row represents a university course in which students and teachers are annotating the course readings. Each bar represents a week’s worth of activity. Their heights are not comparable from row to row; some courses do a lot of annotating and some not so much; each sparkline reports relative variation from week to week; the sum and weekly max columns report absolute numbers.</p>
<p>This visualization makes it easy to see that annotation was occasional in some courses and continuous in others. And when you scroll, the temporal axis comes alive; try scrolling this view to see what I mean.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We use the same mechanism at three different scales. One set of sparklines reports daily activity for students in courses; another rolls those up to weekly activity for courses at a school; still another rolls all those up to weekly activity for each school in the system.</p>
<p>At the level of individual courses, the per-student sparkline views can show patterns of interaction. In the left example here, vertical bands of activity reflect students annotating for particular assignments. In the right example there may be a trace of such temporal alignment but activity is less synchronized and more continuous.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When we’re working in Metabase we can use its handy mini bar charts to contextualize the row-wise sums.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The sparkline-like mini bar chart shows a row’s sum relative to the max for the column. Here we can see that a course with 3,758 notes has about 1/4 the number of notes as the most note-heavy course at the school.</p>
<p>Because these Unicode sparklines are just strings of text in columns of SQL or HTML tables, they can participate in sort operations. In our case we can sort on all columns including ones not shown here: instructor name, course start date, number of students. But the default is to sort by the sparkline column which, because it encodes time, orders courses by the start of annotation activity.</p>
<p>The visual effect is admittedly crude, but it’s a good way to show certain kinds of variation. And it’s nicely portable. A Unicode sparkline looks the same in a psql console, an HTML table, or a tweet. The function will work in any database that can run it, using Python or another of the languages demoed at rosettacode.org. For example, I revisited the Workbench workflow described in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/01/a-beautiful-power-tool-to-scrape-clean-and-combine-data/">A beautiful power tool to scrape, clean, and combine data</a> and added a tab for <a href="https://app.workbenchdata.com/workflows/149325/">Lake levels</a>.</p>
<p>When I did that, though, the effect was even cruder than what I’ve been seeing in my own work.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In our scenarios, with longer strings of characters, the differences average out and things align pretty well; the below-the-baseline effect has been annoying but not a deal breaker. But the width variation in this example does feel like a deal breaker.</p>
<p>What if we omit the problematic characters U+2581 (too narrow) and U+2584/U+2588 (below baseline and too narrow)?</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are only 5 buckets into which to quantize numbers, and their heights aren’t evenly distributed. But for the intended purpose — to show patterns of variation — I think it’s sufficient in this case. I tried swapping the 5-bucket method into the function that creates sparklines for our dashboards but I don’t think I’ll switch. The loss of vertical resolution makes our longer sparklines less useful, and the width variation is barely noticeable.</p>
<p>Unicode evolves, of course, so maybe there will someday be a sequence of characters that’s friendlier to sparklines. Maybe there already is? If so please let me know, I’d love to use it.</p>

    How many people do you need before identity has value - two! How come, as an industry where 3.2bn (<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/digital-identification-a-key-to-inclusive-growth">McKinsey</a>) people have a digital identity, are we so fragmented, uncoordinated and disagreeable?&nbsp; <p>It is evident that our ongoing discussions about identity, ethics, bias, privacy and consent revolve around a lot of noise (opinions) but little signal (alignment), but why?&nbsp; Recognising that in 30 years of digital identity, we still lack coherent and coordinated action to make it work for everyone is a reality. Perhaps it is time to recognise that it is “us”, the industry, who are the problem.&nbsp; We continue in our self confirming opinions, righteous products and determination to win at all costs.&nbsp; I am not saying we have not made progress or done amazing things, but we have not done as well as we should have!</p><p>As identity now takes several forms insomuch that it emerges from interactions with a system (say payment &amp; reputation), is foundational (given by an authority, a credential), and we can create our own (Self Soverign Identity [SSI]), we are more divided than ever on what we should build on, but have we got it totally wrong. This article gives some New thinking to rattle us.&nbsp;</p><p>We (anyone in identity, privacy, consent, digital space) are unlikely to like reading this. I am aware the responses are unlikely to be favourable, positive or constructive; because this is hard. The learning and takeaway, in the end, draws from a different market, who have solved how to act as one, even though they did not align.</p><p>-----&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I am first unpacking the current status.</p> What happens when the user (human) is not the connector? <p>We live in a digital age that is utterly dependent on the complex connectivity of systems, and in all but one case, the integrated communication path requires the centricity to be on a company, government body, product or service; except for personal identity, privacy and consent that remain focussed on an individual human.&nbsp;</p><p>Identity (all forms) is a function of context based on relationships. Identity exists between the two poles of emergent ID (from system and interactions), functional ID (a credential given to us by an authority) and with an individual (in the case of personal identity) being the connecting point. The dependencies between these solutions mean that our “identity data” rests in government, organisations, companies and individual domains.</p><p></p> Identity in this context <p>Identity includes everything that you can imagine: who you think you are, passport, ID, login, email, IP address, messages, census data, birth record, photos, friends, education, work, conversations, experience, travel, reputation, scars, memories, health, heart rate, blood pressure, medication, family tree, skin, DNA, parents, heritage, analysis, habits, rules, content, culture, who you identify as - everything yesterday, today and tomorrow that identify you as you and that makes you unique.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Functional or Foundational Identity <p>I am keeping it broad &amp; straightforward. Passport, birth certification, diving licence, DNA, sovereign ID, company ID and anything given to you by someone who has command and control (a credential.)&nbsp; Foundational Identity has governance and oversight about who issues the foundational identity, and therefore they are classed as an "authoritative source."&nbsp;</p><p>Foundational “hard” ID is given, but from it rises many softer identities (identifications) that are all built from having a foundation.&nbsp; If we had an unbreakable lineage and provenance to back identification from identity, it might help; but there are unintended consequences we have to face.&nbsp;</p> Pause and Reflection <p>We know something is broken in the functional ID model as my identity is me, who I am, what drives me, experience; it is not my passport but where the passport took me and the experiences I gained there.&nbsp; We know some don’t have the foundations of identification, but they have an identity.&nbsp; Your foundation identity does not define who you are.</p> Emergence&nbsp; <p>Definition: Emergence is where the properties or behaviours only emerge when components or parts interact as part of a whole inclusive system.&nbsp;</p> Emergence Identity <p>An identity that forms because you interact with systems.&nbsp; Your made-up email address enables someone to know where you live, what you buy, when you shop, who you shop for.&nbsp; Your preferences and actions identify you.&nbsp; This identity emerges not because you have a trusted bank account to pay but because you interact, your reputation.&nbsp; Your passport allows and enables interactions.&nbsp; The more we interact in a complex digital world, the more emergent identities we have.&nbsp;</p><p>Emergence is usually hidden insofar that IP address providers or payment transaction analysis systems could be judged as emergent identity creators. We as individuals do not control them or have visibility of the data (dark/ hidden). It is very much a debate if consent is needed and/ or if the creator (the user) should have this data under their control.&nbsp; Open Banking could be seen as one of the first emergent identity systems that do give the user some control.</p><p>If emergent identity had strong governance and oversight, it might also become like a Functional Identity.</p> We have to accept our identity is more than the sum. <p>The diagram below is based on a <a href="https://www.jpr.org.uk/documents/14-06-19.barry_johnson.polarity_management.pdf">polarity model</a>.&nbsp; Unlike a linear or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_chain">value chain mode</a>l, there is no one universal starting point or final destination.&nbsp; As we discover the value and limitations of the two principle identity models, we recognise that we continually move around the model, never settling at one place or outcome but learning and improving both.&nbsp; However, given the boundaries and limitations of each, we need both to be successful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The purpose of functional and emergence ID is to determine where you start the journey.</p><br><p></p> There is a deep dependency.&nbsp; <p>Without foundational, I cannot access emergent; without emergent, I cannot gain value from foundational. If I cannot gain/ get a foundational identity, emergent identity enables me to start, barter/ trade and protect myself.&nbsp; Emergence can be a lifeline to getting a foundational identity.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies, organisations and governments believe that control of your identity is critically important. They call it identity to ensure you are not aware if it is emergent or foundational.&nbsp; They (well, we the industry) will use one to create the other and cause confusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Where does SSI (self-sovereign identity) fit? <p>Ignoring the name and all those issues, SSI is not emergent ID or functional/ foundational ID, but our agent for identity. SSI is a decentralized model for digital identity based on an entity’s control over forming and using cryptographically secured digital connections (using DIDs) and accepting and presenting digitally signed credentials (VCs). It applies as much to organizations and IoT as individuals. (thanks @DrummondReed)<br></p><p>SSI has made me realise that we have created different onboarding positions and propositions, not different approaches to identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>SSI could be seen as a new model for providing functional ID that has interesting possibilities for helping with some aspects of emergent ID. But no technology can fully emulate the qualities of emergent ID.</p> But what does this mean? <p>There is a deep desire to want the best of all worlds without realising or recognising the separation and interdependence. We debate and argue about transparency, data sharing, ontology requirements, privacy by design, consent driven, control, value, power, and much more in wanting the best.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Given we cannot have a form of identity without the other, how can we cycle faster to co-create better solutions with the best aspects of both? But recognise that consent works well for foundational identity but is hopeless for emergent. Privacy can protect foundational ID, but not emergent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> The linkage is us, the human, today, but should we be the link? <p>Right now, it is the individual who connects the different domains of personal identity.&nbsp; Without you and your needs to trade, barter, work, play - these domains would not need connecting.&nbsp; We create and need connections and are the connector.&nbsp; We may be lucky enough to have a foundational ID at birth, but for a digital life, we need both.&nbsp; We are the connection until death when they will slowly separate again as emergent ID is no longer needed, but a link can continue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Mapping some solutions <p>Below is the polarity map of identity with SSI, SOLID, yoti, and Vouch added. Why have I only picked these from the 100+ solutions, because I want others to place where they are.&nbsp; The placements are the starting positions for onboarding, the value proposition to get onto the identify loop.&nbsp; It is not where they stay or add the most value; it is day zero, what problem is solved and why you should join. I am likely to have in-correctly positioned them, so if you feel they are wrong, please identify a better place.&nbsp; The message is that we all start as different places to solve the same problem.&nbsp; But what we do is continually confuse everyone and ensure that we disagree on what identity means or what it is for.&nbsp; We hold fast to our “best in class” solution, our product and our personal beliefs with conformational bias.&nbsp;</p><p></p> Who has solved the same problem before? <p>An insight for us (the identity industry) comes from an unlikely source. Time to look at the green movement, global warming and climate change.&nbsp; Back in the 1960s, when protests against nuclear power and arms were in full swing, we also marched for: save the whales, save the endangered species, save the newt, save the planet, save humanity, save the tigers, save the elephants, save the orangutans and many more. &nbsp; On a march or protest, there were a few to hundred and the occasional thousand.&nbsp; Co-ordinated marches across the globe in different cities swelled the number on a specific topic march.&nbsp; During the 80’s “Feed the World” raised millions of pounds for a cause, famine in Africa.&nbsp; When acting as one - we can start to create change.</p><p>At some point, something interesting happened.&nbsp; Individuals connected their ecosystem crisis to another, more significant, crisis.&nbsp; It was bigger than a connection; it was a cause.&nbsp; The small marches against an effect could start to see there was a more significant cause.&nbsp; Global warming and climate change bought together those focusing on local protests through loss of habitat to match together as one voice as their loss resulted from a cause. Save the Whales would not join a save the newt but can walk side by side on Climate Change.&nbsp; Climate change was not a march but a “co-opted” group from thousands of different factions fighting for their own passion, purpose or love.&nbsp; Many voices became one and retained their own passion.&nbsp;</p><p>Identity has many factions, many voices, many causes, many definitions and many solutions.&nbsp; We continue to define, redefine and demand our “xxx” of identity as the one usually because it is the model we want as we will benefit.&nbsp;</p><p>Our big and unifying issue is to recognise that corporates, especially big tech and government, have no interest in one identity and indeed would find ways to ensure it remains factions and uncoordinated unless they are the single controller. They will sponsor and support many programs, many solutions and keep the divisions going, playing a game. Single identity would likely also render Facebook and media companies, with their advertising model unworkable - so not all big tech want a solution! Division works.</p><p>Perhaps the lesson here is that we should stop fighting for our own version of identity (privacy, ethics, consent), for our own definitions, for our own implementations, for our own solutions, for our own products and start to think about acting like one. Each of us swallows some pride, eats some ego and finds ways to behave as one industry voice, one team who cares together as we have passion, purpose and heart to solve identity problems for everyone.</p><p>The railway, automobile and aero industries across the world have made it work. Building different gauge infrastructures to different standards but eventually learning that together they thrive when they stopped wanting aligned infrastructures and found a way to ensure users could access and use it all.&nbsp;</p><p>If you disagree, share this and say why. If you agree, share this, so we talk about it at our meeting places.&nbsp; If you're an influencer, reflect to see if we are the problem. If you organise events, why not make time to lead this debate?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>----</p><p>This article has been in formation for some 18 months. It had no direction or lacked sense at points, and through perseverance, friends, and discussion, it has become what it is today.&nbsp; Many have shaped the thinking.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Epistemology doesn’t just ask questions about what we should do to find things out; that is the task of all disciplines to some extent. For example, science, research, data analysis, and anthropology all have their own methods for finding things out. Epistemology has the job of making those methods themselves the objects of study. It aims to understand how methods of inquiry can be seen as rational endeavours.</p><p>If the concept of “knowing things to be true” were simple, we’d all agree on many things that we currently disagree about; climate and vaccines appear current.&nbsp; We cannot reach a unanimous agreement means something is wrong with our data, analysis, and information model.</p><p>The senior leadership team will tend to think of themselves as clear thinkers and see those who disagree with an opinion as misguided. Executives believe they have the capacity to see things just as they “really” are and that it is others who have confused perceptions. As a result, the CDO can simply point out to everyone where their thinking has gone wrong using facts rather than engage in rational dialogue allowing for the possibility that we all might be wrong. Philosophy, psychology and cognitive science guide us that we are complex, and our reasoning is not clinical or pure. Data (facts) and its analysis create a staggeringly complex array of cognitive biases and dispositions. We are generally ignorant of their role in others who influence us and our own thinking and decision-making.</p><p>A CDO is responsible for introducing everyone who touches data to a systematic way of interrogating thinking, models, rationality, and a sense of what makes “for a good reason” for both sides of the evidence coin.&nbsp;</p><p>As a CDO, you should help determine by what criteria the leadership team are to evaluate reason.&nbsp; We need to establish how, as a team, the criteria themselves are evaluated? Further, how do we determine how a belief or action can be justified and the relationship between justification and truth? &nbsp; And as the CDO, we have to establish and own the <a href="https://opengovernance.net/data-for-better-decisions-nature-or-nurture-79e6531dbe3a">company-wide top-level data ontology</a>.&nbsp;</p><p></p><br><p>The first action will be to get the topic of evidence on the agenda, not as a diversion, but to start to bring up critical issues such as bias in our decision making.&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>----</p><p>Whilst our ongoing agile iteration into <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-occurs-when-physical-beings-transition-to-information-beings-146ea9dcbca3">information beings</a> is never-ending, there are the first 100 days in the new role. But what to focus on? Well, that rose-tinted period of conflicting priorities is what <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/">&lt;/Hello, CDO!&gt;</a> is all about. Maintaining sanity when all else has been lost to untested data assumptions is a different problem entirely.</p> <br>

<p>Some news: I’m super happy to report that I started a new job last week at <a href="https://nytimes.com/">The

<p>After ten years at <a href="https://iovation.com/">iovation</a>, the last four working remotely from New York City
and the last three under the ownership of <a href="https://transunion.com/">TransUnion</a>, I felt it was time to
find something new. At The Times, I’ve taken the role of Staff Engineer on a new
team, User Systems. I’m particularly stoked for this gig, as it falls right into
areas of abiding interest, including privacy-by design, personal data
protection, encryption, authentication, credential management, and scaling a
vital app for the whole business. Add that to the straightforward commute once
the office reopens, and it’s hard to find something more ideal.</p>
<p>I truly appreciate the extraordinary experience of my ten years at iovation. I
originally thought I’d stay a couple years, but was so engaged by the people and
the great work we did that I kept at it. I learned a ton about product
engineering, product design, and scalable architectures, but especially about
working with terrific colleagues who made me a better person even as I tried to
be of service to them. I will especially miss working with Scott, Kurk, Clara,
Travis, John, and Eric — and countless others. I wish them all the best, and
would enjoy working with any and all of them again anytime.</p>
<p>Now I’m excited to make new connections working with my amazing new colleagues
at The Times. I expect we’ll collaborate on fulfilling work building super
useful tools that advance <a href="https://www.nytco.com/company/mission-and-values/" title="The New York Times Company: Mission and Values">The Times mission</a> to inform and empower its readers.
I’m delighted to be jumping on this ride with them.</p>

<p>Labels like “data scientist” and “data journalist” connote an elite corps of professionals who can analyze data and use it to reason about the world. There are elite practitioners, of course, but since the advent of online data a quarter century ago I’ve hoped that every thinking citizen of the world (and of the web) could engage in similar analysis and reasoning. </p>
<p>That’s long been possible for those of us with the ability to wrangle APIs and transform data using SQL, Python, or another programming language. But even for us it hasn’t been easy. When I read news stories that relate to the generation of electric power in California, for example, questions occur to me that I know I could illuminate by finding, transforming, and charting sources of web data:</p>
<p>– How can I visualize the impact of shutting down California’s last nuclear plant?</p>
<p>– What’s the relationship between drought and hydro power?</p>
<p>All the ingredients are lying around in plain sight, but the effort required to combine them winds up being more trouble than it’s worth. And that’s for me, a skilled longtime scraper and transformer of web data. For you — even if you’re a scientist or a journalist! — that may not even be an option.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://workbenchdata.com/">Workbench</a>, a web app with the tagline: “Scrape, clean, combine and analyze data without code.” I’ve worked with tools in the past that pointed the way toward that vision. DabbleDB in 2005 (now gone) and Freebase Gridworks in 2010 (still alive as Open Refine) were effective ways to cut through <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2008/02/20/overcoming-data-friction/">data friction</a>. Workbench carries those ideas forward delightfully. It enables me to fly through the boring and difficult stuff — the scraping, cleaning, and combining — in order to focus on what matters: the analysis.</p>
<p>Here’s the <a href="https://app.workbenchdata.com/workflows/149325/report">report</a> that I made to address the questions I posed above. It’s based on a <a href="https://app.workbenchdata.com/workflows/149325/">workflow</a> that you can visit and explore as I describe it here. (If you create your own account you can clone and modify.)</p>
<p>The workflow contains a set of tabs; each tab contains a sequence of steps; each step transforms a data set and displays output as a table or chart. When you load the page the first tab runs, and the result of its last step is displayed. In this case that’s the first chart shown in the report:</p>
<p></p>
<p>As in a Jupyter notebook you can run each step individually. Try clicking step 1. You’ll see a table of data from <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/data-reports/energy-almanac/california-electricity-data/electric-generation-capacity-and-energy">energy.ca.gov</a>. Notice that step 1 is labeled Concatenate tabs. If you unfurl it you’ll see that it uses another tab, 2001-2020 scraped, which in turn concatenates two other tabs, 2001-2010 scraped and 2011-2020 scraped. Note that I’ve helpfully explained that in the optional comment field above step 1.</p>
<p>Each of the two source tabs scrapes a table from the page at energy.ca.gov. As I note in the report, it wasn’t necessary to scrape those tables since the data are available as an Excel file that can be downloaded, then uploaded to Workbench (as I’ve done in the tab named energy.ca.gov xslx). I scraped them anyway because that web page presents a common challenge: the data appear in two separate HTML tables. That’s helpful to the reader but frustrating to an analyst who wants to use the data. Rapid and fluid combination of scraped tables is grease for cutting through data friction; Workbench supplies that grease.</p>
<p>Now click step 2 in the first tab. It’s the last step, so you’re back to the opening display of the chart. Unfurl it and you’ll see the subset of columns included in the chart. I’ve removed some minor sources, like oil and waste heat, in order to focus on major ones. Several details are notable here. First: colors. The system provides a default palette but you can adjust it. Black wasn’t on the default palette but I chose that for coal.</p>
<p>Second, grand total. The data set doesn’t include that column, and it’s not something I needed here. But in some situations I’d want it, so the system offers it as a choice. That’s an example of the attention to detail that pervades every aspect of Workbench. </p>
<p>Third, Vega. See the triple-dot button above the legend in the chart? Click it, then select Open in Vega Editor, and when you get there, click Run. Today I learned that Vega is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing visualization designs. With Vega, visualizations are described in JSON, and generate interactive views using either HTML5 Canvas or SVG.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Sweet! I think I’ll use it in my own work to simplify what I’ve recently (and painfully) learned how to do with D3.js. It’s also a nice example of how Workbench prioritizes openness, reusability, and reproducibility in every imaginable way.</p>
<p>I use the chart as the intro to my report, which is made with an elegant block editor in which you can combine tables and charts from any of your tabs with snippets of text written in markdown. There I begin to ask myself questions, adding tabs to marshal supporting evidence and sourcing evidence from tabs into the report.</p>
<p>My first question is about the contribution that the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant has been making to the overall mix. In the 2020 percentages all major sources tab I start in step 1 by reusing the tab 2001-2020 scraped. Step 2 filters the columns to just the same set of major sources shown in the chart. I could instead apply that step in 2001-2020 scraped and avoid the need to select columns for the chart. Since I’m not sure how that decision might affect downstream analysis I keep all the columns. If I change my mind it’s easy to push the column selection upstream. </p>
<p>Workbench not only makes it possible to refactor a workflow, it practically begs you to do that. When things go awry, as they inevitably will, it’s no problem. You can undo and redo the steps in each tab! You won’t see that in the read-only view but if you create your own account, and duplicate my workflow in it, give it a try. With stepwise undo/redo, exploratory analysis becomes a safe and stress-free activity.</p>
<p>At step 2 of 2020 percentages all major sources we have rows for all the years. In thinking about Diablo Canyon’s contribution I want to focus on a single reference year so in step 3 I apply a filter that selects just the 2020 row. Here’s the UX for that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In situations like this, where you need to select one or more items from a list, Workbench does all the right things to minimize tedium: search if needed, start from all or none depending on which will be easier, then keep or remove selected items, again depending on which will be easier. </p>
<p>In step 4 I include an alternate way to select just the 2020 row. It’s a Select SQL step that says select * from input where Year = '2020'. That doesn’t change anything here; I could omit either step 3 or step 4 without affecting the outcome; I include step 4 just to show that SQL is available at any point to transform the output of a prior step. </p>
<p>Which is fantastic, but wait, there’s more. In step 5 I use a Python step to do the same thing in terms of a pandas dataframe. Again this doesn’t affect the outcome, I’m just showing that Python is available at any point to transform the output of a prior step. Providing equivalent methods for novices and experts, in a common interface, is extraordinarily powerful.</p>
<p>I’m noticing now, by the way, that step 5 doesn’t work if you’re not logged in. So I’ll show it to you here:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Step 6 transposes the table so we can reason about the fuel types. In steps 3-5 they’re columns, in step 6 they become rows. This is a commonly-needed maneuver. And while I might use the SQL in step 4 to do the row selection handled by the widget in step 3, I won’t easily accomplish the transposition that way. The Transpose step is one of the most powerful tools in the kit.</p>
<p>Notice at step 6 that the first column is named Year. That’s a common outcome of transposition and here necessitates step 7 in which I rename it to Fuel Type. There are two ways to do that. You can click the + Add Step button, choose the Rename columns option, drag the new step into position 7, open it, and do the renaming there. </p>
<p>But look:</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can edit anything in a displayed table. When I change Year to Fuel Type that way, the same step 7 that you can create manually appears automatically. </p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s absolutely brilliant.</p>
<p>In step 8 I use the Calculate step to add a new column showing each row’s percentage of the column sum. In SQL I’d have to think about that a bit. Here, as is true for so many routine operations like this, Workbench offers the solution directly: </p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally in step 9 I sort the table. The report includes it, and there I consider the question of Diablo Canyon’s contribution. According to my analysis nuclear power was 9% of the major sources I’ve selected, contributing 16,280 GWh in 2020. According to another energy.ca.gov page that I <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2020-03/Nuclear_Power_Reactors_in_California_ada.pdf">cite</a> in the report, Diablo Canyon is the only remaining nuke plant in the state, producing “about 18,000 GWh.” That’s not an exact match but it’s close enough to give me confidence that reasoning about the nuclear row in the table applies to Diablo Canyon specifically. </p>
<p>Next I want to compare nuclear power to just the subset of sources that are renewable. That happens in the 2020 percentages renewable tab, the output of which is also included in the report. Step 1 begins with the output of 2020 percentages of all major sources. In step 2 I clarify that the 2020 column is really 2020 GWh. In step 3 I remove the percent column in order to recalculate it. In step 4 I remove rows in order to focus on just nuclear and renewables. In step 5 I recalculate the percentages. And in step 6 I make the chart that also flows through to the report.</p>
<p>Now, as I look at the chart, I notice that the line for large hydro is highly variable and appears to correlate with drought years. In order to explore that correlation I look for data on reservoir levels and arrive at <a href="https://cdec.water.ca.gov/">https://cdec.water.ca.gov/</a>. I’d love to find a table that aggregates levels for all reservoirs statewide since 2001, but that doesn’t seem to be on offer. So I decide to use Lake Mendocino as a proxy. In step 1 I scrape an <a href="https://cdec.water.ca.gov/dynamicapp/QueryWY?Stations=MNC&amp;SensorNums=15&amp;End=2021-07-31&amp;span=20">HTML table</a> with monthly levels for the lake since 2001. In step 2 I delete the first row which only has some months. In step 3 I rename the first column to Year in order to match what’s  in the table I want to join with. In step 4 I convert the types of the month columns from text to numeric to enable calculation. In step 5 I calculate the average into a new column, Avg. In step 6 I select just Year and Avg. </p>
<p>When I first try the join in step 8 it fails for a common reason that Workbench helpfully explains:</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the other table Year looks like ‘2001’, but the text scraped from energy.ca.gov looks like ‘2,001’. That’s a common glitch that can bring an exercise like this to a screeching halt. There’s probably a Workbench way to do this, but in step 7 I use SQL to reformat the values in the Year column, removing the commas  to enable the join. While there I also rename the Avg column to Lake Mendocino Avg Level. Now in tab 8 I can do the join.</p>
<p>In tab 9 I scale the values for Large Hydro into a new column, Scaled Large Hydro. Why? The chart I want to see will compare power generation in GWh (gigawatt hours) and lake levels in AF (acre-feet). These aren’t remotely compatible but I don’t care, I’m just looking for comparable trends. Doubling the value for Large Hydro gets close enough for the comparison chart in step 10, which also flows through to the report.</p>
<p>All this adds up to an astonishingly broad, deep, and rich set of features. And I haven’t even talked about the <a href="http://help.workbenchdata.com/en/articles/2322465-clean-text">Clean text</a> step for tweaking whitespace, capitalization, and punctuation, or the <a href="http://help.workbenchdata.com/en/articles/1867388-refine">Refine</a> step for finding and merging clusters of similar values that refer to the same things. Workbench is also simply beautiful as you can see from the screen shots here, or by visiting my workflow. When I reviewed software products for BYTE and InfoWorld it was rare to encounter one that impressed me so thoroughly.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more. </p>
<p>At the core of my workflow there’s a set of tabs; each is a sequence of steps; some of these produce tables and charts. Wrapped around the workflow there’s the report into which I cherrypick tables and charts for the story I’m telling there. </p>
<p>There’s also another kind of wrapper: a lesson wrapped around the workflow. I could write a lesson that guides you through the steps I’ve described and checks that each yields the expected result. See <a href="https://app.workbenchdata.com/courses/en/intro-to-data-journalism/first-story">Intro to data journalism</a> for an example you can try. Again, it’s brilliantly well done.</p>
<p>So Workbench succeeds in three major ways. If you’re not a data-oriented professional, but you’re a thinking person who wants to use available web data to reason about the world, Workbench will help you power through the grunt work of scraping, cleaning, and combining that data so you can focus on analysis. If you aspire to become such a professional, and you don’t have a clue about how to do that grunt work, it will help you learn the ropes. And if you are one of the pros you’ll still find it incredibly useful.</p>
<p>Kudos to the Workbench team, and especially to core developers Jonathan Stray, Pierre Conti, and Adam Hooper, for making this spectacularly great software tool. </p>

 Reflecting on change and community in a time of personal transition. Staring out over a world of possibilities (Joshua Tree, July&nbsp;2021)<p>Navigating through this global pandemic has leveled up both my tolerance for ambiguity and my appreciation for community — including friends, family, co-workers, and global colleagues. These dual forces of change and connection are also guiding me forward as I embark on a new professional chapter.</p><p>After three deeply rewarding and challenging years with <a href="http://transmute.industries">Transmute</a>, I’m transitioning into a new role this&nbsp;fall.</p><p>I will continue to work in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/CRD-did-core-20210724/">decentralized identity</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">verifiable credentials</a> ecosystem but will return to more of my impact roots as Senior Director of Product with Kiva’s <a href="https://www.kiva.org/protocol">Protocol</a> team — part of an <a href="http://kiva.org">international non-profit</a> working on digital identity as an enabler of deeper financial inclusion. I will also remain a champion and alumni advisor of Transmute, cheering the team on through next iterations of company and product development.</p><p>Making any big transition like this always surfaces the forest through the trees for me, bringing some longer term trends into focus in a way I often miss when heads down on day to day&nbsp;work.</p><p>In particular I’ve found myself reflecting on the philosophy and practice of open versus closed networks, and my growing conviction that open networks are a key to satisfaction and success, both for individuals and for businesses.</p><p>My working definition of “open networks” boils down to a mindset and style of engagement that assumes generosity, collaboration, and expanded connections will lead to mutual benefit. This can look like contributing to global standards and open source work, being proactive with connecting people, offering support without expectation of returned favors, and celebrating colleagues as they transition organizations (something I’ve been fortunate to experience this month with Transmute).</p><p>Open network interactions are empathetic and relational rather than transactional, rooted in a belief that we can progress and grow together, creating more opportunity in the process rather than competing for something finite.</p><p>By contrast, a more closed network approach (all too often the default) sees the gain of others as a personal loss if not compensated in some way. It is a more protective mentality that discourages transparency and informal exchange. It looks like vendor lock-in, punitive non-compete agreements, and proprietary code. To be clear, some degree of this is necessary for businesses to function today — to show value for investors, protect IP, drive competitive advantage, etc. However, taken as a default state, closed networks can crush both innovation and the spirits of individuals whose interests expand beyond the bounds of any single identity or organization.</p><p>One of the things that drew me to Transmute — and more broadly to emergent technology like decentralized identities and verifiable credentials — is that the open network style is often the default culture of engagement. In fact, this approach is necessary in the face of pre-competitive table stakes like technical interoperability as well as collaborative engagement and advocacy in the broader regulatory environment. Essentially, the adoption of this technology is far bigger than any one of us, and we have to work together to build the market and adoption we want to see in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>This open, generous network ethos aligns with the future I want to be part of, both with the organizations I help build and personally as a self-actualizing and social human. Part of the “crafted self” we talk about as identity workers includes the ability to be selectively multi-dimensional beings across different settings. To me this includes the freedom to traverse organizations and even industries as our interests take us, and to carry our reputation and relationships along that journey. Viewed in this way, the interoperability and autonomy values woven into the foundations of decentralized tech become further tools that can help bring to bear an even more generous&nbsp;world.</p><p>A huge thank you to the<a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk"> Transmute Team</a> — particularly <a href="https://medium.com/@karylfowler">Karyl Fowler</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@OR13">Orie Steele</a> — for leading the way, both as technologists and founders, in making the bet that movement across systems and organizations is a win for all parties involved (be they verifiable trade documents or prior employees). It has been a pleasure to work for and with you over the past few&nbsp;years.</p><p>***</p><p>If you are interested in some of the cross-network work happening in the decentralized tech space you can also check out the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> working groups, the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a>, the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a>, and the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/svip">Department of Homeland Security Silicon Valley Innovation Program</a> (to name just a&nbsp;few!).</p>Jumping off, jumping in!

    The last article was about being <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/the-railroad-of-no-choice-a55420cea06f">railroaded</a> in the first 100 days, recognising that you are forced into a decision.&nbsp; In this one I wanted to unpack that “data” shows that using science in an argument (say to defend against railroading) just makes the members of the team more partisan (aligned to their own confirmation bias and opinions).&nbsp; As the #CDO, your job is to use data and science, therefore in the first 100 days, with this insight, you are more likely to lose more people than win friends, lose more arguments than win and create bigger hurdles? &nbsp; What I suggest, based on this work is that to overcome “proof by science” is to use curiosity to bring us together. <p></p><p>Image source: from a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/curious-leader-douglas-longenecker/">good article</a> by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/douglaslongenecker/">Douglas Longenecker</a></p><p>---</p><p><a href="https://law.yale.edu/dan-m-kahan">Dan Kahan</a>, a Yale behavioural economist, has spent the last decade studying whether the use of reason aggravates or reduces “partisan” beliefs. His research papers are <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=45442">here</a>. His research shows that aggravation and alienation easily win, irrespective of being more liberal or conservative. The more we use our faculties for scientific thought, the more likely we are to take a strong position that aligns with our (original) political group (or thought).&nbsp;</p><p>A way through this is to copy “<a href="https://www.solutionsjournalism.org/">solution journalism</a>” which reports on ways that people and governments meaningfully respond to difficult problems and not on what the data says the problem is. Rather than use our best insights, analysis and thinking to reach the version of the “truth”, we use data to find ways to agree with others opinions in our communities. We help everyone to become curious. &nbsp; I use the<a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/"> Peak Paradox</a> framework as an approach to remaining curious as to where we are aligned and where there is a delta.&nbsp;</p><p>What happens when we use data and science in our arguments and explain what the problem is, is that the individuals will selectively credit and discredit information in patterns that reflect their commitment to certain values. They (we) (I) assimilate what they (we)(I) want.&nbsp;</p><p>Kahan, in 2014, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2459057">asked over 1,500 respondents</a> whether they agreed or disagreed with the following statement: “There is solid evidence of recent global warming due mostly to human activity such as burning fossil fuels.” They collected information on individuals political beliefs, and rated their science intelligence.” The analysis found that those with the least science intelligence actually have less partisan positions than those with the most. A Conservative with strong science intelligence will use their skills to find evidence against human-caused global warming, while a Liberal will find evidence for it (cognitive bias.)&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>In the chart above, the y-axis represents the probability of a person agreeing that human activity caused climate change, and x-axis represents the percentile a person scored on the scientific knowledge test. The width of the bars shows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval">confidence interval</a> for that probability.</p><p>As a CDO a most disconcerting finding is that individuals with more “scientific intelligence” are the quickest to align themselves on subjects they don’t know anything about. In one experiment, Kahan analyzed how people’s opinions on an <a href="http://www.nanotechproject.org/file_download/files/NanotechRiskPerceptions-DanKahan.pdf">unfamiliar subject</a> is affected when given some basic scientific information, along with details about what people in their self-identified political group tend to believe about that subject. It turned out that those with the strongest scientific reasoning skills were the ones most likely to use the information to develop partisan opinions.</p><p>Critically Kahan’s research shows that people that score well on a measure called “scientific curiosity” actually show less partisanship, and it is this aspect we need to use.</p><p>As CDO’s, we need to move away from “truth”, “facts”, “data” and “right decisions” if we want to have a board and senior team who can become aligned.&nbsp; We need to present ideas, concepts, how others are finding solutions and make our teams more curious.&nbsp; Being curious appears to be the best way to bring us together - however counterintuitive that is.</p><br><p>-----</p><p>Whilst our ongoing agile iteration into <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-occurs-when-physical-beings-transition-to-information-beings-146ea9dcbca3">information beings</a> is never-ending, there are the first 100 days in the new role. But what to focus on? Well, that rose-tinted period of conflicting priorities is what <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/">&lt;/Hello, CDO!&gt;</a> is all about. Maintaining sanity when all else has been lost to untested data assumptions is a different problem entirely.</p> <br>

    Questions to help frame your own paradoxes <p>Leadership must be <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/in-leadership-why-is-recognising-paradox-critically-important">able to recognise the paradoxes created</a> as they decide on “<a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/what-are-we-optimising-for">what they are optimising for.</a>” The last article described two different starting points for the Peak Paradox model; <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/hello-world">finding paradox</a> and<a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/plotting-how-to-make-better-decisions"> living with paradox</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It is evident that the compromises we elect to live with become more focused as we agreed or decide on what we are optimising for.&nbsp; Such a focus has a benefit insomuch that the narrower and more articulate our view of optimised becomes, the more <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/plotting-how-to-make-better-decisions">decisions can become aligned</a>. However, the counter is that whilst a sharp focus and alignment will require less compromise for some, but it will equally increase the paradoxes/ compromises and tensions others will have to live with.&nbsp; One team can be aligned to a vision but not necessarily on how to get there or live with the chosen “optimised” approach.&nbsp; Stress is created by these differences and can create cracks and weaknesses in the team and culture. One vision, one culture, one team is very naive in any team more extensive than one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Sufficient dwell or thinking time is often not afforded to executive and leadership teams. Indeed board agendas are so packed and time so restricted there is little opportunity to debate or descent. The consequence of this reality is that insufficient time is allowed to consider the impacts of your optimising choices on others.&nbsp; Therefore over the next few posts, I will offer questions at different levels as per the <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/plotting-how-to-make-better-decisions">decision model</a> (below.)&nbsp; This is a <a href="https://opengovernance.net/choice-decision-making-and-judgment-is-your-relationship-constructive-or-destructive-c0e3b076e0a6">link</a> to a longer article on <a href="https://opengovernance.net/choice-decision-making-and-judgment-is-your-relationship-constructive-or-destructive-c0e3b076e0a6">choices, decisions, and judgment</a> as it frames; “are we asking the right questions?”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The outer yellow ring is the focus of this article. Below are five questions per “Peak” that should help facilitate a conversation to maximise benefits within this space or improve understanding of the compromises other will have to make to come to your peak.&nbsp;</p><p></p><br><br><p>As a reminder of what the peaks represent.&nbsp; The original <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/hello-world">detailed definitions of each peak are here.&nbsp;</a></p><p>Peak Individual Purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;At the exclusion of anything else, you are only interested in yourself.&nbsp; Selflessness at the extreme.&nbsp; You believe that you are sovereign (not having to ask anyone for permission or forgiveness), your voice and everything you say matters and everyone should agree. You are all-powerful and can do whatever you want and have the freedom and agency to do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Peak Work Purpose.&nbsp; At the exclusion of anything else, the only reason to work is to deliver as much possible value to the shareholders.&nbsp; Employees, customers, the environment does not matter in terms of exploitation.&nbsp; The purpose is to be the biggest and most efficient beast on the planet and able to deliver enormous returns; Shareholder Primacy at its most pure. Simple, clear, no conflict and no compromise, even to the point that rewarding the staff beyond fair would be a compromise.&nbsp; Compliance is met with the minimal standard ensuring that nothing is wasted.&nbsp; (note: it is not the reason an individual works, but a company works)</p><p>Peak Society Purpose. &nbsp;At the exclusion of anything else, we have to deliver and ensure there is no suffering and poverty for any living thing. Humans must have equal education, health and safety.&nbsp; There must be total transparency and equality.&nbsp; Everything is equally shared, and on-one has more power, agency or influence than anyone else.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Peak Human Purpose.&nbsp; At the exclusion of anything else, we are here to escape death which we do by reproducing as much as we can with the broadest community we can.&nbsp; We also have to adapt as fast as possible.&nbsp; We have to meet our chemistry requirements to stay alive for as long as possible to adopt and reproduce at the expense of anything else.&nbsp; Whilst all the peak purposes might be controversial (even to myself), saying purity of human purpose in chemistry/ biology might not go down very well. However, this is a model for framing thinking, so please go with it as it needs to be pure, and every other human purpose has conflicts with someone.</p><p>How would you answer these questions?</p><p></p><p></p><p>It should be evident that these questions try to frame you towards a natural one peak, but even at this level, you will have noticed that whilst you will align more to one peak than the others, but that you are full of paradoxes.&nbsp; Ask different questions, you will align to a different north star.&nbsp;</p><br><br><br>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/24/pl-pgsql-versus-pl-python-heres-why-im-using-both-to-write-postgres-functions/">episode 2</a> of this series I noted that the languages in which I’m writing Postgres functions share a common type system. It took me a while to understand how types work in the context of Postgres functions that can return sets of records and can interact with tables and materialized views.</p>
<p>Here is a set-returning function.</p>
 create function notes_for_user_in_group(
  _userid text, 
  _groupid text)
returns setof annotation as $$
  begin
    return query 
      select * from annotation
      where userid = concat('acct:', _userid)
      and groupid = _groupid;
  end;
$$ language plpgsql;
 
<p>In this case the type that governs the returned set has already been defined: it’s the schema for the annotation table.</p>



Column
Type




id
uuid


created
timestamp without time zone

target_uri

<p>The function returns records matching a userid and groupid. I can now find the URLs of documents most recently annotated by me.</p>
 select
  target_uri
from notes_for_user_in_group('judell@hypothes.is', '__world__')
order by created desc
limit 3;
 
<p>The Postgres response:</p>
                  target_uri                  
---------------------------------------------
 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20020501
 https://www.infoworld.com/article/2886828/github-for-the-rest-of-us.html
 https://web.hypothes.is/help/formatting-annotations-with-markdown/
 http://example.com                          
(3 rows)
 
<p>You might wonder why the function’s parameters are prefixed with underscores. That’s because variables used in functions can conflict with names of columns in tables. Since none of our column names begin with underscore, it’s a handy differentiator. Suppose the function’s signature were instead:</p>
 create function notes_for_user_in_group(
  userid text, 
  groupid text)
 
<p>Postgres would complain about a confict:</p>
 ERROR:  column reference "userid" is ambiguous
LINE 2:       where userid = concat('acct:', userid)
                    ^
DETAIL:  It could refer to either a PL/pgSQL variable or a table column.
 
<p>The table has userid and groupid columns that conflict with their eponymous variables. So for functions that combine variables and database values I prefix variable names with underscore.</p>
<p>Set-returning functions can be called in any SQL SELECT context. In the example above that context is psql, Postgres’ powerful and multi-talented REPL (read-eval-print loop). For an example of a different context, let’s cache the function’s result set in a materialized view.</p>
 create materialized view public_notes_for_judell as (
  select
    *
  from notes_for_user_in_group('judell@hypothes.is', '__world__')
  order by created desc
) with data;
 
<p>Postgres reports success by showing the new view’s record count.</p>
 SELECT 3972
 
<p>The view’s type is implicitly annotation; its schema matches the one shown above; selecting target_uri from the view is equivalent to selecting target_uri from the setof annotation returned from the function notes_for_user_in_group.</p>
 select
  target_uri
from public_notes_for_judell
limit 3;
 
<p>The Postgres response is the same as above.</p>
                  target_uri                  
---------------------------------------------
 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20020501
 https://www.infoworld.com/article/2886828/github-for-the-rest-of-us.html
 https://web.hypothes.is/help/formatting-annotations-with-markdown/
 http://example.com                          
(3 rows)
 
<p>It shows up a lot faster though! Every time you select the function’s result set, the wrapped query has to run. For this particular example that can take a few seconds. It costs the same amount of time to create the view. But once that’s done you can select its contents in milliseconds.</p>
<p>Now let’s define a function that refines notes_for_user_in_group by reporting the count of notes for each annotated document.</p>
 create function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(
  _userid text, 
  _groupid text)
returns table (
  count bigint,
  userid text,
  groupid text,
  url text
) as $$
  begin
    return query
      select
        count(n.*) as anno_count,
        n.userid,
        n.groupid,
        n.target_uri
      from notes_for_user_in_group(_userid, _groupid) n
      group by n.userid, n.groupid, n.target_uri                          
      order by anno_count desc;
  end;
$$ language plpgsql;
 
<p>Instead of returning a setof some named type, this function returns an anonymous table. I’ve aliased the set-returning function call notes_for_user_in_group as n and used the alias to qualify the names of selected columns. That avoids another naming conflict. If you write userid instead of n.userid in the body of the function and then call it, Postgres again complains about a conflict.</p>
 ERROR:  column reference "userid" is ambiguous
LINE 3:         userid,
                ^
DETAIL:  It could refer to either a PL/pgSQL variable or a table column.
 
<p>Here’s a sample call to our new function..</p>
 select 
  *
from annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(
  'judell',
  'hypothes.is',
  '__world__'
);
 
<p>The result:</p>
  count | userid             | groupid   | target_uri
-------+---------------------------------------------
   516 | judell@hypothes.is | __world__ | http://shakespeare.mit.edu/macbeth/full.html
    73 | judell@hypothes.is | __world__ | https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/india-floods-bangladesh-nepal-deaths-millions-homeless-latest-news-updates-a7919006.html

<p>Now let’s create a view based on that function.</p>
 create materialized view url_counts_for_public_notes_by_judell as (
  select 
    *
  from annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(
    'judell@hypothes.is',
    '__world__'
  )
) with data;
 
<p>Postgres says:</p>
 SELECT 1710
 
<p>When you ask for the definition of that view using the \d command in psql:</p>
<p>\d url_counts_for_public_notes_by_judell</p>
<p>It responds with the same table definition used when creating the function.</p>
  Column  |  Type  
---------+--------
 count   | bigint
 userid  | text
 groupid | text
 url     | text   
 
<p>Behind the scenes Postgres has created this definition from the anonymous table returned by the function.</p>
<p>To revise the function so that it uses a named type, first create the type.</p>
 create type annotated_docs_for_user_in_group as (
  count bigint,
  userid text,
  groupid text,
  url text
);
 
<p>Postgres reports success:</p>
 CREATE TYPE
 
<p>Now we can use that named type in the function. Since we’re redefining the function, first drop it.</p>
 drop function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group;
 
<p>Uh oh. Postgres is unhappy about that.</p>
 ERROR:  cannot drop function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(text,text) because other objects depend on it
DETAIL:  materialized view url_counts_for_public_notes_by_judell depends on function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(text,text)
HINT:  Use DROP ... CASCADE to drop the dependent objects too.
 
<p>A view that depends on a function must be recreated when the function’s signature changes. I’ll say more about this in a future episode on set-returning functions that dynamically cache their results in materialized views. For now, since the view we just created is a contrived throwaway, just drop it along with the function by using CASCADE as Postgres recommends.</p>
 drop function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group cascade;
 
<p>Postgres says:</p>
 NOTICE:  drop cascades to materialized view url_counts_for_public_notes_by_judell
DROP FUNCTION
 
<p>Now we can recreate a version of the function that returns setof annotated_docs_for_user_in_group instead of an anonymous table(...)</p>
 create function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(
  _userid text, 
  _groupid text)
returns setof annotated_docs_for_user_in_group as $$
  begin
    return query
      select
        count(n.*) as anno_count,
        n.userid,
        n.groupid,
        n.target_uri
      from notes_for_user_in_group(_userid, _groupid) n
      group by n.userid, n.groupid, n.target_uri                          
      order by anno_count desc;
  end;
$$ language plpgsql;
 
<p>The results are the same as above. So why do it this way? In many cases I don’t. It’s extra overhead to declare a type. And just as a view can depend on a function, a function can depend on a type. To see why you might not want such dependencies, suppose we want to also track the most recent note for each URL.</p>
 create type annotated_docs_for_user_in_group as (
  count bigint,
  userid text,
  groupid text,
  url text,
  most_recent_note timestamp
);
 
<p>That won’t work.</p>
 ERROR:  type "annotated_docs_for_user_in_group" already exists
 
<p>Dropping the type won’t work either.</p>
 ERROR:  cannot drop type annotated_docs_for_user_in_group because other objects depend on it                           
DETAIL:  function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(text,text,text) depends on type annotated_docs_for_user_in_group    
HINT:  Use DROP ... CASCADE to drop the dependent objects too.
 
<p>To redefine the type you have to do a cascading drop and then recreate functions that depend on the type. If any of those views depend on dropped functions, the drop cascades to them as well and they also must be recreated. That’s why I often write functions that return table(...) rather than setof TYPE. In dynamic languages it’s convenient to work with untyped bags of values; I find the same to be true when writing functions in Postgres.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, it’s useful to declare and use types. In my experience so far it makes most sense to do that in Postgres when you find yourself writing the same returns table(...) statement in several related functions. Let’s say we want a function that combines the results of annotated_docs_for_user_in_group for some set of users.</p>
 create function annotated_docs_for_users_in_group(_userids text[], _groupid text)
  returns setof annotated_docs_for_user_in_group as $$
    begin
      return query 
        with userids as (
          select unnest(_userids) as userid
        )
        select 
          a.*
        from userids u
        join annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(u.userid, _groupid) a
          on a.userid = concat('acct:', u.userid);
    end;
$$ language plpgsql;
 
<p>This new function uses the SQL WITH clause to create a common table expression (CTE) that converts an inbound array of userids into a transient table-like object, named userids, with one userid per row. The new function’s wrapped SQL then joins that CTE to the set returned from annotated_docs_for_user_in_group and returns the joined result.</p>
<p>(You can alternatively do this in a more procedural way by creating a loop variable and marching through the array to accumulate results. Early on I used that approach but in the context of Postgres functions I’ve come to prefer the more purely SQL-like set-oriented style.)</p>
<p>Sharing a common type between the two functions makes them simpler to write and easier to read. More importantly it connects them to one another and to all views derived from them. If I do decide to add most_recent_note to the type, Postgres will require me to adjust all depending functions and views so things remain consistent. That can be a crucial guarantee, and as we’ll see in a future episode it’s a key enabler of an advanced caching mechanism.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/21/a-virtuous-cycle-for-analytics/">A virtuous cycle for analytics</a> I noted that our library of Postgres functions is written in two languages: Postgres’ built-in pl/pgsql and the installable alternative pl/python. These share a common type system and can be used interchangeably.</p>
<p>Here’s a pl/pgsql classifier that tries to match the name of a course against a list of patterns that characterize the humanities.</p>
 create function humanities_classifier(course_name text) returns boolean as $$
  begin
    return
      lower(course_name) ~ any(array[
        'psych',
        'religio',
        'soci'
        ]);
  end;
$$ language plpgsql;

# select humanities_classifier('Religious Studies 101') as match;
match
-----
t

# select humanities_classifier('Comparative Religions 200') as match;
match
-----
t
 
<p>Here is that same classifier in Python.</p>
 create function humanities_classifier(course_name text) returns boolean as $$
  sql = f"""
    select lower('{course_name}') ~ any(array[
      'psych',
      'religio',
      'soci'
      ]) as match"""
  results = plpy.execute(sql)
  return results[0]['match']
$$ language plpython3u;

# select humanities_classifier('Religious Studies 101') as match;
match
-----
t

# select humanities_classifier('Comparative Religions 200') as match;
match
-----
t
 
<p>The results are exactly the same. In this case, Python is only wrapping the SQL used in the orginal function and interpolating course_name into it. So why use pl/python here? I wouldn’t. The pl/pgsql version is cleaner and simpler because the SQL body doesn’t need to be quoted and course_name doesn’t need to be interpolated into it.</p>
<p>Here’s a more Pythonic version of the classifier.</p>
 create function humanities_classifier(course_name text) returns boolean as $$
  import re
  regexes = [
    'psych',
    'religio',
    'soci'
  ]
  matches = [r for r in regexes if re.search(r, course_name, re.I)]
  return len(matches)
$$ language plpython3u;
 
<p>There’s no SQL here, this is pure Python. Is there any benefit to doing things this way? In this case probably not. The native Postgres idiom for matching a string against a list of regular expressions is cleaner and simpler than the Python technique shown here. A Python programmer will be more familiar with list comprehensions than with the Postgres any and ~ operators but if you’re working in Postgres you’ll want to know about those, and use them not just in functions but in all SQL contexts.</p>
<p>What about performance? You might assume as I did that a pl/pgsql function is bound to be way faster than its pl/python equivalent. Let’s check that assumption. This SQL exercises both flavors of the function, which finds about 500 matches in a set of 30,000 names.</p>
 with matching_courses as (
  select humanities_classifier(name) as match
  from lms_course_groups
) 

select count(*) 
from matching_courses
where match;
 
<p>Here are the results for three runs using each flavor of the function:</p>
  pl/pgsql: 159ms, 201ms, 125ms

pl/python: 290ms, 255ms, 300ms
 
<p>The Python flavor is slower but not order-of-magnitude slower; I’ve seen cases where a pl/python function outperforms its pl/pgsql counterpart.</p>
<p>So, what is special about Python functions inside Postgres? In my experience so far there are three big reasons to use it.</p>
<p>Python modules</p>
<p>The ability to wield any of Python’s built-in or loadable modules inside Postgres brings great power. That entails great responsibility, as the Python extension is “untrusted” (that’s the ‘u’ in ‘plpython3u’) and can do anything Python can do on the host system: read and write files, make network requests.</p>
<p>Here’s one of my favorite examples so far. Given a set of rows that count daily or weekly annotations for users in a group — so for weekly accounting each row has 52 columns — the desired result for the whole group is the element-wise sum of the rows. That’s not an easy thing in SQL but it’s trivial using numpy, and in pl/python it happens at database speed because there’s no need to transfer SQL results to an external Python program.</p>
<p>Metaprogramming</p>
<p>Functions can write and then run SQL queries. It’s overkill for simple variable interpolation; as shown above pl/pgsql does that handily without the cognitive overhead and visual clutter of poking values into a SQL string. For more advanced uses that compose queries from SQL fragments, though, pl/pgsql is hopeless. You can do that kind of thing far more easily, and more readably, in Python.</p>
<p>Introspection</p>
<p>A pl/python function can discover and use its own name. That’s the key enabler for a mechanism that memoizes the results of a function by creating a materialized view whose name combines the name of the function with the value of a parameter to the function. This technique has proven to be wildly effective.</p>
<p>I’ll show examples of these scenarios in later installments of this series. For now I just want to explain why I’ve found these two ways of writing Postgres functions to be usefully complementary. The key points are:</p>
<p>– They share a common type system.</p>
<p>– pl/pgsql, despite its crusty old syntax, suffices for many things.</p>
<p>– pl/python leverages Python’s strengths where they are most strategic</p>
<p>When I began this journey it wasn’t clear when you’d prefer one over the other, or why it might make sense to use both in complementary ways. This installment is what I’d like to have known when I started.</p>

<p>Suppose you’re a member of a team that runs a public web service. You need to help both internal and external users make sense of all the data that’s recorded as it runs. That’s been my role for the past few years, now it’s time to summarize what I’ve learned.</p>
<p>The web service featured in this case study is the Hypothesis web annotation system. The primary database, Postgres, stores information about users, groups, documents, courses, and annotations. Questions that our team needs to answer include:</p>
<p>– How many students created annotations last semester?</p>
<p>– In how many courses at each school?</p>
<p>Questions from instructors using Hypothesis in their courses include:</p>
<p>– Which passages in course readings are attracting highlights and discussion?</p>
<p>– Who is asking questions about those passages, and who is responding?</p>
<p>Early on we adopted a tool called Metabase that continues to be a pillar of our analytics system. When Metabase was hooked up to our Postgres database the team could start asking questions without leaning on developers. Some folks used the interactive query builder, while others went straight to writing SQL that Metabase passes through to Postgres.</p>
<p>Before long we had a large catalog of Metabase questions that query Postgres and display results as tables or charts that can be usefully arranged on Metabase dashboards. It’s all nicely RESTful. Interactive elements that can parameterize queries, like search boxes and date pickers, map to URLs. Queries can emit URLs in order to compose themselves with other queries. I came to see this system as a kind of lightweight application server in which to incubate an analytics capability that could later be expressed more richly.</p>
<p>Over time, and with growing amounts of data, early success with this approach gave way to two kinds of frustration: queries began to choke, and the catalog of Metabase questions became unmanageable. And so, in the time-honored tradition, we set up a data warehouse for analytics. Ours is another instance of Postgres that syncs nightly with the primary database. There are lots of other ways to skin the cat but it made sense to leverage ops experience with Postgres and I had a hunch that it would do well in this role.</p>
<p>To unthrottle the choking queries I began building materialized views that cache the results of Postgres queries. Suppose a query makes use of available indexes but still takes a few minutes, or maybe even an hour, to run. It still takes that long to build the corresponding materialized view, but once built other queries can use its results immediately. Metabase questions that formerly included chunks of SQL began reducing to select * from {viewname}.</p>
<p>This process continues to unfold in a highly productive way. Team members may or may not hit a performance wall as they try to use Metabase to answer their questions. When they do, we can convert the SQL text of a Metabase question to a Postgres materialized view that gets immediate results. Such views can join with others, and/or with underlying tables, in SQL SELECT contexts. The views become nouns in a language that expresses higher-order business concepts.</p>
<p>The verbs in this language turned out to be Postgres functions written in the native procedural language, pl/pgsql, and later also in its Python counterpart, pl/python. Either flavor can augment built-in Postgres library functions with user-defined functions that can return simple values, like numbers and strings, but can also return sets that behave in SQL SELECT contexts just like tables and views.</p>
<p>Functions were, at first, a way to reuse chunks of SQL that otherwise had to be duplicated across Metabase questions and Postgres CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW statements. That made it possible to streamline and refactor both bodies of code and sanely maintain them.</p>
<p>To visualize what had now become a three-body system of sources in which Metabase questions, Postgres views, and Postgres functions can call (or link to) one another, I wrote a tool that builds a crosslinked concordance. That made it practical to reason effectively about the combined system.</p>
<p>Along the way I have learned how Postgres, and more broadly <a href="https://modern-sql.com/">modern SQL</a>, in conjunction with a tool like Metabase, can enable a team like ours to make sense of data. There’s plenty to say about the techniques I’ve evolved, and I aim to write them up over time. The details won’t interest most people, but here’s an outcome that might be noteworthy.</p>
<blockquote><p>Team member: I had an idea that will help manage our communication with customers, and I’ve prototyped it in a Metabase question.</p>
<p>Toolsmith: Great! Here’s a Postgres function that encapsulates and refines your SQL. It’s fast enough for now, but if needed we can convert it into a materialized view. Now you can use that function in another Metabase question that projects your SQL across a set of customers that you can select.</p></blockquote>
<p>That interaction forms the basis of a virtuous cycle: The team member formulates a question and does their best to answer it using Metabase; the toolsmith captures the intent and re-expresses it in a higher-level business language; the expanded language enables the team member to go farther in a next cycle.</p>
<p>We recognize this software pattern in the way application programmers who push a system to its limits induce systems programmers to respond with APIs that expand those limits. I suppose it’s harder to see when the application environment is Metabase and the systems environment is Postgres. But it’s the same pattern, and it is powerful.</p>

<p>今日、故あって、銀座のエルメス・ギャラリーでやっているマチュウ・コプランによる展覧会「エキシビジョン・カッティングス」<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2021/07/4810/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-4810" title="Le Forum「エキシビジョン・カッティングス」<br>マチュウ・コプランによる展覧会&amp;#8221;Exhibition Cuttings&amp;#8221; An exhibition by Mathieu Copeland　2021.4.23（金）～7.31（土）<a href=&quot;https://www.hermes.com/jp/ja/story/maison-ginza/forum/210423/&quot;>https://www.hermes.com/jp/ja/story/maison-ginza/forum/210423/</a>">1</a>に行ってきました。アートシーンには全く疎いのですが、前回の東京オリンピックの1964年というと、日本は世界をリードしてたころでなんですね。</p>



<p>大パノラマ展とか<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2021/07/4810/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-4810" title="検索してもあんまり良い情報が出てこないので、「エキシビジョン・カッティングス」に行くのおすすめです。これに続く一連の世界での動きと合わせて勉強できます。ところで、ヨーコ・オノってすごかったんですね。">2</a></p>



<p>普通は画廊での個展は初日は華やかにレセプションとかあるものですが、これは画廊を封鎖して始まり、個展の終わりに封鎖を解いて祝って終わるという反展覧会 Anti-Exhabition。それに続く世界各地でのアートの商業化に対するアンチテーゼの動きを見て、色々考えるところがありました。</p>



<p>それの一つが、あり得たもう一つのオリンピック開会式。</p>



<p>コロナでロックダウンの時期だったんだから、それにふさわしく反開会式 Anti-Opening にして、選手は誰も入場せず、オリンピック村の自室のバルコニーにソーシャルディスタンスで並び、国立競技場にはバッハ会長他オリンピック貴族と関係者だけがいるのをずっと画面半分でTV中継、もう半分ではドローンで宿舎バルコニーを国別に写して回る。音楽はケージの4分33秒でコロナでなくなった方々と、「復興五輪」なんだから10年前の震災で亡くなった方々に黙祷を捧げる。後者に関しては、復興の現状を包み隠さず写す。</p>



<p>オリンピックの最中は、IOC貴族たちにカメラが密着。東京オリンピックとしてのアートタッチのドキュメンタリーを残す。</p>



<p>選手たちが一同に会すのはもちろん閉会式の最後までお預けです。残った人たちだけですが。残らなかった人たちは大スクリーンでバーチャル参加ですね。</p>



<p>最後の最後に誰か象徴的な人（誰が良いですかね）がオリンピック貴族たちを排除してアスリートたちが集まり、商業主義との決別を宣言<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2021/07/4810/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-4810" title="スポーツ団体の資金源がこのへんだから無理は重々承知ですが。">3</a>するとか。LAオリンピック以来ずっとではありますが、今回は特にこれだけ商業主義とアテンションエコノミーの暗黒を見せつけている<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2021/07/4810/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-4810" title="小山田圭吾問題とかのぶみ問題とか、アテンションを取れる人を選ぶという広告代理店的思考ですよね">4</a>オリンピックなのでちょっと妄想してみました。</p>The post <a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2021/07/4810/">あり得たもう一つのオリンピック開会式</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.sakimura.org">@_Nat Zone</a>.

‘hexadaisy layout’ by Darla available at <a href="https://flic.kr/p/e6MH6e">http://www.flickr.com/photos/pedrosz/2040577615</a> under a Attribution 2.0 Generic (CC BY 2.0)&nbsp;license<p>When Open Badges was kicking off ten years ago (<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/5/59/OpenBadges-Working-Paper_012312.pdf">see the original white paper</a>), it was conceived to be a recognition infrastructure for skills attained and achievements accomplished anywhere at any time. Badges could assert skills learned informally, formally, really in any aspect of and through life. It was hoped that recruiters, employers, and others could evaluate the badges to find people who had skills that aligned with the opportunities being offered. It was envisioned they could work like other types of credentials such as degrees and certifications, “but with room for much more granular or diverse skill representation” and available opportunities to capture these&nbsp;skills.</p><p>The infrastructure for this type of recognition system was a format called a digital badge. More than just a digital sticker, the badges would be filled with metadata properties describing the skills and achievements. Then the badges could convey the metadata both as human readable and machine readable content. By having a standard to describe the metadata and how it would be verified, Open Badges became usable in many technologies and contexts. For the most part, this resulted in badges being shared online on issuing platforms and social media — more as a tool for human understanding than one that took full advantage of the potential for machine readability.</p><p>Since then, the ethos of Open Badges, recognizing skills anywhere and anytime, has strengthened. Growth has accelerated, especially in the past few years. IMS Global and Credential Engine’s <a href="http://content.imsglobal.org/badge-count-2020/badge-count-2020/">Badge Count 2020 Report</a> indicated that there’d been an 80% increase in issued badges since 2018. Its use has expanded into more formal institutional contexts, the metadata have evolved, and initiatives have risen around it including the <a href="https://www.openrecognition.org/">Open Recognition Alliance</a>, <a href="https://www.thebadgesummit.com/">Badge Summit</a>, and the <a href="https://www.openskillsnetwork.org/">Open Skills&nbsp;Network</a>.</p><p>Over the years, internet technologies have evolved too and a credential verification model at the W3C called <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> has gained traction. This verification model can be used for any type of credential including passports, drivers licenses, and educational credentials like Open Badges. In fact, members of the Open Badges community helped to write the very first <a href="https://opencreds.org/specs/source/use-cases/">use cases</a> for Verifiable Credentials back in 2018. This was because we knew then that if Open Badges data were to be trusted by apps, they not only needed to be readable by machines, they needed to be verifiable.</p><p>The Verifiable Credential model can provide security and privacy enhancements not yet available to Open Badges. This model gives learners persistent access to their badges increasing the longevity and resilience of credentials that were intended to promote and support lifelong learning. A more secure and universally supported verification model such as Verifiable Credentials enables Open Badges to become the personal skills currency it was originally envisioned to&nbsp;be.</p><p><a href="https://concentricsky.com/">Concentric Sky</a> (<a href="https://info.badgr.com/">Badgr</a>) has offered a <a href="https://github.com/concentricsky/openbadges-specification/blob/feature/ob3/proposals/OBv3p0/Proposal-Open-Badges-3.0.pdf">proposal for a new version of Open Badges</a> that explains what is needed to make it work within the Verifiable Credentials model. The use cases in the proposal provide scenarios where Open Badges are earned and then how they are exchanged. In one use case, a medical professional is able to start her new job sooner because her CME’s can be quickly verified:</p><p>Verifying Continuing Ed: Denise was offered a new job at a hospital as a physician assistant. Before starting, her continuing education training and license to practice needed to be verified. The last time she switched hospitals, the verification process took three weeks. This time, she was able to provide her badges to prove her training and license. Within minutes her credentials were verified and she was issued a new digital staff credential</p><p>In another use case, a career change is facilitated by using verifiable Open Badges to map skills to&nbsp;jobs:</p><p>Mapping Skills: Sid is shifting careers after many years working in construction. In his digital wallet he had several skill badges describing his mastery of several skills in construction but also in teamwork, communication, and organizational skills. Sid also had badges from some courses he’d taken in science and math over the last few years. After he uploaded the skill and course badges from his wallet to a career planning site, he was offered several opportunities to apply for work in software sales and cybersecurity.</p><p>Here’s an example of how an Open Badge as a Verifiable Credential (Open Badges 3.0) exchange could&nbsp;work:</p>  A learner connects to a badge issuing platform with their digital wallet app on their phone or&nbsp;laptop.  Once authenticated, the issuer provides the badge to the learner who puts it in their wallet. The badge data contains cryptographic proof that identifies the issuer and the&nbsp;learner.  A job employment app asks for proof that the applicant has experience with a requirement needed for that&nbsp;role.  The learner presents the job employment app with the badge using the digital wallet app. The job employment app can then verify<br>a. that the learner providing the badge is the recipient of that badge<br>b. that the issuer is the identity that issued the badge, and<br>c. that the badge data has not changed since it was&nbsp;issued.  The verifier responds that the badge is authentic.  <p>In comparison, here’s an Open Badges 2.0&nbsp;flow:</p>  A learner or an organization provides an issuer app with the learner’s email&nbsp;address  The Issuer generates badge data that includes the email address as the recipient identity and sends the earner the badge (typically as a link to a web&nbsp;page)  The earner can share the link on social media, or perhaps with a potential employer or a job application app.  The badge is verified by either<br>a. a human looking at the web page where the badge is hosted or<br>b. the application attempts to retrieve the badge data from a url hosted by the&nbsp;issuer.  <p>The Open Badges 2.0 example depends on the issuer hosting the data and relies on an email address for the learner. The Open Badges 3.0 example is self-contained and doesn’t require the issuer to continue to retain a web hosting provider in order for the credential to remain valid. Instead it uses cryptographic proof to authenticate the badge, the issuer, as well as the learner who earned it. With either example, the learner has a way to proudly share their achievement online but the Open Badges 3.0 method doesn’t rely on that online presence for verification. In fact, the original issuer may no longer exist, but the achievements can still be verified.</p><p>On Monday July 19, we’ll be reviewing the <a href="https://github.com/concentricsky/openbadges-specification/blob/feature/ob3/proposals/OBv3p0/Proposal-Open-Badges-3.0.pdf">Open Badges 3.0 proposal</a> and anyone is invited to join us to learn more.

<p>In The Chess Master and the Computer, Garry Kasparov famously wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The winner was revealed to be not a grandmaster with a state-of-the-art PC but a pair of amateur American chess players using three computers at the same time. Their skill at manipulating and “coaching” their computers to look very deeply into positions effectively counteracted the superior chess understanding of their grandmaster opponents and the greater computational power of other participants. Weak human + machine + better process was superior to a strong computer alone and, more remarkably, superior to a strong human + machine + inferior process.</p></blockquote>
<p>The title of his subsequent TED talk sums it up nicely: Don’t fear intelligent machines. Work with them.</p>
<p>That advice resonates powerfully as I begin a second work week augmented by GitHub Copilot, a coding assistant based on OpenAI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-3). Here is Copilot’s tagline: “Your AI pair programmer: get suggestions for whole lines or entire functions right inside your editor.” If you’re not a programmer, a good analogy is Gmail’s offer of suggestions to finish sentences you’ve begun to type.</p>
<p>In mainstream news the dominant stories are about copyright (“Copilot doesn’t respect software licenses”), security (“Copilot leaks passwords”), and quality (“Copilot suggests wrong solutions”). Tech Twitter amplifies these and adds early hot takes about dramatic Copilot successes and flops. As I follow these stories, I’m thinking of another. GPT-3 is an intelligent machine. How can we apply Kasparov’s advice to work effectively with it?</p>
<p>Were I still a tech journalist I’d be among the first wave of hot takes. Now I spend most days in Visual Studio Code, the environment in which Copilot runs, working most recently on analytics software. I don’t need to produce hot takes, I can just leave Copilot running and reflect on notable outcomes.</p>
<p>Here was the first notable outcome. In the middle of writing some code I needed to call a library function that prints a date. In this case the language context was Python, but might as easily have been JavaScript or SQL or shell. Could I memorize the date-formatting functions for all these contexts? Actually, yes, I believe that’s doable and might even be beneficial. But that’s a topic for another day. Let’s stipulate that we can remember a lot more than we think we can. We’ll still need to look up many things, and doing a lookup is a context-switching operation that often disrupts flow.</p>
<p>In this example I would have needed a broad search to recall the name of the date-formatting function that’s available in Python: strftime. Then I’d have needed to search more narrowly to find the recipe for printing a date object in a format like Mon Jan 01. A good place for that search to land is <a href="https://strftime.org/">https://strftime.org/</a>, where Will McCutchen has helpfully summarized several dozen directives that govern the strftime function.</p>
<p>Here’s the statement I needed to write:</p>
<p>day = day.strftime('%a %d %b')</p>
<p>Here’s where the needed directives appear in the documentation:</p>
<p></p>
<p>To prime Copilot I began with a comment:</p>
<p># format day as Mon Jun 15</p>
<p>Copilot suggested the exact strftime incantation I needed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is exactly the kind of example-driven assistance that I was hoping <a href="https://twitter.com/GitHubCopilot?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@githubcopilot</a> would provide. Life's too short to remember, or even look up, strptime and strftime.</p>
<p>(It turns out that June 15 was a Tuesday, that doesn't matter, Mon Jun 15 was just an example.) <a href="https://t.co/a1epnaZRF9">pic.twitter.com/a1epnaZRF9</a></p>
<p>— Jon Udell (@judell) <a href="https://twitter.com/judell/status/1412111420561367059?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 5, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Now it’s not hard to find a page like Will’s, and once you get there it’s not hard to pick out the needed directives. But when you’re in the flow of writing a function, avoiding that context switch doesn’t only save time. There is an even more profound benefit: it conserves attention and preserves flow.</p>
<p>The screencast embedded in the above tweet gives you a feel for the dynamic interaction. When I get as far as # format day as M, Copilot suggests MMDDYYY even before I write Mon, then adjusts as I do that. This tight feedback loop helps me explore the kinds of natural examples I can use to prime the system for the lookup.</p>
<p>For this particular pattern I’m not yet getting the same magical result in JavaScript, SQL, or shell contexts, but I expect that’ll change as Copilot watches me and others try the same example and arrive at the analogous solutions in these other languages.</p>
<p>I’m reminded of <a href="http://jonudell.net/udell/gems/delicious/delicious.html">Language evolution with del.icio.us</a>, from 2005, in which I explored the dynamics of the web’s original social bookmarking system. To associate a bookmarked resource with a shared concept you’d assign it a tag broadly used for that concept. Of course the tags we use for a given concept often vary. Your choice of cinema or movie or film was a way to influence the set of resources associated with your tag, and thus encourage others to use the same tag in the same way.</p>
<p>That kind of linguistic evolution hasn’t yet happened at large scale. I hope Copilot will become an environment in which it can. Intentional use of examples is one way to follow Kasparov’s advice for working well with intelligent systems.</p>
<p>Here’s a contrived Copilot session that suggests what I mean. The result I am looking for is the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].<br>
<code><br>
l1 = [1, 2, 3]<br>
l2 = [3, 4, 5]<br>
# merge the two lists<br>
l3 = l1 + l2 # no: [1, 2, 3, 3, 5]<br>
# combine as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br>
l3 = l1 + l2 # no: [1, 2, 3, 3, 5]<br>
# deduplicate the two lists<br>
l1 = list(set(l1)) # no: [1, 2, 3]<br>
# uniquely combine the lists<br>
l3 = list(set(l1) | set(l2))  # yes: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br>
# merge and deduplicate the lists<br>
l3 = list(set(l1 + l2)) # yes: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br>
</code></p>
<p>The last two Copilot suggestions are correct; the final (and simplest) one would be my choice. If I contribute that choice to a public GitHub repository am I voting to reinforce an outcome that’s already popular? If I instead use the second comment (combine as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) am I instead voting for a show-by-example approach (like Mon Jun 15) that isn’t yet as popular in this case but might become so? It’s hard for me — and likely even for Copilot itself — to know exactly how Copilot works. That’s going to be part of the challenge of working well with intelligent machines. Still, I hope for (and mostly expect) a fruitful partnership in which our descriptions of intent will influence the mechanical synthesis even as it influences our descriptions.</p>

 Core issue with crypto / stable-coins <p>The biggest unsolved issue with crypto&nbsp;is</p>  its abuse as facilitator of ransomeware / extortion — causing continuous tightening of regulations.  Pseudo-anonymous money laundering that causes traceable risks to Banks (unlike cash which is completely anonymous) — causing <a href="https://www.state.gov/de-risking/">“de-risking”</a> and therefore resulting in extreme and continuous friction for crypto to go mainstream.  <p>Due to the irreversible nature of crypto-currencies together with pseudo-anonymous traceability of dirty money, banks face unlimited risk in serving as on-ramps or off-ramps to&nbsp;crypto.</p> US-banking grade KYC at a global level is not possible with current technology   Identity document can be tampered or stolen — any document can be photoshopped. There is no global database of “photos/biometric” and therefore it is possible to create fake/stolen identities easily.  Impersonation checks don’t exist — There is a 15% error rate in verifying peoples faces with hi-resolution photos in passports by trained immigration professionals in a physical setting. Matching a digital photo with scanned ID by untrained staff or even AI is just no possible.  Address checks don’t exist — There is no global method to verify current address of a given person. Any utility bill can be photoshopped or&nbsp;stolen.  <p>Current Gold standard for digital on-boarding is bank verification by linking your account or verifying test-deposits of few cents in your bank but it only works domestically.</p>  The issue is that this kind of linking of accounts is not possible internationally over a swift&nbsp;network.  The alternative solutions like Plaid do not give global coverage and only work in core few developed countries.  <p>In current scenario— Banks in most countries like switzerland, singapore, UK etc require physical visits or otherwise extremely cumbersome Notary / appostille of documents to even open non-crypto accounts.</p> DIRO is a fundamental new technology <p>that eliminates these bottlenecks not just for crypto-currencies but horizontally for many traditional industries.</p>  Makes Global impersonation check possible — it is the first breakthrough technology that not only turns each and every institutional / government/ corporate website into an identity authenticator. This new technology extends the Gold standard (like Plaid) for US-banking grade identity verification at a global&nbsp;scale.  Makes Global address check possible — can verify any current utility bill from any country, any language, any company be it Telephone, Gas, Electricity, TV, Internet, Municipal taxes or&nbsp;even  100% global coverage — without the need for any third party cooperation/ APIs or agreements.  100% guaranteed — DIRO leverages the time tested and battle tested SSL/TLS technology and blockchain to generate mathematically provable and court-admissible evidence. The documents produced using DIRO are even stronger than physical originals.  <p>Privacy and data protection — The documents produced by DIRO are not only reportable and audit-able by third-parties and regulators but also provide decentralised verification on blockchain (without the typical “phone-home privacy problem”). The access to global private data behind login and passwords are accessed by the USER under is GDPR right to access his own data while automatically providing consent for verification to&nbsp;proceed.</p>

    What is NEW in this article about decision making? <p>The new part explains the relationship between choices, decisions and judgement and how our questions indicate if our relationship is curious and constructive OR linear, framed, and destructive.&nbsp; This article is part of a <a href="https://www.digital20.com/masterclass">masterclass</a> I have been creating on how we, as directors and those in leadership, can improve our choices, decisions and judgements using data and be better ancestors.&nbsp;</p><p>This article is not another self-help or “use this framework to improve decision making”; it is for the curious and those who ask questions on their journey. The refelction at the end should be "How does this article affect our views on the automation of decision making and the use of AI?"</p> Why is this an important topic? <p>Our individual and unique view of the world comprises layers of constructs created by our personality, biases, preferences, facts, and ideas learnt from past experiences.&nbsp; These constructs are better known as “mental models”, which frame how we individually make sense of or align to the world. We continually develop sense-making frameworks, models, and maps in our brains that frame what we perceive as reality, thus affecting our behaviour and, consequently, our Choices, decisions, and Judgments (CDJ).</p><p>Whilst we don’t like it, our mental model frames how we see the world.&nbsp; I love how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Kozyrkov">Cassie Kozyrkov</a> (chief decision-maker at Google) describes in this <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/statistics-are-you-bayesian-or-frequentist-4943f953f21b">article</a> using the toss of a coin to determine how you see the world.&nbsp; Statistics predict one aspect of chance but not how you perceive the results when the coin has landed, and the outcome is known but not to you. My dad taught me to toss the coins a few more times until I got the result I wanted. It was a reinforcement model that I had made the right decision from the possible two choices.&nbsp; I would also suggest following and reading <a href="https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com/">Lisa Feldman Barrett</a> work, especially her new book “<a href="https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com/books/seven-and-a-half-lessons-about-the-brain/">seven and a half lessons about the brain</a>.” She says that we must grasp that everything we perceive as reality is, in fact, constructed from fragments, and we have no idea what reality really is.&nbsp; (yes, this is reinforcement bias - I am quoting things to frame you that align to my model)</p><p>In our digital era, new uncertainty, <a href="https://opengovernance.net/quantum-risk-a-wicked-problem-that-emerges-at-the-boundaries-of-our-data-dependency-2dc36dfb21fb">quantum risk</a>, and more ambiguity constantly challenge our <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-occurs-when-physical-beings-transition-to-information-beings-146ea9dcbca3">mental models</a> and how we accommodate and make sense.&nbsp; The volume of <a href="https://opengovernance.net/the-shadowy-hierarch-5780154de92">noise and signals</a> coming into our brains is high, but we filter and convert it all into something that has meaning to each of us according to our own unique mental model.&nbsp; We all reach different interpretations about what is happening, which creates frustration, confusion and misalignment. We use questions to clarify and check our understanding, assumptions and quality of information. Slight differences always remain; the unsaid, mislead, guided, incentivised, and overconfidence, unfortunately, takes us from the simple to correct misalignments; to tension, conflict and entrenchment.</p><p>This topic matters as directors are mandated to make decisions, but we find we are operating with misalignments, tensions, compromises, and outright conflict.&nbsp; This happens as the <a href="https://opengovernance.net/power-agency-and-influence-a-new-framework-about-complex-relationships-73f5e97295ef">individuals sitting at the same table have agency</a> (and their own mental models and incentives). We are unsure if we have the right choices or are clear about our judgment’s unintended consequences or long-term impact. We have to talk about it.&nbsp;</p><p>We should unpack our relationship with choice, decision and judgement as mental models, hierarchy and rules constrain us. This article is not about “how to ask better questions”, nor if you should (as some questions we don’t want the answer to), but how to determine if you, your team or your company has a constructive or destructive relationship with CDJ.&nbsp;</p><p>---</p><p>When talking about CDJ, you would imagine that in 2021 that starting from the definitions should help, but it does not, as there is a recursive loop of using one definition to define the other words, which define themselves.&nbsp; Amazingly there are professional bodies for <a href="https://www.decisionprofessionals.com/">decision making</a> and <a href="http://www.sjdm.org/">judgement</a>; alas, even these cannot agree on how to define or clearly demark between intent and actions. Our base problem is that:&nbsp; everything framed with a maths or data mind: is a decision. Everything is a choice when framed by a psychologist or social scientist. To someone who has authority and responsibility or plays with complexity, everything looks like a judgment.&nbsp; Confusingly everything is an opinion to a judge!</p><br><p>Everything framed with a maths or data mind: is a decision.

It was likely adapted from an early human bias where leadership in war and battles refused to change their mind even when the facts were in, and they had been proven wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>Choices, decisions and judgement are not difficult if you relinquish your values, ethics and blindly follow the incentives or can fully appreciate the impact of your actions. Still, we know it is just not that simple. We have heuristics to remove choice rather than create more and ways to find more data and facts to become more informed, but without knowing if the new data is helpful or not.&nbsp; Ultimately, at some point, you have to make a choice, decision or judgement.&nbsp;</p><p>The diagram below represents some of the timeless challenges of CDJ, which is a balance between what we know and don’t know.&nbsp; We have the experience that creates the ghosts of the past, flighting the voices of the present as we try to decide what the spirits of the future hold, whilst being held accountable for the decisions we make.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The point here is that it is always possible to find a reason why to act or not to act and the timeless challenge remains that there is no perfect choice, decision or judgment.&nbsp; However, over time and because we have choices we can make decisions that improve our judgement which means we can find and select the right choices.&nbsp; This is a constructive relationship between CDJ.&nbsp; A destructive relationship would be to not like the choices we face, procrastinate in the hope a better choice occurs or maybe lose a choice where the decision is made for you. You don’t improve your judgment and so you cannot determine if the next choice is any better - it is linear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Is the CDJ relationship about framing? <p>From the definition section at the beginning of this article, it was evident that there is a high degree of overlap and dependency between choice, decision and judgment.&nbsp; As highlighted in the previous section it can become complex very quickly but our brain (mental models) demand patterns to make sense of it and so we tend to come back to simple linear narratives which do not do them (choice, decisions, judgment) justice. What we have realised but tend not to verbalise is that none of our (mental) models or frameworks work in all cases and indeed all models about choice, decision and judgment fail.&nbsp; This is why there is always a new book on the topic with new self-help content that you have not seen before, and we cling to a hope that the next model will work better - alas they don’t. I am aware of over 100 decision support models and I expect I have not really scratched the surface. &nbsp; An example below puts choice, decision and judgment on a continuum between your own north star and that for a shared tribe, community or society.&nbsp; It does not really work.&nbsp; White flag time.&nbsp;</p><p>What we have realised but tend not to verbalise is that none of our (mental) models or frameworks work in all cases and indeed all models about choice, decision and judgment fail.</p><br><p></p><p>#Lockdowns have enabled many social experiments.&nbsp; One has been about choice and buying behaviour.&nbsp; As we moved our shopping for food online and therefore missed the in store sale specials, end of gondea, carefully placed items next to each other, those large piled up offers in the entrance and the sweets at the exit, our patterns have changed as choice became limited.&nbsp; We became creatures of habit, buying largely the same items, which reduce in variance over time.&nbsp; (This also highlights that the UI and UX for shopping sucks.)&nbsp; The decision to shop was removed from us, and our choices fell, but the variety was still there.&nbsp; So much for the Web creating perfect information or the algorithm knowing what you would want.&nbsp;</p><p>As an alternative, we can determine that CDJ will change depending on the context right now and the perception those facing the issue have.&nbsp; The figure below highlights three examples but what we rapidly conclude is that complexity in CDJ is generated by speed, volume, consequences, data, sense of enquiry, situation and our own mental models. Every known variable adds layers.</p><p></p><br> Where are we up to and where next? <p>So far, we have explored that there is a relationship between choices, decisions and judgements. We, however, tend to focus on one of them (decision making) as it looks the most difficult, and the others are just linkages. However, this preference for “decision making” fails to understand if we are using the right word to describe the action we are taking. There is no doubt that the word decision is preferable as it is perceived as more powerful and important than choice or judgment. The relationship between them is causal, complex and relational, and we are framed, educated and incentivised to the simple linear view and a single narrative. The reality is that judgement helps frame our choices which we decide on that improve our judgment skills — they are not linear; they are circular. They are circular as we all have agency.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;The reality is that judgement helps frame our choices, which we decide on, that improve our judgment skills</p><p></p><p>We know the linear models are broken as there is no universal tool to help with choice, decision and judgement.&nbsp; The next part is to explain the relationship we have between choices, decisions and judgement and how our questions indicate if it is constructive and curious OR linear, framed and destructive.</p><p>We tend to focus on the decision and choice axis. If we can eliminate bad choices we can improve decisions, but ignore the fact that it is judgment skills that help find the right choice. Procrastination as a decision tool is framed that time will remove choice and so a decision becomes easier, either because a choice has been removed or more data supports one option. More data does not make decision-making easier; nor does it guarantee to make it better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Worthy of note is that academic work about “decision-making” will always seek to create the most complex solution because academics are incentivised to use the most advanced and new thinking (publication, referencing, research and reputation). Sometimes tossing a coin is the perfect solution. &nbsp; The more we see the complex, the less we will accept the simple.&nbsp; In a linear world where we view choice, decision and judgment as a progression line, where we are given choices when young and make a judgement when we are old and wise ignore that we learn and need to exercise all three all the time to become more proficient at decision making.&nbsp; Decision making is not a task or an end game.&nbsp;</p><p>As a thought experiment: if you had all the <a href="https://opengovernance.net/data-for-better-decisions-nature-or-nurture-79e6531dbe3a">data</a> in the world and all the compute power possible to run a perfect forecast model, would you need to make further choices, decisions or judgments?&nbsp; To reach your view I assume you have decided to either give each human full <a href="https://opengovernance.net/power-agency-and-influence-a-new-framework-about-complex-relationships-73f5e97295ef">agency</a> or you have taken our individual <a href="https://opengovernance.net/power-agency-and-influence-a-new-framework-about-complex-relationships-73f5e97295ef">agency</a> away.&nbsp; Now in my definition of data, which might be different to yours, how we all behave with our agency is just data, which opens up a can of worms for each of us. Can you have full agency (freewill) and it all still be modelled? What do we mean about behavioural modelling, agency, data and even more precisely <a href="https://medium.com/mydata/data-is-data-e2a877cb206b">all data</a>?</p><p>Getting to one data set, one tool, one choice hides layers of complexity which looks good for one better decision but is unlikely to be a long term solution to improving choices, decisions and judgment.&nbsp; You have/had choice, you make/made decisions, you exhibit/exercise judgment.&nbsp; Judgement supports you in finding choices.&nbsp;</p> How the questions we ask inform us!&nbsp; <p>The questions you are currently asking will help inform you where you are in the cycle, indeed if you already have closed the loop and have a constructive cycle or a linear open loop distructure relationship with choice, decisions and judgment.&nbsp;</p><p>The circular framing means depending on the stage we are in a process we will be asking different questions.&nbsp; Given that a board has to deal with many situations all at different stages at every meeting, we should see all these questions asked at every meeting, just framed to different agenda items.&nbsp; If there is no variation in questions,&nbsp; surely it tells us something.&nbsp; Indeed are we using our improvement at each stage to further improve the next outcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The destructive “cycle” is not circular but is a linear model as it is fundamentally disconnected from a learning based idea using choice and judgement and focussed on Better Decision making. It depends on the idea that by reading a new book or going on a new decision making course that we will get better.&nbsp; The iteration of improvement is an external influence.&nbsp; Perhaps it is mentoring or coaching and they (mentors) keep you from closing the loop as they either don’t know or it would not support their business model. Indeed books, education and courses have no interest in you closing the loop and always making you believe in a new tool, method, process - it is their business model!</p><p></p><p>In the boardroom or in the senior management meetings is someone always asking the same questions?&nbsp; Does the agenda mean that as a team individuals are unable to ask different questions or is it that others are influencing the agenda to keep it framed to the decisions and outcomes they want.&nbsp; Why enable the asking for more data when the choice they want you to decide on and agree with is already the best supported case (<a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/the-railroad-of-no-choice-a55420cea06f">railroaded</a>).&nbsp; Do you have observers or assessors who look at the questions you ask as a team and determine if you are asking the right questions? (something I am learning to do)&nbsp; Can skills in choice, decision and judgment be determined by the questions asked in the meetings? (something I am exploring)</p><p>A key question I often come back to when thinking about choice, decisions and judgment is “What are we optimising for?” I find the model below a helpful guide to understand the framing.&nbsp; In a linear model it would present moving from single choice in the lower left to complex judgment in the top right. In a learning cyclic model, choice, decision and judgement equally applies, however the lower left is a better learning and experience gaining context for mentoring, or succession planning, than the top right.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Why does this matter, because right now we have increasing data along with more vulnerabilities, ambiguity, complexity and uncertainty. The volume of moving variables (change) and the rate of change breaks the linear model as you can never match the model at hand to the situation you face.&nbsp; There is a need to move from linear ideas of choice, decisions and judgment to a circular one.&nbsp; Linear thinking is the best model when there are limited options and there is stability.&nbsp; We now have many options, increasing variables and more instability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As your <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-99-of-the-public-and-95-of-venture-and-investment-capital-have-got-wrong-69239b4da4f1">company is owned by no-one</a> (yes you read that right - follow this <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-99-of-the-public-and-95-of-venture-and-investment-capital-have-got-wrong-69239b4da4f1">link</a> if you need to read more on this, a company owns itself) and a company cannot think for itself and therefore we (the directors) have to do the thinking for it.&nbsp; We are given in law the authority and responsibility to act on behalf of the company.&nbsp; This is “fiduciary duty”.&nbsp; It is the reason why directors need to move from a linear perspective of decision making to a circular improvement learning process of choice, decision making and judgement.</p><p>My proposal to help support better governance is that we request companies publish the questions asked in a board meeting. Not the answers, but definitely the questions.</p><br>

          <p>In those first 100 days, it will become evident if you are about to be railroaded or if you have to present the choice without creating railroading for those data laggards. The latter being the job, the former being a problem.</p>      <p>To be clear, railroaded means in this context:</p>  to force&nbsp;something&nbsp;to be officially approved or accepted without much discussion or thought.  to force&nbsp;someone&nbsp;into doing something quickly, usually without enough information.  <p>As the CDO, are you about to find that the tracks have already been laid and that you on the train and it is going in one direction. You are now the figurehead of the new shinny data plan based on already accepted wisdom. Your hope, before starting the role, is that it is more analogous to a personal transport situation. This would be where you get to pick the fuel (food, combustible), vehicle (walk, run, bike, motorcycle, car, van, lorry, aeroplane, boat), the destination and the route. Using the analogy of the train on the tracks, the decision to create a data-led organisation, the ontology, the data we have and the value we will create has been made irrespective of what you come up with, or what the data might be able to tell you. The processes are in place, and your role is not to craft, invest, create or imagine but to follow the tracks of command and control. It is at that moment that you realise just how good the CEO is at sales.</p><p>In this case, your priorities are: How to find the right tools that align or match what you are faced with? And, how do you take a senior leadership team and fellow directors on a journey to discover that they can change the rails, change the vehicle and be open to changing how we see the journey from A to B? Indeed based on a pandemic, do we need to physically move at all?</p><p>When the “railroaded” is you and you are being asked to approve something when you have not had the time or opportunity to gather the data or understand the processes, what are the right words to create time to explore and not appear indecisive, trying to procrastinate or evasive?</p><blockquote><p>what are the right words to create time to explore so as not to appear indecisive, trying to procrastinate or evasive?</p></blockquote><p>Presenting an argument about why you need more time is likely to fail, as the defensive response will always be “we have already done the work but it is your decision — trust us” Asking questions that check that the choices and opinions are the right ones or to determine the consequences will equally draw you into an argument where “the facts are the facts,” you have to decide or do you not trust us?</p><p>One question that will give some breathing space is “For what are we optimising,” as explored below.</p>          <p>The two-axis on the model set the horizontal scale of the short and long term against the vertical axis how many variables, from one to many. In asking the question “for what are we optimising,” you are not presenting this framework, but use the question to understand what the “railroading” is trying to achieve; through understanding what the decision being expected is optimising for. With this knowledge, you may find it is easier to take the railroaded decision. If you can conclude they are optimising for many externalities and long term, you are immersed in a team that can cope and manage complexity- this is going to be fun. If this is short term and a single variable you know that incentives are the significant driver and slowly changing the incentives will create a better place for making more complex data decisions. One scenario is outside of this framing which is that they actually don’t know what they are optimising for and the decision at hand is just another reaction to previous poor railroaded decisions. Definitely a red flag moment.</p> Note to the CEO <p>Using railroading as an activity to discover an individuals capability and backbone is always likely to go wrong. In this data-driven complex world where both the data and the analysis is a long way from your immediate access, you may also feel you are being railroaded by the signals and noise. It is likely you will ask “is this recommendation optimising for xyz (the plan you have agreed to) and how can you show this is the optimal path&nbsp;without&nbsp;using the same data” Love the misattributed quote that Ronald Reagan stole from the Russians but so can we.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_verify">Trust, but verify.</a></p>

<p>Today I finished up a tool that you can use to export your complete history from Foursquare and publish the checkins to your website!</p>

<p>In 2017, I created <a href="https://ownyourswarm.p3k.io">OwnYourSwarm</a> to export my future Swarm checkins to my website in real-time. It's been working great, and it's meant that I have had a complete archive of all my checkins on my website ever since then, so I don't have to worry if Foursquare disappears one day. However, I never got around to creating a way to export my past checkins, so I was always missing my checkin history from 2009-2016.</p>

<p>I had been considering building this as a feature of OwnYourSwarm, but realized that it would end up taking a lot of additional effort to make it work well as a web service, in addition to dealing with possible rate limit issues with the Foursquare API. So instead, this is published as a downloadable script you can run on your own computer. This also means you have a bit more flexibility in how you can use it, as well as being able to customize it more if you choose.</p>

<p>You can download the code from GitHub here:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/aaronpk/Swarm-Checkins-Import">https://github.com/aaronpk/Swarm-Checkins-Import</a></p>

<p>The readme has installation and usage instructions, so I'll refrain from repeating all that in this post. Make sure to check out the step by step tutorial in the readme if you want to use this with your own account.</p>

<p>The process is broken up into a couple steps.</p>

 
 First, it downloads your entire Foursquare checkin history to JSON files on your computer 
 Second, it downloads all the photos from your checkins 
 Third, it publishes each checkin to your website via <a href="https://micropub.net">Micropub</a> 
 

<p>If your website doesn't support checkins via Micropub, or if you don't want your checkins on your website at all, you can just skip that step entirely, and instead you'll have a complete export of your data locally.</p>

<p>The JSON files contain the raw API response from Foursquare, so you can do what you want with that as well, such as turning it into your own HTML archive using your own custom tools if you want.</p>

<p>The one issue that I don't have a good solution for is handling renamed venues. Unfortunately the API returns the current name for old checkins, so if a venue is renamed, your old checkins will not reflect the name at the time of the checkin. This is particularly strange for businesses that have gone through an acquisition or rebranding, since for example all my old checkins in Green Dragon are now labeled as Rogue Eastside Brewery. As far as I can tell there isn't a good way to handle this, so I may have to go back and manually edit the posts on my website for the venues I know have been renamed.</p>

<p>I hope this is useful to people! I will be sleeping a little easier now knowing that my old checkin history is safely archived on my website now!</p>

<p>At MATTR we’re always dreaming up ways to make decentralized identity and verifiable credentials easy and intuitive to use for as many people as possible.</p><p>From the start, it’s been a core part of our mission to make sure that end users understand the implications of decentralized identity and the control it affords them over their data and their privacy. This model offers users greater sovereignty over their own information by empowering individuals as both the holder and subject of information that pertains to them. Users are able to exercise their new role in this ecosystem by utilizing a new class of software known as <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/digital-wallets">digital&nbsp;wallets</a>.</p><p>We first released our <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/onboarding/install/wallet">Mobile Wallet</a> for smartphones in June 2020, with a simple user interface to allow people to interact with and receive credentials from issuers as well as present credentials to relying parties. In the interim, we have developed a number of improvements and features to the Mobile Wallet to support advanced capabilities such&nbsp;as:</p>  Authenticating to Identity Providers over OpenID Connect to receive credentials via OIDC&nbsp;Bridge  Deriving privacy-preserving selective disclosure presentations from credentials using BBS+ signatures  Establishing a secure DID messaging inbox for users to receive encrypted messages and push notifications  <p>These changes have not only made the wallet more functional; they’ve also evolved to better protect users’ best interests — giving them privacy-by-design and surfacing the information and context that they need to confidently make decisions underpinned by the security of decentralized identity.</p>Timeline of MATTR wallet development<p>This journey has led us to realize the importance of creating a wallet experience that places users front and center. As these systems create more opportunity for user-driven consent and identity management, they’ve simultaneously created a demand for a wallet that can not only perform the technical operations required, but do so in a user-friendly way that surfaces the information that truly matters to people. Our latest feature release to the MATTR Mobile Wallet is a step in this direction.</p><p>With Human-Friendly Credentials, we have added the capability to render different kinds of credentials uniquely in the wallet interface according to the information they contain. Until now, the end user experience for verifiable credentials has been largely consistent across different categories of credentials and issuers. In other words, a credential containing medical data from your doctor looks exactly the same as an education credential from your university or a concert ticket from a music venue: they all appear to the user as a long list of&nbsp;claims.</p><p>In this release we change that. Thanks to the semantic information encoded in verifiable credentials, the wallet is now able to understand and interpret certain kinds of credentials to render them to the user in a way that makes the data easier to understand.</p><p><a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/semantic-web#json-ld">JSON-LD</a> verifiable credentials have the ability to support common data vocabularies and schemas which are published on the web. For example, if a credential contains a claim describing the name of an individual, the claim can be defined via reference to an existing data vocabulary found here: <a href="https://schema.org/Person">https://schema.org/Person</a></p><p>Human-Friendly Credentials allow the wallet to start intelligently displaying known credential types and data types. This shows up in a variety of different ways in a user’s&nbsp;dataset.</p><p>For example, this update formats address fields to make them more readable; formats names and proper nouns where possible; makes URLs, telephone numbers and email addresses clickable; highlights images and icons for better trust and brand signaling; and creates basic rules for language localization that adjust to a user’s device settings. This logic allows the wallet to create a kind of information hierarchy that starts to draw out the important aspects of data included in a credential, so users can make trust-based decisions using this information.</p><p>These rules are applied to any kind of credential the wallet encounters. Whilst all of this is incredibly helpful for users, we have gone a step further: displaying entire credentials in a completely unique UI according to their type. The ‘type’ property of a credential expresses what kind of information is in the credential — is it a degree, a medical record, a utility bill? The usage of common credential types across different implementations and ecosystems is necessary for semantic interoperability on the broader scale. The wallet should be able to recognize these common credential types and display them to the user in a friendly&nbsp;way.</p><p>In this update, we have added custom rendering for both Personal Identity Credentials as well as Education Courses. These are common types we see occurring naturally across the decentralized identity landscape, and now the MATTR Mobile Wallet is able to recognize and display them properly.</p>Personal Identity Credentials and Education Course credentials<p>An important note to consider is that Human-Friendly Credentials only work for known data and credential types. As the ecosystem matures, we expect to add more data types and credential types in the future to support an even broader set of human-related processes and actions. In a general sense, we will also continue to iterate on our digital wallet offerings to provide a greater degree of flexibility and control for end users. We believe it’s a vital component to a healthy digital trust ecosystem.</p><p>To check out these changes yourself, download the latest version of our <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/onboarding/install/wallet">Mobile Wallet</a> to get&nbsp;started.</p><p>For more information on Human-Friendly Credentials, check out our tutorials and video content on MATTR&nbsp;Learn.</p><p>For everything else related to MATTR, visit <a href="https://mattr.global">https://mattr.global</a> or follow <a href="https://twitter.com/mattrglobal">@MattrGlobal on&nbsp;Twitter</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/rendering-credentials-in-a-human-friendly-way-e47f4a32fd4b">Rendering credentials in a human-friendly way</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  A Sovereign Nation is only capable of two structural models of participation; <br>  1. Database model - data plantation based on possession of ID assets structured as liabilities&nbsp;  <br>  2. Self-Sovereign model - root authority at edges, admin verification mechanism at center.  <br>  In order for #2 to live in the world, a recursive signatory from one generation to the next authenticating the structural model of participation and Rights is required.&nbsp;  <br>  In America, John Hancock serves as our muse when considering the structure of Sovereign authority and the ID/signatory of participation within civil Society. The source of authority demonstrated by John Hancock and his peers in signing the "Declaration of Independence" had a personal origin. These people all put their personal lives, security, fortunes and reputations on the line, literally, and there was no authentication system in place when they did so. In essence, they used a personal relationship network to validate their own personal <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2012/02/what-is-sovereign-source-authority.html">Sovereign source authority</a> to declare anything meaningful in nascent Sovereign Terms.  <br>  You, as an American citizen, are no less than these people. Unless, of course, you Agree to participate in an ID/signatory based system of Rights without holding the system accountable to enforce your own participatory authority.  <br>  American Rights do not resolve from a database or State Trust storing birth certificates. American Rights are for, by, of people, not birth certificates. Of course, in administrative practice, try exercising your personal Rights without these administrative documents, including passports, driver's licenses, social security numbers, etc... which all originate and resolve to an administrative source of authority.  <br>  If you are provisioned authority to act as an American citizen, are you actually an American? Structure yields results in such concerns, and every person who has ever started a corporation and taken responsibility to protect the "corporate veil" from being compromised understands the importance of structural integrity. Unfortunately, the average American citizen does not, and the process of demonstrating America's model of authority is not something that is taught in public schools, funded by American tax payers.  <br>  American authority originates in people, Individuals all. This is not an optional requirement. Any other structural model is literally "un-American", and out of step with Constitutional integrity. Do law schools understand this?  <br>  A recursive signatory serves as the foundation of American ID within all Government-supported administration methods, such that the originating act of "Declaring Independence" is conveyed to every person, every Individual citizen, in the same manner as the founders demonstrated personally.  <br>  The founders of America did not demonstrate one model of American Sovereignty, and then convey a data plantation to everyone else to comply with. Instead, one generation after the next is required to protect the very Institution derived "of, by, for" people, Individuals all, by way of the structural process of inaugurating authentic participation.  <br>  Americans give their personal authority to their Governance. Americans do not receive their authority from their Government. The American people are not the dog of their government, because structurally, the Government is guaranteed to operate as the best friend of the people, Individuals all. This structural process, putting the authority of people before the authority of a bureaucratic Institution is the literal structural integrity differentiating THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA from every other Nation on Earth.  <br>  Generation after generation since America's founding has had their personal Sovereign source authority squandered and mis-represented by an "error of omission" from the structural process of forming an identity with recursive signatory integrity in the administration of American Rights.  <br>  This order of operations failure, putting a false model of <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2013/01/administrative-precedence.html">administrative precedence</a> within a database, is of utmost importance to how American Rights are administered. Without an accurate administrative precedence belonging to people, Individuals all, the Government becomes the keeper of people, rather than people being the keeper of their Governance.  <br>  For some reason, this is not obvious. For some reason, lawyers get this wrong constantly. The concept of a recursive signatory tied to Rights administration exceeds the intellectual grasp of legal managers living on the data plantation they have derived their administrative methods from. This must be repaired, for a Government derived "of, by, for" people, Individuals All.. can not exist otherwise.  <br>  America can not exist in practice without a recursive signatory event tied to Rights administration for every American citizen, giving form and function to the self-Sovereign method of Rights administration that gave life to America, and sustains it to this day.

<p>I recently came out as nonbinary trans-femme.
That's a picture of me on the left, with my spouse Morgan Lemmer-Webber
on the right.</p>
<p>In a sense, not much has changed, and so much has changed.
I've dropped the "-topher" from my name, and given the common tendency
to apply gender to pronouns in English, please either use nonbinary
pronouns or feminine pronouns to apply to me.
Other changes are happening as I wander through this space, from
appearance to other things.
(Probably the biggest change is finally achieving something resembling
self-acceptance, however.)</p>
<p>If you want to know more,
<a href="https://fossandcrafts.org/episodes/30-gender-sexuality-personal-perspective.html">Morgan and I did a podcast episode</a>
which explains more from my present standing, and also explains Morgan's
experiences with being demisexual, which not many people know about!
(Morgan has been incredible through this whole process, by the way.)</p>
<p>But things may change further.
Maybe a year from now those changes may be even more drastic, or maybe
not.
We'll see.
I am wandering, and I don't know where I will land, but it won't be
back to where I was.</p>
<p>At any rate, I've spent much of my life not being able to stand myself
for how I look and feel.
For most of my life, I have not been able to look at myself in a mirror
for more than a second or two due to the revulsion I felt at the person
I saw staring back at me.
The last few weeks have been a shift change for me in that regard...
it's a very new experience to feel so happy with myself.</p>
<p>I'm only at the beginning of this journey.
I'd appreciate your support... people have been incredibly kind to me
by and large so far but like everyone who goes through a process like this,
it's very hard in those experiences where people aren't.
Thank you to everyone who has been there for me so far.</p>

This follows the <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2149">publication of the closely-related second version of the W3C Web Authentication (WebAuthn) specification</a>.</p>
<p>Today’s <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/new-fido-ux-guidelines-and-specification-enhancements/">FIDO Alliance announcement</a> describes the enhancements in the second version as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Enhancements to FIDO standards to accelerate passwordless in the enterprise</p>
<p>The FIDO Alliance has announced enhancements to its FIDO2 specifications, which include several new features that will be helpful for passwordless enterprise deployments and other complex security applications. Both FIDO2 specifications were recently updated by their governing bodies â€“ with the World Wide Web Consortium  (W3C) approving WebAuthn Level 2 and FIDO doing the same for CTAP 2.1.</p>
<p>Key to these enhancements is enterprise attestation, which provides enterprise IT with improved management of FIDO authenticators used by employees. Enterprise attestation enables better binding of an authenticator to an account, assists with usage tracking and other management functions including credential and pin management, and biometric enrollment required in the enterprise.</p>
<p>Other updates include support for cross-origin iFrames and Apple attestation, as well as improvements to resident credentials. More details on these and other FIDO specification enhancements are available <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2-enhancements/">here</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>2020年に、物理的な世界からサイバー世界への移行がかつてないスピードで進みました。COVID-19がその移行を課したのです。5年から10年分の変化が数ヶ月の間に行われたと言う人もいます。そこでは、ステイホーム・ポリシーにより物理的な世界でのコミュニケーション能力が大きく制限され、サイバー・コミュニケーションに大きく依存するようになりました。サイバー空間では、あらゆるコミュニケーションはDigital Being（サイバースペースにおける私たちのデジタル表現）を通じて行われます。しかし、Digital Beingが無形である以上、私たちの「安全な生活」に欠かせない、当たり前だと思っている物理的な存在の多くの特性がそこにはありません。このセッションでは、私たちのデジタルライフを安全で安心なものにするために必要な、Digital Beingの7つの原則を概観します。</p>The post <a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2021/06/4801/">Identiverse: 7 Principles of Digital Being</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.sakimura.org">@_Nat Zone</a>.

 Example Design of an Authorization System with Verifiable Credentials and the Tradeoffs 

 Problem summary 

<p>In this blog post, I’ll cover an example design that relies upon verifiable credentials where a CFO is delegating access to their assistant to authorize purchases made by the company. The primary focus of this blog post is to highlight the different problems that are likely to occur when going down the path of building an authorization system with verifiable credentials. I’ll be sure to keep things at a higher level so that anyone can understand these tradeoffs, but take you through the details that would be thought through by an architect designing the system. Enjoy, and feel free to leave comments or reach out to me for questions, suggested improvements, or other aspects I didn’t fully consider.</p>

 Use case description 

<p>In this use case, the issuer is an employer who wishes to provide an employee credential to their CFO. Now their CFO as a part of their job has a lot of capabilities afforded to them as a senior executive. Let’s say this CFO has two abilities. They can sign off on quarterly reports and they can authorize purchases. Now let’s say the employer issues them the following credential:</p>

   <code>{
 "@context": [
   "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
   {
    "@vocab": "https://example.com/employer/"
   }
  ],
  "id": "http://example.com/employer/credentials/123",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "EmployerCredential"],
  "issuer": "https://example.com/employer",
  "issuanceDate": "2010-01-01T19:73:24Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:cfo",
    "jobTitle": "Chief Financial Officer",
    "employeeNumber": 123,
  },
  "revocation": {
    "id": "http://example.gov/revocations/738",
    "type": "SimpleRevocationList2017"
  },
  "proof": {
      "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
      "created": "2019-12-11T03:50:55Z",
      "proofValue": "....",
      "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
      "verificationMethod": "https://example.com/employer/key1"
    }
}
</code>   

<p>All is good and well, now the CFO can do their job. Now let’s say the CFO has been bombarded with purchase authorization requests recently while trying to prepare the quarterly report and has asked their assistant to assist with the backlog of purchase requests as long as the requests are under $10,000. To do this, the CFO decides to delegate their employee credential to their assistant because the payment authorization system relies upon the jobTitle attribute to determine the capabilities.</p>

<p>So, the CFO delegates the following credential to their assistant and hands over their employee credential too:</p>

   <code>{
 "@context": [
   "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
   {
    "@vocab": "https://example.com/employer/"
   }
  ],
  "id": "http://example.com/employer/credentials/123",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "EmployerCredential"],
  "issuer": "did:example:cfo",
  "issuanceDate": "2010-01-01T19:73:24Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:assistant",
    "jobTitle": "Chief Financial Officer",
    "employeeNumber": 123,
  },
  "revocation": {
    "id": "http://example.gov/revocations/738",
    "type": "SimpleRevocationList2017"
  },
  "proof": {
      "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
      "created": "2019-12-11T03:50:55Z",
      "proofValue": "....",
      "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
      "verificationMethod": "did:example:cfo#key1"
    }
}
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>Side rhetorical consideration around the semantics of this VC as a standalone VC, why is the CFO declaring that their assistant has the jobTitle “Chief Financial Officer” now? This is what I mean when I say using verifiable credentials for authorization systems introduces bad semantics. To skirt around authorization systems we’re bending the semantics of the claims in the credentials in ways that don’t make sense. And that’s ignoring the second and third-order effects that are inherently going to be introduced!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great, so now the assistant can generate the following delegated verifiable Presentation to authorize payments:</p>

   <code>{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
   {
    "@vocab": "https://example.com/employer/"

        "verificationMethod": "did:example:assistant#key1"
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Sweet, now the assistant can authorize payments! Let’s review what the steps are for the payment authorization system now with this.</p>

<p>VP Request checks</p>

 
   Check that the verificationMethod is associated with the authentication proofPurpose for the assistant. 
   Check that the verificationMethod for the VP proof is associated with the delegation credential <code>credentialSubject.id</code> 
   Check that the proofValue is valid in the VP proof (the bottom one) based on the associated verificationMethod for the assistant 
   Check that the challenge matches the VP Request 
 

<p>Delegation Credential checks</p>

 
   Check that the verificationMethod is associated with the assertionMethod proofPurpose for the CFO in the delegation credential 
   Check that the verificationMethod in the delegation credential is associated with the issuer property of the delegation credential 
   Check that the proofValue is valid in the delegation credential proof (the middle one) based on the associated verificationMethod for the CFO 
   Check that the <code>credentialSubject.jobTitle</code> has “Chief Financial Officer” in the delegation credential 
   Check that the issuer property in the delegation credential matches the <code>credentialSubject.id</code> in the original credential 
 

<p>Original Credential checks</p>

 
   Check that the verificationMethod is associated with the assertionMethod proofPurpose for the employer in the original credential 
   Check that the verificationMethod in the original credential is associated with the issuer property of the original credential 
   Check that the proofValue is valid in the original credential proof (the top one) based on the associated verificationMethod for the CFO 
   Check that the <code>credentialSubject.jobTitle</code> has “Chief Financial Officer” in the original credential 
   Check that the original credential isn’t revoked 
 

<blockquote>
  <p>Note to consider: If the credentials in the verifiable presentation are ordered incorrectly that’s going to introduce some problems</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But wait how did the authorization system know that the assistant has been attenuated with limited permission to only authorize payments below $10,000? Well, we’ve got a few different ways we could do that, let’s take a look at the ways we can extend this simple delegation pattern.</p>

 Extension 1: CFO adds a <code>maximumAuthorizationLimit</code> property to the delegation credential 

<p>So in this scenario, the CFO adds <code>maximumAuthorizationLimit</code> property like so:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
        {
            "@vocab": "https://example.com/employer/"
        }
    ],
    "id": "http://example.com/employer/credentials/123",
    "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "EmployerCredential"],
    "issuer": "did:example:cfo",
    "issuanceDate": "2010-01-01T19:73:24Z",
    "credentialSubject": {
        "id": "did:example:assistant",
        "jobTitle": "Chief Financial Officer",
        "employeeNumber": 123,
        "maximumAuthorizationLimit": 10000
    },
    "proof": {
        "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
        "created": "2019-12-11T03:50:55Z",
        "proofValue": "....",
        "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
        "verificationMethod": "did:example:cfo#key1"
    }

<p>Awesome, so now we have a verifiable presentation that attenuates the delegated capabilities of making authorization payments and limits the payments to $10000 for the assistant. This new property introduces some new checks though in our business logic.</p>

 
   Check that the <code>credentialSubject.maximumAuthorizationLimit</code> in the delegation credential is below the limit afforded to the <code>credentialSubject.jobTitle</code> 
   Check that the payment hasn’t exceeded the <code>credentialSubject.maximumAuthorizationLimit</code> 
 

<p>But wait, when we delegated the ability for the assistant to authorize payments we also inadvertently allowed the assistant to sign off on the quarterly reports! Oh no! Now, we’ve got a legal liability issue on our hands.
We’ll need to build on top of option 1 to make sure that the assistant isn’t signing off on our quarterly reports too and so that we can adhere to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">principle of least authority</a>. We’ll cover that in option 2.</p>

 Extension 2: limiting the assistant’s abilities to only payment authorization capabilities 

<p>Since the CFO has two capabilities, we need to disable the one that would allow the assistant to also sign off on quarterly reports. We’re going to go ahead and do this via the introduction of the <code>canSignQuartlyReports</code> claim.</p>

<p>So now the delegation credential looks like this:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",

</code>   

<p>Finally, we’ve got a properly attenuated delegation verifiable credential to address our use case! So what’s the issue with this? First off, we’re using only a toy example here where the CFO has only two capabilities.
Most businesses aren’t paying CFOs the big bucks to only handle those two things though (If they are let me know, I’m sure I can figure that job out 😊). This means that for every additional capability that we don’t want to be delegated we have to add a permission property. By doing this we’re effectively building a deny list with only one capability removed to enable a single capability. Why not build off of and allow list model instead? (Hint this is the approach ZCAP-LDs take)</p>

<p>So our delegation credential could end up looking something like this:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
        {
            "@vocab": "https://example.com/employer/"
        }
    ],
    "id": "http://example.com/employer/credentials/123",
    "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "EmployerCredential"],
    "issuer": "did:example:cfo",
    "issuanceDate": "2010-01-01T19:73:24Z",
    "credentialSubject": {
        "id": "did:example:assistant",
        "jobTitle": "Chief Financial Officer",
        "employeeNumber": 123,
        "maximumAuthorizationLimit": 10000,
        "canSignQuartlyReports": false,
        "canDoXCapability": false,
        "canDoYCapability": false,
        "canDoZCapability": false,
        ...
    },
    "proof": {
        "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
        "created": "2019-12-11T03:50:55Z",
        "proofValue": "....",
        "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
        "verificationMethod": "did:example:cfo#key1"
    }
}
</code>   

 Tradeoffs with this design 

<p>Furthermore, the semantics of the claims in this new credential is quite odd. We’ve effectively combined a claims token and a permission token into a single verifiable Credential here. By doing this we’re far more likely to be issuing and reissuing the same credential many times as access to the delegatee needs to be updated. This also has second-order effects on the maintainability and adaptability that are best described by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter">principle of least knowledge</a>.</p>

<p>It also just so happens, these types of deny lists are awesome things to get your hands on as well when you’re performing the reconnaissance phase of a penetration test to break into a system. Now our system design is helping the attackers assuming they get ahold of one of the credentials, but none of the keys. If they get the keys, problems that are better left out of scope for this writeup occur.</p>

<p>Additionally, the fact that we need to perform 16 checks just to achieve our goal means that it’s highly likely that one gets missed and an authorization bypass vulnerability is introduced. As is pointed out in the CCG mailing list though, this is mainly a byproduct of the fact we’re performing delegation rather than the usage of VCs themselves. However, delegation is only complicated when done correctly. After all, when people are sharing their Netflix passwords they too are delegating and that is a simple implementation for the verifier. So the takeaway here is that the more we can reduce the number of checks when building transparent delegation the more resilient and secure the authorization system is likely to be.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>In conclusion, I stand by the opinion that utilizing verifiable credentials to build authorization systems is possible, but more work than is necessary. Hopefully, this walk-through helps to understand why I’ve come to this conclusion. However, just because I’ve decided I’m probably not going to use VCs in this way doesn’t mean you shouldn’t. Just like any technology, some tradeoffs occur when deciding how you approach your system design. It may be the case that this is the simplest method to achieve your use case. If that’s true then by all means go for it. However, I suspect things can be simplified through the use of <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-ld/">ZCAP-LD</a>. ZCAP-LD is built on the concept of an object capabilities model which is well suited for authorization systems (but not for making claims about a subject). I’ll be writing up a follow-up blog on how the same use case described above could be designed with ZCAP-LD and show the differences between the two. Be on the lookout for that to come next!</p>

 Common Delegation Patterns in the Verifiable Credential Ecosystem 

<p>It’s commonly understood that verifiable credentials are a useful data model for expressing provenance and authority of data. In other words, they’re great for solving the “who says what” problem in a digital ecosystem. However, did you know that there are three ways in which you can utilize VCs and DIDs to enable delegation and attenuated delegation for more complex scenarios? In this blog post, I’ll cover the three patterns you can use with examples to help you figure out some of the more advanced capabilities of the VC data model. See below for more details!</p>

 Terminology 

<p>Since it’s quite common to see these terms within the IAM space, I figured it would be useful to first cover what each term means in simple term.</p>

<p>Delegation: This is the ability for someone to share their abilities with another user within the system. There’s multiple ways this can be done all with different forms of tradeoffs.</p>

 
   
    <p>A user who shares their password with another user is performing delegation, but not in a way that allows an authorization endpoint (often times called a “verifier”) to be able to uniquely differentiate between the two users. This inability to differentiate at the authorization endpoint often leads to concerns around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confused_deputy_problem">confused deputy problem</a>.</p>
   
   
    <p>This when the system has been designed to allow the user to share their abilities with another user. The most common way this shows up today is with google document links. When a user “allows anyone with this link to view/comment/edit” they’re granting abilites to other users in a delegated way. The difference being the system can identify these unique users, which is commonly seen via the further delegation based upon an email address or organization.</p>
   
 

<p>Attenuated delegation: This is when the user opts to share only a portion of the abilities that they have. So looking at our options from delegation, option 1 would not allow this because the user is sharing all the same abilities that they have when logging into an account. So if an admin shares their password, the person they share the password with has admin abilities as well. One of the more common examples I can think of when attenuated delegation that is in use today is when a valet key is given to a valet. This key gives the valet access to drive the vehicle, but doesn’t allow them to open a glovebox or trunk for example. In this case, the driver of the vehichle is able to share only a portion of their abilities (driving) without sharing all of their abilities (opening a glovebox or trunk). In almost every system I’ve seen, this has to be intentionally designed into the system.</p>

 Delegation without attenuation by using DID Documents 

<p>As an example, let’s say we have the two following DID Documents:</p>

<p>Alice’s DID Document:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
        "https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"
    ],
    "id": "did:example:alice",
    "verificationMethod": [
        {
            "id": "did:example:alice#aliceKey1",
            "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",
            "controller": "did:example:alice",
            "publicKeyMultibase": "zH3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
        },
        {
            "id": "did:example:bob#bobKey1",
            "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",
            "controller": "did:example:bob",
            "publicKeyMultibase": "z9hFgmPVfmBZwRvFEyniQDBkz9LmV7gDEqytWyGZLmDXE"
        }
    ],
    "assertionMethod": [
        "did:example:alice#aliceKey1",
        "did:example:bob#bobKey1"
    ]
}
</code>   

<p>Bob’s DID Document:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
        "https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"
    ],
    "id": "did:example:bob",
    "verificationMethod": [
        {
            "id": "did:example:bob#bobKey1",
            "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",
            "controller": "did:example:bob",
            "publicKeyMultibase": "z9hFgmPVfmBZwRvFEyniQDBkz9LmV7gDEqytWyGZLmDXE"
        }
    ],
    "assertionMethod": ["did:example:bob#bobKey1"]
}
</code>   

<p>In this example we can see that Alice has the capability to delegate to Bob the ability for him to assert on her behalf.
In the case of the following VC, bob could then create a valid verifiable presentation based on the following verifiable
credential that was delegated to him:</p>

   <code>{

<p>This effectively is a method to allow Alice to add bob’s public key to her did document and giving him a copy of the verifiable credential to delegate him to act on her behalf. However, because this pattern relies on Alice granting Bob full authority to perform any action on her behalf, it lacks attenuation, but does have delegation.</p>

 Delegation by VCs 

<p>Additionally, there’s a well documented case to be able to establish delegation using just VCs without the ability to attenuate the data. See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#subject-passes-a-verifiable-credential-to-someone-else">Section Appendix C.5</a> for more details on this pattern.</p>

 Attenuated Delegation by VCs 

<p>Further, by combining the pattern described in <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#subject-passes-a-verifiable-credential-to-someone-else">Section Appendix C.5</a> and combining it with the usage of a selective disclosure scheme like BBS signatures, we can enable an attenuated delegation pattern.</p>

<p>This is done via modifying the type of proof used to sign the credential and then utilizing the selective disclosure to limit the data. Using the following original verifiable credential:</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>So there’s a few different take aways from this that should be highlighted. First and foremost VCs and DIDs have some really interesting capabilities that enable delegation and attenuated delegation. However, it’s not always advantageous and requires thorough understanding of the use case that’s trying to be built with DIDs and VCs and whether or not delegation needs to be enabled or disabled. In some cases, it’s being left in when there’s an expectation that a credential is only able to be used by a single holder. Finally, it should be noted that while VCs are capable of being used for authorization systems, it’s generally not a good idea to do so. This is because the complexity (based on the number of checks) of the authorization system is quite high and the semantics have not been designed in a way that align well with most authorization systems meaning a vulnerability is more likely to be introduced. If you’re looking for these capabilities, I would recommend you look to the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-ld/">ZCAP-LD data model</a> which is designed especially for these concepts. And if you’re still confused and would like some help please reach out and I can see how I can help.</p>

<p>Not so fast. Let’s start with losing access to my accounts. Maybe I forgot my
password and failed to reset it. Or maybe I managed to get a password reset
e-mail but my primary e-mail account was hacked, and now the attacker controls my
Facebook account and I don’t. Maybe Google decided to disable my account, and given
that there is no appeals process, that’s the end of me and my e-mail. The end
of a 20-year-long record of all important things I wrote to others and they wrote
to me. In the blink of an eye, because they have my data and I don’t.</p>
<p>But even if everything is fine, and I don’t forget my passwords and don’t get
hacked and won’t get locked out: it’s a bit like being a really unimportant guest
living in a fancy hotel on a short-term lease. They can kick me out any time, and
keep all my furniture and other possessions, no questions asked. Thank you, I
prefer my very own home, where nobody can kick me out, or at least renter
protection laws, which don’t exist online.</p>

Illustration: Digital Identity&nbsp;Wallet<p>This article explains what a wallet is, how it works and how you can use it for managing your digital identity. While there are also wallets for institutions, this article only focuses on wallets for end users. The article also takes into consideration the revised eIDAS regulation including the ‘European Digital Identity&nbsp;Wallet’.</p> An Introduction <p>A digital wallet is a key management application, which provides a user with a graphical interface to store, manage and secure digital keys. These keys can be used to sign transactions, statements, credentials, documents or&nbsp;claims.</p><p>A digital identity wallet enables a user to establish relationships and interact with third parties in a trusted manner. While the wallet aspect is mainly dealing with key management, storage aspects and the graphical interface (UI = User Interface), the third party interactions are rather organised by your agent, which is a part of your wallet. Your agent handles third-party interactions in your name and acts in your interest. It is a piece of software, which helps you to stay in control of your messaging, security, health records, privacy, purchases etc.</p> A digital identity wallet based on self-sovereign identity (SSI) principles. <p>Not all wallets are the same! A wallet is a piece of technology, which can be implemented in different ways. While it can leverage decentralised identifiers (DIDs) and verified credentials, it doesn’t necessarily need to follow the principles of SSI. There are cloud wallets, which are hosted and provided by a third party. A good comparison is a wallet for cryptocurrencies — think of an exchange like Coinbase or Binance. These companies offer you a hosted wallet, which you don’t control. You might have the authentication means (password + second factor) to access your wallet, but it’s not yours. In this case, you are the owner, but not the possessor and you don’t have data sovereignty. This is in stark contrast to so-called self-custody wallets, which you install on your device. These wallets randomly create a private key, which only you know. The key point is that your wallet creates keys for you, which only you know and not a third&nbsp;party.</p><p>A digital identity wallet, which follows the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">principles of SSI </a>enables the user to have data sovereignty and complete control as well as data portability. It provides you with the necessary autonomy to be independent of a third party. It not only enables ownership but also possession. It enables transparency and explicit consent when sharing information. It’s also vendor-independent, meaning you can export your data and import it into another wallet of your choice since it is built on open standards, which are widely used. It also creates peer identifiers for every new contact or rather an interaction, instead of getting an identifier assigned to&nbsp;it.</p> The core functions of an SSI&nbsp;wallet <p>Please note that the described characteristics below are not universally valid for all (SSI) wallets. It’s rather a desired&nbsp;status.</p>Interactions in an SSI ecosystem, picture by Adrian Doerk from&nbsp;Lissi.<p>Establish trusted relationships with third parties:<br>The wallet can create an encrypted communication channel to exchange information between you and a (trusted) third party. This communication channel is based on a unique identifier, which you control. Hence it is not hosted by a third party. This in turn enables you the portability of communication channels. Meaning if you switch from one wallet to another you can use the communication channels, which you already created without the reliance on any third-party platform.</p><p>Store, organise and present verified data:<br>The user can store and manage (verified) credentials among other information within the wallet. Once in the wallet, credentials can be used to answer a proof request from every connection. The wallet creates a verifiable presentation, which the user can choose to send or instead decline the proof request. Users are also able to verify the identity of the other party, effectively establishing a trusted relationship, which can be leveraged to share and receive information within a defined trust framework such as the eIDAS regulation. This trust might be based on an electronic seal or similar trust mechanisms. However, this might not be the case for all contacts.</p><p>The information exchanged can be verified, but can also be self-attested or just proof a certain threshold without revealing the exact information like your age when proofing you are 18 or&nbsp;older.</p><p>A transparent history of shared data:<br>Since the wallet usually keeps a history of interactions, the user can track who shared what data and when. This leads to greater transparency for the user and helps to better exercise data protection rights. A framework for the integration of detailed consent forms is currently under development.</p> Self-custody: With great control comes great responsibility <p>These digital wallets run locally as an application on the device of the user. From a technical perspective, these wallets are similar to self-custody wallets for cryptocurrencies. Similar to these wallets the user has the responsibility to do a&nbsp;backup.</p><p>Identification, authentication and authorization:<br>Before diving deeper into the core functions of a digital wallet we need to understand the differences between the three words above. The questions are from the perspective of the verifier or&nbsp;issuer.</p><p>Identification answers the question: “Who is I’m talking to?”<br>Authentication answers the question: “Is it you (whom I’ve identified already) again?”<br>Authorization answers the question: “What rights do I want to grant&nbsp;you?”</p><p>The wallet can enable a variety of additional functions and thus serves as a central point for the user to manage and access services. For example, the wallet can be used to replace traditional authentication methods such as passwords with a single sign-on (SSO) functionality. Furthermore, existing standards such as the OpenID Connect protocol can also be connected to enable communication with existing infrastructure. Hence, once widespread adopted the wallet will completely replace passwords for you and enable you to identify and authenticate yourself, identity third-parties as well as authorise third-parties to use your data according to your permissions.</p> The European Digital Identity&nbsp;Wallet Illustration: European Digital Identity&nbsp;Wallet<p>The main regulation within the European Union, which addresses the topic of identification (among other topics) is the regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market better known as eIDAS regulation. The regulation just went through a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity">major revision and now includes several aspects regarding self-sovereign identities</a> in its draft version. It also includes the aspect of a European Digital Identity Wallet, which “is a product and service that allows the user to store identity data, credentials and attributes linked to her/his identity, to provide them to relying parties on request and to use them for authentication, online and offline, for a service in accordance with Article 6a; and to create qualified electronic signatures and&nbsp;seals”.</p><p>In the following, the European Digital Identity Wallet is referred to as “EU Wallet” for simplicity.</p> Functions of the EU&nbsp;Wallet: <p>It should technically enable the selective disclosure of attributes to relying parties. Member States should also reach an agreement on common elements of a business model and fee structure of the EU Wallets. The EU Wallet will furthermore enable citizens to create qualified electronic signatures that can facilitate political participation among other functions.</p> EU Wallets shall enable the user&nbsp;to:   securely request and obtain, store, select, combine and share, in a manner that is transparent to and traceable by the user, the necessary legal personal identification data and electronic attestation of attributes to authenticate online and offline to use online public and private services;  sign statements or contracts utilising qualified electronic signatures (QES)  have full control of the EU Wallet. The issuer of the EU Wallet shall not collect information about the use of the EU Wallet which are not necessary for the provision of the EU Wallet&nbsp;service.  use it free of charge (natural persons).  access the wallet for persons with disabilities.   The EU Wallets shall provide a common interface:   to qualified and non-qualified trust service providers issuing qualified and non-qualified electronic attestations of attributes.  for relying parties to request and validate personal identification data and electronic attestations of attributes.  for the presentation to relying parties of personal identification data, electronic attestation of attributes or other data such as credentials, in local mode not requiring internet access for the&nbsp;wallet.   Furthermore, the EU Wallets need&nbsp;to:   ensure that trust service providers of qualified attestations of attributes cannot receive any information about the use of these attributes.  meet the requirements in regards to assurance level “high”, in particular as applied to the requirements for identity proofing and verification, and electronic identification means management and authentication.  provide a mechanism to ensure that the relying party is able to authenticate the user and to receive electronic attestations of attributes;  ensure that the personal identification data uniquely and persistently represent the natural or legal person is associated with&nbsp;it.   An EU Wallet shall be&nbsp;issued: <p>(a) by a Member State;<br>(b) under a mandate from a Member State;<br>(c) independently but recognised by a Member&nbsp;State.</p><p>The draft regulation requires Member States to issue a EU Wallet under a notified eID scheme to common technical standards following a compulsory compliance assessment and voluntary certification within the European cybersecurity certification framework, as established by the Cybersecurity Act.</p><p>Service providers should communicate their intent to rely on the EU Wallets to the Member States. Relying on the level of assurance “high”, the EU Wallets should benefit from the potential offered by tamper-proof solutions such as secure elements.</p><p>The conformity of EU Wallets should be certified by accredited public or private sector bodies designated by Member States. Certification should in particular rely on the relevant European cybersecurity certifications schemes. The EU Wallet Trust Mark’ means an indication in a simple, recognisable and clear manner that a EU Wallet has been issued in accordance with this Regulation.</p><p>The Commission shall establish, publish and maintain a list of certified European Digital Identity&nbsp;Wallets.</p> Where are heading? A personal&nbsp;opinion:   A wallet acts as a central point to manage interactions in a digital world. It will be the standard for identity management and be ubiquitous in everyday&nbsp;life.  Technology is moving fast. While standardisation is taking quite a while, institutions and governments have recognised the need for innovation in this area to secure data sovereignty and not be dependent on a foreign oligopoly of companies with irresponsible business practices.  Dozens of use-cases from different industries are explored in parallel and will be available in the upcoming&nbsp;months.  Over time digital wallets for pure identity management and financial applications (e.g. cryptocurrencies or central bank digital currencies (CBDC)) are likely to&nbsp;merge.  The draft of the revised eIDAS regulation of the European Union is the most comprehensive and ambitious step towards SSI internationally.  While the exact implementation and technical specifications of the EU Wallets are still to be determined, their compulsory issuance for the EU Member States as well as the compulsory acceptance for big platform providers will have a tremendous international impact.  Key management is an issue, which still needs to be solved. This means, the user also has the responsibility of having a secure backup solution to restore the wallet in case of lost&nbsp;access.

 This past week, the Colorado legislature passed the “Colorado Privacy Act”,
which makes Colorado the 3rd US state with modern privacy legislation,
following the CCPA in California
and the CDPA in Virginia.
It will start going into effect about 24 months from now. 
 Its provisions are similar to California’s and Virginia’s, except for
this one, which goes substantially further:

<p>This past week, the Colorado legislature passed the “Colorado Privacy Act”,
which makes Colorado the 3rd US state with modern privacy legislation,
following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act">CCPA in California</a>
and the <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+sum+HB2307">CDPA in Virginia</a>.
It will start going into effect about 24 months from now.</p>
<p>Its provisions are similar to California’s and Virginia’s, except for
this one, which goes substantially further:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A CONTROLLER THAT PROCESSES PERSONAL DATA FOR PURPOSES OF TARGETED ADVERTISING
OR THE SALE OF PERSONAL DATA SHALL ALLOW CONSUMERS TO EXERCISE THE RIGHT TO OPT
OUT OF THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING THE CONSUMER FOR
PURPOSES OF TARGETED ADVERTISING OR THE SALE OF PERSONAL DATA …
BY CONTROLLERS THROUGH A USER-SELECTED UNIVERSAL OPT-OUT MECHANISM THAT
MEETS THE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS ESTABLISHED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">Do Not Track</a> – or
something very much like it – is back in Colorado, and ignoring the setting,
like companies did widely when Do Not Track was created, is not an option any more.
The technical details will need to be figured out between now and when this
provision goes into effect, which two and a half years away. So plenty of
time to get this right.</p>
<p>Progress! Which US state is next? The IAPP has a

<p>In the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/">W3C VC-EDU</a> call on June 7, 2021 we discussed <a href="https://openbadges.org/">Open Badges</a> asserted as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs). This call began the public discussion of Open Badges as Native VCs (potentially as Open Badges 3.0) to inform the IMS Open Badges Working Group. Why are we discussing this? Why does it matter? How will it work? Feedback from folks in the community have suggested that it would be helpful to answer these questions first from a conceptual standpoint. In a later post, we can outline what the structural changes could look&nbsp;like.</p><p>Open Badges are digital credentials that can recognize learning, achievements, and even memberships. They look like an image, but inside the image are metadata properties (it works much like how digital photos have metadata properties that explain the data of the photo, location, etc. so that when the photo is uploaded, applications understand the data). The metadata describes why the badge was issued, when, the recipient (typically an email address), the description and criteria of the achievement, and, critically, how this digital credential can be verified.</p><p>The verification of an Open Badge is dependent on the Issuer of the badge. It can be done in one of two&nbsp;ways:</p>  <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html#HostedBadge">Hosted Verification</a> — One of the metadata properties of an Open Badges is the assertion id which is a URL that hosts the metadata in a&nbsp;.json file. If that URL can’t be found, then the badge is not verifiable  <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html#SignedBadge">Signed Verification</a> — An Issuer can digitally sign the metadata of a badge. This uses cryptography to ensure that the badge data has not changed and that the issuer was the entity that issued the badge. The public key used to sign the badge must be traceable back to the&nbsp;issuer.  <p>Primarily, Open Badges platforms are issuing hosted badges. This means the verifying party is dependent on the issuer to host the data. Also, the issuer has some ability to track when the badge data has been accessed and potentially by who (or at least by IP address).</p><p>For 99% of the badges that have been issued to date, this is fine. In fact, badges are often shared via web pages that attractively display the image and data (not by the&nbsp;.json files that contain the data or the baked image with the data inside). So while Open Badges are both human readable and machine readable, the human readable approach is what is used most often. Signed badges are closer to Verifiable Credentials because they also rely on cryptographic proof.</p><p>Neither of these approaches give learners control of their data and this is the overall conceptual shift between Open Badges 2.0 and Open Badges as Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials, like signed Open Badges, are signed by the issuer and verified cryptographically. Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) can be used to identify the issuer and recipient (using DIDs in Open Badges 2.0 has been prototyped). Also, Verifiable Credentials have a concept called “Presentations” which can be digitally signed by the recipient to prove that they are the recipient of the verifiable credential(s) being presented. All in all, this means that the issuer is verified and also the recipient.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials can be displayed, shared, and presented from wallet applications that are web, mobile, or desktop based (most are mobile right now). Recipients can present one or more of their credentials to verifying third-parties who can verify the credentials without depending on the issuers and consume the data. Not only can the participant manage which credentials are being verified, they can control what aspects of their data are being&nbsp;shared.</p><p>For example, a student’s digital wallet may contain a digital passport, an Open Badge representing a completed course, and an Open Badge representing a student ID (all as Verifiable Credentials). A relying third-party, such as a potential employer seeking to fill an internship role, may need to verify that a student is over 18, has completed a course on communication, and is a current student. The employer’s website application can ask the student to provide this discrete information using their wallet and the student can do this without revealing any of the other information in those credentials like their date of birth, address, photo, or even the name of the school they attend. And all of this information can be verified without contacting the issuers of those credentials. Open Badges 2.0 can’t do&nbsp;this.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials put learners in the center of a trust triangle with issuers and verifiers. They also add an additional layer of verification for the recipients. Open Badges can take advantage of this, be the first education-focused digital credential spec to promote personal protection of and access to data, and be part of the growing ecosystem that is exchanging Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>It’s worth noting that the human readable aspect of Open Badges would not change in a VC version. Issuers can still display web pages for the issued badges and allow recipients to share their badges online from those pages.

<p>A simple technology invented by Bell Labs over 20 years ago (and widely used today) could have prevented the Colonial Pipeline attack.</p> <p></p> <p>In 1880, the French government awarded Alexander Graham Bell roughly the equivalent of $300K as a prize for inventing the telephone. He used the award to fund the research laboratory that became colloquially known as Bell Labs. If you’re not familiar with Bell Labs, you should be. In the 140+ years that followed, researchers at <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/">Bell Labs</a>invented radio astronomy, transistors, lasers, solar cells, information theory, and UNIX, just to name a few of the many accomplishments. Among the many prestigious <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/about/awards/">awards</a>granted to Bell Labs researchers are nine Nobel prizes and twenty-two IEEE Medals of Honor.</p> <p>In 1998, I joined <a href="https://about.att.com/sites/labs_research">AT&amp;T Labs</a>, which was a research group that the company retained when they spun out most of Bell Labs to Lucent Technologies in 1996. I was a Web Application developer; one of the least technical roles in the Labs. If I ever thought for a moment that I knew technology, I was quickly humbled when I built an app that tracked the Labs' actually importantprojects. The experience of working in the Labs stuck with me in the form of humility and curiosity. I accepted that I may never be the foremost expert in any given technology and I assumed the mindset of a forever student. Even today, I constantly question what I think I know because there are always holes in my knowledge or perspectives that I haven’t seen.</p> <p>1998 was the same year that researchers at AT&amp;T Labs were issued a patent (filed in 1995)  for what became known in our industry as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). As a Product Manager at a tech firm, I don’t review patents for legal reasons. But I recently saw an excerpt of the abstract for the AT&amp;T patent and there was one line that I found entertaining: “A preferred method of alerting the customer and receiving a confirmation to authorize the transaction back from the customer is illustratively afforded by conventional two-way pagers.” Not much has changed in 23 years. Pagers have been largely replaced by SMS but text messaging through the telecom provider’s network remains one of the most popular delivery mechanisms for MFA (despite some <a href="https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/questionsand-buzz-surrounding-draft-nist-special-publication-800-63-3">potential security flaws</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>I have no personal insight into AT&amp;T’s motivations at the time, but I read Kevin Mitnick’s book a few years ago (<a href="https://www.mitnicksecurity.com/ghost-in-the-wires">Ghost in the Wires</a>) and can’t help but wonder if AT&amp;T was at the forefront of developing security technologies because they were such a target of hackers for so many years. I also reached out to Steve Greenspan, one of the inventors named in the patent to get his thoughts on the project. He noted:<br></p><p>"Two-way pagers had just come out (1994-1995), and our cybersecurity  friends were debating whether quantum computing would undermine  password-based security. The goal was to explore business applications for  two-way pagers and to put humans in-the-loop for secure access." <br></p><p>Quantum computing is a a pretty interesting business driver for MFA, especially in the mid-1990's. The concern is even more relevant today as we inch closer to quantum compute becoming a practical reality. Today's authentication systems should store password data in non-reversible hashes (theoretically preventing the quantum threat), but it's clear that credentials are being stolen all the time (often via large databases that are just left unprotected) and MFA remains a top solution to mitigate the damage. Steve and team were clearly on the right track when they dreamed up out-of-band authentication and deserve some credit and recognition for the foresight.<br></p>You may be wondering how this relates to the pipeline attack that led to fuel shortages across the U.S. East Coast. Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-04/hackers-breached-colonial-pipeline-using-compromised-password">reported</a>that the Colonial Pipeline, which is the largest fuel pipeline in the country, was taken down by a single compromised password. That should never happen given the variety of tools available to limit and control access, starting with MFA – a relatively simple solution that would likely have prevented the attack. The entry point to the system was a Virtual Private Network (VPN) account. If you’re using a VPN and expose anything sensitive inside the VPN, you should implement strong authentication that includes at least two authentication factors (something you know, something you have, something you are). These are widely available technologies that are very effective against lost or stolen credentials.    <p>Of course, authentication isn’t the end of the story. Today’s widely distributed and highly dynamic environments require multiple layers of security. We all know how popular email and phishing attacks have become. It only takes one person inside a network to open an email, click a link, or logon to a phishing site to give an adversary a foothold in the network. We have to assume that will happen and build layers of strong security between any one user and the potential targets.</p>   <p>To illustrate the point, here’s a quick example:</p>   <p>Grocery stores who sell small, high-value items have traditionally struggled with theft. (Ask me over a beer sometime about how I helped take down a recurring thief when I worked at a grocery store.) If the only answer was to authenticate users (check ID) on the way into the store, it wouldn't be enough. Once inside, someone can still pocket items and walk out without paying. If you walk into a grocery store today, you’ll see cameras in the healthcare aisle where small, expensive medications line the shelves. But that’s not enough either. Each item is also locked in an anti-theft device that’s removed at the register. And some items are found in a locked cabinet that requires employee assistance. Theft still happens, but each layer reduces the risk. Our IT environments are much more complicated in terms of the various pathways to theft and our responses to reduce risk typically require more than a few layers of security.</p>   <p>Sensitive data should only be stored in a secure area of the network with access controls and Least Privilege enforcement. Access should be limited to specific hosts or networks. Data should be encrypted (inside the file when possible - so if the file is stolen, the data is still unusable). There should be strong authentication to get into the network and monitoring of all activity. There should be alerts on unusual behavior and Data Loss Prevention (DLP) to evaluate the sensitivity of data moving across the network. The environment should be scanned regularly for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. And on and on. Any one of these security mechanisms alone is not enough. This multi-layered approach to security is critical in developing a strong security posture that minimizes risk.</p>   <p>We could argue about where to start or which security controls are most important. But, it seems like a no-brainer to implement MFA for employees accessing corporate data and applications. Microsoft, who deals with 300 million fraudulent sign-in attempts daily <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/08/20/one-simple-action-you-can-take-to-prevent-99-9-percent-of-account-attacks/">concluded</a>that “MFA can block over 99.9 percent of account compromise attacks.”That sounds about right. While targeted attacks have increased in prevalence, most attacks are not targeted at specific companies or individuals. Most start with automated scripting or broad-scale phishing attacks that span across potentially thousands of companies and/or millions of people at the same time. When a foothold is found (a script finds a vulnerability or an open port, a user enters credentials into the phishing site, etc.), the attack begins. Implementing a few simple security technologies like automated vulnerability scanning and MFA can prevent most attacks before they begin. Even if a sophisticated phishing attack succeeds despite MFA, the credentials will not be very useful beyond the initial session (which should be limited in scope by other controls).</p>   <p>No single technology will solve all cybersecurity problems. But, implementing MFA is low-cost, easy-to-implement, and highly effective. It may even make life easier for end-users. Password requirements can be loosened because there’s less risk associated with cracked passwords. And there are numerous implementations of passwordless authentication that, while they may not always meet the strict definition of MFA, provide similar (sometimes higher) levels of security as MFA without requiring a password. Combined with context-aware adaptive security (that verifies device, network, location, time-of-day, etc.), these passwordless authentication options may provide the right level of balance between security and user experience. At this point, this isn’t scare tactics or FUD. Attacks on National infrastructure or other high-profile targets can impact the lives of millions with a single execute command. MFA is an easy layer to add to improve security and it’s commonly included with authentication solutions, so there’s really no excuse. It’s time to get it done.</p>
