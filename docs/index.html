<p>I’m posting Fairness Fridays: a new community social justice organization each week. I donate to each featured organization. If you feel so inclined, please join me.</p><p></p><p>This week I’m donating to <a href="https://www.rogueretreat.com/housing-programs/hope-village/">Rogue Retreat</a>. Based in Medford, OR, Rogue Retreat offers support and housing for the homeless in its local area, including <a href="https://www.rogueretreat.com/housing-programs/hope-village/">a pioneering community of local homes</a>. It describes its mission as follows:</p><p>Rogue Retreat provides affordable housing/shelter and case management to homeless individuals and families in Jackson and Josephine Counties, Oregon, to teach them the skills they need to live independently.</p><p>I was struck and moved to donate by <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/01/21/797497926/law-enforcement-officials-argue-rural-homeless-services-worsen-problem">this piece on police criticism of its facilities on NPR last year</a>:</p><blockquote><p>"It is just another enabling mechanism for the homeless, the transients and the displaced people here," [Police Chief] Johnson told the board in February 2019. "When you create something and enable people, you're going to attract more."</p></blockquote><p>Johnson goes on to say that there’s another solution for people who are struggling with mental health and drug addiction: incarceration. I can’t imagine a more counter-productive, harmful attitude for someone in his position to have (color me disappointed but not surprised), which makes me even more appreciative of the work being done.</p><p>I donated. If you have the means, <a href="https://www.rogueretreat.com/ways-to-give/">I encourage you to do the same</a>.</p>

Also described is $Target-Cache-Control: which allows different CDNs to respond to different headers and is already supported by Cloudflare and Akamai (Cloudflare-CDN-Cache-Control: and Akamai-Cache-Control:).</p>

    We spend most of our waking hours being held to account between the guardrails of risk-informed and responsible decision making.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, we often climb over the guardrails and make ill-informed, irresponsible and irrational decisions, but that is human agency. It is also true that we would not innovate, create or discover if we could not explore the other side of our safety guardrails.&nbsp; <p>Today’s perception of responsible decision making is different to that our grandparents held.&nbsp; Our grandchildren will look back at our “risk-informed” decisions with the advantage of hindsight and question why our risk management frameworks were so short-term-focused.&nbsp; However, we need to recognise that our guardrails are established by current political, economic and societal framing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What are we optimising for?”</p><p>I often ask the question, “what are we optimising for?” The reason I ask this question is to draw out different viewpoints in a leadership team.&nbsp; The viewpoints that drive individual optimisation is framed by their experience, ability to understand time-frames and incentives.&nbsp;</p><p>Peak Paradox is a non-confrontational framework to explore our different perceptions of what we are optimising for.&nbsp; We need different and diverse views to ensure that our guardrails don’t become so narrow they look like rail tracks, and we repeat the same mistakes because that is what the process determines.&nbsp; Equally, we must agree together boundaries of divergence which means we can optimise as a team for something that we believe in and has a shared purpose of us and our stakeholders.&nbsp; Finding this dynamic area of alignment is made easier with the Peak Paradox framework.&nbsp;</p><p>However, our model of risk-informed responsible decision making is based on the idea that the majority decides, essentially democracy.&nbsp; If the “majority” is a supermajority, we need 76%; for a simple majority, we need 51%, and for minority protections less than 10%.&nbsp; What we get depends on how someone has previously set up the checks, balances, and control system. And then there is the idea of monarchy or the rich and powerful making the decisions for everyone else, the 0.001%.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, our guardrails for democratic decision making breaks down when there is a need for choices, decisions, judgement that has to be made that people do not like.&nbsp; How do we enable better decisions when hard decisions mean you will lose the support of the majority?&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>We do not all agree with vaccines (even before covid), eating meat, climate change, our government or authority.&nbsp; Vaccines in the current global pandemic period are one such tension of divergence.&nbsp; We see this every day in the news feeds; there is an equal and opposite view for every side.&nbsp; Humanity at large lives at Peak Paradox, but we don’t equally value everyone views. Why do we struggle with the idea that individual liberty of choice can be taken away in the interests of everyone?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Climate change is another.&nbsp; Should the government act in the longer term and protect the future or act in the short term persevering liberty and ensure re-election?&nbsp; Protestors with a cause may fight authority and are portrayed as mavericks and disruptors, but history remembers many as pioneers, martyrs and great leaders.&nbsp; Those who protested in the 1960 and 1970s against nuclear energy may look back today and think that they should have been fighting fossil fuels.&nbsp; Such pioneers are optimising for something outside of the normal guardrails. Whilst they appear to be living outside of the accepted guardrails, they can see they should be adopted.</p><p>Our guardrails work well when we can agree on the consequences of risk-informed and responsible decision making; however, in an age when information is untrusted and who is responsible is questioned, we find that we all have different guardrails.&nbsp; Living at Peak Paradox means we have to accept we will never agree on what is a responsible decision and we are likely to see that our iteration of democracy that maintains power and control is going to end in a revolution if we could only agree on what to optimise for.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>

Meanwhile, supposedly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-12/nfts-are-the-revenue-model-for-metaverse-crypto-veteran-says">NFTs are the revenue model for the metaverse</a>, making <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nft-sales-volume-surges-25-bln-2021-first-half-2021-07-05/">$2.6bn in sales in the first six months of 2021 alone</a>.</p><p>This is all well and good, but what the hell is the metaverse?</p><p>The complicated answer is: it depends on who you're talking to.</p><p>The metaverse as most people are talking about it right now is something to do with an interconnected set of virtual worlds, which may or may not be accessible via virtual reality (hence Facebook’s interest: after all, they own Oculus). The idea is that they’d be interoperable to the point where these worlds can lead to each other, and where you can bring objects from space to space - theoretically represented via NFTs.</p><p>This particular vision of the metaverse is probably not accurate. It depends on a few different important prerequisites: virtual reality becoming not just mainstream but near-ubiquitous for more than just games (when this is far from true even for games today), NFTs evolving to become truly powerful object primitives for interoperability rather than <a href="https://boredapeyachtclub.com/">cartoon pictures of apes</a> <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/are-nfts-being-used-for-money-laundering-yes-they-are-claims-mr-whale">that are sometimes used for money laundering</a>, and enough people buying into this new version of the internet that they build worlds, objects, and applications with wild abandon.</p><p>Another version of the metaverse is a “digital overlay for our reality” - or as I’ve often described social media, a backchannel for real life. Here, rather than interconnected worlds, we’re maybe talking about something closer to digital platforms that add value to reality. This fits a little closer to Facebook, which could already be thought of in this way.</p><p>The thing is, none of these platforms exist. It’s a wishful, top-down version of a future internet that is little more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporware">vaporware</a> today. Moreover, although some of the technologies in play this time round are novel, the overall vision has been around for a long time. It’s a bit like a flying car: something we’ve been promised forever but has never quite come to fruition.</p><p>Which isn’t to say that it’s a completely fruitless endeavor. There are lots of good things that could come out of a push for the metaverse. The most obvious of them is interoperability: while internet platforms have operated as silos to date, an interconnected metaverse depends on true interoperability. Those worlds have to work together, and those objects have to be moveable from place to place. The financial incentives also have to be aligned with keeping the platform open. That means building real, open technologies to allow those things to happen, which may well enable other kinds of applications that we haven’t conceived of yet.</p><p>Still, when people talk about the metaverse online right now, it’s important to remember that it doesn’t exist. Unlike the web, say, it’s not a thing. Facebook is clearly serious about it, and lots of money has been thrown at projects like <a href="https://decentraland.org/">Decentraland</a>. But it’s highly likely that if you ask twelve people to define what the metaverse is, you’ll get twelve different definitions. In that sense, <a href="https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse">the metaverse is science fiction: the stuff of aspiration</a>.</p><p>I’d put money on the actual future of the internet being something that nobody really predicted, emerging from an unexpected place. That’s part of why the internet is such an empowering platform to work on. But again - there’s a lot of value in plugging away at a mission, even if it turns out that most of that value is in the journey rather than the end result. I don’t think the metaverse is a real outcome - frankly, it just smells too much of BS to me - but the protocols, communities, and business models it leads to may be.</p><p>I’m fascinated to find out what Facebook’s definition of the metaverse is. I’m also interested to see which challengers enter into the market with a strong, competing vision. Most of all, of course, I’m interested to see what actually happens, and what the future of the platform we all use turns out to be.</p>

It’s responsive, the keyboard is great, and the battery life is long enough that I sometimes forget the thing has a battery at all.</p><p>As an engineer, I wish it leaned a little heavier on the Pro side. In particular, the lack of adequate virtualization means it’s not a suitable device for some kinds of development. That’s a real bummer!</p><p>I’m sure it’s not a permanent situation: the stacks we used virtualization to test and code on will be replaced by something that’s more ARM-compatible. For now, though, it’s a blocker. There are times when I can’t test directly in the cloud - right now, for example, I’m publishing this on in-flight WiFi - and spinning up a local environment is the only real choice.</p><p>Still, it’s generally superb, and I’m looking forward to using mine for many years to come. (I’m not even that jealous of the new machines with a selection of actual ports.) Highly recommended and worth the money.</p>

    Are the consequence of a ½ baked decision that we created (the mess we are in)squared <br><p>This article joins how the #climate outcomes we get may be related to the evidence requirements we set.&nbsp; The audience for this viewpoint is those who are thinking about the long term consequences of our current decisions and the evidence we use to support those decisions. We are hoping to bring a sense of clarity to our community on why we feel frustrated and lost. You should read this because it will make you think and it will raise questions we need to debate over coffee as we search to become better versions of ourselves.&nbsp;</p><p>@yaelrozencwajg @yangbo @tonyfish </p><p>The running order is: Which camp are you in for positioning of the crisis: know and accepted, still questioning or denial. &nbsp; What are the early approaches to solutions?&nbsp; What are policymakers doing and what is their perspective.&nbsp; The action is to accept the invitation to debate at the end.</p><br><p>Part 1. Sustainability set up</p><p>The world appears more opinionated and divided about everything.&nbsp; Climate change: real or not.&nbsp; Vaccination for COVID19 conspiracy and control or in the public best interest.&nbsp; Space travel for billionaires or feeding those in need. Universal basic income policy vs ignoring those aspects of society we find uncomfortable. Equality creates a more fair society or leaves us alone. So many votes are for self-interest, “it is fairer to me.”&nbsp; Transparency will hold those in power to account or it will only make or worse. Open networks might create new business models on the web, but will they be sustainable? Sustainability is a false claim or it is our only option. Like books, and publications it is now complexity that is the tool that ensures power remains with the few.</p><p>We need to unpack the conflictual and tension-filled gaps in our beliefs, opinions and judgment because we depend on evidence to change our views. How evidence is presented and the systematic squeezing out of curiosity frames us and our current views.&nbsp;</p><p>Evidence, in this context, is actually a problem as we have a very divided idea of what evidence is.&nbsp; For some, evidence is a social media post from an influencer with 10 million followers (how can everyone else be wrong).&nbsp; For others a headline on the front of a tabloid newspaper is truth (is it printed.)&nbsp; For others, a statistical peer-reviewed leading journal publication that is cited 100 times is evidence.&nbsp; In terms of evidence for decision making, there is a gap between the evidence requirements for research and the evidence requirements for business decisions.&nbsp; To be clear, it is not that either is better; it is how we frame evidence that matters. The danger is being framed to believe something because there is a mismatch in the evidence requirements for a decision.&nbsp; A single 100% influencer claim without statistical proof say about “fertility” vs a statistical trial with probability highlights both how a claim is only a claim but many will not understand what evidence is.</p><p>Why is this important? Because the evidence we see in journals, TV, media, books and publications have different criteria and credentials to those that inform business decisions.&nbsp; Where is the environmental action being decided; in the board rooms!&nbsp; Is this gap in evidence leading to a sustainability gap?</p><p></p><br><p>Part 2. Analysis from Kahan&nbsp;</p><p>Here is the rub, it turns out that how scientific evidence is presented matters as its very presentation creates division.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://law.yale.edu/dan-m-kahan">Dan Kahan</a>, a Yale behavioural economist, has spent the last decade studying whether the use of reason aggravates or reduces “partisan” beliefs. His research papers are <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=45442">here</a>. His research shows that aggravation and alienation easily win, irrespective of being more liberal or conservative. The more we use our faculties for scientific thought, the more likely we will take a strong position that aligns with our (original) political group (or thought).</p><p>A way through this could be to copy “<a href="https://www.solutionsjournalism.org/">solution journalism</a>”, which reports on ways people and governments meaningfully respond to difficult problems and not on what the data says the problem is. Rather than use our best insights, analysis and thinking to reach the version of the “truth”, we use data to find ways to agree with others opinions in our communities. We help everyone to become curious. Tony Fish has created the <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/">Peak Paradox framework</a> as an approach to remaining curious by identifying where we are aligned and where there is a delta in views without conflict.</p><p>When we use data and science in our arguments and explain the problem, the individuals will selectively credit and discredit information in patterns that reflect their commitment to certain values. They (we) (I) assimilate what they (we)(I) want.</p><p>Kahan, in 2014, asked over <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2459057">1,500 respondents</a> whether they agreed or disagreed with the following statement: “There is solid evidence of recent global warming due mostly to human activity such as burning fossil fuels.” They collected information on individuals' political beliefs and rated their science intelligence.” The analysis found that those with the least science intelligence actually have less partisan positions than those with the most. A Conservative with strong science intelligence will use their skills to find evidence against human-caused global warming, while a Liberal will find evidence for it (cognitive bias.)</p><p></p><p>In the chart above, the y-axis represents the probability of a person agreeing that human activity caused climate change. The x-axis represents the percentile a person scored on the scientific knowledge test. The width of the bars shows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval">confidence interval</a> for that probability.</p><br><p>Part 3. Are our policies being formed by the evidence we like or evidence we have?</p><p>Governments, activists, and the media have gotten better at holding corporations accountable for the societal repercussions of their actions. A plethora of groups score businesses based on their ESG&nbsp; performance, and despite often dubious methodology, these rankings are gathering a lot of attention. As a result, ESG has emerged as an unavoidable concern for corporate executives worldwide. ESG should be for boards for “purpose” or “are we doing the right thing” camp, but instead has ended up in the compliance camp, do the min, tick box.</p><p>For decades businesses have addressed sustainability as an end of pipe problem or afterthought. Rather than fundamentally altering their models to recognise that sustainability and wellbeing are critical parts for long term success, boards have typically delegated social issues to corporate social responsibility, compliance policies, or charitable foundations and associations, thus they publish their findings (which is not evidence) in annual reports. The issue becomes that neither investors nor stakeholders read these sustainability reports. Actually, they shouldn’t either.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Although investors' thinking on sustainability has evolved substantially over the past few decades, sustainability and efficiency leaders have used strategies to pressure corporations to advance a wide range of social concerns such as the SDGs across industries and supply chains, regardless of the financial considerations. As ESG assessments, sustainability reports or guidelines have become more rigorous; this accountability raises essential biases. This “pressure” has resulted in many types of actions and raised many concerns, including in the operational efficiencies supposed to reduce the use of energy and natural resources at the expense of their profitability.</p><p>Whilst it is still unclear if most investors utilise ESGs factors in their investment selection process based on evidence, it is clear that we do side with what we want to hear and not with the science, <a href="https://law.yale.edu/dan-m-kahan">Dan Kahan</a>, in part 2 above, was right.</p><br><p>Part 4. Null Hypothesis H(0) A lack of headspace for most people to think about the complexity of these issues due to meeting performance targets means leadership has to make time. And if it does not, we become the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At what point do people care about something bigger than themselves? This means you as a person have the headspace to move from survival towards thriving. (PeakParadox.com)</p><p>If ⅓ of the world don’t know where the next meal today comes from, they will not have the headspace to worry about sustainability.</p><p>If the next additional ⅓ of the world don’t know where the food will come from for tomorrow, they will not have the headspace to worry about sustainability.</p><p>If the next ⅙ of the world will run out of food and money in 4 weeks - worrying about sustainability is not their most significant concern.</p><p>Less than ⅙ of the world can survive and think beyond four weeks - is that enough to make a difference, and are these people in roles that count?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Between than 0.01% and 0.001%&nbsp; (8m and 80m) people should be able to consider global complexity on the basis that they will never have money or food issues (over $1m in assets), but are they acting together and is their voice enough to make a difference?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Is leadership's first priority to ensure that first ⅚ have enough to survive and worry for them, but are they able to manage this conflict?&nbsp; Which group has the headspace to cope with recycling?&nbsp; What is amazing and worthy of note is that the majority of those who care about the environment, sustainability, recycling have created headspace irrespective of their situation. The argument above was designed to frame your thinking, the reality is we don’t create headspace because we are too busy.</p><p>Part 5.&nbsp; The imposter syndrome: followers are not followers</p><p>Politics (leadership), Business (leadership), Quango/ NGO (leadership), individuals (leadership), influencers (leadership) - all have different agendas, and demands for different outcomes as incentives drive in different directions. &nbsp; We lack sustainable leadership that drives in one direction.&nbsp;</p><p>As a Leader and opinion former, the most troubling finding should be that individuals with more “scientific intelligence” are the quickest to align themselves on subjects they don’t know anything about. In one experiment, Kahan analysed how people’s opinions on an unfamiliar subject are affected when given some basic scientific information, along with details about what people in their self-identified political group tend to believe about that subject. It turned out that those with the strongest scientific reasoning skills were most likely to use the information to develop partisan opinions.</p><p>Critically Kahan’s research shows that people that score well on a measure called “scientific curiosity” actually show less partisanship, and it is this aspect we need to use.</p><p>Do we need to move away from “truth”, “facts”, “data”, and “right decisions” if we want to have a board and senior team who can become aligned? We need to present ideas, concepts, how others are finding solutions and make our teams more curious. Being curious appears to be the best way to bring us together — however counterintuitive that is.&nbsp; But to do that, we have to give up on filling time, productivity, efficiency, effectiveness, keeping people busy and giving more people time to escape survival and work together for the better good.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a systematic squeezing out of curiosity in our current system.&nbsp; Are we to blame through schooling and education, and search engines? Have we lost how to be curious if the fact and truth presented to us is one that just aligns to our natural bias or one that challenges us? &nbsp; Do we spend sufficient time with others' views to be able to improve our own?&nbsp; Has individualism and personalisation created and reinforced our self opinions of our own views are correct?&nbsp; Does the advertising model depend on this divide?<br><br></p><p>Part 6. Conclusion, rationality and irrationality&nbsp; <br><br></p><p>There is a clear message to those in leadership; stop using evidence to create division, push people away or sure up your own camp. How do we take (all) evidence in and use it to ask questions which mean we come together for a common purpose?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Politics becomes irrational as we focus more on the individual and less on society and community. Politicians and policy formation need to be voted in, which means they have to mislead and misrepresent their populations who are acting in their own interests: therefore, we find evidence for decisions for short term gain based on individual preferences and not long term community - this is obvious but has to be said.&nbsp; The same is happening in many corporations.</p><p>Anger is often seen as a rational emotion, but that is because we focus on the evidence we want to justify the action. When you feel under-represented, threatened, or in harm's way - the evidence you want will fit the glove. Understanding how the evidence frames us is what brings value to the process.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Part 7. Call to action: The Road to Sustainability webinar series</p><p>We believe we have to communicate better, talk openly, listen to more, debate to appreciate, be curious and find a route to collaborate. The best way is to do something small.&nbsp; Sign up for the sessions below and bring your evidence, but be prepared to take away different evidence so we can make better decisions together.&nbsp;</p><p>The Road to Sustainability is a content and tool platform and initiative launched in October 2020 that started as a weekly email newsletter providing approaches and strategies to plan sustainability and innovation. We are launching the third edition of our webinar series, following up on the successful two previous versions, “From chaos to recovery: gateway to sustainability”.<br><br>This new series will take place every Monday through 5 meetings from October 4th to November 8th, with a possible extension of the plan.<br><br>The following schedule is based on our approach "<a href="https://event.theroadtosustainability.com.">Roadmap and product management - the new framework for sustainability conversations</a>".

<p>Columns can now have associated metadata descriptions in <code>metadata.json</code>, see <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/metadata.html#metadata-column-descriptions">Column descriptions</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/942">#942</a>)</p>

<p>I've been wanting this for ages. Tables consist of columns, and column names very rarely give you enough information to truly understand the associated data. You can now drop extra column definitions into your <code>metadata.json</code> like so:</p>
  {
  "databases": {

        "cdph-county-cases-deaths": {
          "columns": {

            "confirmed_cases": "The cumulative number of coronavirus cases that were confirmed as of that time. This is sometimes called the episode date by other sources.",
            "reported_cases": "The cumulative number of coronavirus cases that were reported as of that time. This reflects when cases were first announced by the state.",
            "probable_cases": "The cumulative number of probable coronavirus cases that were confirmed as of that time. This reflects the results of antigen tests, a rapid testing technique different from the standard test.",

      }
    }
  }
}  
<p>The LA Times publish <a href="https://github.com/datadesk/california-coronavirus-data/blob/master/README.md#data-dictionary">a meticulous data dictionary</a> for the 46 CSV and GeoJSON files that they maintain tracking the pandemic in their <a href="https://github.com/datadesk/california-coronavirus-data">california-coronavirus-data</a> GitHub repository.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the new column metadata feature, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/simonw/covid-19-datasette/blob/main/build_la_times_metadata.py">a script</a> that converts their Markdown data dictionary into Datasette's metadata format and publishes it along with imported CSV data from their repository.</p>
<p>You can explore the result at <a href="https://covid-19.datasettes.com/la-times">covid-19.datasettes.com/la-times</a> - here's their <a href="https://covid-19.datasettes.com/la-times/cdcr-prison-totals?_sort_desc=date">cdcr-prison-totals</a> table tracking Covid cases in prisons operated by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.</p>

 register_commands() plugin hook 
<blockquote>
<p>New <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-register-commands">register_commands()</a> plugin hook allows plugins to register additional Datasette CLI commands, e.g. <code>datasette mycommand file.db</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1449">#1449</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I originally built this because I thought I would need it for <a href="https://datasette.io/desktop">Datasette Desktop</a>, then found it wasn't necessary for that project after all.</p>
<p>I held off on implementing this for quite a while on the basis that plugins which needed their own CLI interface could implement one entirely separately as a Click-based CLI app - <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/dogsheep-beta">dogsheep-beta</a> implements this pattern, offering both a <code>dogsheep-beta index</code> command and registering itself as a Datasette plugin.</p>
<p>The problem with plugins implementing their own separate CLI commands is that users then need to understand where they have been installed. Datasette is designed to work well with virtual environments, but if a plugin is installed into a virtual environment I can't guarantee that any CLI tools it includes will execute when the user types their name.</p>
<p>Now that plugins can register <code>datasette subcommand</code> subcommands this problem has a solution: provided users can run <code>datasette</code> they'll also be able to run CLI commands provided by plugins, without needing to understand how to modify their path.</p>
<p>I expect this to be particularly useful for Datasette installed through Homebrew, which invisibly sets up its own virtual environment into which plugins can be installed using <code>datasette install plugin-name</code>.</p>
 Count unique facet values with ?_facet_size=max 
<blockquote>
<p>Adding <code>?_facet_size=max</code> to a table page now shows the number of unique values in each facet. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1423">#1423</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I'm using facets to explore data, I'm often interested in how many values are available in the facet - particularly if I'm faceting by a column such as country or state.</p>
<p>I added a <code>...</code> link to show the maximim number of facets in <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-57">Datasette 0.57</a>. Clicking that link adds <code>?_facet_size=max</code> to the URL, which now also adds a numeric count of the number of distinct facet values.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://covid-19.datasettes.com/la-times/cdcr-prison-totals?_sort_desc=date&amp;_facet=name&amp;_facet_size=max#facet-name">an example</a> using that Californian prison data.</p>
<p></p>
 Upgrading httpx 
<blockquote>
<p>Upgraded dependency <a href="https://github.com/encode/httpx/releases/tag/0.20.0">httpx 0.20</a> - the undocumented <code>allow_redirects=</code> parameter to <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html#internals-datasette-client">datasette.client</a> is now <code>follow_redirects=</code>, and defaults to <code>False</code> where it previously defaulted to <code>True</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1488">#1488</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A while ago Tom Christie <a href="https://github.com/encode/httpx/discussions/1785">requested feedback</a> on how <code>httpx</code> should handle redirects.</p>
<p>The <code>requests</code> library that inspired it automatically follows 301 and 302 redirects unless you explicitly tell it not to.</p>
<p>I've been caught out by this many times in the past - it's not default behaviour that I want from my HTTP client library - so I chimed in as favouring a change in behaviour. I also suggested that <code>follow_redirects=True</code> would be a better term for it than <code>allow_redirects=True</code>.</p>
<p>Tom made that change for <code>httpx 1.0</code>, and then back-ported it for <a href="https://github.com/encode/httpx/releases/tag/0.20.0">version 0.20</a> - after all, pre-1.0 you're allowed to make breaking changes like this.</p>
<p>... and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1488">Datasette broke, hard</a>! Datasette embeds <code>httpx</code> pretty deeply inside itself, and the breaking change caused all kinds of errors and test failures.</p>
<p>This was the final push I needed to get 0.59 released.</p>
<p>(I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1493">just found out</a> this also broke the Homebrew tests for Datasette, as those relied on <code>datasette --get '/:memory:.json?sql=select+3*5'</code> automatically following the redirect to <code>/_memory.json?sql=select+3*5</code> instead.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Code that figures out which named parameters a SQL query takes in order to display form fields for them is no longer confused by strings that contain colon characters. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1421">#1421</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of my favourite obscure features of Datasette is the way it can take a SQL query such as the following:</p>
  select * from [cdcr-prison-totals]
where "zipcode" = :zip  
<p>And extract out that <code>:zip</code> parameter and turn it into an HTML form field, <a href="https://covid-19.datasettes.com/la-times?sql=select+*+from+%5Bcdcr-prison-totals%5D+where+%22zipcode%22+%3D+%3Azip&amp;zip=93212">as seen here</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This used to use a regular expression, which meant that it could be confused by additional colons - the following SQL query for example:</p>
  select * from content
where created_time = '07:00'
and author = :author  
<p>I thought that solving this properly would require embedding a full SQLite-compatible SQL parser in Datasette.</p>
<p>Then I realized SQLite's <code>explain</code> output included exactly the data I needed, <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures?sql=explain+select+id%2C+name+from+facet_cities+where+%22name%22+%3D+%3Aname&amp;name=Los+Angeles">for example</a>:</p>

<p>The trick then is to run an explain, then find any rows with an <code>opcode</code> of <code>Variable</code> and read the <code>p4</code> register to find out the name of those variables.</p>
<p>This is risky, since SQLite makes no promises about the stability of the explain output - but it's such a useful trick that I'm now contemplating building an automated test suite around it such that if a future SQLite release breaks things I will at least know about it promptly.</p>

<p>The <code>--cors</code> option now causes Datasette to return the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization</code> header, in addition to <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/pull/1467">#1467</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was a feature request from users of the <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-auth-tokens">datasette-auth-tokens</a> plugin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Renamed <code>--help-config</code> option to <code>--help-settings</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1431">#1431</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Part of my continuing goal to free up the term "config" to mean plugin configuration (which is currently mixed up with Datasette's metadata concept) rather than meaning the options that can be passed to the Datasette CLI tool (now called <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/settings.html">settings</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>datasette.databases</code> property is now a documented API. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1443">#1443</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've got into the habit of documenting any Datasette internals that I use in a plugin. In this case I needed it <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-block-robots/commit/f947bcc7e56de3eedd7c402d10888ff59babb905">for datasette-block-robots</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>base.html</code> template now wraps everything other than the <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> in a <code>&lt;div class="not-footer"&gt;</code> element, to help with advanced CSS customization. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1446">#1446</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I made this change so that Datasette Desktop could more easily implement <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app-support/blob/0.11.5/datasette_app_support/static/sticky-footer.css">a sticky footer</a> that stuck to the bottom of the application window no matter how short or tall it was.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-render-cell">render_cell()</a> plugin hook can now return an awaitable function. This means the hook can execute SQL queries. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1425">#1425</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another example of the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Sep/2/await-me-maybe/">await me maybe</a> pattern in action.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-register-routes">register_routes(datasette)</a> plugin hook now accepts an optional <code>datasette</code> argument. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1404">#1404</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means plugins can conditionally register routes based on plugin configuration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New <code>hide_sql</code> canned query option for defaulting to hiding the SQL query used by a canned query, see <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/sql_queries.html#canned-queries-options">Additional canned query options</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1422">#1422</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The goal of canned queries is to provide an interface for people who don't know SQL to execute queries written by other people, potentially providing their own inputs using the <code>:parameter</code> mechanism described above.</p>
<p>If it's being used for that, there's not much to be gained from making them scroll past the SQL query first!</p>
<p>Adding <code>"hide_sql": true</code> to the canned query configuration now defaults to hiding the query for them - though they can still click "Show SQL" to see it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New <code>--cpu</code> option for <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/publish.html#publish-cloud-run">datasette publish cloudrun</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1420">#1420</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google Cloud Run recently <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/cpu">added the ability</a> to specify 1, 2 or 4 vCPUs when running a deploy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If <a href="https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich">Rich</a> is installed in the same virtual environment as Datasette, it will be used to provide enhanced display of error tracebacks on the console. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1416">#1416</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich">Rich</a> is  Will McGugan's phenomenal Python library for building beautiful console interfaces. One of the many tricks up its sleeve is improved display of exceptions, including more detailed tracebacks and local variables. Datasette now takes advantage of this if Rich is installed in the same virtual environment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>datasette.utils</code> <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html#internals-utils-parse-metadata">parse_metadata(content)</a> function, used by the new <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-remote-metadata">datasette-remote-metadata plugin</a>, is now a documented API. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1405">#1405</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another API that became documented after I used it in a plugin.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-remote-metadata">datasette-remote-metadata</a> plugin is pretty neat.</p>
<p>I sometimes find myself working on projects where I'm deploying a large database file - 1 or 2 GB - to Google Cloud Run. Each deploy can take several minutes.</p>
<p>If I want to tweak a canned query or a few lines of text in the metadata for that deployment, it can be frustrating to have to push an entirely new deploy just to make those changes.</p>
<p>The remote metadata plugin allows me to host the metadata at a separate URL, which I can then update without needing a full deploy of the underlying database files.</p>
<p>The last two were simple bug fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Fixed bug where <code>?_next=x&amp;_sort=rowid</code> could throw an error. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1470">#1470</a>) 
 Column cog menu no longer shows the option to facet by a column that is already selected by the default facets in metadata. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1469">#1469</a>)

<blockquote>"It was hard to write, it should be hard to use" </blockquote><p>The quote above was something a programmer friend of mine used to say in the '90s and, despite all the advances in user experience or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design">UX design</a>, it appears to remain effectively true. Let's look at the experience over this past weekend with the newly rolled out <a href="https://covid-19.ontario.ca/proof-covid-19-vaccination">enhanced vaccine certificate</a> in Ontario.</p><p>Let me preface this by saying that I appreciate that this may be version 1 of a certificate with a QR code and that my comments are intended for an improved version 1.x or 2 of the proof of vaccination. I should also note that CBC has already pointed out that <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/vaccine-certificate-accessibility-1.6213934">Ontario's enhanced vaccine certificate system is not accessible to marginalized people</a>.</p> Downloading the Certificate <p>You will need to go to <a href="https://covid-19.ontario.ca/get-proof/">https://covid-19.ontario.ca/get-proof/</a> and answer the following questions:</p>  How many doses of the COVID-19 vaccine do you currently have? (required)   Did you get all your doses in Ontario? (required)  Select which health card you have (required)  Do you identify as First Nations, Inuit, or Métis? (required) If you are a non-Indigenous partner or household member of someone in this group, select "Yes."  A couple of more clicks (get the certificate through the website or get it by mail or print it at a local library, ServiceOntario location, or call a friend and you will be asked to agree to the <a href="https://covid19.ontariohealth.ca/app-terms">Terms of Service</a> which includes the following:  <blockquote>By inputting your personal information and personal health information into the COVID-19 Vaccination Services you are agreeing to the ministry's collection, use and disclosure of this information for the purpose of researching, investigating, eliminating or reducing the current COVID-19 outbreak and as permitted or required by law in accordance with PHIPA as set out above. You also agree that your information will be made available to the Public Health Unit(s) in Ontario responsible for your geographic area for the same purpose.</blockquote><blockquote>More specifically, by using COVID-19 Vaccination Services, you consent to the ministry collecting identifying information, including personal health information, about you that you submit through the patient verification page so that the Ministry can ensure that it correctly identifies you for the purpose of administering the COVID-19 vaccination program.</blockquote><blockquote>Neither the ministry nor the Public Health Unit(s) in Ontario will further use or disclose your personal information or personal health information except for the purposes set out above.</blockquote><p>When you click on the "Get a copy" button you may be asked to wait because a virtual queue is being used to throttle traffic. When you get through you will be asked to provide information from your health card. I have a green OHIP card with a photo so I get this screen:</p><p>Assuming the information is correct you will be shown your new certificate, including a QR code (more on this later) as a PDF. At this point, it is on you to print out copies of the two-page certificate and carry them with you. I took it upon myself to crop the certificate to include just my name, birth date &amp; the QR code and print it out small enough that I could put it in a laminating pouch and carry it in my wallet. This enables me to go to my wallet, pull out the laminate and my driving license, and have both ready for presentation. For me, that is the simplest and easiest way. Your mileage may vary since my approach requires being comfortable with basic pdf or graphic editing and having access to a printer. I also put electronic copies on my phone so that I could use that option </p> Verifying the certificate <p>Here is what I observed at brunch (shout out to the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Restaurant_Review-g155019-d796688-Reviews-Sunset_Grill-Toronto_Ontario.html">Sunset Grill on the Danforth</a>).</p>  Staff person asks for Proof of Vaccine  Customer digs out their phone or paper copy of the certificate  The staff person looks at it (or uses the Ontario Verify App)  Staff person asks for a government-issued ID  Customer digs out their driver's license  The staff person looks at the ID and verifies the name   We can do better <p>What I oberved is NOT a user-friendly experience for either the customer or the business. For the experience to be improved it needs to be a single presentation operation of either a paper or digital certificate that the business can verify in one step. Here's an example that I mocked up some months ago (the picture is from <a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/">https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/</a>)</p><p>This provides the following functionality:</p>  The existing QR code will return the same (i.e. green checkmark in the event of a good code)  The verifier (staff person) can compare the photo on the card with the person in front of them rather than asking for a government ID.  Digital verification may have the option of showing the verifier the picture on the verify app for increased assurance. Note that the Ministry of Health is already authorized to have pictures for the current health card.   Privacy and Security <p>The advantage of a paper and ID card presentation ritual is that it is difficult to hack. So if we are going to improve the presentation with a single credential as above, privacy and security MUST be protected. This is why a version 1 that is paper/PDF only is not a bad security and privacy choice. On the <a href="https://covid-19.ontario.ca/verify">Verify Ontario </a>app side, both the <a href="https://covid-19.ontario.ca/verify-terms-of-use">terms of use</a> and <a href="https://covid-19.ontario.ca/verify-privacy">privacy statement</a> are reasonably clear (although the choice to use Google Analytics could be questioned) and make the right commitments &nbsp;</p> Recommendations  Provide retailers with a verifier <p>It's nice that the Ontario Verify app is freely downloadable. I used it to check that the laminated cards that I made from my own certificate were readable. But this puts the burden on the retailer and their staff. When I saw someone come in with their QR code, the waitress had to dig out her personal phone and use that. Not a good solution. Either the provincial government or public health should provide retailers with a low to zero cost option to procure their own tablets for use on entry to the store.</p> Provide Ontarians with options <p>For example:</p>  I'm relatively tech-savvy so I'd be happy with a QR code/certificate I could add to a wallet app on my phone for easy display without fumbling around.  ServiceOntario should provide a service to produce laminated wallet cards WITH photos to any Ontarian who shows up at a ServiceOntario site.  On a go-forward basis, ensure that people attending vaccination clinics get printouts of their QR code based certificates WHEN they get vaccinated since the certificate includes the date of vaccination and presumably the QR code won't return a "Green" until the appropriate dated  <p>With all of the above said, I have to say I'm happy that Ontario's first steps for vaccine certificates appear to have respected Ontarians' privacy and look to be built securely. I look forward to the next couple of weeks because I'm sure that security people will be pounding on the service to find flaws. WHEN they find flaws, let's hope that the province is responsive so that we can all benefit. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This article shows how to create Microsoft Teams meetings in ASP.NET Core using Microsoft Graph with application permissions. This is useful if you have a designated account to manage or create meetings, send emails or would like to provide a service for users without an office account to create meetings. This is a follow up post to part one in this series which creates Teams meetings using delegated permissions. </p>

  <a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/09/20/creating-microsoft-teams-meetings-in-asp-net-core-using-microsoft-graph/">Creating Microsoft Teams meetings in ASP.NET Core using Microsoft Graph</a> (delegated)  



<p>Setup Azure App registration</p>



<p>A simple ASP.NET Core application with no authentication was created and implements a form which creates online meetings on behalf of a designated account using Microsoft Graph with application permissions. The Microsoft Graph client uses an Azure App registration for authorization and the client credentials flow is used to authorize the client and get an access token. No user is involved in this flow and the application requires administration permissions in the Azure App registration for Microsoft Graph. </p>



<p>An Azure App registration is setup to authenticate against Azure AD. The ASP.NET Core application will use application permissions for the Microsoft Graph. The listed permissions underneath are required to create the Teams meetings OBO and to send emails to the attendees using the configuration email which has access to office.</p>



<p>Microsoft Graph application permissions:</p>



  User.Read.All  Mail.Send   Mail.ReadWrite   OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite.All  



<p>This is the list of permissions I have activate for this demo. </p>







<p>Configuration</p>



<p>The Azure AD configuration is used to get a new access token for the Microsoft Graph client and to define the email of the account which is used to create Microsoft Teams meetings and also used to send emails to the attendees. This account needs an office account.</p>


  "AzureAd": {
	"TenantId": "5698af84-5720-4ff0-bdc3-9d9195314244",
	"ClientId": "b9be5f88-f629-46b0-ac4c-c5a4354ac192",
	// "ClientSecret": "add secret to the user secrets"
	"MeetingOrganizer": "--your-email-for-sending--"
},
  


<p>Setup Client credentials flow to for Microsoft Graph</p>



<p>A number of different ways can be used to authorize a Microsoft Graph client and is a bit confusing sometimes. Using the DefaultCredential is not really a good idea for Graph because you need to decide if you use a delegated authorization or a application authorization and the DefaultCredential will take the first one which works and this depends on the environment. For application authorization, I use the  ClientSecretCredential Identity to get the service access token. This requires the .default scope and a client secret or a client credential. Using a client secret is fine if you control both client and server and the secret is stored in an Azure Key Vault. A client certificate could also be used.</p>


  private GraphServiceClient GetGraphClient()
{
	string[] scopes = new[] { "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default" };
	var tenantId = _configuration["AzureAd:TenantId"];

	// Values from app registration
	var clientId = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureAd:ClientId");
	var clientSecret = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureAd:ClientSecret");

	var options = new TokenCredentialOptions
	{
		AuthorityHost = AzureAuthorityHosts.AzurePublicCloud
	};

	// https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.identity.clientsecretcredential
	var clientSecretCredential = new ClientSecretCredential(
		tenantId, clientId, clientSecret, options);

	return new GraphServiceClient(clientSecretCredential, scopes);
}
  


<p>The IConfidentialClientApplication interface could also be used to get access tokens which is used to authorize the Graph client. A simple in memory cache is used to store the access token. This token is reused until it expires or the application is restart. If using multiple instances, maybe a distributed cache would be better. The client uses the “<a href="https://graph.microsoft.com/.default&amp;#8221">https://graph.microsoft.com/.default&amp;#8221</a>; scope to get an access token for the Microsoft Graph client. A GraphServiceClient instance is returned with a value access token. </p>


  public class ApiTokenInMemoryClient

	private readonly IHttpClientFactory _clientFactory;

<p>OnlineMeetings Graph Service</p>



<p>The AadGraphApiApplicationClient service is used to send the Microsoft Graph requests. This uses the graphServiceClient client with the correct access token. The GetUserIdAsync method is used to get the Graph Id using the UPN. This is used in the Users API to run the requests with the application scopes. The Me property is not used as this is for delegated scopes. We have no user in this application. We run the requests as an application on behalf of the designated user.</p>


  public class AadGraphApiApplicationClient
{
	private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

	public AadGraphApiApplicationClient(IConfiguration configuration)
	{
		_configuration = configuration;
	}

	private async Task&lt;string&gt; GetUserIdAsync()
	{
		var meetingOrganizer = _configuration["AzureAd:MeetingOrganizer"];
		var filter = $"startswith(userPrincipalName,'{meetingOrganizer}')";

	}

	public async Task SendEmailAsync(Message message)
	{

		var userId = await GetUserIdAsync();

		await graphServiceClient.Users[userId]

	}

	private GraphServiceClient GetGraphClient()

<p>The startup class adds the services as required. No authentication is added for the ASP.NET Core application.</p>


  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	services.AddScoped&lt;AadGraphApiApplicationClient&gt;();
	services.AddSingleton&lt;ApiTokenInMemoryClient&gt;();
	services.AddScoped&lt;EmailService&gt;();
	services.AddScoped&lt;TeamsService&gt;();
	services.AddHttpClient();
	services.AddOptions();

	services.AddRazorPages();
}
  


<p>Azure Policy configuration</p>



<p>We need to allow applications to access online meetings on behalf of a user with this setup. This is implemented using the following documentation:</p>



<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/cloud-communication-online-meeting-application-access-policy">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/cloud-communication-online-meeting-application-access-policy</a></p>



<p>Testing</p>



<p>When the application is started, you can create a new Teams meeting with the required details. The configuration email must have an account with access to Office and be on the same tenant as the Azure App registration setup for the Microsoft Graph application permissions. The Email must have a policy setup to allow the Microsoft Graph calls. The Teams meeting is organized using the identity that signed in because we used the applications permissions. </p>







<p>This works really well and can be used for Azure B2C solutions as well. If possible, you should only use delegated scopes in the application, if possible. By using application permissions, the ASP.NET Core is implicitly an administrator of these permissions as well. It would be better if user accounts with delegated access was used which are managed by your IT etc. </p>

<p><br>
The <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=worldwide+shipping+crisis">worldwide shipping crisis</a> is bad. Here are some reasons:</p>
 
 “Just in time” manufacturing, shipping, delivery, and logistics. For several decades, the whole supply system has been optimized for “lean” everything. On the whole, no part of it fully comprehends breakdowns outside the scope of immediate upstream or downstream dependencies. 
 The pandemic, which has been depriving nearly every sector of labor, intelligence, leadership, data, and much else, since early last year. 
 Catastrophes. The largest of these was the <a>2021 Suez Canal Obstruction</a>, which has had countless effects upstream and down. 
 Competing narratives. Humans can’t help reducing all complex situations to stories, all of which require protagonists, problems, and movement toward resolution. It’s how our minds are built, and why it’s hard to look more deeply and broadly at any issue and why it’s here. (For more on that, see <a>Where Journalism Fails</a>.) 
 Corruption. This is endemic to every complex economy: construction, <a href="http://j.mp/adbwars">online advertising</a>, high finance, whatever. It happens here too. (And, like incompetence, it tends to worsen in a crisis.) 
 Bureacracies &amp; non-harmonized regulations. More about this below*. 
 Complicating secondary and tertiary effects. The most obvious of these is inflation. Says <a href="https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/supply-chain-breakdown-its-causes-and-effects>">here</a>, “the spot rate for a 40-foot shipping container from Shanghai to Los&nbsp;Angeles rising from about $3,500 last year to $12,500 as of the end of&nbsp;September.” I’ve since heard numbers as high as $50,000. And, of course, inflation also happens for other reasons, which further complicates things. 
 
<p>To wrap one’s head around all of those (and more), it might help to start with Aristotle’s four “causes” (which might also be translated as “explanations”). Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes">illustrates these</a> with a wooden dining table:</p>
 
 Its material cause is wood. 
 Its efficient cause is carpentry. 
 Its final cause is dining. 
 Its formal cause (what gives it form) is design. 
 
<p>Of those, formal cause is what matters most. That’s because, without knowledge of what a table is, it wouldn’t get made.</p>
<p>But the worldwide supply chain (which is less a single chain than braided rivers spreading outward from many sources through countless deltas) is impossible to reduce to any one formal cause. Mining, manufacturing, harvesting, shipping on sea and land, distribution, wholesale and retail sales are all involved, and specialized in their own ways, dependencies withstanding.</p>
<p>I suggest, however, that the most formal of the supply chain problem’s causes is also what’s required to sort out and solve it: digital technology and the Internet. From <a href="https://bit.ly/make_us">What does the Internet make of us?</a>, sourcing the McLuhans:</p>
<blockquote><p>“People don’t want to know the cause of anything”, Marshall said (and Eric quotes, in&nbsp;Media and Formal Cause). “They do not want to know why radio caused Hitler and Gandhi alike. They do not want to know that print caused anything whatever. As users of these media, they wish merely to get inside…”</p></blockquote>
<p>We are all inside a digital environment that is making each of us while also making our systems. This can’t be reversed. But it can be improved.</p>
<p>One way might be to build ways to fully (or at least adequately) comprehend whole systems that subsume and transcend the scope and interests of any part, whether those parts be truckers, laws, standards, or whatever. Global aviation has some of this, but it’s also a much simpler system than the braided rivers between global supply and demand.</p>
<p>Is there something like that? I don’t yet know. Closest I’ve found is the UN’s <a href="https://www.imo.org/">IMO (International Maritime Organizaiton)</a>, and that only covers “the safety and security of shipping and the&nbsp;prevention of marine and atmospheric pollution&nbsp;by ships.” Not very encompassing, that. If any of ya’ll know more, fill us in.</p>
<p>[*Added 18 October]&nbsp;Just attended a talk by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oswaldkuyler/">Oswald Kuyler</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/international-chamber-icc-leader-for-digital-standards">Managing Director</a>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href="https://iccwbo.org/">International Chamber of Commerce</a>‘s <a href="https://iccwbo.org/media-wall/news-speeches/icc-digital-initiatives-that-will-equip-business-for-the-next-century-of-global-trade/">Digital Standards initiative</a>, on an “Integrated Approach” by his and allied organizations that addresses “digital islands,” “no single view of available standards” both open and closed, “limited investments into training, change management and adoption,” “lack of enabling rules and regulations,” “outdated regulation,” “privacy law barriers,” “trade standard adoption gaps,” “costly technical integration,” “fragmentation” that “prevents paperless trade,” and other factors. Yet he also says the whole thing is “bent but not broken,” and that (says one slide) “trade and supply chain prove more resilient than imagined.”</p>
<p>Another relevant .org is the <a href="https://www.ics-shipping.org/">International Chamber of Shipping</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, Heather Cox Richardson (whose <a href="https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/">newsletter</a> I highly recommend) <a href="https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/october-13-2021">yesterday</a> summarized what the Biden administration is trying to do about all this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Biden also announced today a deal among a number of different players to try to relieve the&nbsp;supply chain slowdowns that have built up as people turned to online shopping during the&nbsp;pandemic. Those slowdowns threaten the delivery of packages for the holidays, and Biden has&nbsp;pulled together government officials, labor unions, and company ownership to solve the&nbsp;backup.</p>
<p>The Port of Los Angeles, which handles 40% of the container traffic coming into the U.S., has&nbsp;had container ships stuck offshore for weeks. In June, Biden put together a Supply Chain&nbsp;Disruption Task Force, which has hammered out a deal. The port is going to begin operating&nbsp;around the clock, seven days a week. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union has&nbsp;agreed to fill extra shifts. And major retailers, including Walmart, FedEx, UPS, Samsung,&nbsp;Home Depot, and Target, have agreed to move quickly to clear their goods out of the dock&nbsp;areas, speeding up operations to do it and committing to putting teams to work extra hours.</p>
<p>“The supply chain is essentially in the hands of the private sector,” a White House official told&nbsp;Donna Littlejohn of the&nbsp;Los Angeles Daily News, “so we need the private sector…to help solve&nbsp;these problems.” But Biden has brokered a deal among the different stakeholders to end what&nbsp;was becoming a crisis.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hopefully helpful, but not sufficient.</p>

  <br>For the past 50 years, most business leaders in free market-based economies have been taught or trained in a core ideology; "that the purpose of business is to serve only the shareholder". The source was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman">#MiltonFriedman</a>. Whilst shareholder primacy is simple and allows businesses to optimise for one thing, which has an advantage in terms of decision making, it has also created significant damage. It does not stand up to modern critique and challenges such as ESG. Importantly there is an assumption that a shareholder group was a united and unified collective. <br> There is an assumption: shareholders are united and unified  <br>The reality is that in a public or investor-led company, the shareholders are as diverse in terms of vision, rationale, purpose and expectation as any standard group of associated parties. Shareholders as a group rarely have an entirely homogeneous objective. Given the dominance of shareholder primacy, how do we know this concept of non-homogeneous actors is genuine. Because there are conflicts among shareholders, which is so large, it constitutes a topic of high practical relevance for academic interest. Two areas dominate research in this area, board performance and board dynamics. Particular attention has been given to conflict that arises when ownership is shared between a dominant, controlling shareholder and minority shareholders. <br><br><br><br><br>The majority and dominant shareholders have incentives to pursue personal goals through the business as they disproportionately gain the benefits but do not fully bear the economic risks and can misuse their power to exploit minority shareholders. That is, the majority shareholder may push management and the board to pursue objectives that align with their own priorities but that are detrimental for the minority shareholder. Studies have shown that such conflicts negatively affect a firm's performance, valuation, and innovation. In listed companies, market regulators, using minority protection clauses, try to avoid this abuse of power, but in private equity markets, there is no regulator to prevent this conflict.<br><br>Surprisingly, however, far less research has examined whether and how different types of shareholders (even stakeholders) can complement each other so that mutual benefits arise. <br><br>In a recent study examining shareholder relationships in privately held firms, the outcomes of private equity investments in privately held family businesses were compared. This research hypothesis was to test if the objectives of professional investors and family owners differ. PE investors focus on maximising financial returns through a medium-term exit and generally have lower levels of risk aversion. Family shareholders, in contrast, generally have most of their wealth concentrated in a single firm, hold longer time horizons, and are often particularly concerned about non-economic benefits the firm brings to the family (e.g., reputation in the community). What is clear is that the reason to trade and have a purpose is critical for any alignment to emerge. <br><br>We know that boards and management need to be informed and review shareholders' objectives. Shareholders need to be informed and review the extent to which they are still aligned in terms of time horizons, risk preferences, need for cash, prioritising financial goals, and whether control or dominance of an agenda is constructive or destructive. Which is the segway to the Peak Paradox mapping above. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The fundamental issue is that we <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/plotting-how-to-make-better-decisions">cannot make decisions at Peak Paradox</a> and have to move towards a Peak to determine what we are optimising for. For shareholders who optimise for Peak Individual Purpose will want to use a dominant position or minority protection to force an agenda to their own goals. A high performing board, perceived, will optimise towards Peak Work Purpose. This included commercial and noncommercial, where commercial boards will optimise for a single objective such as shareholder primacy. What becomes evident at this point is the question about diversity. Dominant shareholders can create environments where the lack of diversity or thinking, experience, motivation, purpose and incentives serves them and their objectives. This will also be seen as a board that does not ask questions, cannot deal with conflict and avoids tension. Finally, if we move towards optimising for a better society (Peak Social Purpose), we find that we move towards serving stakeholders. <br><br> Will society be better off because this business exists? <br>The critical point here is that stakeholders cannot live with Peak Paradox's decision-making and have to find something to optimise for and align to. This will not be a three or five-year plan but a reason for the business to exist. At Peak Paradox, the most important questions get asked, such as "Will society be better off because this business exists?" Because the same data should present a yes and no answer, and the board needs to justify why it believes it should.

  <p>Summary:      The hype over NFTs and collectibles is blinding us to their true usefulness as trustworthy persistent data objects. How do they sit in the landscape with verifiable credentials and picos?</p>




<p>
    Listening to this <a href="https://www.reality2cast.com/87?t=0">Reality 2.0 podcast about NFTs</a> with <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a>, <a href="https://katherinedruckman.com">Katherine Druckman</a>, and their guest <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/users/greg-bledsoe">Greg Bledsoe</a> got me thinking about NFTs. <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/03/what_we_learn_about_self-sovereignty_from_cryptokitties.shtml">I first wrote about NFTs</a> in 2018 regarding what was perhaps the first popular NFT: Cryptokitties. I bought a few and played with them, examined the contract code, and was thinking about how they might enable self-sovereignty, or not. I wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>[E]ach kitty has some interesting properties:</p>
     
         Each Kitty is distinguishable from all the rest and has a unique identity and existence 
         Each kitty is owned by someone. Specifically, it is controlled by whoever has the private keys associated with the address that the kitty is tied to. 
     
</blockquote>
<p>
    This is a good description of the properties of NFTs in general. Notice that nothing here says that NFTs have to be about art, or collectibles, although that's the primary use case right now that's generating so much hype. Cryptokitties were more interesting than most of the NFT use cases right now because the smart contract allowed them to be remixed to produce new kitties (for a fee).
</p>

<p>
    Suppose I rewrote the quote from my post on Cryptokitties like this:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>[E]ach verifiable credential (VC) has some interesting properties:</p>
     
         Each VC is distinguishable from all the rest and has a unique identity and existence 
         Each VC is owned by someone. Specifically, it is controlled by whoever has the private keys associated with the address that the VC was issued to. 
     
</blockquote>
<p>
    Interesting, no? So, if these properties are true for both NFTs and verifiable credentials, what's the difference? The primary difference is that right now, we envision VC issuers to be institutions, like the DMV, your bank, or employer. And institutions are centralized. In contrast, because NFTs are created using a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, we think of them as decentralized. But, not so fast. As I noted in my post on Cryptokitties, you can't assume an NFT is decentralized without examining the smart contract.

<blockquote>
    <p>There is one problem with CryptoKitties as a model of self-sovereignty: the CryptoKitty smart contract has a "pause" function that can be executed by certain addresses. This is probably a protection against bugs—no one wants to be the next <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)">theDAO</a>—but it does provide someone besides the owner with a way to shut it all down.</p>
    <p>I have no idea who that someone is and can't hold them responsible for their behavior—I'd guess it's someone connected with CryptoKitties. Whoever has control of these special addresses could shutdown the entire enterprise. I do not believe, based on the contract structure, that they could take away individual kitties; it's an all or nothing proposition. Since they charged money for setting this up, there's likely some contract law that could be used for recourse. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    So, without looking at the code for the smart contract, it's hard to say that a particular NFT is decentralized or not. They may be just as centralized as your bank1.  
</p>

<p>
    To examine this more closely, let's look at a property title, like a car title, as an example. The DMV could decide to issue car titles as verifiable credentials tomorrow. And the infrastructure to support it is all there: well-supported open source code, companies to provide issuing software and wallets, and specifications and protocols for <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/10/ugh_theres_an_app_for_that.shtml">interoperability</a>2. Nothing has to change politically for that to happen. 
</p>

<p>
    The DMV could also issue car titles as NFTs. With an NFT, I'd prove I own the car by exercising control over the private key that controls the NFT representing the car title. The state might do this to provide more automation for car transfers. Here too, they'd have to find an infrastructure provider to help them, ensure they had a usable wallet to store the title, and interact with the smart contract. I don't know how interoperable this would be.
</p>

<p>
    Suppose I want to sell the car. With a verifiable credential, the state would still be there, revoking the VC representing my title to the car and issuing a new VC to the buyer when the title transfers. The record of who owns what is still the database at the DMV. With NFTs we can get rid of that database. So, selling my car now becomes something that might happen in a decentralized way, without the state as an intermediary. Note that they could do this and still retain a regulatory interest in car titling if they control the smart contract.
</p>

<p>
    But, the real value of issuing a car title as an NFT would be if it were done using a smart contract in a way that decentralized car titles. If you imagine a world of self-driving cars that own and sell themselves, then that's interesting.  You could also imagine that we want to remove the DMV from the business of titling cars altogether. That's a big political lift, but if you dream of a world with much smaller government, then NFT-based car titles might be a way to do that. But I think it's a ways off. So, we could use NFTs for car titles, but right now there's not much point besides the automation.  
</p>

<p>
    You can also imagine a much more decentralized future for verifiable credentials. There's no reason a smart contract couldn't issue and revoke verifiable credentials according to rules embodied in the code. Sphereon has an <a href="https://sphereon.com/solution/integration-of-verifiable-credentials-for-daml-workflows/">integration between</a> verifiable credentials and the <a href="https://github.com/digital-asset/daml#readme">Digital Assets Markup Language (DAML)</a>, a smart contract language. Again, how decentralized the application is depends on the smart contract, but decentralized, institution-independent verifiable credentials are possible. 
</p>

<p>
    A decade ago, Lucas, Ballay, and McManus wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B008SGNFJQ/windleyofente-20">Trillions: Thriving in the Emerging Information Ecology</a>. One of the ideas they talked about was something they called a persistent data object (PDO). I was <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2012/12/programing_the_cloud_with_persistent_data_objects.shtml">intrigued by persistent data objects</a> because of the work we'd been doing at Kynetx on personal clouds. In applying the idea of PDOs, I quickly realized that what we were doing was much more than data because our persistent data objects also encapsulated code and the name <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/07/ten_reasons_to_use_picos_for_your_next_decentralized_programming_project.shtml">persistent compute objects, or picos</a> was born.
</p>

<p>
    An NFT is one possible realization of Trillion's PDOs. So are verifiable credentials. Both are <a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/verifiable-credentials-arent-credentials-they-re-containers-fab5b3ae5c0">persistent containers for data</a>. They are both <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X20303067">capable of inspiring confidence</a> that the data they contain has <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/fidelity_provenance_and_trust.shtml">fidelity and, perhaps, a trustworthy provenance</a>. A pico is an agent. Picos can:
    </p> 
         have a wallet that holds and exchanges NFTs and credentials according to the rules encapsulated in the pico.  
         be programmed to interact with the smart contract for an NFT to perform the legal operations. 
         be programmed to receive, hold, and present verifiable credentials according to the proper <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">DIDCommm protocols</a>.3  
     
<p></p>

	Relationship between NFTs, verifiable credentials, and picos (click to enlarge)


<p>
    NFTs are currently in their awkward, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pets.com">Pets.com</a> stage. Way too much hype and many myopic use cases. But I think they'll grow to have valuable uses in creating more decentralized, trustworthy data objects. If you listen to the reality 2.0 podcast starting about <a href="https://www.reality2cast.com/87?t=3350">56 minutes</a>, Greg, Katherine, and Doc get into some of those. Greg's starting with games—a good place, I think. Supply chain is another promising area. If you need decentralized, automated, trustworthy, persistent data containers, then NFTs fit the bill. 
</p>

<p>
    People who live in a country with a strong commitment to the rule of law, might ask why decentralizing things like titles and supply chains is a good idea. But that's not everyone's reality. Blockchains and NFTs can inspire confidence in systems that would otherwise be too costly or untrustworthy otherwise. Picos are a great way to create distributed systems of entity-oriented compute nodes that are capable of using PDOs. 
</p>


 

<a></a>
 Notes 
 
     Note that I'm not saying that Cryptokitties is as centralized as your bank. Just that without looking at the code, you can't tell.  
     Yeah, I know that interop is still a work in progress. But at least it's in progress, not ignored. 
     These are not capabilities that picos presently have, but they do support DIDComm messaging. Want to help add these to picos? Contact me.

<p>The article goes through some of the challenges we face when using or implementing identity, authentication and authorization solutions using self sovereign identity. I based my findings after implementing and testing solutions and wallets with the following SSI solution providers:</p>



  <a href="https://trinsic.id/">Trinsic</a>  <a href="https://mattr.global/">MATTR.global</a>  <a href="https://www.evernym.com/">Evernym</a>  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/verifiable-credentials/">Azure Active Directory Verifiable Credentials</a>  Different Wallets like <a href="https://lissi.id/">Lissi</a>  



<p> SSI (Self Sovereign Identity) is very new and a lot of its challenges will hopefully get solved and help to  improve identity management solutions.</p>



<p>Some definitions:</p>



  Digital Identity: This is the ID which represents a user, for example an E-ID issued by the state, this could be a certificate, hardware key, verifiable credential etc.  Identity: This is the user + application trying to access something which usually needs to be authenticated when using a protected user interactive resource.  Authentication: verifying the “Identity” i.e. application + user for user interactive flows.  Authorization: verify that the request presents the required credentials, specifying access rights/privileges to resources. This could mean no verification of who or what sent the request, although this can be built in with every request if required. Solutions exist for this in existing systems.  



<p>The following diagram from the Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0 <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">specification</a> shows a good overview of verifiable credentials with issuers, holders and verifiers. The holder is usually represented through a wallet application which can be any application type, not just mobile applications.</p>







<p>Level of security for user interaction authentication with SSI</p>



<p>Authentication using SSI credentials would have to same level of security as the authenticator apps which you have for existing systems. This is not as safe as using FIDO2 in your authentication process as FIDO2 is the only solution which protects against phishing. The SSI Authentication is also only as good as the fallback process, so if the fallback process, recovery process allows a username or password login, then the level would be passwords. </p>







<p>See this post for more details: </p>



<p><a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/03/17/the-authentication-pyramid/">The authentication pyramid</a></p>



<p>Authentication Issuer</p>



<p>The authentication process is not any better than previous systems, every issuer needs to do this properly. Trust quality of the issuer depends on this. If a verifier wants to use verifiable credentials from a certain issuer, then a trust must exist between the verifier and the issuer. If the issuer of the credentials makes mistakes or does this in a bad way, then the verifier has this problem as well. It is really important that the credential issuer authenticates correctly and only issues credentials to correctly authenticated identities. </p>



<p>SIOP (Self-Issued OpenID Provider) provides one solution for this. With this solution, every issuer requires its own specific IDP (identity provider) clients and OIDC (OpenID Connect) profiles for the credentials which are issued.</p>



<p>When a credential issuer has a data leak or a possible security bug, maybe all credentials issued from this issuer would need to be revoked. This might mean that all data in any verifier applications created from this issuer also needs to be revoked or deleted. This is worse than before where we have many isolated systems. With SSI, we have a chain of trust. A super disaster would be if a government which issues verifiable credentials had to revoke credentials due to a security leak or security bug, then all data, processes created from this would have to evaluate and process the data again, worse case delete and require new proofs.</p>



<p>Authentication/Authorization Verifier</p>



<p>Every verifier application/process has a responsibility for it’s own authorization and the quality of its verification. Depending on what the verifier needs to do, a decision on the required verifiable credentials needs to be taken. A verifier must decide, if it needs only to authorize the verifiable credential it receives from the wallet application, or if it needs to authenticate the digital identity used in the subject of the verifiable credential. If you only authorize a verifiable credential when you should be authenticating the digital identity used in the verifiable credential, this will probably result in false identities in the verifier application or processes run for the wrong user.  Once the verifiable credential is accepted as trustworthy, an identity could be created from the verifiable credential and the digital identity if contained in the subject. </p>



<p>Some solutions move the authentication of the digital identity to the wallet and the verifiers accept verifiable credentials from the wallet without authentication of the digital identity. This would mean that the wallet requires specific authentication steps and restrictions. Another solution would be to use a certificate which is attached to the digital identity for authentication on the verifier and on the wallet. SIOP and OpenID Connect would also provide a solution to this.</p>



<p>Access to Wallets, Authentication &amp; Authorization of the holder of the Wallet</p>



<p>One of the biggest problems is to manage and define what verifiable credentials can be loaded into a wallet. Wallets also need to possibility to import and export backups and also share credentials with other wallets using DIDComm or something like this. Enterprise wallets will be used by many different people. This means that solutions which fix the identity to a specific wallet will not work if shared wallets or backups are to be supported. Wallets would also need to support or load verifiable credentials for other people who are not able to do this themselves or do not have access to a wallet. With these requirements it is very hard to prove that a verifiable credential belongs to the person using the wallet. Extra authentication is required on the wallet and also the issuers and the verifier applications cannot know that the credential issued to wallet x, really belongs to person x, which is the subject of the verifiable credential. Extra authentication would be required. Solutions with certificates, or wallet authentication can help solve this but no one solution will fit all solutions. </p>



<p>If a relationship between the person using the wallet, the credentials in the wallet and how the verifiers use and trust the credentials is managed badly, many security problems will exist. People are people and will lose wallets, share wallets when they should not and so on. This needs to be planned for and the issuer of verifiable credentials and the verifier of these credentials need to solve this correctly. This would probably mean when using verifiable credentials from a wallet, the issuer application and the verifier application would need to authenticate the user as well as the credentials being used. Depending on the use case, the verifier would not always need to do this.</p>



<p>Interoperability between providers  &amp; SSI solutions</p>



<p>At present it is not possible to use any wallet with any SSI solution. Each solution is locked to its own wallet. Some solutions provide a way of exporting verifiable credentials and importing this again in a different vendor wallet but not using wallet vendor 1 together solution vendor 2. Solutions are also not supporting the same specifications, standards. Each implementation I tried supports different standards and have vendor specific solutions which are not compatible to other vendors. </p>



<p>I have a separate wallet installed now for each solution I tried. It cannot be expected that users install many different wallets to use SSI. Also, if a government issues a verifiable credential with a certain wallet, it would be really bad if all verifiers and further credential issuers must use the same wallet. </p>



<p>With JSON-LD and BBS+, the APIs between the wallets and the SSI services should work together but vendor specific details seem to be used in the payloads. If SSI is to work, I believe any wallet which conforms to a standard x must work with any SSI service. Or the services, vendor implementations needs a common standard for issuing and verifying credentials with wallets and the agents used in the wallets. Some type of certification process would probably help here.</p>



<p>Phishing</p>



<p>Users authenticating using verifiable credentials stored on your wallet are still vulnerable to phishing attacks. This can be improved by using FIDO2 as a second factor to the SSI authentication.</p>



<p>PII databases will still be created</p>



<p>Credential Issuers require PII data to create a verifiable credentials. This data is persisted and can be leaked like we see every day on the internet. Due to costs/laws/charges, verifiers will also copy credentials and create central PII databases as well. The applications doing verifications also will save data to a local database. For example, if an insurance company uses verifiable credentials to create a new account, it will save the data from the verifiable credential to a local database as this is required for its requirements. This will have the PII data as well. So even with SSI solutions we will still share and have many databases of PII data. </p>



<p>If BBS+ ZKP is used which does not share the data with the verifier, just a verification, this is a big improvement compared to existing solutions. At the time of testing, this is not supported yet with any of the solutions I tried, but the specifications exist. Most solutions only support selective or compound proofs. If the verifier does not save this data, then SSI has added a big plus compared to existing solutions. A use case for this would be requesting a government document which only requires proof of the digital identity and this can be issued then without storing extra PII data or requiring a shared IDP with the digital identity issuer.</p>



<p>Complexity of the Self Sovereign Identity</p>



<p>I find the complexity when implementing SSI solutions still very high. Implementation of a basic issue credential, verify credential process requires many steps. Dev environments also require some type of callback, webhooks. ngrok solves this good but this is different after each start and needs to be re-configured regularly, which then requires new presentation templates which adds extra costs and so on. If integrating this in DevOps processes with integration testing or system testing, this would become more complex. Due to the overall complexity to set this up and implement this, developers will make mistakes and this results in higher costs. IDP or PKI solutions are easier to implement in a secure way.</p>



<p>Trust</p>



<p>When using the provided solutions, some of these systems are closed source and you have no idea how the solutions manage their data, or handle the secrets in their infrastructure, or how the code is implemented (closed source). For some solutions, I had to share my OpenID Connect client secret for a flow to complete the SSI SIOP credential issuer flow. This was persisted somewhere on the platform which does not feel good. You also don’t know who they share their secrets with and the company provider has different law requirements depending on your country of origin. Implementing a “full” SSI solution does not seem like a good option for most use cases. Open source software improves this trust at least but is not the only factor.</p>



<p>Notes:</p>



<p>I would love feedback on this and will correct, change anything which is incorrect or you believe I should add something extra. These challenges are based on my experiences implementing the solutions and reading the specifications. I really look forward to the new SSI world and how this develops. I think SSI is cool, but people need to know when and how to use it and it is not the silver bullet to identity but does add some super cool new possibilities.</p>

  <p>Today’s <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Main_Page">Project VRM</a> meeting marks
the project’s 15 years anniversary. A good opportunity to list the uses cases that have
emerged over the years. To make them more manageable, I categorize them by the stage of
the relationship between customer and vendor:</p>
 Category 1: Establishing the relationship 
<p>What happens when a Customer or a Vendor wishes to initiate a relationship, or wishes to modify the
terms of the relationship.</p>
 1.1 Customer initiates a new relationship with a Vendor 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to offer initiating a new relationship with a Vendor.”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 The Customer encounters the Vendor’s electronic presence (e.g. their website) 
 The Customer performs a gesture on the Vendor’s site that indicates their interest of establishing
a relationship 
 As part of the gesture, the Customer’s proposed terms are conveyed to the Vendor 
 In response, the Vendor provides acceptance of the proposed relationship and offered terms,
or offers alternate terms in return. 
 If the offered terms are different from the proposed terms, the Customer has the opportunity
to propose alternate terms; this continues until both parties agree on the terms or
abort the initiation. 
 Once the terms have been agreed on, both sides record their agreement. 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 To make this “consumer-grade”, much of the complexity of such concepts as
“proposed terms” needs to be hidden behind reasonable defaults. 
 
 1.2 Vendor initiates a new relationship with a Customer 
<p>“As a Vendor, I want to offer initiating a new relationship with a Customer.”</p>
<p>Similar as for “Customer initiates a new relationship with a Vendor”, but with reversed roles.</p>
 1.3 Customer and Vendor agree on a closer relationship 
<p>“The Customer and the Vendor agree on a closer relationship.”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 The Customer and the Vendor have been in a relationship governed by certain terms for some time. 
 Now, either the Customer or the Vendor propose new terms to the other party, and the other party
accepts. 
 The new terms permit all activities permitted by the old terms, plus some additional
ones. 
 
<p>Example:</p>
 
 The Customer has agreed with the Vendor that the Vendor may send the Customer product updates once a month.
For that purpose, the Customer has provided Vendor an e-mail address (but no physical address). 
 Now, the Customer has decided to purchase a product from Vendor. To ship it, the Vendor needs to have
the Customer’s shipping address. New terms that also include the shipping address are being
negotiated. 
 
 1.4 A Customer wants a more distant relationship 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to limit the Vendor to more restrictive terms.”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 The Customer and the Vendor have been in a relationship governed by certain terms for some time. 
 Now, the Customer wishes to disallow certain activities previously allowed by the terms, without
terminating the relationship. 
 The Customer offers new terms, which the Vendor may or may not accept. The Vendor may offer alternate
terms in turn. This negotiation continues until either mutually acceptable terms are
found, or the relationship terminates. 
 
<p>Examples:</p>
 
 The Customer has agreed with the Vendor that the Vendor may send the Customer product updates. Now the Customer
decides that they do not wish to receive product updates more frequently than once
a quarter. 
 The Customer has agreed to behavioral profiling when visiting Vendor’s website. Now, while the Customer
still wishes to use the website, they do no longer consent to the behavioral profiling. 
 
 2. Category: Ongoing relationship 
<p>What happens during a relationship after it has been established and while no
party has the intention of either modifying the strength of, or even leaving
the relationship.</p>
 2.1 Intentcasting 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to publish, to a selection of Vendors that I trust, that I wish to purchase a
product with description X”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Convenience for Customer 
 Potential for a non-standard deal (e.g. I am a well-known influencer, and the seller
makes Customer a special deal) 
 
<p>Features:</p>
 
 It’s basically a shopping list
 
 free-form text 
 plus “terms” (FIXME: open issue) 
 
 
 Retailers can populate product alternatives for each item in the list
 
 might simply be a search at the retailer site 
 but terms need to be computable 
 
 
 
<p>Issues:</p>
 
 what if a retailer lies and spams with unrelated products, or unavailable products? 
 
 2.2 Automated intentcasting on my behalf 
<p>“As a Customer, I want an ‘AI’ running on my behalf to issue Intentcasts when it is in my interest”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 This is similar to functionality deployed by some retailers today: “We noticed you have
not bought diapers in the last 30 days. Aren’t you about to run low? Here are some offers”.
But this functionality runs on my behalf, and takes data from all sorts of places into
account. 
 
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Convenience, time savings 
 
 2.3 Contextual product reviews and ratings 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to see reviews and ratings of the product and seller alternatives for any
of my shopping list items.”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Same as product reviews in silos, but without the silos: have access to more reviews
and ratings by more people 
 Seller alternatives give Customer more choice 
 
 2.4 Filter offers by interest 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to receive offers that match my implicitly declared interest”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 In Intentcasting, I actively publish my intent to meet a need I know I have by
purchasing a product 
 This is about offers in response to needs, or benefits, that I have not explicitly
declared but that can be inferred. Example: if I have purchased a laser printer
6 months ago, and I have not purchased replacement toner cartridges nor have I declared
an intent to purchase some, I would appreciate offers for such toner cartridges (but
not of inkjet cartridges) 
 
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Convenience for Customer 
 Better response rate for Vendor 
 
 2.5 Full contact record 
<p>“As a Customer, I want a full record of all interactions between Customer and each Vendor accessible in a single place.”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 Trackability 
 Similar to CRM 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 This should cover all modes of communication, from e-mail to trouble tickets,
voice calls and home visits. 
 
 2.6 Manage trusted Vendor’s in a single place 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to see and manage my list of trusted Vendors in a single place”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity 
 Transparency (to Customer) 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 Probably should also have a non-trusted Vendor’s: so my banned vendors are maintained
in the same place — which subset is being displayed is just a filter function 
 Probably should have a list of all Vendor’s ever interacted with 
 
 2.7 Notify of changes about products I’m interested in 
<p>“As a Customer, I want be notified of important changes (e.g. price) in products that I’m interested in.”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 can use my shopping cart as a “price watch list” and purchase when I think the
price is right 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 This should apply to items in my shopping cart, but also items in product lists that
I might have created (“save for later” lists) 
 
 2.8 Personal wallet 
<p>“As a Customer, I want my own wallet that I can use with any Vendor”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 Unified billing 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 Unified ceremony 
 Should be able to delegate to the payment network of my choice 
 
 2.9 Preventative maintenance 
<p>“As a Customer, I would like to be notified of my options when a product I own needs maintenance”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 If I have a water heater, and it is about to fail, I would like to be notified that
it is about to fail, with offers for what to do about it. It’s a kind of
<a>intentcasting</a>
but the intent is inferred from the fact that I own the product, the product is about
to fail, that I don’t want it to fail and I am willing to entertain offers from
the vendor I bought it from and others. 
 
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Convenience for Customer 
 No service interruption 
 
 2.10 Product clouds 
<p>“Each product instance has its own cloud”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Collects information over the lifetime of the product instance 
 Product instance-specific 
 Can change ownership with the product 
 Does not disappear with the vendor 
 
<p>Example:</p>
 
 My water heater has its own cloud. It knows usage, and maintenance events.
It continues to work even if the vendor of the water heater goes out of business. 
 
 2.11 Product info in context 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to access product documentation, available instruction manuals etc in the
context of the purchase that I made”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 Updated documentation, new materials etc show up automatically 
 
 2.12 Set and monitor terms for relationships 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to set terms for my relationship with a Vendor in a single place”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 Privacy &amp; Agency 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 Originally this was only about terms for provided personal data, but it appears
this is a broader issue: I also want to set terms for, say, dispute resolution
(“I never consent to arbitration”) or customer support (“must agree to never let
Customer wait on the phone for more than 30min”) 
 
 2.13 Update information in a single place only 
<p>“As a Customer, I (only) want to update my personal contact information in one place that I control”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 for Customer: convenience 
 for Vendor: more accurate information 
 
<p>Issues:</p>
 
 Should that be a copy and update-copy process (push), or a copy and update-on-need
process (pull with copy) or a fetch-and-discard process (pull without copy)? 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 Originally phrased as only about contact info (name, married name, shipping address,
phone number etc) this probably applies to other types of information was well, such
as, say, credit card numbers, loyalty club memberships, even dietary preferences or
interests (“I gave up stamp collecting”) 
 
 2.14 Single shopping cart 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to use a single shopping cart for all e-commerce sites on the web.”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 I don’t need to create accounts on many websites, or login into many websites 
 I decide when the collection of items in the cart expires and I don’t lose work 
 It makes it easier for Customer to shop at more sites, and I can more easily buy from the long tail of sites 
 
<p>Features:</p>
 
 It shows product and seller 
 It may show alternate sellers and difference in terms (e.g. price, shipping, speed) 
 We may also want to have product lists that aren’t a shopping cart (“save for later”
lists) 
 
 2.15 Unified communications/notifications preferences 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to manage my communication/notification preferences with all Vendors
in a single place”</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 In a single place, and in a single manner. I should not have to do things differently
to unsubscribe from the product newsletter of vendors X and Y. 
 
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 
 2.16 Unified product feedback 
<p>“As a Customer, I want a uniform way to submit (positive and negative) product feedback (and
receive responses) with any Vendor”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 Trackability 
 Similar to CRM 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 Should be easy to do this either privately or publicly 
 
 2.17 Unified purchase history 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to have a record of all my product purchases in a single place”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 If I wish to re-order a product I purchased before, I can easily find it and the
vendor that I got it from 
 
 2.18 Unified subscriptions management 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to manage all my ongoing product subscriptions in a single place”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 Expense management 
 
<p>Note:</p>
 
 This is implied by the source, not explicitly mentioned. 
 
<p>Future:</p>
 
 Opens up possibilities for subscription bundle business models 
 
 2.19 Unified support experience 
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Simplicity &amp; Convenience 
 Trackability 
 Similar to CRM 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 Should be multi-modal: trouble tickets, chat, e-mail, voice etc 
 
 3. Category: Beyond binary relationships 
<p>Use cases that involve more than one Customer, or more than one Vendor, or both.</p>
 3.1 Proven capabilities 
<p>“As a Vendor, I want to give another party (Customer or Vendor) the capabilities to perform certain operations”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 This is SSI Object Capabilities 
 Example: I want to give my customer the ability to open a locker 
 The scenario should be robust with respect to confidentiality and accuracy. 
 
 3.2 Silo-free product reviews 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to publish my reviews and ratings about products I own so they can be
used by any other Customer at any point of purchase”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Same as product reviews in silos, but without the silos: broader distribution of
my review for more benefit by more people 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 Rephrased from “express genuine loyalty” 
 
 3.3 Monitoring of terms violation 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to be notified if other Customer’s interacting with a Vendor report a violation of their terms”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 I have a relationship with a Vendor, and we have agreed to certain terms. If the Vendor breaks
those terms, and other Customer’s in a similar relationship with the Vendor notice that, I want
to be notified. 
 
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Trust, security, safety 
 
<p>Notes:</p>
 
 This can of course be abused through fake reports, so suitable measures must be taken. 
 
 3.4 Unified health and wellness records 
<p>“As a Customer, I want my health and wellness records from all sources to be aggregated in a
place that I control.”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
 
 Survives disappearance of the vendor 
 Privacy 
 Allows cross-data-source personal analytics and insights 
 Integration across healthcare (regulated industry) and wellness (consumer) 
 
 3.5 Verified credentials 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to be able to tell Vendor 1 that Vendor 2 makes a claim about Customer.”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 This is the SSI verified credential use case 
 Example: I want to tell a potential employer that I have earned a certain degress
from a certain institution 
 The scenario should be robust with respect to confidentiality and accuracy. 
 
 4. Category: Ending the relationship 
<p>What happens when one of the parties wishes to end the relationship.</p>
 4.1 Banning the vendor 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to permanently ban a Vendor from doing business with Customer ever again.”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 This form of ending the relationship means that I don’t want to be told of offers
or responses to Intentcasts etc. by this vendor ever again. 
 
 4.2 Disassociating from the vendor 
<p>“As a Customer, I want to stop interacting with a vendor at this time but I am open to
future interactions.”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 This probably means that data sharing and other interaction reset to the level of
how it was before the relationship was established. However, the Customer and the Vendor do not
need to go through the technical introduction ceremony again when the relationship
is revived. 
 
 4.3 Firing the customer 
<p>“As a Vendor, I want to stop interacting with a particular Customer.”</p>
<p>Description:</p>
 
 For customers (or non-customers) that the Vendor does not wish to serve (e.g. because of
excessive support requests), the VendorVendor may unilaterally terminate the relationship with
the Customer.

  <p>I found a bug in Python 3.10 today! Some notes on how I found it and my process for handling it once I figured out what was going on.</p>
 Testing Datasette against Python 3.10 
<p>I finally got around to attempting to upgrade Datasette to the just-released Python 3.10 this morning. I started by <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/pull/1481/commits/18a490734fc724b52cfb5a20601af3b00748af8d">adding <code>"3.10"</code></a> to the matrix of Python versions that Datasette is tested against by GitHub Actions:</p>
 <code>strategy:
  matrix:
    python-version: ["3.6", "3.7", "3.8", "3.9", "3.10"]
</code> 
<p>That line previously looked like this:</p>
 <code>python-version: [3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9]
</code> 
<p>I switched to using quoted strings here based on <a href="https://twitter.com/webology/status/1445394072492023811">a tip from Jeff Triplett</a>, who pointed out that <code>3.10</code> is actually a floating point number in YAML syntax which will be treated as referring to Python 3.1 instead!</p>
<p>This one-line change in a pull request was all it took to run the tests against the new version of Python... and they failed, spectacularly.</p>
<p>Annoyingly the root error wasn't displayed directly in the tests, because it was triggered and then caught by Datasette's own error handling and turned into a 500 HTTP error. So, I needed to run Python 3.10 locally and it the debugger.</p>
 Running Python 3.10 locally 
<p>I occasionally use <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv">pyenv</a> to manage multiple Python versions on my machine. I have this installed through Homebrew.</p>
<p>I had to run <code>brew upgrade pyenv</code> first,  because my installed version didn't know about Python 3.10. Then I ran this:</p>
 <code>pyenv install 3.10.0
</code> 
<p>Which gave me a Python 3.10 installation on my Mac in <code>~/.pyenv/versions/3.10.0/bin/python</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, I created a new virtual environment using this version of Python.</p>
 <code>~/.pyenv/versions/3.10.0/bin/python \
  -m venv /tmp/py310
# Now activate that virtual environment:
source /tmp/py310/bin/activate
</code> 
<p>I put this in my <code>/tmp</code> directory so I don't have to remember to clean it up later.</p>
<p>Having done this, I installed my Datasette test dependencies into the new environment and used <code>pytest</code> to run my tests:</p>
 <code>% cd ~/Dropbox/Development/datasette
% pip install -e '.[test]'
</code> 
<p>Running <code>pytest -x --pdb</code> stopped at the first failing test and dropped me into a debugger where I could finally access the full traceback, which looked something like this:</p>
 <code>  File "datasette/datasette/views/base.py", line 122, in dispatch_request
    await self.ds.refresh_schemas()
  File "datasette/datasette/app.py", line 344, in refresh_schemas
    await self._refresh_schemas()
  File "datasette/datasette/app.py", line 349, in _refresh_schemas
    await init_internal_db(internal_db)
  File "datasette/datasette/utils/internal_db.py", line 5, in init_internal_db
    await db.execute_write(
  File "datasette/datasette/database.py", line 102, in execute_write
    return await self.execute_write_fn(_inner, block=block)
  File "datasette/datasette/database.py", line 113, in execute_write_fn
    reply_queue = janus.Queue()
  File "janus/__init__.py", line 39, in __init__
    self._async_not_empty = asyncio.Condition(self._async_mutex)
  File "lib/python3.10/asyncio/locks.py", line 234, in __init__
    raise ValueError("loop argument must agree with lock")
ValueError: loop argument must agree with lock
</code> 
<p>So, something is going long with <code>asyncio.Condition()</code>, which is being called by <code>janus.Queue()</code>.</p>
 Some background on Janus 
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/aio-libs/janus">Janus</a> library referenced here describes itself as a "Thread-safe asyncio-aware queue for Python".</p>
<p>I use it in Datasette for the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/682">write queue</a> - a mechanism where writes can be safely made to a SQLite database by first queueing them up in memory.</p>
<p>Janus provides a mechanism that lets asyncio event tasks send and receive messages to Python threads, and vice-versa, via a queue class that is modelled on Python's own standard library queues. It's really neat.</p>
 Tracking the investigation in issue comments 
<p>Any time I'm investigating a bug I make sure that there's an associated GitHub issue or pull request, to give me somewhere to build up detailed notes of my investigation.</p>
<p>I used my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/pull/1481">PR #1481</a> for this. Now that I had an error message - "loop argument must agree with lock" - I did some initial Google searches and found to my surprise that it had very few existing mentions - my first clue that this might be related to the new Python 3.10 release itself.</p>
<p>I tracked down the relevant source code in both Python and the Janus library based on the traceback and linked to them from the issue comments. I pasted in copies of the relevant code too, since GitHub only magically embeds code from the same repository, not code from other repositories. You can see <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/pull/1481#issuecomment-939078872">those comments here</a>.</p>
<p>I always like to include copies of the code most likely to be the cause of a bug in an issue comment, to save myself from having to dig around for it again later on and to act as a historical record once the bug has been fixed.</p>
<p>I also started an issue in the Janus repo, with the title <a href="https://github.com/aio-libs/janus/issues/358">Error with Python 3.10: "ValueError: loop argument must agree with lock"</a>. I linked this to my own issue and posted relevant research in both places.</p>
<p>The two lines of code in Janus that caused the bug where these ones (note my added comment):</p>
 self._async_mutex = asyncio.Lock()
# "loop argument must agree with lock" exception is raised here:
self._async_not_empty = asyncio.Condition(self._async_mutex) 
<p>This is where I began to suspect a Python bug. The above code can be simplified to this:</p>
 asyncio.Condition(asyncio.Lock()) 
<p>This is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-sync.html#asyncio.Condition">a documented way</a> of using conditions in Python: you can instantiate conditions with an optional lock, which allows that lock to be shared by more than one condition.</p>
<p>So I tried that in the Python 3.10 interpreter... and it didn't throw the error:</p>
 <code>% ~/.pyenv/versions/3.10.0/bin/python
Python 3.10.0 (default, Oct  7 2021, 13:45:58) [Clang 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.29)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; import asyncio
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(asyncio.Condition(asyncio.Lock()))
&lt;asyncio.locks.Condition object at 0x1062521d0 [unlocked]&gt;
</code> 
<p>From browsing the source code I could see that there was something going on here involving the event loop - so on a hunch I tried running that code in an event loop instead, like so:</p>
  &gt;&gt;&gt; async def example():
...     print(asyncio.Condition(asyncio.Lock()))
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; asyncio.run(example())
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 2, in example
  File "/Users/simon/.pyenv/versions/3.10.0/lib/python3.10/asyncio/locks.py", line 234, in __init__
    raise ValueError("loop argument must agree with lock")
ValueError: loop argument must agree with lock  
<p>There's the exception!</p>
<p>So it looked like this might be a genuine Python 3.10 bug. After all, I knew that this code worked in prior versions of Python (since Janus and Datasette worked fine there). In fact I could confirm it like so:</p>
 <code>~ % python3.9
Python 3.9.7 (default, Sep  3 2021, 12:45:31) 
[Clang 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.29)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; import asyncio
&gt;&gt;&gt; async def example():
...     print(asyncio.Condition(asyncio.Lock()))
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; asyncio.run(example())
&lt;asyncio.locks.Condition object at 0x1049aab50 [unlocked]&gt;
</code> 
 Reporting the bug to the Python issue tracker 
<p>Python bugs are tracked on <a href="https://bugs.python.org/">bugs.python.org</a> - thankfully they support sign in with GitHub (and Google and even OpenID) so I signed in with my GitHub account to report the bug.</p>
<p>I filed <a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue45416">Issue 45416</a> entitled:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"loop argument must agree with lock" instantiating asyncio.Condition</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And included a brief description with my minimal Python script that demonstrated the bug.</p>
<p>Then I added a comment pointing back to one of the related GitHub issues where I had been figuring this out, and another comment that linked to <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/a1092f62492a3fcd6195bea94eccf8d5a300acb1/Lib/test/test_asyncio/test_locks.py#L722-L727">the most relevant test</a> in Python's own test suite, which I found using GitHub search for the term <code>Condition</code>.</p>
<p>Any time I file an issue against a project - my own or someone else's - I always like to do a bit of extra research and link to both the likely code at fault and the likely test.</p>
<p>As a maintainer, this saves me a bunch of time - if the issue links straight to the code and tests I don't have to spend any time digging around looking for them.</p>
<p>My hope is that this saves time for the people I am reporting the bug to as well, which increases the chance that they'll dig into it and help me find a fix!</p>
<p>Then I tweeted about it. I have a bunch of followers with relevant experience, so I thought it was time to get a few more eyes on the problem.</p>
<blockquote><p>I think I /may/ have found a bug in Python 3.10, which is exciting!<br><br>asyncio.Condition(asyncio.Lock()) raises a ValueError error if executed while an event loop is running<br><br>Means Datasette doesn't work on 3.10 (yet)<a href="https://t.co/ofd9MmzuJS">https://t.co/ofd9MmzuJS</a> <a href="https://t.co/ICQz8lf39M">pic.twitter.com/ICQz8lf39M</a></p>- Simon Willison (@simonw) <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1446576515940904962?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2021</a></blockquote>

<p>I included a screenshot of my steps-to-reproduce script to save anyone who might be casually interested from having to click through to the issue itself.</p>
 Łukasz Langa to the rescue 
<p>Łukasz is the "CPython Developer in Residence", which means he is paid by the Python Software Foundation to work on Python full-time.</p>
<p>Less than an hour after I filed the issue he <a href="https://bugs.python.org/msg403506">posted a comment</a> that both confirmed the bug and provided two short-term workarounds for it!</p>
<p>I really liked his first workaround, which looks like this:</p>
  &gt;&gt;&gt; l = asyncio.Lock()
&gt;&gt;&gt; getattr(l, '_get_loop', lambda: None)()
&lt;_UnixSelectorEventLoop running=True closed=False debug=False&gt;  
<p>It works by calling the <code>lock._get_loop()</code> method, but only if it exists - so even though that's an undocumented internal method this should be safe even when run against future Python versions that might remove the method.</p>
<p>You can see <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.10.0/Lib/asyncio/mixins.py#L22-L31">that method here</a> - it safely populates the <code>self._loop</code> property, which helps work around the bug.</p>
 Submitting a PR to Janus 
<p>The best place to apply this workaround is to Janus - so I submitted a PR there which adds the workaround and updates their CI configuration to test against Python 3.10: <a href="https://github.com/aio-libs/janus/pull/359">Janus PR #359</a>. The GitHub Actions tests for that PR are now passing against Python 3.10.</p>
<p>Their README <a href="https://github.com/aio-libs/janus#communication-channels">links to a gitter chat</a> so I dropped a link to my PR in there too. Hopefully that can be merged soon!</p>
 What I should have done 
<p>I'm feeling pretty good about this situation - the bug is set to be fixed, we have a great workaround thanks to Łukasz and I'm optimistic that the upstream library from Datasette will land the fix soon.</p>
<p>If only I'd done this a few weeks earlier!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0619/#schedule">Python 3.10 release schedule</a> shipped the first alpha a year ago, in October 2020. It totalled 7 alphas, 4 betas and 2 release candidates before the final 3.10 release on Monday 4th October 2021.</p>
<p>If I'd taken the time to get Datasette's test suite running against Python 3.10 for any of those pre-releases, I could have helped spot this bug before it landed in the final release!</p>
<p>So lesson learned: Python has alphas and betas and RCs for a reason. For future Pythons I'm going to pay attention to testing against these for my projects before the final release lands.</p>

   Mark Zuckerberg recently dedicated a
long interview
to the subject, so the metaverse must be a thing. Promptly, the
chatter is exploding. Personally
I believe the metaverse is currently underhyped: it will be A Really Big Thing,
for consumers, and for businesses, and in particular for commerce and

  <p>Mark Zuckerberg recently dedicated a
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview">long interview</a>
to the subject, so the metaverse must be a thing. Promptly, the
<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=metaverse">chatter</a> is exploding. Personally
I believe the metaverse is currently underhyped: it will be A Really Big Thing,
for consumers, and for businesses, and in particular for commerce and
collaboration, far beyond what we can grasp in video games and the likes today.</p>
<p>So what is it, this metaverse thing? I want to share my definition, because I
think it is simple, and useful.</p>
<p>It’s best expressed in a two-by-two table:</p>

 
  
  
   How you access it:
   <br>
   physically vs. virtually
 
 
  
   Where it is:
   <br>
   in physical or virtual space
  
  
   The virtual world, accessed physically:
   <br>
   Augmented Reality
  
  
   The virtual world, accessed virtually:
   <br>
   today's internet and future virtual worlds
  
 
 
  
   The physical world, accessed physically:
   <br>
   our ancestors exclusively lived here
  
  
   The physical world, accessed virtually:
   <br>
   the Internet of Things
  
 

<p>By way of explanation:</p>
 
 
<p>There is physical space – the physical world around us – and
virtual space, the space of pure information, that only exists on computers.</p>
 
 
<p>Our ancestors, and we so far, have mostly been interacting with physical space
by touching it physically.
But in recent decades, we have learned to access it from the information
sphere, and that’s usually described as the Internet of Things:
if you run an app to control your lights, or open your garage door, that’s
what I’m talking about.</p>
 
 
<p>So far, we have mostly interacted with virtual space through special-purpose
devices that form the gateway to the virtual space: first computers,
now phones and in the future: headsets. I call this accessing virtual space
virtually.</p>
 
 
<p>And when we don our smart glasses, and wave our arms, we interact with
virtual space from physical space, which is the last quadrant.</p>
 
 
<p>In my definition, those four quadrants together form the metaverse:
the metaverse is a superset of both meatspace and cyberspace, so to speak.</p>
<p>This definition has been quite helpful for me to understand what various
projects are working on.</p>

The context in this article is to explore how a framed approach to questions creates biased outcomes. One framing in Regulatory Focus centres on a “Promotion Focus” which looks for “gain” which can be translated as finding or seeking hope, advancement and accomplishment.&nbsp; The counter is a prevention focus that centres on losses that looks to find safety, responsibility and security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In Dana’s research, which is the basis for her talk about why women get less venture funding, she categorises “Promotion” questions as ones that will ask the following questions as they seek to focus on GAIN. When talking about: customers seeks data about acquisition, income looking for data to confirm sales, Market seeking to understand the size,&nbsp; Balance Sheet will want to know data on assets, projections should focus on growth and questions on strategy will want to understand the vision.&nbsp;</p><p>Dana’s research shows that “Prevention” questions will be framed as LOSSES, therefore a focus on customers would seek data on retention, income questions look for data on margin, market questions would focus on shape, balance sheet questions will centre on liability, projection data wants to confirm stability, and strategy to ensure execution capability.</p><p>Whilst Dana has collected this data as part of a noble and useful study on why women get less funding from venture capital, investors tend to bias and ask women prevention questions with a framing away from gain towards losses and downside risk.&nbsp; However, we should reflect on this data and research for a little longer.</p><p>Does your executive team tend to focus on promotion or prevention questions? &nbsp;Do different executive roles tend to frame their questions based on gain (upside) or loss prevention (risk)?&nbsp; Is the person leading the questions critical to the decision-making unit and will their questions frame promotion or prevention for the company.&nbsp; Whilst a rounded team should ask both, do they?</p><p>As the CDO, our role is to find “all data.” and not data to fit a question. Data that shows your company's approach to how they frame questions for Prevention or Promotion is just data,&nbsp; but this data will help you as a team make better decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>A specific challenge in the first 100 days is to determine what questions we, as a leadership team, ask ourselves and how our framing is biasing our choices and decisions.&nbsp; We are unlikely to like this data and how power aligns with those who prevent or promote a proposal or recommendation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Based on listening to questions and those in communications, I have been building an ontology of questions and been categorising them for a while now.&nbsp; I am interested both in the absolute bias, the bias to people, the bias to project types and also how bais changes depending on who is leading the project and questions.&nbsp; Based on a sample size that is not statistical, I believe that Dana’s work has far wider implications than just venture funding.&nbsp;</p><p>---</p><p>Whilst our ongoing agile iteration into <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-occurs-when-physical-beings-transition-to-information-beings-146ea9dcbca3">information beings</a> is never-ending, there are the first 100 days in the new role. But what to focus on? Well, that rose-tinted period of conflicting priorities is what <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/">&lt;/Hello, CDO!&gt;</a> is all about. Maintaining sanity when all else has been lost to untested data assumptions is a different problem entirely.</p>

   Abusing Terraform to Upload Static Websites to S3 
 I found this really interesting.

<p>I found this really interesting. Terraform is infrastructure as code software which mostly handles creating and updating infrastructure resources, so it's a poor fit for uploading files to S3 and setting the correct Content-Type headers for them. But... in figuring out how to do that, this article taught me a ton about how Terraform works. I wonder if that's a useful general pattern? Get a tool to do something that it's poorly designed to handle and see how much you learn about that tool along the way.</p>

<p>The latest version of the â€œOAuth 2.0 Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession at the Application Layer (DPoP)â€ specification adds an option for servers to supply a nonce value to be included in the DPoP proof.  Both authorization servers and resource servers can provide nonce values to clients.</p>
<p>As described in the updated Security Considerations, the nonce prevents a malicious party in control of the client (who might be a legitimate end-user) from pre-generating DPoP proofs to be used in the future and exfiltrating them to a machine without the DPoP private key.

  <p>Summary: Interoperability is a fundamental property of tech systems that are generative and respect individual privacy and autonomy. And, as a bonus, it makes people's live easier!</p>





<p>
    I traveled to Munich for European Identity Conference several weeks ago—my first international trip since before the pandemic. Post-pandemic travel can be confusing, international travel even more so. To get into Germany, I needed to prove I had been vaccinated. To get back in the US, I had to show evidence of a negative Covid-19 test conducted no more than three days prior to my arrival in the US. Figuring out how to present these, which forms to fill out, and who cared led to a bit of stress. 
</p>

<p>
    Once in Munich, venturing out of the hotel had its own surprises. Germany, or maybe just Munich, has implemented a contract tracing system. Apparently there's one or more apps you can use, but I had a tough time figuring that out. Restaurants were spotty in their demands and enforcement. After showing them my US vaccination card, one small place just threw up their hands and said "just come in and eat!"
</p>

<p>
    You'd think all this would have been a perfect opportunity for me to use a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/06/building_an_ssi_ecosystem_health_passes_and_the_design_of_an_ecosystem_of_ecosystems.shtml">health pass app</a>, but whose? None of the ones I knew about had a way for me to get my vaccination status into them. Delta airlines didn't accept any that I could tell. Munich has its own—or three. In short, it's an interoperability nightmare. 
</p>

<p>
    Apple recently <a href="https://www.imore.com/you-can-now-store-your-covid-19-vaccination-health-app">announced</a> that you can store your Covid-19 vaccination card in the Health app. And soon you'll be able to put it in the phone's wallet app. Android users have similar options. But there's also hundreds (really) of apps for doing the same thing and each has its own tiny ecosystem. PC Magazine even wrote a guide with <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/does-my-state-have-a-covid-19-vaccine-app">every US state's chosen app</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    The size of Apple and Android may help solve this problem since they already represent huge ecosystems. But then we're stuck with whatever solutions they provide and we may not like what we get. You don't have to look far to see <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-icloud-photo-scan-csam-pause-backlash/">BigTech solutions that have left people scratching their head.</a> We can't continue to count on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictatorship">benevolence of our erstwhile dictators</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/10/255710-competitive-compatibility/fulltext">Writing in Communications of the ACM</a>, Cory Doctorow discusses what can be done and hits upon a conceptually simple answer: enforce interoperability.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>[Interoperability] is the better way. Instead of enshrining Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft as the Internet's permanent overlords and then striving to make them as benign as possible, we can fix the Internet by making Big Tech less central to its future.</p>
    <p>It's possible that people will connect tools to their BigTech accounts that do ill-advised things they come to regret. That is kind of the point, really. After all, people can plug weird things into their car's lighter receptacles, but the world is a better place when you get to decide how to use that useful, versatile ANSI/SAE J56-compliant plug—not GM or Toyota.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
    By enforcing interoperability, we avoid empowering Apple, Google, or anyone else as the sole trusted repositories of health data and then hoping they'll not only do the right thing, but also have all the best ideas. We can let the hundreds of Covid-19 health pass apps thrive (or not), secure in the knowledge that people can pick the app they like from a company they trust and still have it work when they travel across borders—or just across town.
</p>

<p>
    People with decision making authority can help this process by choosing the interoperable solution and avoiding closed, proprietary technology. Why are organizations like <a href="https://www.nascio.org/">NASCIO (National Association of State CIOs)</a>, for example, not doing more to help states find, chose, and use interoperable solutions to common state IT problems? Beyond health pass applications, things like mobile drivers licenses need to be interoperable to be useful.
</p>

<p>
    Fortunately, we have <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2021.626726/full">open-source technology, with multiple commercial providers</a>, that can provide interoperable credentials. Verifiable credential technology and SSI tick all the checkboxes for interoperable data exchange. Several <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/use+cases">production use cases</a> exist that can inform new projects. 
</p>

<p>
    In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/06/building_an_ssi_ecosystem_health_passes_and_the_design_of_an_ecosystem_of_ecosystems.shtml">Health Passes and the Design of an Ecosystem of Ecosystems</a>, I wrote about efforts to create interoperable health passes on principles that respect individual privacy and autonomy. Those efforts have created real apps, with real interoperability. But too many decision makers jettison interoperability in search of profit, dominance, or simply time to market. The lesson of the internet was not that it was the cheapest, easiest way to build global network. We had CompuServe for that. The lesson of the internet was that it was the best way to build a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/01/generative_identity.shtml">network that was generative</a> and provided the most utility for the greatest number of people. Interoperability was the key—and still is.

U.S., Canadian, and European Governments see how this technology can provide superior data protection for its citizens, while enabling global data sharing — that’s why they have invested more than $16 million USD into this space over the past several&nbsp;years.</p><p>On September 15, 2021, I moderated a panel with representatives from the United States Government, the Canadian Government, and the European Commission. Below is an edited excerpt from the panel that included:</p>  Anil John, Technical Director of the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/svip">Silicon Valley Innovation Program</a> which has invested $8 million on R&amp;D, proof of concepts, product development, refinement, and a digital wallet UI competition.  Tim Bouma, Senior Policy Analyst for identity management at the Treasury Board secretariat at of the Government of Canada. The <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/ucvdcc">User-centric Verifiable Digital Credentials Challenge</a> has awarded $4 million CAD in two&nbsp;phases.  Olivier Bringer, Head of the <a href="https://www.ngi.eu/">Next-Generation Internet</a> at the European commission and under his program, he has awarded about € 6 million euros through three open calls for EID and SSI solutions.  Heather Vescent, Co-Chair of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">Credentials Community Group</a> which incubates many of the open standards in this space &amp; an author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Guide-Self-Sovereign-Identity-ebook/dp/B07Q3TXLDP/">The Comprehensive Guide to Self Sovereign Identity</a>.   Policy and Technology <p>Heather Vescent: Policy tends to be squishy while technology and especially technology standards must be precise. What challenges do you face implementing policy decisions into technology?</p><p>Anil John: Our two primary work streams come out of the oldest parts of the U.S. government: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.</p><p>Immigration credentials must be available to anyone regardless of their technical savvy or infrastructure availability. The USCIS team is focused on leaving nobody behind, and do not have the luxury of pivoting to a digital only model. Technology has to provide credentials in electronic format, as well as on paper — each with a high degree of verification validation.</p><p>U.S. Customs has to deal with every single entity that is shipping goods into the U.S. We don’t have any choice but to be globally interoperable, because while we may be the largest customs organization on the planet, we do not want to mandate a single platform or technology stack. Interoperability is critical so that everybody has a choice in the technology that they are&nbsp;using.</p><p>It is easy to get pushback about why we are doing this long public process, rather than put money into a vendor and buy their technology. One of the reasons we made the decision to work in public, under the remit of a global standards organization, was to ensure that we were not repeating past mistakes where we were locked into particular vendors or platforms. In the past, we were locked into proprietary APIs, with high switching costs, left with the care and feeding of legacy systems that were very uniquely government centric. There are benefits to develop technology in the public from a solution choice and a public interest perspective.</p><p>Tim Bouma: The challenge is that you have to deal with short term exigencies, and combine that with a long-term vision to come up with requirements that are fairly timeless. Because once you develop the requirements, they have to last for a decade or more. This forces you to think of what the timeless requirements might be. In order to do that, you have to understand the technology very deeply. You have to understand the abstraction, so you can come up with language that can serve the test of&nbsp;time.</p><p>Olivier Bringer: I agree that it can be a challenge to implement policy choices into technology; but it can also be an opportunity. Innovators have not waited for the European General Data Protection Regulation before developing privacy preserving technologies. This is an opportunity for companies, an opportunity for administration, an opportunity for innovators to develop new technologies and new business&nbsp;models.</p><blockquote>“Policy is an opportunity to implement fundamental rights into technology.” — Olivier&nbsp;Bringer</blockquote><p>In NGI we try to take the policy development, the regulations that we have, as an opportunity to implement our fundamental rights, an opportunity to implement the law into technology. Our program supports innovators, the adoption of their technologies, their solutions, and their integration into standards. We do that firstly in Europe, but our ambition is to link to the global environment and work in cooperation with&nbsp;others.</p> A Benefit to&nbsp;Citizens <p>Vescent: What would you tell your citizens is the most important reason to invest in this infrastructure and businesses that use&nbsp;it?</p><p>Bringer: First that we are funding technologies, which are, this is our motto, human centric. So returning to your first question, going beyond pure policy development, we think it’s really important to develop the technology. So next to the regulation that we put in place in the field of electronic identity, in the field of AI, in the field of data protection, it’s important to fund the technologies that will implement these policies and regulation. This is really what we try to do when we build an internet that’s more trustworthy, that gives more control to the users in terms of the data they disclose, in terms of control of their identity online, in terms of including everyone in this increasingly important digital environment. It is technology geared towards the&nbsp;citizen.</p><p>John: I’m going to answer for myself, rather than speak for my organization. Having said that, I think what I would tell [citizens] would be that we want to make your life more secure, and more privacy-respecting, without leaving anybody behind. These are the first technologies that have come along that give us a hope in ensuring that we’re not trapped by nefarious or corporate or money interests. That there is a choice in the marketplace in what is available to our citizens in how they access it. And we absolutely are not ignoring the people who may not have a level of comfort with digital technologies and leaving them behind, but ensuring that there is a clear bridge with this technology to what their level of comfort&nbsp;is.</p><p>Bouma: We are moving to a notion of a digital economy, and it’s more than some slogan. We are building a digital infrastructure that is becoming a critical infrastructure. It is important that we understand that we develop the capabilities that ensure that the citizens actually feel safe. This is as fundamental as having safe drinking water and a regulated electricity supply. So now we need to start thinking about the digital capabilities, verifiable credentials included, as part of the national and international infrastructure.</p><p>We’re doing proof of concepts and pilots on national digital infrastructure, to understand what it means, to use a Canadian metaphor, create a “set of rails” that goes across the country. What would that look like? What are the capabilities? At the end of the day, we need to build services that can be trusted by Canadians and everyone. And there’s a lot of engineering and a lot of policy work that has to go into&nbsp;that.</p> Most Surprising Lesson <p>Vescent: What’s the most surprising thing you’ve learned since the inception of your investment programs.?</p><p>Bouma: I had a major shift in perspective. There are other technical ecosystems we have to take into account, like the mobile driver’s license, the digital travel credentials, and others. So, we have to figure out how to incorporate all those requirements. The mantra I’ve been using is, we’ve got these different technical ecosystems but we have to focus on the human being — the point of integration is at the digital wallet. So that’s reframed my policy thinking — there’s a multiplicity of technical ecosystems that we have to account from a policy point of&nbsp;view.</p><p>Bringer: I’m impressed by the quality of the innovators. We have people who are very good in technology who understand the political challenges, the policy context in which they intervene and who are able to make excellent contribution to our own policy, and who are really dedicated to our human centric&nbsp;vision.</p><p>John: I’ll give you one positive one, one negative. On the positive side, I am happy there is a community of people that understands there is value in working together to ensure the shared infrastructure that we are all using has a common foundation of security, privacy, and interoperability — that it is not a zero-sum game. They can compete on top of a common foundation.</p><p>On the negative side, I’m fascinated by the shenanigans being pulled by people who use the theater of interoperability in order to pedal proprietary solutions. Fortunately, I think a lot of the public sector entities are getting more educated so that they can see through the interoperability theater.</p><p>Curious for more? Watch the full panel.

<p>I’ve just rediscovered two digital assets that I’d forgotten about.</p>
<p>1. The Reddit username judell, which I created in 2005 and never used. When you visit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/judell">the page</a> it says “hmm… u/judell hasn’t posted anything” but also reports, in my Trophy Case, that I belong to the 15-year club.</p>
<p>2. The Amazon AWS S3 bucket named simply jon, which I created in 2006 for an <a href="http://jonudell.net/udell/2006-03-22-towards-politically-neutral-infrastructure-amazons-s3.html">InfoWorld blog post</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060330221659/https://www.infoworld.com/article/06/03/22/76555_13OPstrategic_1.html">companion column</a> about the birth of Amazon Web Services. As Wikipedia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Amazon_Web_Services#Full_timeline">timeline</a> shows, AWS started in March of that year.</p>
<p>Care to guess the odds that I could still access both of these assets after leaving them in limbo for 15 years?</p>
<p>Spoiler alert: it was a coin flip.</p>
<p>I’ve had no luck with Reddit so far. The email account I signed up with no longer exists. The support folks kindly switched me to a current email but it’s somehow linked to Educational_Elk_7869 not to judell. I guess we may still get it sorted but the point is that I was not at all surprised by this loss of continuity. I’ve lost control of all kinds of digital assets over the years, including the above-cited InfoWorld article which only Wayback (thank you as always!) now remembers. </p>
<p>When I turned my attention to AWS S3 I was dreading a similar outcome. I’d gone to Microsoft not long after I made that AWS developer account; my early cloud adventures were all in Azure; could I still access those long-dormant AWS resources? Happily: yes. </p>
<p>Here’s the backstory from that 2006 blog post:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Naming</p>
<p>The name of the bucket is jon. The bucket namespace is global which means that as long as jon is owned by my S3 developer account, nobody else can use that name. Will this lead to a namespace land grab? We’ll see. Meanwhile, I’ve got mine, and although I may never again top Jon Stewart as Google’s #1 Jon, his people are going to have to talk to my people if they want my Amazon bucket.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not holding my breath waiting for an offer. Bucket names never mattered in the way domain names do. Still, I would love to be pleasantly surprised!</p>
<p>My newfound interest in AWS is, of course, because Steampipe wraps SQL around a <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws/tables">whole bunch of AWS APIs</a> including <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws/tables/aws_s3_bucket">the one for S3 buckets</a>. So, for example, when exactly did I create that bucket? Of course I can log into the AWS console and click my way to the answer. But I’m all about SQL lately so instead I can do this.</p>
 &gt; select name, arn, creation_date from aws_s3_bucket 
+-------+--------------------+---------------------+         
| name  | arn                | creation_date       |         
+-------+--------------------+---------------------+         
| jon   | arn:aws:s3:::jon   | 2006-03-16 08:16:12 |         
| luann | arn:aws:s3:::luann | 2007-04-26 14:47:45 |         
+-------+--------------------+---------------------+  
 
<p>Oh, and there’s the other one I made for <a href="https://www.luannudell.com/">Luann</a> the following year. These are pretty cool ARNs (<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html">Amazon Resource Names</a>)! I should probably do something with them; the names you can get nowadays are more like Educational_Elk_7869. </p>
<p>Anyway I’m about to learn a great deal about the many AWS APIs that Steampipe can query, <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/mods/turbot/aws_compliance">check for policy compliance</a>, and join with <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins">the APIs of other services</a>. Meanwhile it’s fun to recall that I wrote one of the first reviews of the inaugural AWS product and, in the process, laid claim to some very special S3 bucket names.</p>

<p>There’s an economic theory here:&nbsp;Free customers are more valuable than captive ones—to themselves, to the companies they deal with, and to the marketplace. If that’s true, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527">the intention economy</a> will prove it. If not, we’ll stay stuck in the attention economy, where the belief that captive customers are more valuable than free ones prevails.</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22attention+economy%22">attention economy</a> is not native to human attention. It’s native to businesses that&nbsp; seek to grab and manipulate buyers’ attention. This includes the businesses themselves and their agents. Both&nbsp;see human attention as a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy">resource</a>” as passive and ready for extraction as oil and coal. The primary actors in this economy—purveyors and customers of marketing and advertising services—typically talk about human beings not only as mere “users” and “consumers,” but as “targets” to “acquire,” “manage,” “control” and “lock in.” They are also oblivious to the irony that this is the same language used by those who own cattle and slaves.</p>
<p>While attention-grabbing has been around for as long as we’ve had yelling, in our digital age the fields of practice (abbreviated&nbsp;<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=martech">martech</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=adtech">adtech</a>) have become so vast and varied that nobody (really, nobody) can get their head around everything that’s going on in them. (Examples of attempts are <a href="https://informationsciencejournal.org/2021/01/10/fueling-the-adtech-machine-google-analytics-and-the-commodification-of-online-personal-data/">here</a>, <a href="https://cdn.chiefmartec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/martech-landscape-2020-martech5000-slide.jpg">here</a> and <a href="https://lumapartners.com/content/lumascapes/display-ad-tech-lumascape/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>One thing we know for sure is that martech and adtech rationalize taking advantage of absent&nbsp;<a href="http://In%20this%20economy,%20human%20attention%20is%20a%20scarce%20%22resource,%22%20ready%20for%20extraction.%20And%20the%20extraction%20business%20typically%20talks%20about%20human%20beings%20not%20just%20as%20mere%20%22users%22%20or%20%22consumers,%22%20but%20as%20%22targets%22%20to%20%22acquire,%22%20%22manage,%22%20%22control%22%20and%20%22lock%20in%22—oblivious%20to%20the%20irony%20that%20this%20is%20the%20same%20language%20used%20by%20those%20owning%20cattle%20and%20slaves.">personal privacy</a>&nbsp;tech in the hands of their targets. What we need there are the digital equivalents of the privacy tech we call clothing and shelter in the physical world. We also need means to signal our privacy preferences, to obtain agreements to those, and to audit compliance and resolve disputes. As it stands in the attention economy, privacy is a weak promise made separately by websites and services that are highly incentivised not to provide it. Tracking prophylaxis in browsers is some help, but itworks differently for every browser and it’s hard to tell what’s actually going on.</p>
<p>Another thing we know for sure is that the attention economy is thick with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/augustinefou/2020/08/14/my-review-of-ad-fraud-detection-technology-companies/?sh=7314bf2d7172">fraud</a>, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=malware+adtech">malware</a>, and worse. For a view of how much worse, look at any adtech-supported website&nbsp;through <a href="https://pagexray.fouanalytics.com">PageXray</a>&nbsp;and see the hundreds or thousands of ways sthe site and its invisible partners are trying to track you. (For example, <a href="https://pagexray.fouanalytics.com/q/smithsonianmag.com">here’s what Smithsonian Magazine‘s site does</a>.)</p>
<p>We also know that lawmaking to stop adtech’s harms (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act">CCPA</a>) has thus far mostly caused inconvenience for you and me (how many “consent” notices have interrupted your web surfing today?)—while creating a vast new industry devoted to making tracking as easy as legally possible. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gdpr+compliance">Look up GDPR+compliance</a> and you’ll get way over 100 million results. Almost all of those will be for companies selling other companies ways to obey the letter of privacy law while violating its spirit.</p>
<p>Yet all that bad shit is also a red herring, misdirecting attention away from the inefficiencies of an economy that depends on unwelcome surveillance and algorithmic guesswork about what people might want.</p>
<p>Think about this: even if you apply all the machine learning and artificial intelligence in the world to all the personal data that might be harvested, you still can’t beat what’s possible when the targets of that surveillance have their own ways to contact and inform sellers of what they actually want and don’t want, plus ways to form genuine relationships and express genuine (rather than coerced) loyalty, and to do all of that at scale.</p>
<p>We don’t have that yet. But when we do, it will be an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527">intention economy</a>. Here are the opening paragraphs of&nbsp;The Intention Economy: When Customers Take Charge (Harvard Business Review Press, 2012):</p>
<blockquote><p>This book stands with the customer. This is out of necessity, not sympathy. Over the coming years, customers will be emancipated from systems built to control them. They will become free and independent actors in the marketplace, equipped to tell vendors what they want, how they want it, where and when—even how much they’d like to pay—outside of any vendor’s system of customer control. Customers will be able to form and break relationships with vendors, on customers’ own terms, and not just on the take-it-or-leave-it terms that have been pro forma since Industry won the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>Customer power will be personal, not just collective.&nbsp; Each customer will come to market equipped with his or her own means for collecting and storing personal data, expressing demand, making choices, setting preferences, proffering terms of engagement, offering payments and participating in relationships—whether those relationships are shallow or deep, and whether they last for moments or years. Those means will be standardized. No vendor will control them.</p>
<p>Demand will no longer be expressed only in the forms of cash, collective appetites, or the inferences of crunched data over which the individual has little or no control. Demand will be personal. This means customers will be in charge of personal information they share with all parties, including vendors.</p>
<p>Customers will have their own means for storing and sharing their own data, and their own tools for engaging with vendors and other parties.&nbsp; With these tools customers will run their own loyalty programs—ones in which vendors will be the members. Customers will no longer need to carry around vendor-issued loyalty cards and key tags. This means vendors’ loyalty programs will be based on genuine loyalty by customers, and will benefit from a far greater range of information than tracking customer behavior alone can provide.</p>
<p>Thus relationship management will go both ways. Just as vendors today are able to manage relationships with customers and third parties, customers tomorrow will be able to manage relationships with vendors and fourth parties, which are companies that serve as agents of customer demand, from the customer’s side of the marketplace.</p>
<p>Relationships between customers and vendors will be voluntary and genuine, with loyalty anchored in mutual respect and concern, rather than coercion. So, rather than “targeting,” “capturing,” “acquiring,” “managing,” “locking in” and “owning” customers, as if they were slaves or cattle, vendors will earn the respect of customers who are now free to bring far more to the market’s table than the old vendor-based systems ever contemplated, much less allowed.</p>
<p>Likewise, rather than guessing what might get the attention of consumers—or what might “drive” them like cattle—vendors will respond to actual intentions of customers. Once customers’ expressions of intent become abundant and clear, the range of economic interplay between supply and demand will widen, and its sum will increase. The result we will call the Intention Economy.</p>
<p>This new economy will outperform the Attention Economy that has shaped marketing and sales since the dawn of advertising. Customer intentions, well-expressed and understood, will improve marketing and sales, because both will work with better information, and both will be spared the cost and effort wasted on guesses about what customers might want, and flooding media with messages that miss their marks. Advertising will also improve.</p>
<p>The volume, variety and relevance of information coming from customers in the Intention Economy will strip the gears of systems built for controlling customer behavior, or for limiting customer input. The quality of that information will also obsolete or re-purpose the guesswork mills of marketing, fed by crumb-trails of data shed by customers’ mobile gear and Web browsers. “Mining” of customer data will still be useful to vendors, though less so than intention-based data provided directly by customers.</p>
<p>In economic terms, there will be high opportunity costs for vendors that ignore useful signaling coming from customers. There will also be high opportunity gains for companies that take advantage of growing customer independence and empowerment.</p></blockquote>
<p>But this hasn’t happened yet. Why?</p>
<p>Let’s start with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand">supply and demand</a>, which is roughly about price. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/law-of-supply-demand.asp">Wikipedia</a>: “the relationship between the price of a given good or product and the willingness of people to either buy or sell it.” But that wasn’t the original idea. “Supply and demand” was first expressed as “demand and supply” by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Steuart_%28economist%29">Sir James Denham-Steuart</a> in An Inquiry into the Principles of Political Oeconomy, written in 1767. To Sir James, demand and supply wasn’t about price. Specifically, “it must constantly appear reciprocal. If I demand a pair of shoes, the shoemaker either demands money or something else for his own use.” Also, “The nature of demand is to encourage industry.”</p>
<p>Nine years later, in The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith, a more visible bulb in the Scottish Enlightenment, wrote, “The real and effectual discipline which is exercised over a workman is that of his customers. It is the fear of losing their employment which restrains his frauds and corrects his negligence.” Again, nothing about price.</p>
<p>But neither&nbsp;of those guys lived to see the industrial age take off. When that happened, demand became an effect of supply, rather than a cause of it. Supply came to run whole markets on a massive scale, with makers and distributors of goods able to serve countless customers in parallel. The industrial age also ubiquitized standard-form&nbsp;<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/adhesion_contract_%28contract_of_adhesion%29">contracts of adhesion</a> binding all customers to one supplier with a single “agreement.”</p>
<p>But, had Sir James and Adam lived into the current millennium, they would have seen that it is now possible, thanks to digital technologies and the Internet, for customers to achieve scale across many companies, with efficiencies not imaginable in the pre-digital industrial age.</p>
<p>For example, it should be possible for a customer to express her intentions—say, “I need a stroller for twins downtown this afternoon”—to whole markets, but without being trapped inside any one company’s walled garden. In other words, not only inside Amazon, eBay or Craigslist. This is called <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Intentcasting">intentcasting</a>,&nbsp;and among its virtues is what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Cameron_(computer_scientist)">Kim Cameron</a> <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/01/the_laws_of_identity.shtml">calls</a> “minimum disclosure for constrained purposes” to “justifiable parties” through a choice among a “plurality of operators.”</p>
<p>Likewise, there is no reason why websites and services can’t agree to&nbsp;your&nbsp;privacy policy, and your&nbsp;terms of engagement. In legal terms, you should be able to operate as the first party, and to proffer your own terms, to which sites and services can agree (or, as privacy laws now say, consent) as second parties. That this is barely thinkable is a legacy of a time that has sadly not yet left us: one in which only companies can enjoy that kind of scale. Yet it would clearly be a convenience to have privacy as normalized in the online world as it is in the offline one. But we’re slowly getting there; for example with Customer Commons’ <a href="https://customercommons.org/solutions/tools/terms/p2b1/">P2B1, aka #NoStalking</a> term, which readers can proffer and publishers can agree agree to. It says “Just give me ads not based on tracking me.” Also with the IEEE’s <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/project/7012.html">P7012&nbsp;Standard for Machine Readable Personal Privacy Terms</a>&nbsp;working group.</p>
<p>Same with <a href="https://customercommons.org/solving-subscriptions/">subscriptions</a>. A person should be able to keep track of all her regular payments for subscription services, to keep track of new and better deals as they come along, to express to service providers her intentions toward those new deals, and to cancel or unsubscribe. There are lots of tools for this today, for example&nbsp;<a href="https://zdcs.link/Truebill?_ga=2143292681.1599871823&amp;t=lineup-page&amp;el=Truebill&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcmag.com%2Fhow-to%2Fhow-to-track-and-manage-your-paid-subscriptions&amp;cd2=Story%20Slideshow&amp;cd61=lineup&amp;cd62=04H2Trg3sEkVXbHd1PljSHY">Truebill</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bobbyapp.co/">Bobby</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moneydashboard.com/">Money Dashboard</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://mint.intuit.com/">Mint</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/subscriptme-personal-finance/id963594756">Subscript Me</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bill-tracker-pro/id1059461492">BillTracker Pro</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://go.asktrim.com/">Trim</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://subby.online/">Subby</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/card-due-credit-card-bill-tracker/id1073417260">Card Due</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.siftwallet.com/">Sift</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tilicho.subman&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">SubMan</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/subscriptme-bill-tracker/id963594756">Subscript Me</a>. There are also subscription management systems offered by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/how-paypal-works">Paypal</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/magazines-subscription-manager">Amazon</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039">Apple</a>&nbsp;and Google (e.g. with&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/">Google Sheets</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yq4KbccszG71lj0QTStMciiGdFVSgMlspAi4gAomDAY/template/preview">Google Doc templates</a>). But all of them to one degree or another are based more on the felt need by those suppliers for customer captivity than for customer independence.</p>
<p>As Customer Commons unpacks it <a href="https://customercommons.org/solutions/">here</a>, there are many largely or entirely empty market spaces that are wide open for free and independent customers: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity">identity</a>, shopping (e.g. with shopping carts of your own to take from site to site), loyalty (of the genuine kind), property ownership (the real Internet of Things), and <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/EmanciPay">payments</a>, for example.</p>
<p>It is possible to fill all those spaces if we have the capacity to—as Sir James put it—encourage industry, restrain fraud and correct negligence. While there is some progress in some of those areas, the going is still slow on the global scale. After all,&nbsp;The Intention Economy is nine years old and we still don’t have it yet. Is it just not possible, or are we starting in the wrong places?</p>
<p>I think it’s the latter.</p>
<p>Way back in 1995, when the Internet first showed up on both of our desktops, my wife Joyce said, “The sweet spot of the Internet isn’t global. It’s local.” That was the gist of my <a href="https://tedxsantabarbara.com/2018/doc-searls/">TEDx Santa Barbara talk in 2018</a>. It’s also why Joyce and I are now in Bloomington, Indiana, working&nbsp;with the <a href="https://ostromworkshop.indiana.edu/">Ostrom Workshop</a> at Indiana University on deploying a new way for demand and supply to inform each other and get business rolling—and to start locally. It’s called the <a href="https://customercommons.org/a-new-way/">Byway</a>, and it works outside of the old supply-controlled industrial model.&nbsp;<a href="https://customercommons.org/solutions/tools/intention-byway/intention-byway-faq/">Here’s an FAQ</a>.

<p>The article shows how an ASP.NET Core API and a Blazor BBF application can be implemented in the same project and secured using Azure AD with Microsoft.Identity.Web. The Blazor application is secured using the BFF pattern with its backend APIs protected using cookies with anti-forgery protection and same site. The API is protected using JWT Bearer tokens and used from a separate client from a different domain, not from the Blazor application. This API is not used for the Blazor application. When securing Blazor WASM hosted in an ASP.NET Core application, BFF architecture should be used for the Blazor application and not JWT tokens, especially in Azure where it is not possible to logout correctly.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCore6Experiments">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCore6Experiments</a></p>



<p>Setup</p>



<p>The Blazor application consists of three projects. The Server project implements the OpenID Connect user interaction flow and authenticates the client as well as the user authentication. The APIs created for the Blazor WASM are protected using cookies. A second API is implemented for separate clients and the API is protected using JWT tokens. Two separate Azure App registrations are setup for the UI client and the API. If using the API, a third Azure App registration would be used for the client, for example an ASP.NET Core Razor page, or a Power App.</p>



<p>API </p>



<p>The API is implemented and protected with the MyJwtApiScheme scheme. This will be implemented later in the Startup class. The API uses swagger configurations for Open API 3 and a simple HTTP GET is implemented to validate the API security.</p>


  [Route("api/[controller]")]
[ApiController]
[Authorize(AuthenticationSchemes = "MyJwtApiScheme")]
[Produces("application/json")]
[SwaggerTag("Using to provide a public api for different clients")]
public class MyApiJwtProtectedController : ControllerBase
{
	[HttpGet]
	[ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status200OK, Type = typeof(string))]
	[SwaggerOperation(OperationId = "MyApiJwtProtected-Get", 
		Summary = "Returns string with details")]
	public IActionResult Get()
	{
		return Ok("yes my public api protected with Azure AD and JWT works");
	}
}
  


<p>Blazor BFF</p>



<p>The Blazor applications are implemented using the backend for frontend security architecture. All security is implemented in the backend and the client requires a secret or a certificate to authenticate. The security data is stored to an encrypted cookie with same site protection. This is easier to secure than storing tokens in the browser storage, especially since Blazor does not support strong CSPs due to the generated Javascript and also that AAD does not support a proper logout for access tokens, refresh tokens stored in the browser. The following blog post explains this in more details.</p>



<p><a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/03/08/securing-blazor-web-assembly-using-cookies/">Securing Blazor Web assembly using&nbsp;cookies</a></p>



<p>Microsoft.Identity.Web</p>



<p>The Microsoft.Identity.Web Nuget package is used to implement the Azure AD clients. This setup is different to the documentation. The default schemes need to be set correctly when using Cookie (App) authentication and also API Auth together. The AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp method sets up the Blazor authentication for one Azure App registration using configuration from the AzureAd settings. The AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApi method implements the second Azure App registration for the JWT Bearer token Auth using the AzureAdMyApi settings and the MyJwtApiScheme scheme.</p>


  services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt; 
{
	options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
	options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
	options.DefaultSignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
	options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(Configuration, "AzureAd", 
	OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
   .EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(initialScopes)
   .AddMicrosoftGraph("https://graph.microsoft.com/beta",
		"User.ReadBasic.All user.read")
   .AddInMemoryTokenCaches();

services.AddAuthentication("MyJwtApischeme")
	.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApi(
		Configuration, "AzureAdMyApi", "MyJwtApiScheme");
  


<p>app.settings</p>



<p>The ASP.NET Core project uses app.settings and user secrets in development to configure the Azure AD clients. The two Azure App registrations values are added here.</p>


  "AzureAd": {
	"Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
	"Domain": "damienbodhotmail.onmicrosoft.com",
	"TenantId": "7ff95b15-dc21-4ba6-bc92-824856578fc1",
	"ClientId": "46d2f651-813a-4b5c-8a43-63abcb4f692c",
	"CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc",
	"SignedOutCallbackPath ": "/signout-callback-oidc"
	// "ClientSecret": "add secret to the user secrets"
},
"AzureAdMyApi": {
	"Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
	"Domain": "damienbodhotmail.onmicrosoft.com",
	"TenantId": "7ff95b15-dc21-4ba6-bc92-824856578fc1",
	"ClientId": "b2a09168-54e2-4bc4-af92-a710a64ef1fa"
},
  


<p>Swagger</p>



<p>Swagger is added to make it easier to view and test the API. A simple UI is created so that you can paste your access token into the UI and test the APIs manually if required. You could also implement a user flow directly in the Swagger UI but then you would have to open up the security headers protection to allow this. </p>


  services.AddSwaggerGen(c =&gt;
{
	c.EnableAnnotations();

	// add JWT Authentication
	var securityScheme = new OpenApiSecurityScheme
	{
		Name = "JWT Authentication",
		Description = "Enter JWT Bearer token **_only_**",
		In = ParameterLocation.Header,
		Type = SecuritySchemeType.Http,
		Scheme = "bearer", // must be lower case
		BearerFormat = "JWT",
		Reference = new OpenApiReference
		{
			Id = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
			Type = ReferenceType.SecurityScheme
		}
	};
	c.AddSecurityDefinition(securityScheme.Reference.Id, securityScheme);
	c.AddSecurityRequirement(new OpenApiSecurityRequirement
	{
		{securityScheme, Array.Empty&lt;string&gt;() }
	});
	c.SwaggerDoc("v1", new OpenApiInfo
	{
		Title = "My API",
		Version = "v1",
		Description = "My API"
	});

});
  


<p>The Swagger middleware is added after the security headers middleware. Some people only add this to dev and not production deployments.</p>


  app.UseSwagger(); 
app.UseSwaggerUI(c =&gt;
{
	c.SwaggerEndpoint("/swagger/v1/swagger.json", "MyApi v1");
});

  


<p>Testing</p>



<p>The UITestClientForApiTest Razor Page application can be used to login and get an access token to test the API. Before starting this application, the AzureAD configuration in the settings need to be updated to match your Azure App registration and your tenant. The access token can be used directly in the Swagger UI. The API only accepts delegated access tokens and no CC tokens etc. The configuration in the Blazor server application also needs to match the Azure App registrations in your tenant. </p>







<p>This setup is good for simple projects where you would like to avoid creating a second deployment or you want to re-use a small amount of business logic from the Blazor server. At some stage, it would probably make sense to split the API and the Blazor UI into two separate projects which would make this security setup more simple again but result in more infrastructure.</p>

<p>I’ve been building and working with REST APIs for many years now. Recently, however, I’ve been spending more and more of my time working with (and building) GraphQL-based APIs.</p>

<p>While GraphQL has generally made my life easier, especially as I’ve been building and consuming more data-heavy APIs, there is still one extremely annoying problem I’ve run into over and over again: lack of GraphQL support for third-party APIs I need to consume.</p>

<p>If I’m trying to use a third-party API service that doesn’t have a GraphQL endpoint, I either need to:</p>

 
 Download, install, configure, and learn how to use their custom REST API clients (which takes a lot of time and means my codebase is now a bit cluttered), or 
 Build my own GraphQL proxy for their service… But this is a big task. I’ve got to read through all their REST API docs and carefully define GraphQL schemas for everything, learning all the ins and outs of their API as I go. 
 

<p>In short: it’s a lot of work either way, but if I really want to use GraphQL everywhere I have to work for it.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, every API service would have a GraphQL endpoint, this way I could just use a single GraphQL library to query all the API services I need to talk to.</p>

<p>Luckily, one of my favorite developer tools, <a href="https://stepzen.com/" title="StepZen">StepZen</a> (disclaimer: I advise them), has made this problem a lot less painful.</p>

 What StepZen Does 

<p>StepZen is a platform that lets you host a GraphQL endpoint to use in your applications. But, more importantly, they’ve designed a schema system that lets you import (or build your own) GraphQL wrappers for just about anything: REST APIs, databases, etc. It’s really neat!</p>

<p>Using the StepZen CLI, for example, I can create a new GraphQL endpoint that allows me to talk with the <a href="https://www.airtable.com/" title="Airtable">Airtable</a> and <a href="https://www.fedex.com/en-us/home.html" title="FedEx">FedEx</a> APIs, neither of which support GraphQL natively. The beautiful thing is, I don’t even need to write a GraphQL wrapper for this myself since someone else already did!</p>

<p>Here’s what this looks like (assuming you’ve already got the <a href="https://stepzen.com/docs/cli" title="StepZen CLI">StepZen CLI</a> installed and initialized):</p>

 <code>$ stepzen import airtable
$ stepzen import fedex
$ stepzen start
</code> 

<p>Using the <code>import</code> command, StepZen will download the publicly available GraphQL schemas for these services (Airtable and FedEx) to your local directory. The <code>start</code> command then launches a GraphQL explorer on localhost, port 5000, which you can use to interactively query the Airtable and FexEx APIs using GraphQL! Pretty neat!</p>

<p></p>

 How to Access Public GraphQL Schemas 

<p>So, let’s say you want to use GraphQL to query an API service that doesn’t support GraphQL. If you’re using StepZen, you can find all the publicly available (official) schemas on the <a href="https://github.com/steprz/stepzen-schemas" title="StepZen Schemas on GitHub">StepZen Schemas repo</a> on GitHub. This repo is namespaced, so if you see a folder in the project, you can use the <code>stepzen import</code> command on it directly. At the time of writing, there are 24 publicly available GraphQL schemas you can instantly use.</p>

<p>StepZen currently has support for lots of popular developer services: <a href="https://disqus.com/api/docs/" title="Disqus API">Disqus</a>, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest" title="GitHub API">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://shopify.dev/api/admin/rest/reference" title="Shopify API">Shopify</a>, etc.</p>

<p>You can, of course, create your own GraphQL schemas as well.</p>

 The Problem I Ran Into with GraphQL 

<p>Several months ago I was working on a simple user-facing web app. The entire backend of the app was using GraphQL and I was trying to keep the codebase as pure as possible, which meant not using any REST APIs directly.</p>

<p>In all my years of building web apps, I’ve always used a REST API at some point. So this was a bit of an experiment to see whether or not I could build my app without cluttering my codebase with REST API clients or requests.</p>

<p>As I was working on the app, I went to use one of my favorite free API services, <a href="https://randomuser.me/" title="Random User">Random User</a>. If you haven’t heard of it before, it’s a publicly available REST API you can hit to generate realistic-looking fake users. It’s incredible for building a development environment, using seed data in an app, or creating real-world-looking MVPs. I use it all the time.</p>

<p>I knew going into this process that the Random User API didn’t have a GraphQL endpoint, so I figured I’d spend some time creating one for them.</p>

 How to Convert a REST API to GraphQL 

<p>My goal, as I mentioned above, was to build a GraphQL endpoint for the Random User REST API.</p>

<p>In order to make this work, what you have to do is translate your REST API so the <a href="https://stepzen.com/" title="StepZen">StepZen service</a> can understand which endpoints you are hitting and what types of inputs and outputs they require.</p>

<p>Once you’ve defined all this, StepZen will be able to create a GraphQL endpoint for your app. When your app queries the StepZen GraphQL endpoint, StepZen will translate your GraphQL request into the proper REST API call, execute the request, then translate the response and send it back to your app in standard GraphQL format.</p>

<p>Here’s how you can convert any REST API to GraphQL using StepZen, step-by-step.</p>

 Step 1: Read Through the REST API Docs and Identify Endpoints to Convert 

<p>The first part of converting any REST API to GraphQL is to fully understand what endpoints you want to convert from REST to GraphQL.</p>

<p>In my case, the Random User API only has a single endpoint, so this isn’t complicated. But, let’s say you’re converting a large, popular API like <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api" title="Twilio API">Twilio</a> that has many endpoints… This can be much more difficult.</p>

<p>To make things simpler, here’s what I recommend: when converting a REST API to GraphQL, identify the endpoints you actually need and ignore the rest. Trying to build an entire abstraction layer for a massive API like Twilio would be difficult, so instead, focus only on the key endpoints you need to use. In the future, if you need to use additional endpoints, you can always add support for them.</p>

<p>NOTE: This is especially true if you’re using StepZen. It’s incredibly easy to support additional endpoints in StepZen once you have a basic schema going, so don’t feel bad about focusing on the important ones and ignoring the rest.</p>

<p>Following this just-in-time pattern will help save you time and get you back to working on the important stuff.</p>

 Step 2: Understand the REST Endpoint’s Schema 

<p>Every API endpoint has some sort of schema. For example, the Random User API, when queried, returns a blob of JSON similar to the following:</p>

 <code>{
  "results": [
    {
      "gender": "male",
      "name": {
        "title": "mr",
        "first": "brad",
        "last": "gibson"
      },
      "location": {
        "street": "9278 new road",
        "city": "kilcoole",
        "state": "waterford",
        "postcode": "93027",
        "coordinates": {
          "latitude": "20.9267",
          "longitude": "-7.9310"
        },
        "timezone": {
          "offset": "-3:30",
          "description": "Newfoundland"
        }
      },
      "email": "brad.gibson@example.com",
      "login": {
        "uuid": "155e77ee-ba6d-486f-95ce-0e0c0fb4b919",
        "username": "silverswan131",
        "password": "firewall",
        "salt": "TQA1Gz7x",
        "md5": "dc523cb313b63dfe5be2140b0c05b3bc",
        "sha1": "7a4aa07d1bedcc6bcf4b7f8856643492c191540d",
        "sha256": "74364e96174afa7d17ee52dd2c9c7a4651fe1254f471a78bda0190135dcd3480"
      },
      "dob": {
        "date": "1993-07-20T09:44:18.674Z",
        "age": 26
      },
      "registered": {
        "date": "2002-05-21T10:59:49.966Z",
        "age": 17
      },
      "phone": "011-962-7516",
      "cell": "081-454-0666",
      "id": {
        "name": "PPS",
        "value": "0390511T"
      },
      "picture": {
        "large": "https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/men/75.jpg",
        "medium": "https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/med/men/75.jpg",
        "thumbnail": "https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/thumb/men/75.jpg"
      },
      "nat": "IE"
    }
  ],
  "info": {
    "seed": "fea8be3e64777240",
    "results": 1,
    "page": 1,
    "version": "1.3"
  }
}
</code> 

<p>Since the purpose of the Random User API is to return random user data, I can clearly see in the JSON data many of the fields I might be interested in working with: <code>email</code>, <code>cell</code>, <code>username</code>, etc.</p>

<p>Once you’ve clearly identified the fields you want to make use of, move on to the next step.</p>

 Step 3: Create a Corresponding GraphQL Schema 

<p>Once you’ve figured out which fields you want to make use of, you need to define a <a href="https://graphql.org/learn/schema/" title="GraphQL Schema">GraphQL schema</a> that will tell the StepZen service how to understand the endpoint’s response.</p>

<p>You don’t need to be a wizard to do this, just pick out the important fields (and their types) from a REST API response, then build a corresponding GraphQL type.</p>

<p>For example, here’s the <code>RandomUser</code> type I defined based on the REST API output above:</p>

 <code>type RandomUser {
  gender: String!
  title: String!
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
  streetNumber: Int!
  streetName: String!
  city: String!
  state: String!
  country: String!
  postcode: String!
  latitude: String!
  longitude: String!
  timezoneOffset: String!
  timezoneDescription: String!
  email: String!
  uuid: String!
  username: String!
  password: String!
  salt: String!
  md5: String!
  sha1: String!
  sha256: String!
  dateOfBirth: Date!
  age: Int!
  registeredDate: DateTime!
  registeredAge: Int!
  phone: String!
  cell: String!
  largePicture: String!
  mediumPicture: String!
  thumbnailPicture: String!
  nationality: String!
}
</code> 

<p>As you can see, I simply defined the fields I care about from the REST response, along with their type.</p>

<p>NOTE: The exclamation point after many of these fields is to mark these fields as non-nullable. This means that no matter what, these fields should always be present in a response.</p>

<p>What you’ll want to do is create a new folder in your project and put this code into a file named <code>&lt;servicename&gt;.graphql</code>. In my case, I created the following directory tree and put the code into the <code>randomuser.graphql</code> file.</p>

 <code>randomuser
└─ randomuser.graphql
</code> 

 Step 4: Define a GraphQL Query 

<p>Once your data modeling is complete and you’ve defined your type(s), it’s time to define a special <code>Query</code> type that will tell the StepZen service how to communicate with the REST API you’re converting.</p>

<p>To get started, edit the <code>&lt;servicename&gt;.graphql</code> file and add the following <code>Query</code> definition:</p>

 <code>type Query {
  randomUser: RandomUser
    @rest(
      endpoint: "https://randomuser.me/api"
      resultroot: "results[]"
    )
}
</code> 

<p>This is a barebones query that essentially tells StepZen the <code>randomUser</code> query will return data of type <code>RandomUser</code> (which we defined in the previous step) and will get data by hitting the <code>https://randomuser.me/api</code> endpoint, then parsing the data out of the <code>results</code> JSON array field.</p>

<p>But… That’s not all! We still have more work to do.</p>

<p>When I defined the <code>RandomUser</code> type above, I decided to make all the data flat, and not nested like it was in the original REST API. This is because I don’t need any special nested fields when I generate a random user, I just want the data!</p>

<p>So, the next thing we need to do is explain to StepZen how to convert the nested JSON key/values into the custom schema I defined. To do this, we’ll use the <code>setters</code> REST directive StepZen provides:</p>

 <code>type Query {
  randomUser: RandomUser
    @rest(
      setters: [
        { field: "title", path: "name.title" }
        { field: "firstName", path: "name.first" }
        { field: "lastName", path: "name.last" }
        { field: "streetNumber", path: "location.street.number" }
        { field: "streetName", path: "location.street.name" }
        { field: "city", path: "location.city" }
        { field: "state", path: "location.state" }
        { field: "country", path: "location.country" }
        { field: "postcode", path: "location.postcode" }
        { field: "latitude", path: "location.coordinates.latitude" }
        { field: "longitude", path: "location.coordinates.longitude" }
        { field: "timezoneOffset", path: "location.timezone.offset" }
        { field: "timezoneDescription", path: "location.timezone.description" }
        { field: "uuid", path: "login.uuid" }
        { field: "username", path: "login.username" }
        { field: "password", path: "login.password" }
        { field: "salt", path: "login.salt" }
        { field: "md5", path: "login.md5" }
        { field: "sha1", path: "login.sha1" }
        { field: "sha256", path: "login.sha256" }
        { field: "dateOfBirth", path: "dob.date" }
        { field: "age", path: "dob.age" }
        { field: "registeredDate", path: "registered.date" }
        { field: "registeredAge", path: "registered.age" }
        { field: "largePicture", path: "picture.large" }
        { field: "mediumPicture", path: "picture.medium" }
        { field: "thumbnailPicture", path: "picture.thumbnail" }
        { field: "nationality", path: "nat" }
      ]
      endpoint: "https://randomuser.me/api"
      resultroot: "results[]"
    )
}
</code> 

<p>Using the <code>setters</code> directive, we’re able to tell StepZen which fields in our <code>RandomUser</code> type can be supplied by which nested paths from the raw REST API JSON data. Neat!</p>

<p>There are lots of other things you can define using StepZen, so even if you have an incredibly complex endpoint there are always ways to support it. To learn more about this, you might want to read through the <a href="https://stepzen.com/docs/connecting-backends/how-to-connect-a-rest-service">StepZen docs</a> on the subject.</p>

 Step 5: Define the API Metadata 

<p>Once you’ve finished defining the data model and query, the next thing you’ll want to do is prepare your GraphQL API schema for production!</p>

<p>In my case, I wanted to contribute my schema back to the StepZen developer community, so I forked the <a href="https://github.com/steprz/stepzen-schemas" title="StepZen Schemas Repo">stepzen-schemas repo</a> and created a new top-level folder named <code>randomuser</code> in which I put my query/data model from above.</p>

<p>I then wrote up a README and created  a <code>stepzen.config.json</code> file which provides details about this schema:</p>

 <code>{
  "name": "RandomUser",
  "description": "Generates random users for testing purposes using the randomuser.me API.",
  "categories": ["Dev Tools"]
}
</code> 

<p>Notice how all I’m providing is a <code>name</code>, <code>description</code>, and any relevant <code>categories</code> this schema fits into.</p>

<p>Finally, I opened a pull request to the StepZen repo and the maintainers tested and merged my schema into the repo so anyone could use it!</p>

<p>Now, if you have no interest in creating a public GraphQL schema for the REST API you’re converting, you can obviously skip this step. So long as you have a folder with your service name and your data model/queries defined, you can use StepZen to run your endpoint regardless of whether or not your schema is publicly available to the world.</p>

 Using Your Converted REST API 

<p>Once you’ve built a schema that teaches StepZen how to talk to the REST API, how do you actually use it?</p>

<p>Well, in the example above, I built a public-facing StepZen schema and contributed it back to the community. In this case, I can simply use this schema like I would any other:</p>

 <code>$ stepzen import randomuser
$ stepzen start
</code> 

<p>This will download and install the schema I built, then deploy the code in the current directory to my personal StepZen GraphQL endpoint. It’ll also watch the directory for changes and automatically deploy them if I tweak any of the schema code, etc.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, the <code>start</code> command will open a browser window with the StepZen Schema Explorer that will allow you to test your API by exploring the queries and types available and querying the API running on StepZen.</p>

<p>If you want to start querying your new GraphQL endpoint directly from an application, read through the <a href="https://stepzen.com/docs/connecting-frontends/connecting-to-stepzen" title="Connecting to Your StepZen API">Connecting to Your StepZen API Guide</a> which shows some examples of how to connect/query your new GraphQL API.</p>

 Recap: How to Convert a REST API You Don’t Control to GraphQL 

<p>If you’re trying to find a way to use GraphQL on a REST API, here’s what you should do.</p>

<p>First, check StepZen’s list of <a href="https://github.com/steprz/stepzen-schemas" title="StepZen Publicly Supported Schemas">publicly supported schemas</a> to see if a schema already exists. This means you can use GraphQL to access the API of your choice without doing much.</p>

<p>If there isn’t a public schema available, go build your own! To do this:</p>

 
 Figure out what endpoints you need to use 
 Figuring out what data your endpoints take as input/output 
 Define a GraphQL type to reflect what your endpoints look like in GraphQL 
 Define a StepZen query to explain how the StepZen service can interact with the REST API 
 

<p>Once you have a schema, you can easily deploy it live to the StepZen service, which will give you a dedicated GraphQL endpoint/explorer you can query. And bam, you’re now able to use GraphQL to talk to any REST API, even ones you don’t own/control/etc!</p>

<p>A derived version of this article was published by the <a href="https://mobileecosystemforum.com/?p=103731&amp;preview=1&amp;_ppp=2bb3b8b890">Mobile Ecosystem Forum</a> on October 7, 2021.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you heard? Mobile is a big deal. The <a>majority of the world’s population carries a mobile device</a>, and there are <a>billions of connected devices</a> integrated throughout nearly every part of our daily life. Why does this insight matter? Putting it another way, mobile is the guiding light that leads enterprises down the path of commercial success. Commercial success requires The 3Cs: Connection, Communication, Commerce. One of the four core threads that connect these three stepping stones to commercial success is mobile; the other three are communications, content, and identity (aka personal information). Everyone in an enterprise must understand this, from the c-suite to the staffer. Why? Because today’s connected [mobile] individual is the point of everything along the customer journey. They are the point of discovery. The point of consideration. The point of sales/transaction. The point of engagement. The point of loyalty. Point of exit. And, at each point of engagement, mobile identity plays an irreplaceable role. We’re still early days in mobile identity, but the market is shaping and reshaping up quickly.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We see the mobile device as playing an almost irreplaceable role in terms of this linkage between a physical person in live space, or meatspace, you might say, and the digital realm.” – Cameron D’Ambrosi, Managing Director, Liminal 2021 (MEF PD&amp;I Working Group Guest Speaker, 2021)</p></blockquote>
 Mobile Identity: A Pillar for Commercial Success 
<p>Mobile identity sits at the heart of most commercial experiences. Identity can help organizations know, with varying levels of assurance, who is on the other end of a device (aka “know your customer”); likewise, soon but not just yet, it will enable individuals to know the enterprise too (aka “know the sender”). The ability for enterprises and the connected individual to know, with absolute assurance (aka deterministic identity) or with varying degrees of assurance (aka probabilistic identity), who the human or entity is on the other end of a device is extremely important. When we have identity assurance, we can have transparency in our transactions, communications, and relationships. This transparency fosters trust, which in turn leads to lasting connections, effective communications, and commerce. Moreover, this transparency will allow organizations to better serve people at every stage along the customer lifecycle (acquisition, consideration, conversation, adoption, loyalty, and offboarding), while simultaneously meeting their contractual, legal and regulatory obligations and protecting themselves and their stakeholders from fraud and other cybercrime. With the systematic foundation of trust that mobile identity enables, a world of abundance can lay out our feet.</p>
 Mobile Ecosystem Forum PD&amp;I Working Group 
<p>The <a>Mobile Ecosystem Forum</a> is a global big-tent trade body made of leading cross-sector organizations from around the world. Its mission is to help foster a healthy, responsible, mobile ecosystem, one where mobile can be used as an effective tool to bring social and commercial prosperity to every region, organization, and individual.</p>
<p>It is accomplishing this by engaging in a range of initiatives that generate insights, stimulate interaction, and make a positive impact. Much of the MEFs work happens at a grassroots level in its workgroups. For example, the <a>Personal Data &amp; Identity Working Group</a>, chaired by <a>Andrew Perkin-White</a>, focuses on mobile identity, the emerging personal data economy, the growth and application of people-centric regulations (e.g.&nbsp;<a>GDPR</a>, <a>CCPA</a>), the annual <a>MEF global trust study</a>, and more. The working group meets monthly to discuss and prioritize the effort across all its initiatives.</p>
 MEF PD&amp;I Working Group Guest Speaker 
<p>Periodically the working group invites a guest speaker to the monthly working group meeting. September 20, 2021, the group was fortunate enough to have <a>Cameron D’Ambrosi</a>, Managing Director, <a>Liminal</a>, join the meeting and share his thoughts on the state of the global identity infrastructure market ecosystem, both today and in the years to come.</p>
<p></p>
<p>During his prepared remarks, Cameron shared Liminal’s framework for evaluating identity infrastructure, the “Honeycomb.” He talked through the structure of the Honeycombs, how “anchor” identity solutions sit in the center, adjacent solutions fuse together to support use cases, and various other solutions specialize in the three types of data: deterministic, probabilistic, and self-managed, and their persistent or transitory states. He touched on a number of important topics, including,</p>
 
 The Liminal “Identity Honeycombs” framework 
 The three data types and their two stages 
 Digital ID: A How, not a What 
 Use Case examples 
 Strategies for navigating the landscape 
 Risk/reward management 
 Identity orchestration 
 And more

 An Invitation To Lead 
<p>The conversation with Cameron went on much longer than what you heard in the recording above. Why? Because much of the content is reserved for MEF members. If you’re a MEF member, I encourage you to log in to the MEF site and listen to the engaging Q&amp;A the working group members had with Cameron. If you’re not a member of the MEF, I encourage you to consider becoming one. Through the MEF, you can gain indispensable insight, interact with people, and make a difference that will benefit you and your company professionally and personally. An important thing to remember is that with membership in any community, including the MEF, like anything in life, is that you get out of it what you put in. The more you put into your relationship with the MEF and your fellow members, the more you can get out.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this peek into the identity infrastructure marketplace. If you have thoughts and ideas as to where you think the marketplace is going, please do reach out. With the MEF, I’m working on a personal data &amp; identity market assessment report. I’d love to connect with you, see <a>MEF Personal Data &amp; Market Assessment Project (Schedule Interview and Share Insights)</a> to learn about the project, schedule an interview with me, or share your insights and resources.</p>

  <p>I spent the last week mostly surrounded by boxes: we're completing our move to the new place and life is mostly unpacking now. I did find some time to fix some issues with my <a href="https://cdc-vaccination-history.datasette.io/">CDC vaccination history</a> Datasette instance though.</p>
 Fixing my CDC vaccination history site 
<p>I started tracking changes made to the <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total">CDC's COVID Data Tracker</a> website back in Feburary. I created <a href="https://github.com/simonw/cdc-vaccination-history">a git scraper repository</a> for it as part of my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Mar/5/git-scraping/">five minute lightning talk on git scraping</a> (notes and video) at this year's NICAR data journalism conference.</p>
<p>Since then it's been quietly ticking along, recording the latest data in a git repository that now has <a href="https://github.com/simonw/cdc-vaccination-history/commits/main">335 commits</a>.</p>
<p>In March I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/cdc-vaccination-history/commit/bf88c1e6cc3e5b6344a7dfea5d2a70dcb0552847#diff-87ee5504a3e25ac558b343724c905f2f7949e8cec3d92b9c4300bb922afa164f">added a script</a> to build the collected historic data into a SQLite database and publish it to Vercel using GitHub. That started breaking a few weeks ago, and it turnoud out that was because the database file had grown in size to the point where it was too large to deploy to Vercel (~100MB).</p>
<p>I got a bug report about this, so I took some time to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/cdc-vaccination-history/issues/8">move the deployment over</a> to Google Cloud Run which doesn't have a documented size limit (though in my experience starts to creak once you go above about 2GB.)</p>
<p>I also started publishing the raw collected data <a href="https://github.com/simonw/cdc-vaccination-history/issues/9">directly as a CSV file</a>, partly as an excuse to learn <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/googlecloud/gsutil-bucket">how to publish to Google Cloud Storage</a>.</p>
 datasette-template-request 
<p>I released an extremely simple plugin this week called <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-template-request">datasette-template-request</a> - all it does is expose Datasette's <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html#request-object">request object</a> in the context passed to <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/custom_templates.html">custom templates</a>, for people who want to update their custom page based on incoming request parameters.</p>
<p>More notable is how I built the plugin: this is the first plugin I've developed, tested and released entirely in my browser using the new <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">GitHub Codespaces</a> online development environment.</p>
<p>I created the new repo using my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin-template-repository">Datasette plugin template repository</a>, opened it up in Codespaces, implemented the plugin and tests, tried it out using the port forwarding feature and then published it to PyPI using the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-template-request/blob/0.1/.github/workflows/publish.yml">publish.yml</a> workflow.</p>
<p>Not having to even open a text editor on my laptop (let alone get a new Python development environment up and running) felt really good. I should turn this into a tutorial.</p>

<a href="https://equalsdrummond.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/workona-wordmark-logo.png"></a>



<p>This is the first post I’ve made in 2 years—for the simple reason that my day job in SSI (the acronym for  <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/self-sovereign-identity">Self-Sovereign Identity</a>—click the link and read the book if you want to learn more) has been all-consuming (and showing no signs of abating).</p>



<p>So that explains why the last post was a rant about an experience with Lyft. It’s blood-boiling incidents like that which move me past the inertia to actually push out a new post.</p>



<p>This post is similar, but with a different ending. Here’s the story:</p>



<p>For at least four years I had been an inveterate user of The Great Suspender browser extension to help save memory due to the dozens of browser tabs I always had open in Chrome.</p>



<p>Then last March <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-kills-the-great-suspender-heres-what-you-should-do-next/">Google remotely blocked The Great Suspender</a> because it had been sold to a malware company.</p>



<p>A friend recommended I try <a href="https://workona.com/">Workona</a> because “it does much more than just suspend tabs—it will transform how you work with your browser”.</p>



<p>I did a little research and found several more such breathless endorsements, so I decided to give Workona a try.</p>



<p>It worked exactly as advertised. Within 30 minutes “my life in a browser” was changed forever. I was never going back. (I won’t go into how Workona works here—just check out the many <a href="https://www.g2.com/products/workona/reviews">rave reviews</a>.)</p>



<p>I was hooked enough that after a few weeks I tweeted out a love letter to Workona. </p>



<blockquote><p>.<a href="https://twitter.com/WorkonaHQ">@WorkonaHQ</a> It is rare that a browser utility stands out enough to merit a direct personal endorsement. But Workona is that good. I read so many reviews saying “it will change the way you use your browser” that I wondered if that could really be true. It was. Within minutes.</p></blockquote>



<p>When they replied to thank me, I responded.</p>



<blockquote><p>Honestly, you deserve it. Pretty soon I am going to start wondering, “Am I using Workona inside my browser or am I using my browser inside of Workona?”</p></blockquote>



 End of Act 1. 



<p>Act 2 began at about 6PM last Tuesday night when I clicked the “New Version – Upgrade” button that appears in Workona when there’s a new update. As usual, it refreshed in seconds. </p>



<p>Suddenly there was a new icon next to many of my Workona workspaces. I thought, “Cool, I wonder what new feature this is?” I clicked one to find out…</p>



<p>…and up popped a new dialog saying the workspace was now “locked” and the only way to unlock it was to buy a premium subscription (to that point Workona has been completely free).</p>



<p>I went ballistic. This fantastic new tool that had become an integral part of using my browser was suddenly blocking my own work in my own workspaces. I started clicking madly on the links provided in the upgrade dialog to find out who was responsible for this outrage. When I found a Workona contact form, I was almost shouting at the screen as I typed. A sampling:</p>



<blockquote><p>I am beyond upset that after working with&nbsp;Workona&nbsp;for several months now—whose functionality I love and which I have already recommended to several friends and tweeted about—you suddenly, with NO WARNING—lock all but 5 of my workspaces and hold me hostage to upgrade to free them OR require an SSO connection just to export my own data.</p><p>That, my good friends, is highly unethical business behavior.</p></blockquote>



<p>As you can tell, I was livid.</p>



<p>Thankfully, in the time it took me to go take a short walk and blow off steam, Alex Young at Workona sent me a reply via email.</p>



<blockquote><p>We’re sorry for the frustration this has caused. To start, you should be able to access all of your existing workspaces if you click the “Open workspace” button when you see the Upgrade modal. We are not locking any users out of their workspaces.&nbsp;</p><p>As for SSO, this is just needed to authenticate you for security purposes. You signed in via SSO, and as a result, that’s how we need to verify you.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>Alex was right. Despite what the upgrade dialog said, the “Open workspace” button that was greyed out (the universal signal that a button is not functional) did in fact work if you clicked it. So I wasn’t locked out of all-but-5 of my workspaces. They had just made it look that way.</p>



 End of Act 2. 



<p>Act 3 began a few hours later after I finished the work I was under deadline for and finally replied to Alex’s email:</p>



<blockquote><p>Alex, I appreciate the rapid response to my email. I have no idea if&nbsp;Workona&nbsp;has an automatic timer for when that “upgrade prompt” appears for a user or whether&nbsp;Workona&nbsp;just applied the policy today. (If the latter, I worry that you and the rest of the support staff have been flooded with complaints like mine today.)</p><p>Honestly—and feel free to share this within the company—I would have been much more supportive if the whole thing had been messaged differently. For example:</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>First, an advanced notice could have been made that explained the change in policy—there was NO WARNING whatsoever.</p><p>Second, the upgrade could have explained that you can still access the rest of your workspaces, you just have to go through the nag screen.</p><p>But the best way to handle it would have been to be upfront from the start and explain that the free version supports up to 5 workspaces and beyond that, you have to subscribe.</p></blockquote>



<p>That began a dialog in several more rounds of email with Alex where he acknowledged my criticisms and explained the rationale behind the upgrade policy. I particularly appreciated this one:</p>



<blockquote><p>We did send out an email to all of our users that the change would be happening – are you subscribed to receive our emails?&nbsp;</p><p>As for the rest of your feedback, I have passed this along to our product team.&nbsp;<br>Also – a little background regarding our current pricing: We have had to overcome immense technical challenges in the development of what we believe is the world’s best browser&nbsp;work&nbsp;manager.</p><p>Work&nbsp;has steadily moved from the desktop to the cloud, and many people do almost all of their most important&nbsp;work&nbsp;in the browser these days. For people that&nbsp;work&nbsp;in the browser, $7 is a good match to the value our app provides, and our pricing survey data backs this up. If you don’t&nbsp;work&nbsp;in the browser, or don’t feel you need a professional/reliable&nbsp;work&nbsp;management system, then we certainly understand that a different solution may be a better fit. We hope this helps you better understand why&nbsp;Workona&nbsp;has the premium pricing it does.</p></blockquote>



<p>It turns out that Workona had indeed sent out an advance notice (in email, not in their browser extension) of their change in policy in late August. I was on vacation, naturally, so I had missed it. </p>



<p>When I found it and read it—it was perfectly reasonable. And, although I thought $7/mo was a little on the high side for Workona (I use Zoom 6+ hours a day and it’s $15/mo), I really did feel that Workona represented the future of work in the browser.</p>



<p>I was going to wait until the next day to decide about upgrading. But before I went to bed, Alex had assuaged me enough—and most importantly restored my belief in the intent and integrity of Workona as a company—that I went ahead and subscribed for a year.</p>



<p>That was a pretty dramatic turnaround in a single evening. Kudos to Alex for his premium customer service. As I said to him in my final message:</p>



<blockquote><p>Alex, FYI, I subscribed for the 1 year plan. I want to personally thank you for talking me off the ledge. That’s the kind of customer service that makes or breaks a company IMHO.<br>I have high hopes for&nbsp;Workona. Keep being awesome.</p></blockquote>



 EPILOG 



<p>Today there was another upgrade message from Workona. When I clicked on it, a screen popped up (I had the foresight to take a screenshot) that offered an apology directly to Workona users right there in the browser. It contained a link to <a href="https://workona.com/blog/update-to-premium-plans/">this page on the Workona website</a>, the start of which I’ll excerpt here:</p>



 An Apology From Our CEO 



 



<p>September 24, 2021</p>



<blockquote><p>This week, we made some serious missteps while launching Workona’s premium plans. Please allow me to personally apologize and explain exactly what what we’ve done to make it right.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>We assumed that a detailed email sent a month ago announcing the changes was enough advance notice for users. Clearly, we were wrong. Your feedback has made it obvious that this was a major mistake. We should have announced this in the product, multiple times. We messed up, and we’re sorry.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Many users were caught off guard by the restrictions of the Free plan and wondered whether Workona was still a good option for them. This was exacerbated by the unclear language we used in our popup, which made them believe they were locked out of their workspaces. This was not the case (and not our intention), but that doesn’t change the damage it did to our users’ trust in Workona.</p></blockquote>



<p>There’s more. I encourage you to go to the Workona website and read the rest.</p>



<p>I took the time to write this post—my first one in two years—because when you screw up as a company—no matter how big or small—this is how you make it right. You bite the bullet, admit your mistake, and fix it, no matter how much work it takes.</p>



<p>The faster and more transparently you do it, the faster you repair the damage and start restoring faith in your company.</p>



<p>Good job, Workona. (And great job, Alex.) My faith in you has been restored, and I’ll continue to recommend you as a browser work management tool. Keep growing it into something even more amazing.</p>

<p>A few months back, I wrote about some of the edge points of the verifiable credentials data model and briefly mentioned that the authorization capabilites for linked data (ZCAP-LD) data model were a useful technology for addressing these edges for building better distributed authz systems. So what is the differences between these two data models and why am I advocating for the separation of concerns for the two of them? The three main points I want to highlight are the conceptual differences in usages and how the data models assist with the enforcing those concepts. Then I’ll highlight the differences in the data models and finally, I’ll connect it all together to show how these difference makes a difference when build distributed authz systems.</p>

<p>So conceptually verifiable credentials exists to make provenanced assertions. What does this really mean though? Basically a verifiable credential is a way to know who is making the claims, what the claims are, and who the claims are about and it’s done in a standard way so that all parties who issue, hold, and verify the provenance of the claims can do so without having to pre-coordinate their software design. On the other hand, authorization capabilties (ZCAPs) are designed around removing the concept of who the statements are about and rather building around the concept of an “invoker”. And it’s this difference that allows for an emergence of a different authorization system called object capabilities authorization systems. It’s my personal opinion that object capability systems are better for most security models being designed today due to the simplicity for relying parties, but we’ll have to save that discussion for a later post.</p>

<p>What’s the difference between a subject and an invoker then? The difference is all in the practicality of pairing the claims with the entity. In the verifiable credential by tying all the claims to a subject there’s an inherent coupling of the claims to an identity by the issuer. In technical terms it’s actually being paired to an identifier which is the “credentialSubject.id” property which means that the claims that are made should really only be extended to a single entity which is the subject of the claims. Anything which extends beyond the original claims made by the issuer is actually a new credential which needs to be evaluated independently of the original veracity of the claims made by the first issuer.</p>

<p>For example, let’s look at a proof of assets credential:</p>

   <code>{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
    {
        "@vocab": "https://bank.com/vocab#"
    }
  ],
  "id": "http://example.edu/credentials/1872",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "ProofOfAssetsCredential"],
  "issuer": "did:web:bank.com:branch:id:565049",
  "issuanceDate": "2021-06-04T20:50:09Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:bankAccountOwner",
    "TotalAccountValueInUSD": 4156.62,
  },
  "proof": {
    "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
    "created": "2021-06-04T20:50:29Z",
    "verificationMethod": "did:example:bankAccountOwner#key-0",
    "proofPurpose": "authentication",
    "proofValue": "..."
  }
}
</code>   

<p>In this example we can see that a bank branch is asserting on behalf of the bank that the bank account owner has a total account value with this bank of $4156.62. Now, let’s say the bank account owner has decided to chain their credential to their child so that their child can spend up to $50:</p>

   <code>{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
    {
        "@vocab": "https://bank.com/vocab#"
    }
  ],
  "id": "http://example.edu/credentials/1872",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "ProofOfAssetsCredential"],
  "issuer": "did:example:bankAccountOwner",
  "issuanceDate": "2010-01-01T20:54:24Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:child",
    "TotalAccountValueInUSD": 50.00,
  },
  "proof": {
    "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
    "created": "2017-06-18T21:19:10Z",
    "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
    "verificationMethod": "did:example:bankAccountOwner#key1",
    "proofValue": "..."
  }
}
</code>   

<p>and with this the child is now able to create a verifiable presentation like this:</p>

   <code>{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",

<p>Let’s break down what is actually being asserted here, who the verifier needs to trust, and how the verifier would go about processing this verifiable presentation. From what we can see here, the bank is asserting that the bank account owner has a total account value of $4156.62, the bank account owner is asserting that their child is authorized to spend $50.00. Seems to make sense, right? Yeah, but the problem here is how is the verifier supposed to be able to trust that the bank account owner verified the child has that money as well, but why should the verifier trust the bank account owner? From their perspective there’s two problems here. First, they don’t trust any random person to make assertions about the amount of many in another persons bank account. Second, the verifier is unable to correlate the relationship between the bank account owner and the child. From their perspective, the <code>credentialSubject.id</code> should be expected to be two opaque identifiers assuming all they’ve received is this verifiable presentation. So, the problem here is that the verifier is expected to infer knowledge about what is actually being stated here which presents risks in the business processes being encoded into software. Are they to assume that they’ll be paid by the bank account owner if the child doesn’t pay? The reality is the verifier shouldn’t rely upon this verifiable presentation because there’s no way to chain the trust and figure out the capabilities that the child should have based only on this verifiable presentation. Sure, they could manage some state about the relationships of the identifiers and coordinate with the bank to know that they’ll make sure someone pays, but that leads to bespoke authorization systems built specifically to the business logic which is unlikely to scale to the size of the internet today within a reasonable time frame. Coordination costs are incredibly expensive (look at how long it takes to make a standard) and managing state makes it nearly impossible to generalize the system outside the particular business process it’s designed for.</p>

<p>How do ZCAPs address this problem then? First off, it’s important to recognize that the model of capabilities lends itself to different statements being made. In the verifiable credential model, traditional I’ve seen most people making claims about what the subject are. Where as with ZCAPs I’ve seen the focus of the statements on what the invoker can do. This slight shift combined with the change from a subject to an invoker changes the focus of the verifier to simplify what needs to be checked and makes it more explicit what they’re actually checking.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at an example to see what I mean by this:</p>

   <code>{
  "@context": ["https://w3id.org/security/v2",
  {
      "@vocab": "https://bank.com/vocab#"
  }],

  // The identifier of this specific zcap object
  "id": "https://example.com/zcap/id/1",

  // Since this is the first delegated capability, the parentCapability
  // points to the target this capability will operate against
  // (in this case, a payment gateway)
  "parentCapability": "https://example.com/paymentGateway",
  
  // the bank account owner is only allowed to spend the amount in their account
  "caveat": [{
       "type": "MaxPayment",
        "maxPaymentValue": 4156.62
  }],

  // We are granting authority to any of bankAccountOwner's verification methods
  "invoker": "did:example:bankAccountOwner",
  
  // Finally we sign this object with cryptographic material from
  // Alyssa's Car's capabilityDelegation field, and using the
  // capabilityDelegation proofPurpose.
  "proof": {
    "type": "Ed25519Signature2018",
    "created": "2018-02-13T21:26:08Z",
    "capabilityChain": [
      "https://example.com/paymentGateway"
    ],
    "proofValue": "...",
    "proofPurpose": "capabilityDelegation",
    "verificationMethod": "did:web:bank.com:branch:id:565049#key1"
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Now for the bank account owner to authorize their child to spend $50.00 they need to produce the following delegated capability:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": ["https://w3id.org/security/v2",
    {
        "@vocab": "https://bank.com/vocab#"
    }],

    // The identifier of this specific delegated zcap object
    "id": "https://example.com/zcap/id/2",

    // Pointing up the chain at the capability from
    // which the bank Account Owner was initially 
    // granted authority by their bank
    "parentCapability": "https://example.com/zcap/id/1",

    // Bank account owner adds a caveat:
    // child can spend a maximum of 50.00
    "caveat": [{
       "type": "MaxPayment",
        "maxPaymentValue": 50.00
    }],

    // bank account owner grants authority to any
    // verification method of their child's DID
    "invoker": "did:example:child",

    // Finally the bank account owner signs this 
    // object with the key she was granted the 
    // authority with
    "proof": {
        "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
        "proofPurpose": "capabilityDelegation",
        "created": "2018-02-13T21:26:08Z",
        "creator": "did:example:bankAccountOwner#key1",
        "signatureValue": "..."
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Now for the zcap to be invoked by the child at the payment gateway to spend $50 they need to produce a zcap that looks like the following:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": ["https://w3id.org/security/v2",
    {
        "@vocab": "https://bank.com/vocab#"
    }],

    "id": "https://example.com/zcap/id/3",

    // Pointing up the chain at the capability from
    // which the bank Account Owner was initially 
    // granted authority by their bank
    "parentCapability": "https://example.com/zcap/id/2",

    // bank account owner grants authority to any
    // verification method of their child's DID
    "invoker": "did:example:child",

    // the chain of capabilities from the trusted entity
    // making the intial authorization to the current 
    // capability being invoked 
    "capabilityChain": [{
        "@context": ["https://w3id.org/security/v2",
        {
            "@vocab": "https://bank.com/vocab#"
        }],
        "id": "https://example.com/zcap/id/1",
        "parentCapability": "https://example.com/paymentGateway",
        "caveat": [{
            "type": "MaxPayment",
                "maxPaymentValue": 4156.62
        }],
        "invoker": "did:example:bankAccountOwner",
        "proof": {

            "capabilityChain": [

            ],
            "proofValue": "...",

            "verificationMethod": "did:web:bank.com:branch:id:565049#key1"
        }
    },
    {
        "@context": ["https://w3id.org/security/v2",
        {
            "@vocab": "https://bank.com/vocab#"
        }],
        "id": "https://example.com/zcap/id/2",
        "parentCapability": "https://example.com/zcap/id/1",
        "caveat": [{
            "type": "MaxPayment",
            "maxPaymentValue": 50.00
        }],
        "invoker": "did:example:child",
        "proof": {
            "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
            "proofPurpose": "capabilityDelegation",
            "created": "2018-02-13T21:26:08Z",
            "creator": "did:example:bankAccountOwner#key1",
            "signatureValue": "..."
        }
    }],
    "proof": {
        "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
        "proofPurpose": "capabilityInvocation",
        "created": "2018-02-13T21:27:09Z",
        "creator": "did:example:child#key1",
        "signatureValue": "..."
    }
}
</code>   

<p>To verify this zcap, the payment gateway verifier needs to do the following:</p>

 
   verify the proof of the original capability 
   verify the original invoker is authorized to delegate the original capability on behalf of the payment gateway 
   verify the original capability meets or exceeds the authorities necessary to perform the request 
   verify the proof that the bankAccountOwner delegated the original capability to the invoker 
   verify the caveats allow the delegated capability to still meet or exceed the authorities necessary to perform the request 
   verify the proof in the capability invoked by the child 
 

<p>So this is a bit simpler for the payment gateway verifying the chain and makes it explicit what’s actually being delegated through the different parties. The question of the relationship between the different parties has now been eliminated which means that the payment gateway can operate in a stateless method. Additionally, there’s less coordination between the original delegator and the payment gateway verifier. In the object capabilities model the authorization semantics are all predetermined by what is possible to be authorized which keeps the claims tightly scoped to the purpose of the capabilities being invoked.</p>

<p>The difference here is that the basis of all authority stems from the verifier rather than building off the statements that already exist from Issuers who may not have designed the original claims for the purposes of an authorization systems. And this key difference is what allows for the simplicity of the verifier system to exist. It moves the model back to having the sole authority set by the verifier rather than the verifier having to adapt and potentially misinterpret the original veracity and the chained veracity of the claims.</p>

<p>So what are the drawbacks of the object capability paradigm and more specifically of the ZCAP-LD data model. Well first and foremost, ZCAPs are fit for purpose for building object capability authorization models and are unlikely to be reapplicable beyond that intended scope. For me that’s alright because I like the idea of designing a technology to do one thing well. Especially when dealing with security and access control. Whereas the verifiable credentials data model allows for generic statements to be made which are far more useful for verifiable data ecosystems to emerge. Additionally, it’s worth mentioning that the ZCAPs data model is a relatively immature draft report at the credentials community group where as the verifiable credentials data model has a much more stable recommendation having completed the process to become an international standard recommended by the W3C. This means there’s far more likely to be interoperability between verifiable credential processors than there would be between ZCAPs.</p>

<p>Why make the investment then to put the time and effort into ZCAPs when we’ve already got VCs? Simply put because security is hard and trying to push square pegs into round holes often times leads to bugs which are elevated to mission critical authentication/authorization bypass vulnerabilities. By designing around a fit for purpose data model with a well defined problem being solved it allows for us to be much more precise about where we believe extensibility is important versus where normative statements should be made to simplify the processing of the data models. By extension this leads to a simpler security model and likely a much more robust design with fewer vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/">Office of Management and Budget</a> (OMB) and the <a href="https://cisa.gov">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</a> (CISA) recently released a <a href="https://zerotrust.cyber.gov/federal-zero-trust-strategy/">request for public feedback</a> on a draft strategy for a zero-trust cybersecurity architecture for the US Government in response to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Executive Order 14028</a> issued last May. Public comments were due September 21. The comments I submitted are below.</p>



 



<p>Thank you for the opportunity to provide public comment on your draft, Moving the U.S. Government Towards Zero Trust Cybersecurity Principles. I hope that the below comments will inform your decisions as you finalize this policy.</p>



 Identity 



 Use of phishing-resistant MFA 



<p>Phishing is an important attack vector and must be addressed. The use of phishing-resistant MFA critically prevents the use of credentials by impostor websites and services such as mobile apps. Requiring phishing-resistant MFA by agency staff, contractors, and partners is a logical step, although existing PIV and derived PIV credentials are already phishing resistant. At the present time, PIV credentials are not available to contractors and partners that typically do not require access to federal facilities, so an alternate approach to this problem might be to unify the authentication methods used by these parties to use PIV or equivalently secure authenticators.</p>



<p>Requiring phishing-resistant MFA as an option for public access to federal websites and online services encourages use and familiarization with these authentication methods by the public, in addition to their direct role in blocking phishing attacks. Members of the public that adopt phishing-resistant authenticators also need to be cautioned against the use of other multifactor authentication methods that they might be prompted to use by phishing actors.</p>



<p>Currently, many commercial products that offer phishing-resistant authentication using the WebAuthn standard do not meet the current technical requirements of verifier impersonation resistance in NIST SP 800-63-3 (cited in footnote 4 of the draft) because they bind the authentication to the domain name of the verifier rather than to the communication channel itself. However, this non-compliance does not significantly impact the phishing resistance of these authenticators. It is widely expected that NIST will recognize these authenticators as an alternative method of achieving verifier impersonation resistance in the next revision of that Guideline. For clarity, it would be useful to explicitly recognize these authenticators as phishing-resistant in this policy as well.</p>



 Checking passwords against blocklists 



<p>This draft notes that CISA will be making a service available to check passwords against known-breached data. Use of a password blocklist is required by NIST SP 800-63B as well. The size of these blocklists should be carefully considered. A blocklist that is too small does not sufficiently protect against the use of common passwords, but a list that includes every common or breached password is likely to frustrate users, who will then focus on coming up with an acceptable password rather than other aspects of password strength such as length. There should also be the ability for individual agencies to supplement these blocklists with agency-specific entries.</p>



<p>The use of common passwords is not the only weakness in password use. Agencies should be reminded of the need to store password verification secrets securely (using, at a minimum, “salting” and iterative hashing) and of the need for rate limiting to blunt online guessing attacks.</p>



 Networks 



 DNS encryption 



<p>The draft policy notes the importance of encrypting DNS traffic, but seems to be undecided on the use of DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH, which operates in browsers) or DNS-over-TLS (DoT, which is normally implemented in the operating system). There is significant interesting DNS traffic that is not initiated by browsers, such as that coming from email clients, instant messaging applications, and many others. This policy should consider the need for DNS encryption outside the browser as well as for Web traffic.</p>



<p>Encryption of DNS traffic does limit agencies’ ability to inspect DNS requests for indications of malware and other inappropriate behavior, so there is somewhat of a security tradeoff in its implementation. If CISA’s Protective DNS offering is centralized, it may not be possible for individual agencies to employ DNS monitoring for security purposes.</p>



 DNSSEC 



<p>Notwithstanding the removal (by OMB M-18-23) of the requirement to implement DNSSEC that was established by M-08-23, DNSSEC implementation continues to be an effective defense against demonstrated DNS spoofing attacks and in providing a trust framework for data published in DNS. DNSSEC has a single “source of truth” that is easily monitored for fraud, unlike the WebPKI which has in excess of 100 certificate authorities, any of which could potentially publish a rogue certificate. Minimizing external security dependencies is very much in the spirit of the Zero Trust architecture. While Certificate Transparency helps a vigilant domain to detect the mistaken issuance of a certificate to the wrong party, many CAs are in jurisdictions where they could be compelled to issue a certificate and make it available to a bad actor, perhaps in support of a state-sponsored attack. For this reason, the use of DANE in addition to WebPKI, particularly for sensitive applications, should be strongly considered.</p>



<p>Furthermore, M-08-23 was in some cases interpreted as a requirement to DNSSEC-sign .gov domains but not necessarily to implement DNSSEC verification of DNS requests originating within an agency. In contrast many consumer DNS providers, including internet service providers and services such as Google, implement DNSSEC verification thereby giving their users a security advantage that these agencies currently do not have available. This policy should require verification as well as DNSSEC signing by agencies; verification could potentially be an aspect of the CISA Protective DNS program.</p>



 Encrypting email traffic 



<p>The draft correctly notes the importance of encryption for email traffic. It describes the use of MTA-STS to accomplish this by allowing a domain to advertise a policy that it supports SMTP-over-TLS. However, this publication requires additional infrastructure (web servers) to effect this, and requires caching of previously received policies to overcome the possibility that a bad actor will block the policy advertisement. In contrast DANE, which is deployed on DNSSEC protected domains, provides a way to publish a similar policy without this trust-on-first-use limitation and without the need to stand up additional infrastructure to support policy publication. DANE should be strongly considered as an alternative to MTA-STS for this requirement.</p>



<p>In addition, there is a complementary standard, REQUIRETLS (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8689">RFC 8689</a>), that allows the sender of an email message to tag it to indicate that the message must only be sent over a TLS-protected channel, effectively overriding the opportunistic nature of STARTTLS. This most directly satisfies the stated goal of guaranteeing that Federal emails are encrypted in transit. Unfortunately, REQUIRETLS has not received significant deployment, but government interest in this capability would undoubtedly motivate deployment. REQUIRETLS builds upon MTA-STS or DANE.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned if any further information or clarification is needed.</p>

      <br>  Can we live at the peak paradox?  <br> <p><a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/">Peak Paradox</a> is the middlemost point of the model. It is the point where everything has equal weight in terms of policy, priority, resources, commitment, interest, data and consequences.&nbsp; It is the area of a perfect storm.&nbsp; It is a magical (or imaginary) place where you can have everything, everyone else can have everything, no one is fighting for survival, and every work situation thrives.&nbsp; In reality, the converse is probably also true. It is where everyone fights for survival; I cannot get what I want, others have nothing and work is just meaningless. It is in between these two states of euphoria and despair that we spend our time.&nbsp; Never reaching utopia but somehow constantly individual’s individual’s feeling one step closer to dystopia.&nbsp; In this state, we have to decide how to allocate the limited resources we have to be able to change the situation (for the better.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Whilst hard to accept, we actually don’t have the data, model or ability to allocate resources for better outcomes as we live in a complex system. In our ecosystem and economy, our actions have consequences that we cannot see. In the USA, they reintroduced wolves and have found that Wolves play a crucial role in keeping ecosystems healthy. They help keep deer and elk populations in check, benefiting individual’s many other plant and animal species. The carcasses of their prey also help to redistribute nutrients and provide food for other wildlife species, like grizzly bears and scavengers. Scientists are just beginning to fully understand the positive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_effect">ripple effects</a> that wolves have on ecosystems. The removal of the wolves was forecast to create a more vibrant and healthy ecosystem, but it turns out it collapses without them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The Ripple Effect is when an initial disturbance to a system propagates outward to disturb an increasingly more significant portion of the system, like ripples expanding across the water when an object is dropped into it.&nbsp; The ripple effect is often used colloquially to mean a multiplier in macroeconomics. For example, an individual's reduction in spending reduces the incomes of others and their ability to spend. Unions negotiating for a pay rise drives prosperity for everyone. In sociology, the ripple effect can be observed in how social interactions can affect situations not directly related to the initial interaction and in charitable activities where information can be disseminated and passed from community to community to broaden its impact.&nbsp; The concept has been applied in computer science within the field of software metrics as a complexity measure.</p><p>Living at peak paradox and making decisions at this central point creates ripples. However, we find it easy to predict the positive consequences of ripples we want to see in the direction of the peak purpose we are aiming for on the Peak Paradox model.&nbsp; We are blinded to the adverse effects because we believe we have understood the risks and concluded this is the best action, given where we are and our resources.&nbsp; Equally, we find it near impossible to see any good or bad consequences that can occur in other directions.&nbsp; The point here is that we cannot see how a ripple in a different direction will come back (forward) and change the situation we forecast.&nbsp; This is the complexity of modelling dependent systems that we do not understand, yet believing we have a risk model that does.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The purpose of the Peak Paradox model is to shine a light on the other views, other perspectives, other consequences, other risks - not to change the decision, but to clarify how our decision will affect others and we are affected by theirs.&nbsp; With the same thinking, others acting with their own agency will optimise for a different peak and, in doing so, create ripples in our tank, highlighting why resilience has become such an important but widely misunderstood topic.&nbsp; We must agree on what we are trying to be resilient for, as it is often hidden.&nbsp;</p><p>The article on <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/plotting-how-to-make-better-decisions">how to make better decisions</a> using the Peak Pardox framework suggests that we have to move from the Peak Paradox if we can clarify what we are optimising for and bring the team together.&nbsp; However, the further we become aligned to a Purpose, whilst the easier the decision, the more unified the culture, the less resilient we become to others ripples.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Balancing simplicity of decision making, with the allocation of resources and understanding risk and consequences is the optimisation model a board now has to wrestle with. Decision making has never been more challenging.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p></p><br><br>

  <p>Summary: JSON has its place. But I think we're overusing it in places where a good notation would serve us better.</p>



<p>
    JSON is robot barf. Don't get me wrong. JSON is a fine serialization format for data and I have no problem with it in that context. My beef is with the use of JSON for configuration files, policy specs, and so on. If JSON were all we had, then we'd have to live with it. But we've been building parsers for almost 70 years now. The technology is well understood. There are multiple libraries in every language for parsing. And yet, even very mature, well supported frameworks and platforms persist in using JSON instead of a human-friendly notation. 
</p>

<p>
    When a system requires programmers to use JSON, what they're effectively asking developers to use an "abstract" syntax instead of a "concrete" syntax. Here's what I mean. This is a function definition in concrete syntax:
</p>



<p>
    And here's the same function definition expressed as an abstract syntax tree (AST) serialized as JSON:
</p>



<p>
    I don't know any programmer who'd prefer to write the abstract syntax instead of the concrete. Can you imagine an entire program expressed like that? Virtually unreadable and definitely not maintainable. <a href="https://blog.sessionstack.com/how-javascript-works-parsing-abstract-syntax-trees-asts-5-tips-on-how-to-minimize-parse-time-abfcf7e8a0c8"> Parsing can take as much as 20% of the time taken to compile code</a>, so there's a clear performance win in using abstract syntax over concrete, but even so we, correctly, let the machine do the work. 
</p>

<p>
    I get that systems often start out simply with simple configuration. Some inputs are just hierarchies of data. But that often gets more complicated over time. And spending time figuring out the parser when you're excited to just get it working can feel like a burden. But taking the shortcut of making developers and others write the configuration in abstract syntax instead of letting the computer do the work is a mistake. 
</p>

<p>
    I'd like to say that the problem is that not enough programmers have a proper CS education, but I fear that's not true. I suspect that even people who've studied CS aren't comfortable with parsing and developing notations. Maybe it's because we treat the subject too esoterically—seemingly useful for people designing a programming language, but not much else. And students pick up on that and figure this is something, like calculus, they're unlikely to ever use IRL. What if programming langauge classes helped students learn the joy and benefit of building little languages instead? 
</p>

<p>
    I'm a big believer in the power of notation. And I think we too often shy away from designing the right notation for the job. As I wrote about <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2007/11/domain_specific_language.shtml">Domain Specific Languages</a> (DSLs) in 2007:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        I'm in the middle of reading Walter Isaacson's new biography of Einstein. It's clear that notation played a major role in his ability to come up with the principle of general relativity. He demurred at first, believing that the math was for someone else to come along later and tidy up. But later in his life, after the experience of working on general relativity, Einstein became an ardent convert.</p>
    <p>
        Similarly, there is power in notation for computing tasks. Not merely the advantage of parameterized execution but in it's ability to allow us to think about problems, express them so that other's can clearly and unambiguously see our thoughts, and collaborate to create joint solutions. What's more, languages can be versioned. GUI configurations are hard to version. Notation has advantages even when it's not executed.</p>
    <p>
        The DSL becomes the focal point for design activities. The other day, I was having a discussion with three friends about a particular feature. Pulling out pencil and paper and writing what the DSL would need to look like to support the feature helped all of us focus and come up with solutions. Without such a tool, I'm not sure how we would have communicated the issues or whether we'd have all had the same conception of them and the ultimate solution we reached.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
    As this points out, clear notations have advantages beyond being easier to write and understand. They also provide the means to easily share and think about the problem. I think system designers would be better off if we spent more time thinking about the notation developers will use when they configure and use our systems, making it clear and easy to read and write. Good notation is a thinking tool, not just a way to control the system. The result will be increased expressiveness, design leverage, and freedom.

<p>This article shows how to create Microsoft Teams online meetings in ASP.NET Core using Microsoft Graph. Azure AD is used to implement the authentication using Microsoft.Identity.Web and the authenticated user can create teams meetings and send emails to all participants or attendees of the meeting.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/TeamsAdminUI">https://github.com/damienbod/TeamsAdminUI</a></p>

  <a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/09/20/creating-microsoft-teams-meetings-in-asp-net-core-using-microsoft-graph/">Creating Microsoft Teams meetings in ASP.NET Core using Microsoft Graph</a> (delegated)  <a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/10/18/creating-microsoft-teams-meetings-in-asp-net-core-using-microsoft-graph-application-permissions-part-2/">Creating Microsoft Teams meetings in ASP.NET Core using Microsoft Graph application permissions part 2</a>  



<p>Setup Azure App registration</p>



<p>An Azure App registration is setup to authenticate against Azure AD. The ASP.NET Core application will use delegated permissions for the Microsoft Graph. The listed permissions underneath are required to create the teams meetings and to send emails to the attendees. The account used to login needs access to office and should be able to send emails.</p>



  User.Read   Mail.Send   Mail.ReadWrite   OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite  



<p>This is the list of permissions I have activate for this demo. </p>







<p>The Azure App registration requires a user secret or a certificate to authentication the ASP.NET Core Razor page application. Microsoft.Identity.Web uses this to authenticate the application. You should always authenticate the application if possible. </p>



<p>Setup ASP.NET Core application</p>



<p>The Microsoft.Identity.Web Nuget packages with the MicrosoftGraphBeta package are used to implement the Azure AD client. We want to implement Open ID Connect code flow with PKCE and a secret to authenticate the identity and the Microsoft packages implements this client for us. </p>


  &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
&lt;PackageReference 
	Include="Microsoft.Identity.Web" 
	Version="1.16.1" /&gt;
&lt;PackageReference 
	Include="Microsoft.Identity.Web.UI" 
	Version="1.16.1" /&gt;
&lt;PackageReference 
	Include="Microsoft.Identity.Web.MicrosoftGraphBeta" 
	Version="1.16.1" /&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
  


<p>The ConfigureServices method is used to add the required services for the Azure AD client authentication and the Microsoft Graph client for the API calls. The AddMicrosoftGraph is used to initialize the required permissions.</p>


  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	// more services ...

	var scopes = "User.read Mail.Send Mail.ReadWrite OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite";

	services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(Configuration)
		.EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi()
		.AddMicrosoftGraph("https://graph.microsoft.com/beta", scopes)
		.AddInMemoryTokenCaches();

	services.AddRazorPages().AddMvcOptions(options =&gt;
	{
		var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
			.RequireAuthenticatedUser()
			.Build();
		options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
	}).AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();
}
  


<p>The AzureAd configuration is read from the app.settings file. The secrets are read from the user secrets in local development.</p>


  "AzureAd": {
	"Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
	"Domain": "damienbodsharepoint.onmicrosoft.com",

	// "ClientSecret": "add secret to the user secrets"
},
  


<p>Creating a Teams meeting using Microsoft Graph</p>



<p>The OnlineMeeting class from Microsoft.Graph is used to create the teams meeting. In this demo, we added a begin and an end DateTime in UTC and the name (Subject) of the meeting. We want that all invited attendees can bypass the lobby and enter directly into the meeting. This is implemented with the LobbyBypassSettings property. The attendees are added to the meeting using the Upn property and setting this with the email of each attendee. The organizer is automatically set to the identity signed in. </p>


  public OnlineMeeting CreateTeamsMeeting(
	string meeting, DateTimeOffset begin, DateTimeOffset end)
{

	var onlineMeeting = new OnlineMeeting
	{
		StartDateTime = begin,
		EndDateTime = end,
		Subject = meeting,
		LobbyBypassSettings = new LobbyBypassSettings
		{

<p>A simple service is used to implement the GraphServiceClient instance which is used to send the Microsoft Graph requests. This uses the Microsoft Graph as described by the docs.</p>


  public async Task&lt;OnlineMeeting&gt; CreateOnlineMeeting(
	OnlineMeeting onlineMeeting)
{
	return await _graphServiceClient.Me

}

public async Task&lt;OnlineMeeting&gt; GetOnlineMeeting(
	string onlineMeetingId)
{
	return await _graphServiceClient.Me
		.OnlineMeetings[onlineMeetingId]
		.Request()
		.GetAsync();
}
  


<p>A Razor page is used to create a new Microsoft Teams online meeting. The two services are added to the class and a HTTP Post method implements the form request from the Razor page. This method creates the Microsoft Teams meeting using the services and redirects to the created Razor page with the ID of the meeting. </p>

<p>Sending Emails to attendees using Microsoft Graph</p>



<p>The Created Razor page displays the meeting JoinUrl and some details of the Teams meeting. The page implements a form which can send emails to all the attendees using Microsoft Graph. The EmailService class implements the email logic to send plain mails or HTML mails using the Microsoft Graph.</p>

<p>The CreatedTeamsMeetingModel class is used to implement the Razor page logic to display some meeting details and send emails using a form post request. The OnGetAsync uses the meetingId to request the Teams meeting using Microsoft Graph and displays the data in the UI. The OnPostAsync method sends emails to all attendees.</p>


  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using TeamsAdminUI.GraphServices;
using Microsoft.Graph;

namespace TeamsAdminUI.Pages
{
    public class CreatedTeamsMeetingModel : PageModel
    {
        private readonly AadGraphApiDelegatedClient _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient;
        private readonly EmailService _emailService;

        public CreatedTeamsMeetingModel(
            AadGraphApiDelegatedClient aadGraphApiDelegatedClient,
            EmailService emailService)
        {
            _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient = aadGraphApiDelegatedClient;
            _emailService = emailService;
        }

        [BindProperty]
        public OnlineMeeting Meeting {get;set;}

        [BindProperty]
        public string EmailSent { get; set; }

        public async Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; OnGetAsync(string meetingId)
        {
            Meeting = await _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient.GetOnlineMeeting(meetingId);
            return Page();
        }

        public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnPostAsync(string meetingId)
        {
            Meeting = await _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient.GetOnlineMeeting(meetingId);
            foreach (var attendee in Meeting.Participants.Attendees)
            {
                var recipient = attendee.Upn.Trim();
                var message = _emailService.CreateStandardEmail(recipient, Meeting.Subject, Meeting.JoinUrl);
                await _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient.SendEmailAsync(message);
            }

            EmailSent = "Emails sent to all attendees, please check your mailbox";
            return Page();
        }

    }
}
  


<p>The created Razor page implements the HTML display logic and adds a form to send the emails. The JoinUrl is displayed as this is what you need to open the meeting a Microsoft Teams application.</p>


  @page "{handler?}"
@model TeamsAdminUI.Pages.CreatedTeamsMeetingModel
@{
}

&lt;h4&gt;Teams Meeting Created: @Model.Meeting.Subject&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Meeting Id:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Model.Meeting.Id&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;JoinUrl&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Model.Meeting.JoinUrl&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Participants&lt;/h4&gt;

@foreach(var attendee in Model.Meeting.Participants.Attendees)
{
	&lt;p&gt;@attendee.Upn&lt;/p&gt;
}

&lt;form method="post"&gt;
    &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;input type="hidden" value="@Model.Meeting.Id" /&gt;
        &lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary"&gt;&lt;i class="fas fa-save"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Send Mail to attendees&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Model.EmailSent&lt;/p&gt;
  


<p>Testing</p>



<p>When the application is started, you can create a new Teams meeting with the required details. The logged in user must have an account with access to Office and be on the same tenant as the Azure App registration setup for the Microsoft Graph permissions. The Teams meeting is organized using the identity that signed in because we used the delegated permissions. </p>







<p>Once the meeting is created, the created Razor page is opened with the details. You can send an email to all attendees or use the JoinUrl directly to open up the Teams meeting.</p>







<p>Creating Teams meetings and sending emails in ASP.NET Core is really useful and I will do a few following up posts to this as there is so much more you can do here once this is integrated.</p>

 I enjoyed reading The Code of Capital by Katharina Pistor.  I liked this book because it provides what seems like a rare perspective that is required to reveal the DNA of capitalism rather than the more common unintended obfuscation from books that are lacking.  A benefit is that emerging technologies related to assets can be considered in a more coherent way and we can see that issues which s

<p>I enjoyed reading <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691178974/the-code-of-capital">The Code of Capital</a> by <a href="https://www.law.columbia.edu/faculty/katharina-pistor">Katharina Pistor</a>.  I liked this book because it provides what seems like a rare perspective that is required to reveal the DNA of capitalism rather than the more common unintended obfuscation from books that are lacking.  A benefit is that emerging technologies related to assets can be considered in a more coherent way and we can see that issues which seem new often resemble those of the past.</p>

<p>For instance, Pistor asks the genesis question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How should the initial allocation of property rights in the digital world be achieved, and who is in charge?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While my mind somehow retrieves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWiwYApseDk">Otisburg</a>, Pistor more helpfully notes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These are the same questions the commoners disputed with the landlords and the settler challenged the First Peoples about, as discussed in Chapter 2.  Ultimately, these issues were resolved by establishing legal priority rights, backed by the coercive powers of the state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Law relating to capital is often created in private law offices but is dependent on the state for the legal modules used to assemble these legal codes.  The most important of these modules are contract law, property rights, collateral law, trust, corporate and bankruptcy law.</p>

<p>These legal codes transform an asset (object, claim, skill or idea) into capital.  Because the legal coding gives the asset attributes of priority, durability, universality and convertability, the asset can create wealth for its holder while surviving challenging economic circumstances and externalizing associated risks to others.  The book goes into detail as the legal modules are applied to new assets over time.</p>

<p>Following the evolution of these legal codes helped me understand things that had been a mystery to me.  I wish I could have read a book like this a long time ago.</p>

  <p>This entry marks my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/weeknotes/">100th weeknotes</a>, which I've managed to post once a week (plus or minus a few days) consistently since <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Sep/13/weeknotestwitter-sqlite-datasette-rure/">13th September 2019</a>.</p>
<p>I started writing weeknotes to add some accountability to the work I was doing during <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Sep/10/jsk-fellowship/">my JSK fellowship year</a> at Stanford. The fellowship ended over a year ago but I've stuck to the habit - I've been finding it really helpful as a structured approach to thinking about my work every week, and it occasionally helps motivate me to get things done enough that I have something I can write about!</p>
 Datasette Desktop 0.2.0 
<p>My big achievement this week was <a href="https://datasette.io/desktop">Datasette Desktop 0.2.0</a> (and the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/releases/tag/0.2.1">0.2.1 patch release</a> that followed). I published <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Sep/13/datasette-desktop-2/">annotated release notes</a> for that a few days ago. I'm really pleased with the release - I think Datasette as a desktop application is going to significantly increase the impact of the project.</p>
<p>I also sent out <a href="https://datasette.substack.com/p/datasette-desktop-a-macos-application">an issue of the Datasette Newsletter</a> promoting the new desktop application.</p>
 Datasette Desktop for Windows 
<p>I did a quick research spike to investigate the feasibility of publishing <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues/71">a Windows version</a> of Datasette Desktop. To my surprise, I managed to get a working prototype going with just half a small amount of work:</p>

<blockquote><p>So that was one heck of a lot easier than I expected... <a href="https://t.co/BDa4gvkgnd">pic.twitter.com/BDa4gvkgnd</a></p>- Simon Willison (@simonw) <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1438008493265473536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2021</a></blockquote> 
<p>Electron claims to solve cross-platform development and it seems to uphold that claim pretty well!</p>
<p>I'm still quite a bit of work away from having a release: I need to learn how to build and sign Windows installers. But this is a very promising first step.</p>
 json-flatten 
<p>I've started thinking about how I can enable Datasette Desktop users to configure plugins without having to hand-edit plugin configuration JSON (the current mechanism).</p>
<p>This made me take another look at a small library I released a couple of years ago, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/json-flatten">json-flatten</a>, which turns a nested JSON object into a set of flat key/value pairs suitable for editing using an HTML form and then unflattens that data later on.</p>
  &gt;&gt;&gt; import json_flatten
&gt;&gt;&gt; json_flatten.flatten({"foo": {"bar": [1, True, None]}})
{'foo.bar.[0]$int': '1', 'foo.bar.[1]$bool': 'True', 'foo.bar.[2]$none': 'None'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; json_flatten.unflatten(_)
{'foo': {'bar': [1, True, None]}}  
<p>It turns out a few people have been using the library, and had filed issues - I released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/json-flatten/releases/tag/0.2">version 0.2</a> with a couple of fixes.</p>

  <p>Summary:    Identity finds its way into everything—even toothbrushes. Careful planning can overcome privacy concerns to yield real benefits to businesses and customers alike.</p>


<p>
    I have a Philips Sonicare toothbrush. One of the features is a little yellow light that comes on to tell me that the head needs to be changed. The first time the light came on, I wondered how I would reset it once I got a new toothbrush head. I even googled it to find out. 
</p>

<p>
    Turns out I needn't have bothered. Once I changed the head the light went off. This didn't happen when I just removed the old head and put it back on. The toothbrush heads have a unique identity that the toothbrush recognizes. This identity is not only used to signal head replacement, but also to put the toothbrush into different modes based on the type of head installed. 
</p>

<p>
    Philips calls this <a href="https://www.electricteeth.com/sonicare-brushsync/">BrushSync</a>, but it's just RFID technology underneath the branding. Each head has an RFID chip embedded in it and the toothbrush body reads the data off the head and adjusts its internal state in the appropriate way.
</p>

<p>
    I like this use case RFID because it's got clear benefits for both Philips and their customers. Philips sells more toothbrush heads—so the internet of things (IoT) use case is clearly aligned with business goals. Customers get reminders to replace their toothbrush head and can reset the reminder by simply doing what they'd do anyway—switch the head
</p>

<p>
    There aren't many privacy concerns at present. But as more and more products include RFID chips, you could imagine scanners on garbage trucks that correlate what gets used and thrown out with an address. I guess we need garbage cans that can disable RFID chips when they're thrown away. 
</p>

<p>
    I was recently talking to a friend of mine, Eric Olafson, who is a founding investor in <a href="https://www.riotinsight.com">Riot</a>. Riot is another example of how thoughtfully applied RFID-based identifiers can solve business and customer problems. Riot creates tech that companies can use for RFID-based, in-store inventory management. This solves a big problem for stores that often don't know what inventory they have on hand. With Riot, a quick scan of the store each morning updates the inventory management system, showing where the inventory data is out of sync with the physical inventory. As more and more of us go to the physical store because the app told us they had the product we wanted, it's nice to know the app isn't lying. Riot puts the RFID on the tag, not the clothing, dealing with many of the privacy concerns.
</p>

<p>
    Both BrushSync and Riot use identity to solve business problems, showing'that unique identifiers on individual products can be good for business and customers alike. This speaks to the breadth of identity and its importance in areas beyond associating identifiers with people. I've noticed an uptick in discussions at <a href="http://internetidentityworkshop">IIW</a> about identity for things and the impact that can have. The next IIW is Oct 12-14—online—join us if you're interested.

<p>Since <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/intro-to-dids-for-people-5ebe620b5a15">the beginning</a> of our journey here at MATTR, decentralization and digital identity have been central to our approach to building products. As part of this, we’ve supported Decentralized Identifiers (or <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/docs/platform/core/dids/overview">DIDs</a>) since the <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-the-mattr-platform-91db4925c773">earliest launch of our platform</a>. We’ve also considered how we might give you more options to <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/did-extensibility-on-the-mattr-platform-14c73c7a798e">expand the utility</a> of these identities over&nbsp;time.</p> An important milestone <p>The W3C working group responsible for Decentralized Identifiers <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/9179">recently published</a> the DID v1.0 specification under “Proposed Recommendation” status. This is a significant milestone as DIDs approach global standardization with the pending approval of the W3C Advisory Committee.</p><p>DIDs are maturing, but so is the environment and context in which they were originally designed. With a complex ecosystem consisting of dozens of different methodologies and new ones emerging on a regular basis, it’s important to balance the potential of this decentralized approach with a realistic approach for defining the real utility and value of each <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods">DID method</a>. For example, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/NOTE-did-rubric-20210826/">DID Method Rubric</a> provides a good frame of reference for comparing different approaches.</p><p>Different types of DIDs can be registered and anchored using unique rules specific to the set of infrastructure where they’re stored. Since DIDs provide provenance for keys which are controlled by DID owners, the rules and systems that govern each kind of DID method have a significant impact on the trust and maintenance model for these identifiers. This is the key thing to remember when choosing a DID method that makes sense for your&nbsp;needs.</p> Our supported DID&nbsp;methods <p>In MATTR VII, by supporting a variety of DID methods — deterministic or key-based DIDs, domain-based DIDs, and ledger-based DIDs — we are able to provide tools which can be customized to fit the needs of individual people and organizations.</p>  Key-based DIDs — Largely static, easy to create, and locally controlled. This makes them a natural choice for applications where there’s a need to manage connections and interactions with users directly.  DIDs anchored to web domains — These have a different trust model, where control over the domain can bootstrap a connection to a DID. This makes a lot of sense for organizations with existing domain names that already transact and do business online, and can extend their brand and reputation to the domain of&nbsp;DIDs.  Ledger-based DIDs — These offer a distributed system of public key infrastructure which is not centrally managed or controlled by a single party. While ledgers differ in their governance and consensus models, they ultimately provide a backbone for anchoring digital addresses in a way which allows them to be discovered and used by other parties. This can be a useful feature where a persistent identifier is needed, such as in online communication and collaboration.  <p>There is no single DID method or type of DID (which at the moment) should be universally applied to every situation. However, by using the strengths of each approach we can allow for a diverse ecosystem of digital identifiers enabling connections between complex networks of people, organizations and machines.</p><p>To date, we’ve provided support for three main DID methods in our platform: <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">DID Key</a>, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">DID Web</a>, and <a href="https://sovrin-foundation.github.io/sovrin/spec/did-method-spec-template.html">DID Sovrin</a>. These align with three of the central types of infrastructure outlined&nbsp;above.</p> Introducing DID&nbsp;ION <p>We’re proud to announce that as of today we’ve added support for <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">DID ION</a>, a DID method which is anchored to IPFS and Bitcoin. We’ve <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/sidetree-protocol-reaches-v1-9b565cf92db3">supported the development of the Sidetree protocol</a> that underpins DID ION for some time as it has matured in collaboration with working group members at the Decentralized Identity Foundation.</p><p>With contributions from organizations such as Microsoft, Transmute, and SecureKey, <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree</a> and DID ION have emerged as a scalable and enterprise-ready solution for anchoring DIDs. The <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/decoding-the-sidetree-protocol-18d8bfa39257">core idea</a> behind the Sidetree protocol is to create decentralized identifiers that can run on any distributed ledger system. DID ION is an implementation of that protocol which backs onto the Bitcoin blockchain, one of the largest and most used public ledger networks in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Sidetree possesses some unique advantages not readily present in other DID methods, such as low cost, high throughput, and built-in portability of the identifier. This provides a number of benefits to people and organizations, especially in supporting a large volume of different kinds of connections with the ability to manage and rotate keys as needed. We have added end-to-end capabilities for creating and resolving DIDs on the ION network across our platform and wallet products.</p><p>Although DID ION is just one implementation of the Sidetree protocol, we see promise in other DID methods using Sidetree and will consider adding support for these over time as and when it makes sense. We’ll also continue to develop Sidetree in collaboration with the global standards community to ensure that this protocol and the ION Network have sustainable futures for a long time to&nbsp;come.</p><p>At the same time, the community around DID Sovrin is developing a new kind of interoperability by designing a <a href="https://hackmd.io/@icZC4epNSnqBbYE0hJYseA/S1eUS2BQw">DID method</a> that can work for vast networks of Indy ledgers, rather than focusing on the Sovrin-specific method that’s been used to date. As DID Sovrin gets phased out of adoption, we’re simultaneously deprecating standard support for DID Sovrin within MATTR VII. We’ll be phasing this out shortly with upcoming announcements for customers building on our existing platform.</p><p>If you’ve got any use cases that utilize DID Sovrin or want to discuss extensibility options, please reach out to us on any of our social channels or at info@mattr.global and we’ll be happy to work with&nbsp;you.</p> Looking ahead <p>We believe this a big step forward in providing a better set of choices when it comes to digital identity for our customers. From the start, we have designed our platform with flexibility and extensibility in mind, and will continue to support different DID methods as the market&nbsp;evolves.</p><p>We look forward to seeing how these new tools can be used to solve problems in the real world and will keep working to identify better ways to encourage responsible use of digital identity on the&nbsp;web.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/adding-did-ion-to-mattr-vii-d56bdb7a2fde">Adding DID ION to MATTR VII</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

	But ... last time I tried to do that, it wouldn't let me do that. Yeah. Locked out of capability on my own blog due to some glitch.</p>
<p>
	Where can I find someone who REALLY KNOWS THEIR STUFF around a server and around Drupal to help me out of this? Technical assistance is n order. Know such a person?</p>

<p>Over the past several years, the world of messaging has morphed in front of our very eyes. There are now more than six messaging channel categories, including text (inc. SMS, MMS, RCS), email, social media, chatbots (i.e. for support and conversational commerce), proximity alerts, and more than a dozen over-the-top apps (WhatsApp, WeChat, Viber, Apple Business Chat, Line, iMessage, Facebook Messenger, Pinterest, YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, and more). What does this mean for organizations? Well, for some they may think it means that their organization has a variety of channels to choose from to reach the people they serve (aka consumers, shoppers, patients, investors, etc.). On the surface, this is true. But what it really means is that organizations must start developing their multi-channel messaging muscles so that they can reach individuals not on the organization’s preferred time and medium of communication, but on the individual’s preferred time and medium of communication.</p>
<p>To effectively manage a messaging program, the most important thing to realize is that messaging channels are NOT all created equal. Every channel has a different audience profile, audience expectations, norms, message lengths, message formats, ways to send and receive messages, and methods for reporting across the engagement continuum (e.g., transaction through relationship). Messaging is an ecosystem all of its own that must be nurtured if you want to find success.</p>
 Need I say more? Of course, I do! 
<blockquote><p>“The customer is everywhere and nowhere.” Todd Harrison, SVP of Digital at Skechers&nbsp;(Harrison, 2021)</p></blockquote>
<p>You may find yourself with prospects and customers and few ways to reach them? You may find yourself with tired campaigns that simply do not perform the way you want them to? You may find yourself losing touch with your most valuable asset, your first-party database. You may ask yourself, how did I get here? You may ask yourself, which channel should I use to achieve the best results?</p>
<p>Todd is right, “the customer is everywhere, and nowhere.” The way to address this problem is to put your customer at the heart of your business. What does this mean? It means you must learn to collect and listen to their preferences? To interact and engage them, not just barrage them with mono-directional messages that basically say, “I have an idea, why don’t you buy more stuff from us?” People want to be respected, heard, and served. You need to treat them as the hero of your story. To make this happen, you need to understand them. You need to focus on building out an end-to-end communication strategy, which includes building a preference-based opt-in database, often referred to as a customer data platform (CDP). Depending on your needs you’ll need dedicated messaging platforms (e.g. SMS, 10DLC, Email, etc.) or possibly a multichannel communication platform as a service (CPasS) to manage real-time messaging across all channels. Moreover, you’ll need a content strategy. And soon, to meet the expectations of those you serve, you’ll need to build the capability to deliver predictive, personalized, contextually aware content and offers, with real-time feedback loops so that you can listen to customers and respond to them when they reply or initiate a conversation with you. In the near future, we will find that messaging has become the cornerstone of the vast majority of businesses’ engagement strategies, but we have a long way to go as only six to ten percent of companies are actively nurturing and running commercial messaging programs today (Ruppert, 2021).</p>
<p>Yes, you can succeed with the tried and true tactics, but for how long? The marketplace and consumer sentiments are changing, and you must change with them, or you’ll be left behind.</p>
<blockquote><p>“By 2030, society will no longer tolerate a business model that relies on mass transactions of increasingly sensitive personal data: a different system will be in place.”&nbsp;(Data 2030, 2020)</p></blockquote>
<p>We’ll cover more on the bigger picture in future articles, let’s get back to messaging.</p>
 What it takes to run a successful messaging program 
<p>The key to a successful messaging program is to start simple and build from there.</p>
<p>You should not be frightened by the sea of mobile messaging opportunities. Embrace them, and take them one step at a time. Take it from us, with the simplest of messaging programs you have the potential to see material success. For example, we are aware of a retail company that, in 12 months after launching a text-based SMS program sprinkled with the occasional MMS message, acquired 700,000 subscribers and is now generating over $1.4M in monthly sales.</p>

 Where do you start? 
<p>SMS, or text messaging, is the most straightforward, omnipresent, and ubiquitous messaging channel that you can use to engage people anywhere in the world. And, best of all, it is proven.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephanieburns/2019/09/06/9-clever-ways-to-use-text-messaging-in-your-business/?sh=2aa3edb62951">Open rates in SMS are often 95% and higher</a>.</p>
<p>Text messaging is not just about driving sales, and although this is the end-game, it is about being of service to your audience throughout every stage of the relationship they have with you. Text messaging provides at the most basic level more engagement not just as a utility but as a consumer relationship tool – securing interactions, driving pre and post-sales engagements, gathering feedback through surveys, and fostering loyalty and support. You can, and should, use it across every stage of the purchase funnel: discovery, awareness, consideration, conversation, onboarding and adoption, loyalty, support, and offboarding.</p>
<p>NOTE: Keep an eye out for 10DLC, a new messaging standard the kicked off in June 2021. Our next article will be on this.</p>
 But What if? 
<p>Yes, text messaging, aka SMS, is ubiquitous, but what should you do when you need to grow beyond what texting has to offer? Remember, “the medium is the message” (Marshall McLuhan, 1964). Text messaging is not the right channel for every engagement.</p>
<p>What if you needed to reach and engage people in China, Brazil, Germany, or Australia? What if your product was best suited to be explained via a picture or a video? What are the best channels to reach these consumers? Text is not always the answer!</p>

<p>Facebook Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, and other messaging channels are making a considerable play at being complementary messaging options for consumers and, in some cases, the primary channel. Geographic location is the main driver for these channel decisions as well as the use case. But the numbers don’t lie in regards to the global user base of over 2 billion consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/258749/most-popular-global-mobile-messenger-apps/">OTT Messaging Leaders.&nbsp;</a></p>
  
 Where Should You Start? 
<p>Sounds like a lot? Sounds complicated? It’s really not if you think about these few items and take them one at a time in your messaging and engagement roadmap.</p>
<p>Here are a few things for you to consider that will help mold your direction. First, start with a few pillars: Message type (use-case, transactional, marketing, support…), Geolocation(s), Staffing, and Existing Partners. Consider,</p>
 
 Are you currently offering text transactional or marketing messaging? 
 Which markets and countries are you looking to reach? 
 How much is your social media advertising budget? 
 Are you considering messaging for support (don’t just think SMS, think OTT)? 
 Do you have internal staff to manage your messaging programs? 
 Are you currently using a Marketing Automation platform? 
 Are you working with external guides and mentors (Remember:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6841097885103341568/">coaches and mentors are required if you want to be an expert</a>&nbsp;)? 
 
 Enter Personal Data &amp; Identity 
<p>It is critical for you to remember that all effective commerce starts with a meaningful connection and relevant and consistent communication. The path to relevance is through data, particularly personal data, in fact, a new asset class that you need to wield with precision.</p>
 The Bottomline 
<p>For the majority SMS (text) will be your first entry into the messaging space. But, depending on how you answered the questions above, the odds are you will be a perfect candidate to implement one of the other messaging channels too. Your next step is to evaluate your current programs and roadmap of “Needs” vs ’Wants” and map out the use cases, i.e., the experience you want to offer your customers, prior to finding a good technology and solutions partner.</p>
<p>Your “Needs’ may have to do with driving revenue, loyalty sign-ups, gathering preference data, support efficiencies, personalization, and could be as simple as mapping out your KPI’s and creating efficiencies of your current messaging strategy. Day, time, type of message, MMS vs.&nbsp;SMS, frequency, and more have a say in the results in your program. Remember, planning before tactics!</p>
<p>Messaging has proven to be the most effective tool, especially when used in a thoughtful and meaningful experience, for people-centric engagement programs. But in the age of the connected individual, the bottom line is that it is a necessity, not a nice to have.</p>
<p>There is a lot to navigate, but this is nothing like any other part of your business. You can do it. Create a roadmap. Find your partners. Take one step at a time!</p>

<p>現地（ミュンヘン）時間13日午後7時半、European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021で GAIN – Global Assured Identity Network を発表しました。これは、すべての参加者が身元確認済みであるオーバレイネットワークです。</p>



<p>使用したスライドは以下からご覧になっていただけます。</p>



<p>ホワイトペーパー自体は、<a href="https://gainforum.org/">https://gainforum.org/</a> からダンロードしていただけます。</p>



<p>参加にあたっての問い合わせは、DigitalTrust _at_ iif.com (International Institute of Finance内事務局。_at_ を @ で置き換えてお使いください）にお願いいたします。また、POC参加に関するお問い合わせは donna _at_ oidf.org にお願いします</p>



 GAINとは 



<p>詳細は以下の英文ブログに譲りますが、その下にDeepLによる機械翻訳も参考までに載せておきます。（検証していないので間違いや割愛等結構あるかもしれません。が、なんとなく概要を見るのには良いでしょう。原本は英語ですので、詳しく見るにはそちらを御覧ください。）</p>



 
<blockquote><a href="https://nat.sakimura.org/2021/09/14/announcing-gain/">Announcing GAIN: Global Assured Identity Network</a></blockquote>
 



<p>インターネットの始まりには、信頼がありました。誰もが参加している組織に知られており、誰もが責任（Accountability）を負わされることを知っていたのです。</p>



<p>しかし、90年代にインターネットが商業的に利用できるようになると、信頼は失われました。参加者の大半が匿名になり、責任を問われないと認識するようになったのです。その結果、多くの犯罪者やバッドアクターがネットワーク上で活躍するようになりました。インターネットのワイルド・ワイルド・ウエストの時代が到来したのです。</p>



<p>それ以来、状況を改善し、信頼を回復するために多くの努力が払われてきました。しかし、あまり効果はありませんでした。金融犯罪は、人への影響が計り知れない不正行為から生まれ、世界経済に年間GDPの最大5％もの損失を与えています。マネーロンダリング防止やテロ資金対策に莫大な費用がかけられていますが、今のところ効果はありません。金融システム内の1,000ドルの「違法な資金」に対して、コンプライアンスに100ドルが費やされていますが、傍受されるのはわずか1ドル。わずか0.1％です。</p>



<p>このコインの裏側には金融包摂の問題もあります。</p>



<p>多くの人々は、口座開設に関わる本人確認コストのために商業的にとりこむことができず、経済的に排除されています。</p>



<p>匿名で行動できることは、原理的にはプライバシーの面で大きなメリットがあります。しかし、私たちが実現しているのは、個人データが危険にさらされ、善良な行為者が悪質な行為者に容易に追跡されるという状況です。いわば熟練した悪質な行為者のためのプライバシーであり、われわれ「それ以外の人」のためのプライバシーはありません。</p>



<p>30年の時間とコストをかけたにもかかわらず、なぜ私たちはこれらを阻止することに成功しないのでしょうか。</p>



<p>それは、アイデンティティとアカウンタビリティという根本的な問題に取り組んでこなかったからです。</p>



<p>私たちが必要としているのは、エコシステム内のすべての参加者のアカウンタビリティを再確立することです。</p>



<p>このようなエコシステムは、比較可能性と相互承認の原則に基づいて相互に接続することができ、最終的にはサイバーワールドの人口の大部分をカバーする説明責任のあるエコシステムのネットワークを形成することができます。</p>



<p>そのようなエコシステムのひとつが、今日、私たちが提案するものです。GAIN（Global Assured Identity Network）です。</p>



<p>GAINは、アカウンタビリティのある参加者のみで構成されるインターネット上のオーバーレイネットワークです。すべての参加者は、主に銀行やその他の規制対象組織からなるホスティング組織で口座を開設する際に、規制を満たすための身元確認を受けています。これらの高保証属性は、エンドユーザーの指示に基づいて アイデンティティ情報提供者から依拠当事者(RP)に渡される アイデンティティ情報の基礎として使用されます。</p>



<p>エンド・ユーザーは、自己申告ではなく、信頼できるエンティティによって証明された年齢などの属性を証明できるようになります。これは非常に強力です。</p>



<p>例えば、「私は18歳以上です」ということを、「私を信じてください」と言うだけでなく、銀行の証明書を使って証明することができます。</p>



<p>これは、プライバシーの観点からも非常に良いことです。</p>



<p>自己申告の場合、情報の受け手は自分の言っていることが信じられないので、通常、それを証明するために運転免許証などの身分証明書を提示しなければなりません。この時点で、彼女は年齢よりもはるかに多くの属性を開示していることになります。</p>



<p>このような能力は、以前に行われた 身元確認にかかっています。身元確認は非常にコストのかかるプロセスです。</p>



<p>この目的のためだけにそれを行おうとすると、法外な費用がかかる可能性があります。</p>



<p>本業のために身元確認を行う必要がある銀行やその他の規制機関は、この点で有利です。これは、ある巨大なオンライン小売業者が、ホリデーシーズンにしか必要とされない冗長機能をより有効に活用するために、クラウドコンピューティングサービスを提供し始めたようなものです。他のホスティングベンダーは太刀打ちできませんでした。</p>



<p>アイデンティティ情報提供者によってIDが証明されたからといって、個人がGAINで匿名で行動できないわけではありません。個人は、マーチャントやネットワークの他の参加者に対して、匿名または偽名で行動することができます。実際、個人の属性の開示は最小限にとどめるのが普通である。ただし、不正行為を行った場合には、正当な手続きに基づいて個人を追跡し、責任を追及することができるようになっています。指定されたオープナーと呼ばれるエンティティは、取引の履歴を開き、その時の人物を指し示すことができる。</p>



<p>ネットワーク上のすべてのビジネスエンティティは、ホスティング組織でのビジネスアカウントの作成と維持の一環として審査されており、匿名のままでいることはできません。彼らには説明責任があります。その結果、消費者は安心して取引を行うことができ、依拠当事者にとってはビジネスの拡大につながります。すべての善良なアクターが利益を得ることができるのです。</p>



<p>この効果はグローバルなものです。マーチャントは、一度登録して契約するだけで、世界中のネットワーク参加者にアクセスできるようになります。</p>



<p>個人は、エコシステム内のすべての依拠当事者が存在し、説明責任を果たしているという安心感を持ってアクセスすることができます。確かに悪質な業者はまだ存在するでしょうが、その範囲はより限定されたものになります。エコシステムは、現在のインターネットよりもはるかに安全になります。参加者がアクションを起こすのに十分なものになるでしょう。信頼が再び確立されます。</p>



<p>完璧なプロセスはありません。GAINにおいても、悪質な行為者は確実に存在しますが、それは標準ではなく例外となるため、問題ははるかに扱いやすくなります。行動を起こすには「十分」でしょう。</p>



<p>つまり、信頼が再確立されたのです。</p>

<p>You can see the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/releases/tag/0.2.0">release notes for 0.2.0 here</a>, but as I've done <a href="https://simonwillison.net/series/datasette-release-notes/">with Datasette in the past</a> I've decided to present an annotated version of those release notes providing further background on each of the new features.</p>
 The plugin directory 
<blockquote>
<p>A new plugin directory for installing new plugins and upgrading or uninstalling existing ones. Open it using the "Plugins -&gt; Install and Manage Plugins..." menu item. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues/74">#74</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>This was the main focus for the release. <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins">Plugins</a> are a key component of both Datasette and Datasette Desktop: my goal is for Datasette to provide a robust core for exploring databases, with a wide array of plugins that support any additional kind of visualization, exploration or data manipulation capability that a user might want.</p>
<p>Datasette Desktop goes as far as bundling <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Sep/8/datasette-desktop/#how-the-app-works">an entire standalone Python installation</a> just to ensure that plugins will work correctly, and invisibly sets up a dedicated Python virtual environment for plugins to install into when you first run the application.</p>
<p>The first version of the app allowed users to install plugins by pasting their name into a text input field. Version 0.2.0 is a whole lot more sophisticated: the single input field has been replaced by a full plugin directory interface that shows installed v.s. available plugins and provides "Install", "Upgrade" and "Uninstall" buttons depending on the state of the plugin.</p>
<p>When I set out to build this I knew I wanted to hit <a href="https://datasette.io/content/plugins.json?_shape=array">this JSON API</a> on <a href="https://datasette.io/">datasette.io</a> to fetch the list of plugins, and I knew I wanted a simple searchable index page. The I realized I also wanted faceted search, so I could filter for installed vs not-yet-installed plugins.</p>
<p>Datasette's built-in table interface already implements faceted search! So I decided to use that, with <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app-support/tree/0.11.5/datasette_app_support/templates">some custom templates</a> to add the install buttons and display the plugins in a more suitable format.</p>
<p>The first challenge was getting the latest list of plugins into my Datasette instance. I built this into the <code>datasette-app-support</code> plugin using the <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#startup-datasette">startup() plugin hook</a> - every time the server starts up it hits that API and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app-support/blob/ee8a05ba1dd55734d2b99c9bd774ebb8e9790d7c/datasette_app_support/__init__.py#L17-L62">populates an in-memory table</a> with the returned data.</p>
<p>The data from the API is then extended with four extra columns:</p>
 
 
<code>"installed"</code> is set to "installed" or "not installed" depending on whether the plugin has already been installed by the user 
 
<code>"Installed_version"</code> is the currently installed version of the plugin 
 
<code>"upgrade"</code> is the string "upgrade available" or None - allowing the user to filter for just plugins that can be upgraded 
 
<code>"default"</code> is set to 1 if the plugin is a default plugin that came with Datasette 
 
<p>The data needed to build the plugin table is gathered by these three lines of code:</p>
 plugins = httpx.get(
     "https://datasette.io/content/plugins.json?_shape=array"
).json()
# Annotate with list of installed plugins
installed_plugins = {
    plugin["name"]: plugin["version"]
    for plugin in (await datasette.client.get("/-/plugins.json")).json()
}
default_plugins = (os.environ.get("DATASETTE_DEFAULT_PLUGINS") or "").split() 
<p>The first line fetches the full list of known plugins from the Datasette <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins">plugin directory</a></p>
<p>The second makes an internal API call to the Datasette <code>/-/plugins.json</code> endpoint using the <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html#datasette-client">datasette.client mechanism</a> to discover what plugins are currently installed and their versions.</p>
<p>The third line loads a space-separated list of default plugins from the <code>DATASETTE_DEFAULT_PLUGINS</code> environment variable.</p>
<p>That last one deserves further explanation. Datasette Desktop now ships with some default plugins, and the point of truth for what those are <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/blob/0.2.0/main.js#L34-L42">lives in the Electron app codebase</a> - because that's where the code responsible for installing them is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Five plugins are now installed by default: <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-vega">datasette-vega</a>, <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-cluster-map">datasette-cluster-map</a>, <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-pretty-json">datasette-pretty-json</a>, <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-edit-schema">datasette-edit-schema</a> and <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-configure-fts">datasette-configure-fts</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues/81">#81</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The plugin directory needs to know what these defaults are so it can avoid showing the "uninstall" button for those plugins. Uninstalling them currently makes no sense because Datasette Desktop installs any missing dependencies when the app starts, which would instantly undo the user's uninstall action decision.</p>
<p>An environment variable felt like the most straight-forward way to expose that list of default plugins to the underlying Datasette server!</p>
<p>I plan to make default plugins uninstallable in the future but doing so require a mechanism for persisting user preference state which I haven't built yet (see <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues/101">issue #101</a>).</p>
 A log on the loading screen 
<blockquote>
<p>The application loading screen now shows a log of what is going on. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues/70">#70</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first time you launch the Datasette Desktop application it creates a virtual environment and installs <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette">datasette</a>, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app-support">datasette-app-support</a> and the five default plugins (plus their dependencies) into that environment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This can take quite a few seconds, during which the original app would show an indeterminate loading indicator.</p>
<p>Personally I hate loading indicators which don't show the difference between something that's working and something that's eternally hung. Since I can't estimate how long it will take, I decided to pipe the log of what the <code>pip install</code> command is doing to the loading screen itself.</p>
<p>For most users this will be meaningless, but hopefully will help communicate "I'm installing extra stuff that I need". Advanced users may find this useful though, especially for bug reporting if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>Under the hood <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/commit/e0c899e422e60b43866551fd776b86a954deb94d">I implemented this</a> using a Node.js <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter">EventEmitter</a>. I use the same trick to forward server log output to the "Debug -&gt; Show Sever Log" interface.</p>
 Example CSV files 
<blockquote>
<p>The welcome screen now invites you to try out the application by opening interesting example CSV files, taking advantage of the new "File -&gt; Open CSV from URL..." feature. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues/91">#91</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Previously Datasette Desktop wouldn't do anything at all until you opened up a CSV or SQLite database, and I have a hunch that unlike me most people don't have good examples of those to hand at all times!</p>
<p>The new welcome screen offers example CSV files that can be opened directly from the internet. I implemented this using a new API at <a href="https://datasette.io/content/example_csvs">datasette.io/content/example_csvs</a> (add <code>.json</code> for the JSON version) which is loaded by code running on that welcome page.</p>
<p>I have two examples at the moment, for <a href="https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/">the Squirrel Census</a> and the <a href="https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/animal-rescue-incidents-attended-by-lfb">London Fire Brigade's animal rescue data</a>. I'll be adding more in the future.</p>
<p>The API itself is a great example of the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jul/28/baked-data/">Baked Data architectural pattern</a> in action: the data itself is stored in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io/blob/main/example_csvs.yml">this hand-edited YAML file</a>, which is compiled to SQLite every time the site is deployed.</p>
<p>To get this feature working I added a new "Open CSV from URL" capability to the app, which is also available in the File menu. Under the hood this works by passing the provided URL to the new <code>/-/open-csv-from-url</code> API endpoint. The implementation of this <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app-support/blob/0.11.5/datasette_app_support/utils.py#L52-L88">was surprisingly fiddly</a> as I wanted to consume the CSV file using an asynchronous HTTP client - I ended up using an adaption of <a href="https://github.com/mosquito/aiofile/blob/3.5.1/README.rst#async-csv-dict-reader">some example code</a> from the <a href="https://github.com/mosquito/aiofile">aiofile</a> README.</p>
 Recently opened files and "Open with Datasette" 
<blockquote>
<p>Recently opened <code>.db</code> and <code>.csv</code> files can now be accessed from the new "File -&gt; Open Recent" menu. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/mnckapilan">Kapilan M</a>! <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues/54">#54</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the project's first external contribution! Kapilan M <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/pull/77">figured out a way</a> to hook into the macOS "recent files" mechanism from Electron, and I expanded that to cover SQLite database in addition to CSV files.</p>
<p>When a recent file is selected, Electron fires <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/app#event-open-file-macos">the "open-file" event</a>. This same event is fired when a file is opened using "Open With -&gt; Datasette" or dragged onto the application's dock.</p>
<p>This meant I needed to tell the difference between a CSV or a SQLite database file, which I do by <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/blob/0.2.0/main.js#L95-L101">checking if</a> the first 16 bytes of the file match the SQLite header of <code>SQLite format 3\0</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>.db and .csv files can now be opened in Datasette starting from the Finder using "Right Click -&gt; Open With -&gt; Datasette". <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues/40">#40</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Registering Datasette as a file handler for <code>.csv</code> and <code>.db</code> was not at all obvious. It turned out to involve adding the following to the Electron app's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/blob/0.2.0/package.json#L13-L28">package.json file</a>:</p>
    "build": {
    "appId": "io.datasette.app",
    "mac": {
      "category": "public.app-category.developer-tools",
      "extendInfo": {
        "CFBundleDocumentTypes": [
          {
            "CFBundleTypeExtensions": [
              "csv",
              "tsv",
              "db"
            ],
            "LSHandlerRank": "Alternate"
          }
        ]
      }  
 The Debug Menu 
<blockquote>
<p>A new Debug menu can be enabled using Datasette -&gt; About Datasette -&gt; Enable Debug Menu".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The debug menu existed previously in development mode, but with 0.2.0 I decided to expose it to end users. I didn't want to show it to people who weren't ready to see it, so you have to first enable it using a button on the about menu.</p>
<p>The most interesting option there is "Run Server Manually".</p>
<p>Most of the time when you are using the app there's a <code>datasette</code> Python server running under the hood, but it's entirely managed by the Node.js <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html">child_process</a> module.</p>
<p>When developing the application (or associated plugins) it can be useful to manually run that server rather than having it managed by the app, so you can see more detailed error messages or even add the <code>--pdb</code> option to drop into a debugger should something go wrong.</p>
<p>To run that server, you need the Electron app to kill its own version... and you then need to know things like what port it was running on and which environment variables it was using.</p>
<p>Here's what you see when you click the "Run Server Manually" debug option:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here's that command in full:</p>
<p><code>DATASETTE_API_TOKEN="0ebb45444ba4cbcbacdbcbb989bb0cd3aa10773c0dfce73c0115868d0cee2afa" DATASETTE_SECRET="4a8ac89d0d269c31d99059933040b4511869c12dfa699a1429ea29ee3310a850" DATASETTE_DEFAULT_PLUGINS="datasette datasette-app-support datasette-vega datasette-cluster-map datasette-pretty-json datasette-edit-schema datasette-configure-fts datasette-leaflet" /Users/simon/.datasette-app/venv/bin/datasette --port 8002 --version-note xyz-for-datasette-app --setting sql_time_limit_ms 10000 --setting max_returned_rows 2000 --setting facet_time_limit_ms 3000 --setting max_csv_mb 0</code></p>
<p>This is a simulation of the command that the app itself used to launch the server. Pasting that into a terminal will produce an exact copy of the original process - and you can add <code>--pdb</code> or other options to further customize it.</p>
 Bonus: Restoring the in-memory database on restart 
<p>This didn't make it into the formal release notes, but it's a fun bug that I fixed in this release.</p>
<p>Datasette Desktop defaults to opening CSV files in an in-memory database. You can import them into an on-disk database too, but if you just want to start exploring CSV data in Datasette I decided an in-memory database would be a better starting point.</p>
<p>There's one problem with this: installing a plugin requires a Datasette server restart, and restarting the server clears the content of that in-memory database, causing any tables created from imported CSVs to disappear. This is confusing!</p>
<p>You can follow my progress on this in issue <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues/42">#42: If you open a CSV and then install a plugin the CSV table vanishes</a>. I ended up solving it by adding code that dumps the "temporary" in-memory database to a file on disk before a server restart, restarts the server, then copies that disk backup into memory again.</p>
<p>This works using two custom API endpoints added to the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app-support">datasette-app-support</a> plugin:</p>
 
 
<code>POST /-/dump-temporary-to-file</code> with <code>{"path": "/path/to/backup.db"}</code> dumps the contents of that in-memory temporary database to the specified file. 
 
<code>POST /-/restore-temporary-from-file</code> with <code>{"path": "/path/to/backup.db"}</code> restors the content back again. 
 
<p>These APIs are called from the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/blob/0.2.0/main.js#L189-L221">startOrRestart()</a> method any time the server restarts, using a file path generated by Electron using the following:</p>
  backupPath = path.join(
  app.getPath("temp"),
  `backup-${crypto.randomBytes(8).toString("hex")}.db`
);  
<p>The file is deleted once it has been restored.</p>
<p>After much experimentation, I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app-support/blob/0.11.5/datasette_app_support/__init__.py#L270-L288">ended up using</a> the <code>db.backup(other_connection)</code> method that was added to Python's <code>sqlite3</code> module in Python 3.7. Since Datasette Desktop bundles its own copy of Python 3.9 I don't have to worry about compatibility with older versions at all.</p>
 The rest is in the milestone 
<p>If you want even more detailed notes on what into the release, each new feature is included in the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/milestone/2?closed=1">0.2.0 milestone</a>, accompanied by a detailed issue with screenshots (and even a few videos) plus links to the underlying commits.</p>

<p>This posts shows how an Angular application can be secured using Open ID Connect code flow with PKCE and <a href="https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider">node-oidc-provider</a> identity provider. This requires the correct configuration on both the client and the identity provider.</p>



<p>The node-oidc-provider clients need a configuration for the public client which uses refresh tokens. The grant_types ‘refresh_token’, ‘authorization_code’ are added as well as the offline_access scope.</p>


  clients: [ 
	{ 
		client_id: 'angularCodeRefreshTokens', 
		token_endpoint_auth_method: 'none', 
		application_type: 'web', 
		grant_types: [
			'refresh_token', 
			'authorization_code'
		], 
		response_types: ['code'],
		redirect_uris: ['https://localhost:4207'],
		scope: 'openid offline_access profile email',
		post_logout_redirect_uris: [ 'https://localhost:4207' ] 
	}
,]
  


<p>The Angular client is implemented using <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/angular-auth-oidc-client">angular-auth-oidc-client</a>. The offline_access scope is requested as well as the prompt=consent. The nonce validation after a refresh is ignored.</p>


  import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { AuthModule, LogLevel } from 'angular-auth-oidc-client';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    AuthModule.forRoot({
      config: {
        authority: 'http://localhost:3000', 
		redirectUrl: window.location.origin, 
		postLogoutRedirectUri: window.location.origin, 
		clientId: 'angularCodeRefreshTokens',

			prompt: 'consent', // login, consent 
		}, 
      },
    }),
  ],
  exports: [AuthModule],
})
export class AuthConfigModule {}
  


<p>That’s all the configuration required.</p>

Functional literacy is a requirement for system integrity.</p><p>Words carry meaning; literary abstractions of often real and digital objects, methods, processes, ideas. When a word's meaning is not accurate, or not accurate enough, language is negatively affected, and as a result, communication of integrity between people is affected. People, Individuals all, living among one another, is the only actual reality of human existence in the Universe. This structural requirement for accuracy can only translate accurately enough by using the right words. "We the people", if not structurally referring to the Individuals walking in local communities with blood running through their veins, but instead translated via legalese into a legal abstraction giving force to Government administration methods, represents a perversion of human intent.</p><p>While amendments have been offered to fix past perversions of human intent and accurate use of language, the <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2021/07/recursive-signatory.html">root error of omission</a> providing cover for the mis-translation of "We The People" in the United States of America in 2021 is not a construct of words, or literary amendments. Instead, it is a restructuring of baseline participation in the administration of human authority within a Sovereign territory. "We The People", Individuals All, give administrative integrity to the Government derived "of, by, for" our consenting authority. Our <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2012/02/what-is-sovereign-source-authority.html">Sovereign source authority</a>, represented as Individuals, by our own self-Sovereign identity is the means by which this Nation came into existence, and the only means by which it continues.</p><p>America can not be provisioned from a database.

<p>Monday will be my first day as community lead for Steampipe, a young open source project that normalizes APIs by way of Postgres foreign data wrappers. The project’s taglines are select * from cloud and query like it’s 1992; the <a href="https://steampipe.io/">steampipe.io home page</a> nicely illustrates these ideas. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I’ve been thinking about API normalization for a long time. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html">original proposal</a> for the World Wide Web says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Databases</p>
<p>A generic tool could perhaps be made to allow any database which uses a commercial DBMS to be displayed as a hypertext view.
</p></blockquote>
<p>We ended up with standard ways for talking to databases — ODBC, JDBC — but not for expressing them on the web. </p>
<p>When I was at Microsoft I was bullish on <a href="https://www.odata.org/">OData</a>, an outgrowth of Pablo Castro’s wonderful <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2007/07/03/a-conversation-with-pablo-castro-about-astorias-restful-data-services/">Project Astoria</a>. Part of the promise was that every database-backed website could automatically offer basic API access that wouldn’t require API wrappers for everybody’s favorite programming language. The API was hypertext; a person could navigate it using links and search. Programs wrapped around that API could be useful, but meaningful interaction with data would be possible without them. </p>
<p>(For a great example of what that can feel like, jump into the middle of one of Simon Willison’s datasettes, for example <a href="https://san-francisco.datasettes.com/food-trucks/Mobile_Food_Facility_Permit?Applicant=1">san-francisco.datasettes.com</a>, and start clicking clicking around.)</p>
<p>Back then I wrote a couple of posts on this topic[<a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2009/11/18/odata-is-grease-to-cut-data-friction/">1</a>, <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2010/01/29/odata-for-collaborative-sense-making/">2</a>]. Many years later OData still hasn’t taken the world by storm. I still think it’s a great idea and would love to see it, or something like it, catch on more broadly. Meanwhile Steampipe takes a different approach. Given a proliferation of APIs and programming aids for them, let’s help by providing a unifying abstraction: SQL.</p>
<p>I’ve done a deep dive into the SQL world over the past few years. The <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/21/a-virtuous-cycle-for-analytics/">first post</a> in a series I’ve been writing on my adventures with Postgres is what connected me to Steampipe and its sponsor (my new employer) <a href="https://turbot.com/">Turbot</a>. When you install Steampipe it brings Postgres along for the ride. Imagine what you could do with data flowing into Postgres from many different APIs and filling up tables you can view, query, join, and expose to tools and systems that talk to Postgres. Well, it’s going to be my job to help imagine, and explain, what’s possible in that scenario. </p>
<p>Meanwhile I need to give some thought to my Twitter tag line: patron saint of trailing edge technologies. It’s funny and it’s true. At BYTE I explored how software based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_News_Transfer_Protocol">Net News Transfer Protocol</a> enabled my team to <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-internet-groupware/1565925378">do things</a> that we use Slack for today. At Microsoft I built a system for <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/elmcity-project-faq/">community-scale calendaring</a> based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">iCalendar</a>. When I picked up NNTP and iCalendar they were already on the trailing edge.  Yet they were, and especially in the case of iCalendar still are, capable of doing much more than is commonly understood. </p>
<p>Then of course came web annotation. Although Hypothesis recently shepherded it to <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/blog/annotation-is-now-a-web-standard/">W3C standardization</a> it goes all the way back to the <a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q2/0416.html">Mosaic browser</a> and is exactly the kind of generative tech that fires my imagination. With Hypothesis now well established in education, I hope others will continue to explore the breadth of what’s possible when every document workflow that needs to can readily connect people, activities, and data to selections in documents. If that’s of interest, here are some <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/09/03/notes-for-an-annotation-sdk/">signposts</a> pointing to scenarios I’ve envisioned and prototyped.</p>
<p>And now it’s SQL. For a long time I set it aside in favor of object, XML, and NoSQL stores. Coming back to it, by way of Postgres, has shown me that:</p>
<p>– Modern SQL is more valuable as a programming language than is commonly understood</p>
<p>– So is Postgres as a programming environment</p>
<p>The tagline query like it’s 1992 seems very on-brand for me. But maybe I should let go of the trailing-edge moniker. Nostalgia isn’t the best way to motivate fresh energy. Maybe query like it’s 2022 sets a better tone? In any case I’m very much looking forward to this next phase.</p>

<p>Yeah, it’s a sequel, and sequels tend to sag. Even The&nbsp;Godfather Part 2. (But that one only sagged in the relative sense, since Part 1 was perfect.)</p>
<p>If anything bothers me about this next Matrix it’s that what had seemed an untouchable Classic is now a Franchise. Not a bad beast, the Franchise. Just different: same genus, different species.</p>

<p>Passwords are hell.</p>
<p>Worse, to make your hundreds of passwords safe as possible, they should be nearly impossible for others to discover—and for you to remember.</p>
<p>Unless you’re a wizard, this all but requires using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager">password manager</a>.†</p>
<p>Think about how hard that job is. First, it’s impossible for developers of password managers to do everything right:</p>
 
 Most of their customers and users need to have logins and passwords for hundreds of sites and services on the Web and elsewhere in the networked world 
 Every one of those sites and services has its own gauntlet of methods for registering logins and passwords, and for remembering and changing them 
 Every one of those sites and services has its own unique user interfaces, each with its own peculiarities 
 All of those UIs change, sometimes often. 
 
<p>Keeping up with that mess while also keeping personal data safe from both user error and determined bad actors, is about as tall as an order can get. And then you have to do all that work for each of the millions of customers you’ll need if you’re going to make the kind of money required to keep abreast of those problems and providing the solutions required.</p>
<p>So here’s the thing: the best we can do with passwords is the best that password managers can do. That’s your horizon right there.</p>
<p>Unless we can get past logins and passwords somehow.</p>
<p>And I don’t think we can. Not in the <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2021/08/15/beyond-the-web">client-server ecosystem that the Web has become</a>, and that industry never stopped being, since long before the Internet came along. That’s the real hell. Passwords are just a symptom.</p>
<p>We need to work around it. That’s my work now. Stay tuned <a href="http://customercommons.org">here</a>, <a href="http://projectvrm.org">here</a>, and here for more on that.</p>
 
<p>† We need to fix that Wikipedia page.</p>

  <p>I just released <a href="https://datasette.io/desktop">version 0.1.0</a> of the new Datasette macOS desktop application, the first version that end-users can easily install. I would very much appreciate your help testing it out!</p>
 Datasette Desktop 
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> is "an open source multi-tool for exploring and publishing data". It's a Python web application that lets you explore data held in SQLite databases, plus a growing <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins">ecosystem of plugins</a> for visualizing and manipulating those databases.</p>
<p>Datasette is aimed at data journalists, museum curators, archivists, local governments, scientists, researchers and anyone else who has data that they wish to explore and share with the world.</p>
<p>There's just one big catch: since it's a Python web application, those users have needed to figure out how to <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/installation.html">install and run</a> Python software in order to use it. For people who don't live and breath Python and the command-line this turns out to be a substantial barrier to entry!</p>
<p><a href="https://datasette.io/desktop">Datasette Desktop</a> is my latest attempt at addressing this problem. I've packaged up Datasette, SQLite and a full copy of Python such that users can <a href="https://datasette.io/desktop">download and uncompress a zip file</a>, drag it into their <code>/Applications</code> folder and start using Datasette, without needing to know that there's a Python web server running under the hood (or even understand what a Python web server is).</p>
<p>Please try it out, and send me feedback and suggestions <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/discussions/67">on GitHub</a>.</p>
 What the app does 
<p>This initial release has a small but useful set of features:</p>
 
 Open an existing SQLite database file and offer all of Datasette's functionality, including the ability to explore tables and to execute arbitrary SQL queries. 
 Open a CSV file and offer the Datasette table interface (<a href="https://covid-19.datasettes.com/covid/economist_excess_deaths">example here</a>). By default this uses an in-memory database that gets cleared when the app shuts down, or you can... 
 Import CSV files into tables in on-disk SQLite databases (including creating a new blank database first). 
 By default the application runs a local web server which only accepts connections from your machine... but you can change that in the "File -&gt; Access Control" menu to allow connections from anyone on your network. This includes <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> networks too, allowing you to run the application on your home computer and then access it securely from other devices such as your mobile phone anywhere in the world. 
 You can install plugins! This is the most exciting aspect of this initial release: it's already in a state where users can customize it and developers can extend it, either with <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins">Datasette's existing plugins</a> (69 and counting) or by <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/writing_plugins.html">writing new ones</a>. 
 
 How the app works 
<p>There are three components to the app:</p>
 
 A macOS wrapper application 
 Datasette itself 
 The <code>datasette-app-support</code> plugin 
 
<p>The first is the macOS application itself. This is currently written with <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a>, and bundles a full copy of Python 3.9 (based on <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone">python-build-standalone</a> by Gregory Szorc). Bundling Python is essential: the principal goal of the app is to allow people to use Datasette who aren't ready to figure out how to install their own Python environment. Having an isolated and self-contained Python is also a great way of avoiding making <a href="https://xkcd.com/1987/">XKCD 1987</a> even worse.</p>
<p>The macOS application doesn't actually include Datasette itself. Instead, on first launch it creates a new Python virtual environment (currently in <code>~/.datasette-app/venv</code>, feedback on that location welcome) and installs the other two components: <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette">Datasette</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app-support">datasette-app-support</a> plugin.</p>
<p>Having a dedicated virtual environment is what enables the "Install Plugin" menu option. When a plugin is installed the macOS application runs <code>pip install name-of-plugin</code> and then restarts the Datasette server process, causing it to load that new plugin.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app-support">datasette-app-support</a> plugin is designed exclusively to work with this application. It adds API endpoints that the Electron shell can use to trigger specific actions, such as "import from this CSV file" or "attach this SQLite database" - these are generally triggered by macOS application menu items.</p>
<p>It also adds a custom authentication mechanism. The user of the app should have special permissions: only they should be able to import a CSV file from anywhere on their computer into Datasette. But for the "network share" feature I want other users to be able to access the web application.</p>
<p>An interesting consequence of installing Datasette on first-run rather than bundling it with the application is that the user will be able to upgrade to future Datasette releases without needing to re-install the application itself.</p>
 How I built it 
<p>I've been building this application completely in public over <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Aug/30/datasette-app/">the past two weeks</a>, writing up my notes and research in GitHub issues as I went (here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/milestone/1?closed=1">the initial release milestone</a>).</p>
<p>I had to figure out a lot of stuff!</p>
<p>First, <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a>. Since almost all of the user-facing interface is provided by the existing Datasette web application, Electron was a natural fit: I needed help powering native menus and bundling everything up as an installable application, which Electron handles extremely well.</p>
<p>I also have ambitions to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues/71">get a Windows version working</a> in the future, which should share almost all of the same code.</p>
<p>Electron also has fantastic <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start">initial developer onboarding</a>. I'd love to achieve a similar level of quality for Datasette some day.</p>
<p>The single biggest challenge was figuring out how to bundle a working copy of the Datasette Python application to run inside the Electron application.</p>
<p>My initial plan (touched on <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Aug/30/datasette-app/">last week</a>) was to compile Datasette and its dependencies into a single executable using <a href="https://www.pyinstaller.org/">PyInstaller</a> or <a href="https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/">PyOxidizer</a> or <a href="https://py2app.readthedocs.io/">py2app</a>.</p>
<p>These tools strip down a Python application to the minimal required set of dependencies and then use various tricks to compress that all into a single binary. They are really clever. For many projects I imagine this would be the right way to go.</p>
<p>I had one big problem though: I wanted to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues/5">support plugin installation</a>. Datasette plugins can have their own dependencies, and could potentially use any of the code from the Python standard library. This means that a stripped-down Python isn't actually right for this project: I need a full installation, standard library and all.</p>
<p>Telling the user they had to install Python themselves was an absolute non-starter: the entire point of this project is to make Datasette available to users who are unwilling or unable to jump through those hoops.</p>
<p>Gregory Szorc built PyOxidizer, and as part of that he built <a href="https://python-build-standalone.readthedocs.io/">python-build-standalone</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This project produces self-contained, highly-portable Python distributions. These Python distributions contain a fully-usable, full-featured Python installation as well as their build artifacts (object files, libraries, etc).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like exactly what I needed! I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues/22">opened a research issue</a>, built a proof-of-concept and decided to commit to that as the approach I was going to use. Here's a TIL that describes how I'm doing this: <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/electron/python-inside-electron">Bundling Python inside an Electron app</a></p>
<p>(I find GitHub issue threads to be the ideal way of exploring these kinds of areas. Many of my repositories have a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/labels/research">research label</a> specifically to track them.)</p>
<p>The last key step was figuring out how to sign the application, so I could distribute it to other macOS users without them facing this dreaded dialog:</p>
<p></p>
<p>It turns out there are two steps to this these days: signing the code with a developer certificate, and then "notarizing" it, which involves uploading the bundle to Apple's servers, having them scan it for malicious code and attaching the resulting approval to the bundle.</p>
<p>I was expecting figuring this out to be a nightmare. It ended up not too bad: I spent two days on it, but most of the work ended up being done by <a href="https://www.electron.build/">electron-builder</a> - one of the biggest advantages of working within the Electron ecosystem is that a lot of people have put a lot of effort into these final steps.</p>
<p>I was adamant that my eventual signing and notarization solution should be automated using GitHub Actions: nothing defangs a frustrating build process more than good
automation! This made things a bit harder because all of the tutorials and documentation assumed you were working with a GUI, but I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml">got there in the end</a>. I wrote this all up as a TIL: <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/electron/sign-notarize-electron-macos">Signing and notarizing an Electron app for distribution using GitHub Actions</a> (see also <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/github-actions/attach-generated-file-to-release">Attaching a generated file to a GitHub release using Actions</a>).</p>
 What's next 
<p>I announced the release <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1435457848050257925">last night on Twitter</a> and I've already started getting feedback. This has resulted in a growing number of issues under the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-app/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ausability">usability label</a>.</p>
<p>My expectation is that most improvements made for the benefit of Datasette Desktop will benefit the regular Datasette web application too.</p>
<p>There's also a strategic component to this. I'm investing a lot of development work in Datasette, and I want that work to have the biggest impact possible. Datasette Desktop is an important new distribution channel, which also means that any time I add a new feature to Datasette or build a new plugin the desktop application should see the same benefit as the hosted web application.</p>
<p>If I'm unlucky I'll find this slows me down: every feature I build will need to include consideration as to how it affects the desktop application.</p>
<p>My intuition currently is that this trade-off will be worthwhile: I don't think ensuring desktop compatibility will be a significant burden, and the added value from getting new features almost for free through a whole separate distribution channel should hopefully be huge!</p>

  <p>Summary:      Fluid multi-pseudonymity perfectly describes the way we live our lives and the reality that identity systems must realize if we are to live authentically in the digital sphere.</p>



<p>
    In response to my recent post on <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/08/ephemeral_relationships.shtml">Ephemeral Relationships</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sotirov">Emil Sotirov</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/sotirov/status/1431785788673511425">tweeted</a> that this was an example of "fluid multi-pseudonymity as the norm." I love that phrase because it succinctly describes something I've been trying to explain for years. 
</p>

<p>
    Emil was riffing on this article in Aeon <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/the-self-is-not-singular-but-a-fluid-network-of-identities">You are a network</a> that says "Selves are not only 'networked', that is, in social networks, but are themselves networks." I've never been a fan of philosophical introspections in digital identity discussions. I just don't think they often lead to useful insights. Rather, I like what Joe Andrieu <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/functional-identity-primer.md">calls functional identity</a>: Identity is how we recognize, remember, and ultimately respond to specific people and things. But this insight, that we are multiple selves, changing over time—even in the course of a day—is powerful. And as Emil points out, our real-life ephemeral relationships are an example of this fluid multi-pseudonymity. 
</p>

<p>
    The <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml#administrative">architectures of traditional, administrative identity systems</a> do not reflect the fluid multi-pseudonymity of real life and consequently are mismatched to how people actually live. I frequently see calls for someone, usually a government, to solve the online identity problem by issuing everyone a permanent "identity." I put that in quotes because I hate when we use the word "identity" in that way—as if everyone has just one and once we link every body (literally) to some government issued identifier and a small number of attributes all our problems will disappear.
</p>

<p>
    These calls don't often come from within the identity community. Identity professionals understand how hard this problem is and that there's no single identity for anyone. But even identity professionals use the word "identity" when they mean "account." I frequently make an ass of myself my pointing that out. I get invited to fewer meetings that way. The point is this: there is no "identity." And we don't build identity systems to manage identities (whatever those are), but, rather, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">relationships</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    All of us, in real life and online, have multiple <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">relationships</a>. Many of those are pseudonymous. Many are ephemeral. But even a relationship that starts pseudonymous and ephemeral can develop into something permanent and better defined over time. Any relationship we have, even those with online services, changes over time. In short, our relationships are fluid and each is different.
</p>

<p>
    Self-sovereign identity excites me because, for the first time, we have a model for online identity that can flexibly support fluid multi-pseudonymity. Decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials form an identity metasystem capable of being the foundation for any kind of relationship: ephemeral, pseudonymous, ad hoc, permanent, personal, commercial, legal, or anything else. For details on how this all works, see my <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2021.626726/full">Frontiers article on the identity metasystem</a>.
</p>

<p>
    An identity metasystem that matches the fluid multi-pseudonymity inherent in how people actually live is vital for personal autonomy and ultimately human rights. Computers are coming to intermediate every aspect of our lives. Our autonomy and freedom as humans depend on how we architect this digital world. Unless we put digital systems under the control of the individuals they serve without intervening administrative authorities and make them as flexible as our real-lives demand, the internet will undermine the quality of life it is meant to bolster. The identity metasystem is the foundation for doing that.

<p>R0ml Lefkowitz’s <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/21/postgres-functional-style/">The Image of Postgres</a> evokes the Smalltalk experience: reach deeply into a running system, make small changes, see immediate results. There isn’t yet a fullblown IDE for the style of Postgres-based development I describe in this series, though I can envision a VSCode extension that would provide one. But there is certainly a REPL (read-eval-print loop), it’s called psql, and it delivers the kind of immediacy that all REPLs do. In our case there’s also Metabase; it offers a complementary REPL that enhances its power as a <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/09/05/metabase-as-a-lightweight-app-server/">lightweight app server</a>. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/repl/introduction">Clojure docs</a> it says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The Clojure REPL gives the programmer an interactive development experience. When developing new functionality, it enables her to build programs first by performing small tasks manually, as if she were the computer, then gradually make them more and more automated, until the desired functionality is fully programmed. When debugging, the REPL makes the execution of her programs feel tangible: it enables the programmer to rapidly reproduce the problem, observe its symptoms closely, then improvise experiments to rapidly narrow down the cause of the bug and iterate towards a fix.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I feel the same way about the Python REPL, the browser’s REPL, the Metabase REPL, and now also the Postgres REPL. Every function and every materialized view in the analytics system begins as a snippet of code pasted into the psql console (or Metabase). Iteration yields successive results instantly, and those results reflect live data. In <a href="https://blog.bracha.org/exemplarDemo/exemplar2021.html">How is a Programmer Like a Pathologist</a> Gilad Bracha wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
A live program is dynamic; it changes over time; it is animated. A program is alive when it’s running. When you work on a program in a text editor, it is dead.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Tudor Girba amplified the point in a tweet. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In a database-backed system there’s no more direct way to interact with live data than to do so in the database. The Postgres REPL is, of course, a very sharp tool. Here are some ways to handle it carefully.</p>
 Find the right balance for tracking incremental change 
<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/26/working-in-a-hybrid-metabase-postgres-code-base/">Working in a hybrid Metabase / Postgres code base</a> I described how version-controlled files — for Postgres functions and views, and for Metabase questions — repose in GitHub and drive a concordance of docs. I sometimes write code snippets directly in psql or Metabase, but mainly compose in a “repository” (telling word!) where those snippets are “dead” artifacts in a text editor. They come to life when pasted into psql.</p>
<p>A knock on Smalltalk was that it didn’t play nicely with version control. If you focus on the REPL aspect, you could say the same of Python or JavaScript. In any such case there’s a balance to be struck between iterating at the speed of thought and tracking incremental change. Working solo I’ve been inclined toward a fairly granular commit history. In a team context I’d want to leave a chunkier history but still record the ongoing narrative somewhere.</p>
 Make it easy to understand the scope and effects of changes 
<p>The doc concordance has been the main way I visualize interdependent Postgres functions, Postgres views, and Metabase questions. In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/28/working-with-interdependent-postgres-functions-and-materialized-views/">Working with interdependent Postgres functions and materialized views</a> I mentioned Laurenz Albe’s <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/tracking-view-dependencies-in-postgresql/">Tracking View Dependencies in Postgres</a>. I’ve adapted the view dependency tracker he develops there, and adapted related work from others to track function dependencies. </p>
<p>This tooling is still a work in progress, though. The concordance doesn’t yet include Postgres types, for example, nor the tables that are upstream from materialized views. My hypothetical VSCode extension would know about all the artifacts and react immediately when things change.</p>
 Make it easy to find and discard unwanted artifacts 
<p>Given a function or view named foo, I’ll often write and test a foo2 before transplanting changes back into foo. Because foo may often depend on bar and call baz I wind up also with bar2 and baz2. These artifacts hang around in Postgres until you delete them, which I try to do as I go along. </p>
<p>If foo2 is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">memoized</a> function (see <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/19/postgres-set-returning-functions-that-self-memoize-as-materialized-views/">this episode</a>), it can be necessary to delete the set of views that it’s going to recreate. I find these with a query.</p>
 select 
  'drop materialized view ' || matviewname || ';' as drop_stmt
from pg_matviews 
where matviewname ~* {{ pattern }}
 
<p>That pattern might be question_and_answer_summary_for_group to find all views based on that function, or _6djxg2yk to find all views for a group, or even [^_]{8,8}$ to find all views made by memoized functions. </p>
<p>I haven’t yet automated the discovery or removal of stale artifacts and references to them. That’s another nice-to-have for the hypothetical IDE. </p>
 The Image of Postgres 
<p>I’ll give R0ml the last word on this topic.</p>
<blockquote><p>
This is the BYTE magazine cover from August of 1981. In the 70s and the 80s, programming languages had this sort of unique perspective that’s completely lost to history. The way it worked: a programming environment was a virtual machine image, it was a complete copy of your entire virtual machine memory and that was called the image. And then you loaded that up and it had all your functions and your data in it, and then you ran that for a while until you were sort of done and then you saved it out. And this wasn’t just Smalltalk, Lisp worked that way, APL worked that way, it was kind of like Docker only it wasn’t a separate thing because everything worked that way and so you didn’t worry very much about persistence because it was implied. If you had a programming environment it saved everything that you were doing in the programming environment, you didn’t have to separate that part out. A programming environment was a place where you kept all your data and business logic forever.</p>
<p>So then Postgres is kind of like Smalltalk only different.</p>
<p>What’s the difference? Well we took the UI out of Smalltalk and put it in the browser. The rest of it is the same, so really Postgres is an application delivery platform, just like we had back in the 80s.

<p>This article shows how to implement authorization in an ASP.NET Core application which uses Azure security groups for the user definitions and Azure B2C to authenticate. Microsoft Graph API is used to access the Azure group definitions for the signed in user. The client credentials flow is used to authorize the Graph API client with an application scope definition. This is not optimal, the delegated user flows would be better. By allowing applications rights for the defined scopes using Graph API, you are implicitly making the application an administrator of the tenant as well for the defined scopes.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/azureb2c-fed-azuread">https://github.com/damienbod/azureb2c-fed-azuread</a> </p>



<p>Two Azure AD security groups were created to demonstrate this feature with Azure B2C authentication. The users were added to the admin group and the user group as required. The ASP.NET Core application uses an ASP.NET Core Razor page which should only be used by admin users, i.e. people in the group. To validate this in the application, Microsoft Graph API is used to get groups for the signed in user and an ASP.NET Core handler, requirement and policy uses the group claim created from the Azure group to force the authorization.</p>



<p>The groups are defined in the same tenant as the Azure B2C. </p>







<p>A separate Azure App registration is used to define the application Graph API scopes. The User.Read.All application scope is used. In the demo, a client secret is used, but a certificate can also be used to access the API.</p>







<p>The Microsoft.Graph Nuget package is used as a client for Graph API.</p>


  &lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Graph" Version="4.4.0" /&gt;
  


<p>The GraphApiClientService class implements the Microsoft Graph API client. A ClientSecretCredential instance is used as the AuthProvider and the definitions for the client are read from the application configurations and the user secrets in development, or Azure Key Vault. The user-id from the name identifier claim is used to get the Azure groups for the signed-in user. The claim namespaces gets added using the Microsoft client, this can be deactivated if required. I usually use the default claim names but as the is an Azure IDP, I left the Microsoft defaults which adds the extra stuff to the claims. The Graph API GetMemberGroups method returns the group IDs for the signed in identity.</p>


  using Azure.Identity;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Graph;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace AzureB2CUI.Services
{
    public class GraphApiClientService
    {
        private readonly GraphServiceClient _graphServiceClient;

        public GraphApiClientService(IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            string[] scopes = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("GraphApi:Scopes")?.Split(' ');
            var tenantId = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("GraphApi:TenantId");

            // Values from app registration
            var clientId = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("GraphApi:ClientId");
            var clientSecret = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("GraphApi:ClientSecret");

            var options = new TokenCredentialOptions
            {
                AuthorityHost = AzureAuthorityHosts.AzurePublicCloud
            };

            // https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.identity.clientsecretcredential
            var clientSecretCredential = new ClientSecretCredential(
                tenantId, clientId, clientSecret, options);

            _graphServiceClient = new GraphServiceClient(clientSecretCredential, scopes);
        }

        public async Task&lt;IDirectoryObjectGetMemberGroupsCollectionPage&gt; GetGraphApiUserMemberGroups(string userId)
        {
            var securityEnabledOnly = true;

            return await _graphServiceClient.Users[userId]
                .GetMemberGroups(securityEnabledOnly)
                .Request().PostAsync()
                .ConfigureAwait(false);
        }
    }
}


  


<p>The .default scope is used to access the Graph API using the client credential client. </p>


  "GraphApi": {
    "TenantId": "f611d805-cf72-446f-9a7f-68f2746e4724",
    "ClientId": "1d171c13-236d-4c2b-ac10-0325be2cbc74",
    "Scopes": ".default"
    //"ClientSecret": "--in-user-settings--"
},
  


<p>The user and the application are authenticated using Azure B2C and an Azure App registration. Using Azure B2C, only a certain set of claims can be returned which cannot be adapted easily. Once signed-in, we want to include the Azure security group claims in the claims principal. To do this, the Graph API is used to find the claims for the user and add the claims to the claims principal using the IClaimsTransformation implementation. This is where the GraphApiClientService is used.</p>


  using AzureB2CUI.Services;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;
using System.Linq;
using System.Security.Claims;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace AzureB2CUI
{
    public class GraphApiClaimsTransformation : IClaimsTransformation
    {
        private GraphApiClientService _graphApiClientService;

        public GraphApiClaimsTransformation(GraphApiClientService graphApiClientService)
        {

            _graphApiClientService = graphApiClientService;
        }

        public async Task&lt;ClaimsPrincipal&gt; TransformAsync(ClaimsPrincipal principal)
        {
            ClaimsIdentity claimsIdentity = new ClaimsIdentity();
            var groupClaimType = "group";
            if (!principal.HasClaim(claim =&gt; claim.Type == groupClaimType))
            {
                var nameidentifierClaimType = "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier";
                var nameidentifier = principal.Claims.FirstOrDefault(t =&gt; t.Type == nameidentifierClaimType);

                var groupIds = await _graphApiClientService.GetGraphApiUserMemberGroups(nameidentifier.Value);

                foreach (var groupId in groupIds.ToList())
                {
                    claimsIdentity.AddClaim(new Claim(groupClaimType, groupId));
                }
            }

            principal.AddIdentity(claimsIdentity);
            return principal;
        }
  


<p>The startup class adds the services and the authorization definitions for the ASP.NET Core Razor page application. The IsAdminHandlerUsingAzureGroups authorization handler is added and this is used to validate the Azure security group claim.</p>


  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	services.AddTransient&lt;AdminApiService&gt;();
	services.AddTransient&lt;UserApiService&gt;();
	services.AddScoped&lt;GraphApiClientService&gt;();
	services.AddTransient&lt;IClaimsTransformation, GraphApiClaimsTransformation&gt;();
	services.AddHttpClient();

	services.AddOptions();

	string[] initialScopes = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;(
		"UserApiOne:ScopeForAccessToken")?.Split(' ');

	services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(Configuration, "AzureAdB2C")
		.EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(initialScopes)
		.AddInMemoryTokenCaches();

	services.AddRazorPages().AddMvcOptions(options =&gt;
	{
		var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
			.RequireAuthenticatedUser()
			.Build();
		options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
	}).AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();

	services.AddSingleton&lt;IAuthorizationHandler, IsAdminHandlerUsingAzureGroups&gt;();

	services.AddAuthorization(options =&gt;
	{
		options.AddPolicy("IsAdminPolicy", policy =&gt;
		{
			policy.Requirements.Add(new IsAdminRequirement());
		});
	});
}
  


<p>The IsAdminHandlerUsingAzureGroups implements the AuthorizationHandler class with the IsAdminRequirement requirement. This handler checks for the administrator group definition from the Azure tenant. </p>


  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace AzureB2CUI.Authz
{
    public class IsAdminHandlerUsingAzureGroups : AuthorizationHandler&lt;IsAdminRequirement&gt;

        public IsAdminHandlerUsingAzureGroups(IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            _adminGroupId = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureGroups:AdminGroupId");
        }
        protected override Task HandleRequirementAsync(AuthorizationHandlerContext context, IsAdminRequirement requirement)
        {
            if (context == null)
                throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(context));
            if (requirement == null)
                throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(requirement));

<p>If a user tries to call the Razor page which was created for admin users, then an Access denied is returned. Of course, in a real application, the menu for this would also be hidden if the user is not an admin and does not fulfil the policy. </p>







<p>If the user is an admin and a member of the Azure security group, the data and the Razor page can be opened and viewed.</p>







<p>By using Azure security groups, it is really easily for IT admins to add or remove users from the admin role. This can be easily managed using Powershell scripts. It is a pity that Microsoft Graph API is required to use the Azure security groups when authenticating using Azure B2C. This is much more simple to use when authenticating using Azure AD. </p>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/21/a-virtuous-cycle-for-analytics/">A virtuous cycle for analytics</a> I said this about Metabase:</p>
<blockquote><p>
It’s all nicely RESTful. Interactive elements that can parameterize queries, like search boxes and date pickers, map to URLs. Queries can emit URLs in order to compose themselves with other queries. I came to see this system as a kind of lightweight application server in which to incubate an analytics capability that could later be expressed more richly.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s explore that idea in more detail. Consider this query that finds groups created in the last week.</p>
 with group_create_days as (
  select
     to_char(created, 'YYYY-MM-DD') as day
  from "group"
  where created &gt; now() - interval '1 week'
)
select 
  day,
  count(*)
from group_create_days
group by day 
order by day desc 
 
<p>A Metabase user can edit the query and change the interval to, say, 1 month, but there’s a nicer way to enable that. Terms in double squigglies are Metabase variables. When you type {{interval}} in the query editor, the Variables pane appears. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Here I’m defining the variable’s type as text and providing the default value 1 week. The query sent to Postgres will be the same as above. Note that this won’t work if you omit ::interval. Postgres complains: “ERROR: operator does not exist: timestamp with time zone – character varying.” That’s because Metabase doesn’t support variables of type interval as required for date subtraction. But if you cast the variable to type interval it’ll work.</p>
<p>That’s an improvement. A user of this Metabase question can now type 2 months or 1 year to vary the interval. But while Postgres’ interval syntax is fairly intuitive, this approach still requires people to make an intuitive leap. So here’s a version that eliminates the guessing. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The variable type is now Field Filter; the filtered field is the created column of the group table; the widget type is Relative Date; the default is Last Month. Choosing other intervals is now a point-and-click operation. It’s less flexible — 3 weeks is no longer an option — but friendlier.</p>
<p>Metabase commendably provides URLs that capture these choices. The default in this case is METABASE_SERVER/question/1060?interval=lastmonth. For the Last Year option it becomes interval=lastyear. </p>
<p>Because all Metabase questions that use variables work this way, the notion of Metabase as rudimentary app server expands to sets of interlinked questions. In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/26/working-in-a-hybrid-metabase-postgres-code-base/">Working in a hybrid Metabase / Postgres code base</a> I showed the following example.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A Metabase question, #600, runs a query that selects columns from the view top_20_annotated_domains_last_week. It interpolates one of those columns, domain, into an URL that invokes Metabase question #985 and passes the domain as a parameter to that question. In the results for question #600, each row contains a link to a question that reports details about groups that annotated pages at that row’s domain.</p>
<p>This is really powerful stuff. Even without all the advanced capabilities I’ve been discussing in this series — pl/python functions, materialized views — you can do a lot more with the Metabase / Postgres combo than you might think.</p>
<p>For example, here’s a interesting idiom I’ve discovered. It’s often useful to interpolate a Metabase variable into a WHERE clause.</p>
 select * 
from dashboard_users
where email = {{ email }} 
 
<p>You can make that into a fuzzy search using the case-insensitive regex-match operator ~*.</p>
 select * 
from dashboard_users
where email ~* {{ email }}
 
<p>That’ll find a single address regardless of case; you can also find all records matching, say, ucsc.edu. But it requires the user to type some value into the input box. Ideally this query won’t require any input. If none is given, it lists all addresses in the table. If there is input it does a fuzzy match on that input. Here’s a recipe for doing that. Tell Metabase that {{ email }} a required variable, and set its default to any. Then, in the query, do this:</p>
 select * 
from dashboard_users
where email ~*
  case 
    when {{ email }} = 'any' then ''
    else {{ email}}
  end
 
<p>In the default case the matching operator binds to the empty string, so it matches everything and the query returns all rows. For any other input the operator binds to a value that drives a fuzzy search.</p>
<p>This is all very nice, you may think, but even the simplest app server can write to the database as well as read from it, and Metabase can’t. It’s ultimately just a tool that you point at a data warehouse to SELECT data for display in tables and charts. You can’t INSERT or UPDATE or ALTER or DELETE or CALL anything. </p>
<p>Well, it turns out that you can. Here’s a Metabase question that adds a user to the table.</p>
<p>select add_dashboard_user( {{email}} )</p>
<p>How can this possibly work? If add_dashboard_user were a Postgres procedure you could CALL it from psql, but in this context you can only SELECT.</p>
<p>We’ve seen the solution in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/19/postgres-set-returning-functions-that-self-memoize-as-materialized-views/">Postgres set-returning functions that self-memoize as materialized views</a>. A Postgres function written in pl/python can import and use a Python function from a plpython_helpers module. That helper function can invoke psql to CALL a procedure. So this is possible.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We’ve used Metabase for years. It provides a basic, general-purpose UX that’s deeply woven into the fabric of the company. Until recently we thought of it as a read-only system for analytics, so a lot of data management happens in spreadsheets that don’t connect to the data warehouse. It hadn’t occurred to me to leverage that same basic UX for data management too, and that’s going to be a game-changer. I always thought of Metabase as a lightweight app server. With some help from Postgres it turns out to be a more capable one than I thought.</p>

  <p>Prompted by this exchange on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Functionality attached to the context-defining data object. Instead of an “app” silo. Now here’s a thought. :-)</p>— Johannes Ernst (@Johannes_Ernst) <a href="https://twitter.com/Johannes_Ernst/status/1434044253835980803?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 4, 2021</a></blockquote> 
<p>Let me unpack this a bit. Let’s say that I’d like to send a message to
some guy, let’s call him Tom for this example.</p>
<p>The messaging app vendors go like: “Oh yes, we’ll make it super-easy for
him (Johannes) to send a message to Tom, so we give him an extra short
handle (say @tom) so he doesn’t need to type much, and also add a ‘reply’
button to previous messages so he won’t even have to type that.”</p>
<p>Which is myopic, because it completely misunderstands or ignores the context
of the user. The user doesn’t think that way, at least most of the time.</p>
<p>As a user, I think the pattern is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I need to tell (person) about (news) related to
(common context), how do I best do that (i.e. which app)?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three concepts and a sub-concept:</p>
 
 
<p>Who do I want to tell. In Joshua’s example: the person(s) I’m about to meet
with.</p>
 
 
<p>What’s the news I want to tell them. Here it is “I am running late”.</p>
 
 But this news only makes sense in the common context of “we agreed to meet
today”. If the receiver doesn’t have that context, they will receive
my message and it will be pointless and bewildering to them. 
 
 
 
<p>What’s the best way of conveying that news. It might be a text, a phone call,
or pretty much anything. This item is the least important in this entire
scenario, as long as the receiver gets the message.</p>
 
 
<p>So thre are two primary “entry” points for this scenario:</p>
 
 
<p>It starts with a person. The user thinks “Tom, I need to tell Tom that I’ll
be late”, and the frantically tries to find a way of contacting them while
hurring in the subway or driving really fast. (We have all been there.)</p>
 
 
<p>It starts with the shared context object. The user looks at the calendar and
thinks “Oh darn, this meeting, it’s now, I’ll be late, I need to tell them”.
(They might not even remember who exactly will be in the meeting, but then likely
the calender event has that info.)</p>
 
 
<p>The entry point is almost never: “how convenient, I have all people I’m about
to meet with in the current window of the messaging app, they all know what
whatever I’m going to type into that window next is about the meeting, and
I can just simply say that I’ll be late.”</p>
<p>So … if we were to put the user, and their experience, at the center of
messaging, messaging wouldn’t be an app. (Well, it might also be an app,
but mostly it wouldn’t.)</p>
<p>Instead, the messaging would be a “system service” attached to the context
objects in which I’d like to message. In Joshua’s example that is:</p>
 
 
<p>the person I’m about to meet with (but this only works if there is a
single person; if there are a dozen this does not work).</p>
 
 
<p>the shared context about which I am conveying the news: here, the
(hopefully shared) calendar event. Joshua’s original point.</p>
 
 
<p>Now in my experience, this is just an example for a more general pattern. For example:</p>
 
 
<p>meeting notes. In which meeting any meeting notes were taken is
of course supremely important. Which is why most meeting minutes start
with a title, a date/time and a list of attendees. Instead, they should be
attached to the calendar event, just like the message thread. (Yes,
including collaborative editing.)</p>
<p>And by “attached” I don’t mean: there’s a URL somewhere in the calendar
dialog form that leads to a Google Doc. No, I mean that the calendar can
show them, and insert the to-do-items from the meeting, and future meetings
from that document, and the other way around: that when you look at
the meeting notes, I can see the calendar event, and find out it is
a biweekly meeting, and the notes for the other meetings are over there.</p>
 
 
<p>projects. Software development is the worst offender, as far as I
know. If you and I and half a dozen other people work on a project to
implement functionality X, that is our primary shared context. All
communication and data creation should occur in that context. But instead
we have our code in Github, our bugs in Confluence, our APIs … test
cases … screen mockups … video calls … chats … in a gazillion
different places, and one of these days I’m sure somebody is going to
prove that half of software budgets in many places are consumed by context
switching between tools that blissfully ignore that the user thinks not
like a vendor does. (And the other half by trying to make the so-called
“integrations” between services work.)</p>
 
 
<p>There are many more examples. (In a previous life, I ran around with the
concept of “situational computing” – which takes context-aware computing
to something much more dynamic and extreme; needless to say it was decades
before its time. But now with AR/VR-stuff coming, it will probably become
part of the mainstream soon.)</p>
<p>The 100 dollar question is of course: if this is the right thing for users, why aren’t apps doing that?</p>
<p>Joshua brought up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDoc">OpenDoc</a> in a subsequent
post. Yep, there is a similarity here, and apps don’t do this kind of thing for
the same reason OpenDoc failed. (It didn’t fail because it was slow as molasses
and Steve Jobs hated it.)</p>
<p>OpenDoc failed because it would have disintermediated big and powerful
companies such as Adobe, who would have had to sell 100 little OpenDoc
components, instead of one gigantic monolith containing those 100 components
as a take-it-or-leave-it package at “enterprise” pricing. No adoption by
Adobe, Adobe feeling Apple proactively attacked their business model, it
would have killed Apple right afterwards.</p>
<p>But having OpenDoc would have sooo much better for users. We would have gotten
much more innovation, and yes, lower prices. But software vendors, like all
businesses, primarily do what is right for them, not their customers.</p>
<p>Which is why we get <a href="https://indieweb.org/silo">silos</a> everwhere we look.</p>
<p>If we wanted to change that situation, about OpenDoc-like things, or
messaging attached, in context, to things like calendar events, we have
to change the economic situation in which the important vendors find
themselves.</p>
<p>Plus of course the entire technology stack, because if all you know is
how to ship an <code>int main(argv, argc)</code> on your operating system, something
componentized and pluggable and user-centric and context-centric is never
able to emerge, even if you want to.</p>
<p>(*) The title is meant to be sarcastically, in case you weren’t sure.</p>

<p>While helping Hypothesis find its way to ed-tech it was my great privilege to explore ways of adapting annotation to other domains including bioscience, journalism, and scholarly publishing. Working across these domains showed me that annotation isn’t just an app you do or don’t adopt. It’s also a service you’d like to be available in every document workflow that connects people to selections in documents.</p>
<p>In my talk Weaving the Annotated Web I showcased four such services: <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2017/05/05/weaving-the-annotated-web/#sitc">Science in the Classroom</a>, <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2017/05/05/weaving-the-annotated-web/#digipo">The Digital Polarization Project</a>, <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2017/05/05/weaving-the-annotated-web/#scibot">SciBot</a>, and <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2017/05/05/weaving-the-annotated-web/#claimchart">ClaimChart</a>. Others include tools to <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/blog/annotation-powered-questionnaires/">evaluate credibility signals</a>, or <a href="https://misinfocon.com/lets-use-the-annotated-web-to-coordinate-the-struggle-against-fake-news-1627ff4919a3">review claims</a>, in news stories. </p>
<p>As I worked through these and other scenarios, I accreted a set of tools for enabling any annotation-aware interaction in any document-oriented workflow. I’ve wanted to package these as a coherent software development kit, that hasn’t happened yet, but here are some of the ingredients that belong in such an SDK. </p>
 Creating an annotation from a selection in a document 
<p>Two core operations lie at the heart of any annotation system: creating a note that will bind to a selection in a document, and binding (anchoring) that note to its place in the document. A tool that creates an annotation reacts to a selection in a document by forming one or more selectors that describe the selection.</p>
<p>The most important selector is TextQuoteSelector. If I visit <a href="http://www.example.com">http://www.example.com</a> and select the phrase “illustrative examples” and then use Hypothesis to annotate that selection, the payload sent from the client to the server includes this construct.</p>
 {
  "type": "TextQuoteSelector", 
  "exact": "illustrative examples", 
  "prefix": "n\n    This domain is for use in ", 
  "suffix": " in documents. You may use this\n"
}
 
<p>The Hypothesis client formerly used an NPM module, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dom-anchor-text-quote">dom-anchor-text-quote</a>, to derive that info from a selection. It no longer uses that module, and the equivalent code that it does use isn’t separately available. But annotations created using TextQuoteSelectors formed by dom-anchor-text-quote interoperate with those created using the Hypothesis client, and I don’t expect that will change since Hypothesis needs to remain backwards-compatible with itself.</p>
<p>You’ll find something like TextQuoteSelector in any annotation system. It’s formally defined by the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#text-quote-selector">here</a>. In the vast majority of cases this is all you need to describe the selection to which an annotation should anchor. </p>
<p>There are, however, cases where TextQuoteSelector won’t suffice. Consider a document that repeats the same passage three times. Given a short selection in the first of those passages, how can a system know that an annotation should anchor to that one, and not the second or third? Another selector, TextPositionSelector (<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dom-anchor-text-position">https://www.npmjs.com/package/dom-anchor-text-position</a>), enables a system to know which passage contains the selection.</p>
 {
  "type": "TextPositionSelector", 
  "start": 51
  "end": 72, 
}
 
<p>It records the start and end of the selection in the visible text of an HTML document. Here’s the HTML source of that web page.</p>
 &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Example Domain&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents. You may use this
    domain in literature without prior coordination or asking for permission.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.iana.org/domains/example"&gt;More information...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
 
<p>Here is the visible text to which the TextQuoteSelector refers.</p>
<blockquote><p>
\n\n    Example Domain\n    This domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents. You may use this\n    domain in literature without prior coordination or asking for permission.\n    More information…\n\n\n\n
</p></blockquote>
<p>The positions recorded by a TextQuoteSelector can change for a couple of reasons. If the document is altered, it’s obvious that an annotation’s start and stop numbers might change. Less obviously that can happen even if the document’s text isn’t altered. A news website, for example, may inject different kinds of advertising-related text content from one page load to the next. In that case the positions for two consecutive Hypothesis annotations made on the same selection can differ. So while TextPositionSelector can resolve ambiguity, and provide hints to an annotation system about where to look for matches, the foundation is ultimately TextQuoteSelector.</p>
<p>If you try the first example in the README at <a href="https://github.com/judell/TextQuoteAndPosition">https://github.com/judell/TextQuoteAndPosition</a>, you can form your own TextQuoteSelector and TextPositionSelector from a selection in a web page. That repo exists only as a wrapper around the set of modules — dom-anchor-text-quote, dom-anchor-text-position, and wrap-range-text — needed to create and anchor annotations.</p>
<p>Building on these ingredients, <a href="https://github.com/judell/HelloWorldAnnotated">HelloWorldAnnotated</a> illustrates a common pattern.</p>
 
  Given a selection in a page, form the selectors needed to post an annotation that targets the selection.
   Lead a user through an interaction that influences the content of that annotation.
   Post the annotation.
  
<p>Here is an example of such an interaction. It’s a content-labeling scenario in which a user rates the emotional affect of a selection. This is the kind of thing that can be done with the stock Hypothesis client, but awkwardly because users must reliably add tags like WeakNegative or StrongPositive to represent their ratings. The app prompts for those tags to ensure consistent use of them. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Although the annotation is created by a standalone app, the Hypothesis client can anchor it, display it, and even edit it. </p>
<p></p>
<p>And the Hypothesis service can search for sets of annotations that match the tags WeakNegative or StrongPositive. </p>
<p>There’s powerful synergy at work here. If your annotation scenario requires controlled tags, or a prescribed workflow, you might want to adapt the Hypothesis client to do those things. But it can be easier to create a standalone app that does exactly what you need, while producing annotations that interoperate with the Hypothesis system.</p>
 Anchoring an annotation to its place in a document 
<p>Using this same set of modules, a tool or system can retrieve an annotation from a web service and anchor it to a document in the place where it belongs. You can try the second example in the README at <a href="https://github.com/judell/TextQuoteAndPosition">https://github.com/judell/TextQuoteAndPosition</a> to see how this works.</p>
<p>For a real-world demonstration of this technique, see <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2017/05/05/weaving-the-annotated-web/#sitc">Science in the Classroom</a>. It’s a project sponsored by The American Association for the Advancement of Science. Graduate students annotate research papers selected from the Science family of journals so that younger students can learn about the terminology, methods, and outcomes of scientific research.</p>
<p>Pre-Hypothesis, annotations on these papers were displayed using Learning Lens, a viewer that color-codes them by category. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Nothing about Learning Lens changed when Hypothesis came into the picture, it just provided a better way to record the annotations. Originally that was done as it’s often done in the absence of a formal way to describe annotation targets, by passing notes like: “highlight the word ‘proximodistal’ in the first paragraph of the abstract, and attach this note to it.” This kind of thing happens a lot, and wherever it does there’s an opportunity to adopt a more rigorous approach. Nowadays at Science in the Classroom the annotators use Hypothesis to describe where notes should anchor, as well as what they should say. When an annotated page loads it searches Hypothesis for annotations that target the page, and inserts them using the same format that’s always been used to drive the Learning Lens. Tags assigned by annotators align with Learning Lens categories. The search looks only for notes from designated annotators, so nothing unwanted will appear. </p>
 An annotation-powered survey 
<p>The <a href="https://credibilitycoalition.org/">Credibility Coalition</a> is “a research community that fosters collaborative approaches to understanding the veracity, quality and credibility of online information.” We worked with them on a project to test a set of <a href="https://credweb.org/reviewed-signals-20200224/">signals</a> that bear on the credibility of news stories. Examples of such signals include: </p>
 
 Title Representativeness (Does the title of an article accurately reflect its content?)
  Sources (Does the article cite sources?)
  Acknowledgement of uncertainty (Does the author acknowledge uncertainty, or the possibility things might be otherwise?)
  
<p>Volunteers were asked these questions for each of a set of news stories. Many of the questions were yes/no or multiple choice and could have been handled by any survey tool. But some were different. What does “acknowledgement of uncertainty” look like? You know it when you see it, and you can point to examples. But how can a survey tool solicit answers that refer to selections in documents, and record their locations and contexts? </p>
<p>The answer was to create a <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/blog/annotation-powered-questionnaires/">survey tool</a> that enabled respondents to answer such questions by highlighting one or more selections. Like the HelloWorldAnnotated example above, this was a bespoke client that guided the user through a prescribed workflow. In this case, that workflow was more complex. And because it was defined in a <a href="https://github.com/judell/AnnotationPoweredSurvey/blob/master/questions.js">declarative way</a>, the same app can be used for any survey that requires people to provide answers that refer to selections in web documents.</p>
 A JavaScript wrapper for the Hypothesis API 
<p>The HelloWorldAnnotated example uses functions from a library, <a href="https://github.com/judell/hlib">hlib</a>, to post an annotation to the Hypothesis service. That library includes functions for searching and posting annotations using the Hypothesis API. It also includes support for interaction patterns common to annotation apps, most of which occur in <a href="https://github.com/judell/facet">facet</a>, a standalone tool that searches, displays, and exports sets of annotations. Supported interactions include:</p>
<p>– Authenticating with an API token</p>
<p>– Creating a picklist of groups accessible to the authenticated user</p>
<p>– Assembling and displaying conversation threads</p>
<p>– Parsing annotations</p>
<p>– Editing annotations</p>
<p>– Editing tags</p>
<p>In addition to facet, other tools based on this library include <a href="https://github.com/judell/CopyAnnotations">CopyAnnotations</a> and <a href="https://github.com/judell/TagRename">TagRename</a></p>
 A Python wrapper for the Hypothesis API 
<p>If you’re working in Python, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/hypothesis-api/">hypothesis-api</a> is an alternative API wrapper that supports searching for, posting, and parsing annotations. </p>
 Notifications 
<p>If you’re a publisher who embeds Hypothesis on your site, you can use a <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/blog/new-search-capability/">wildcard search</a> to find annotations. But it would be helpful to be notified when annotations are posted. <a href="https://github.com/judell/h_notify">h_notify</a> is a tool that uses the Hypothesis API to watch for annotations on individual or wildcard URLs, or from particular users, or in a specified group, or with a specified tag. </p>
<p>When an h_notify-based watcher finds notes in any of these ways, it can send alerts to a Slack channel, or to an email address, or add items to an RSS feed.</p>
<p>At Hypothesis we mainly rely on the Slack option. In this example, user nirgendheim highlighted the word “interacting” in a page on the Hypothesis website. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The watcher sent this notice to our #website channel in Slack. </p>
<p></p>
<p>A member of the support team (Hypothesis handle mdiroberts) saw it there and responded to nirgendheim as shown above. How did nirgendheim know that mdiroberts had responded? The core Hypothesis system sends you an email when somebody replies to one of your notes. h_notify is for bulk monitoring and alerting.</p>
<p><a></a></p>
 A tiny Hypothesis server 
<p>People sometimes ask about connecting the Hypothesis client to an alternate server in order to retain complete control over their data. It’s doable, you can follow the instructions <a href="https://h.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing/install/">here</a> to build and run your own server, and some people and organizations do that. Depending on need, though, that can entail more effort, and more moving parts, than may be warranted.</p>
<p>Suppose for example you’re part of a team of investigative journalists annotating web pages for a controversial story, or a team of analysts sharing confidential notes on web-based financial reports. The documents you’re annotating are public, but the notes you’re taking in a Hypothesis private group are so sensitive that you’d rather not keep them in the Hypothesis service. You’d ideally like to spin up a minimal server for that purpose: small, simple, and easy to manage within your own infrastructure.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://github.com/judell/MinimalHypothesisServer">proof of concept</a>. This tiny server clocks in just 145 lines of Python with very few dependencies. It uses Python’s batteries-include SQLite module for annotation storage. The web framework is Pyramid only because that’s what I’m familiar with, but could as easily be Flask, the ultra-light framework typically used for this sort of thing. </p>
<p>A <a href="https://github.com/judell/MinimalHypothesisServer/blob/main/service.py">tiny app</a> wrapped around those ingredients is all you need to receive JSON payloads from a Hypothesis client, and return JSON payloads when the client searches for annotations to anchor to a page.</p>
<p>The service is dockerized and easy to deploy. To test it I used the <a href="https://fly.io/">fly.io</a> <a href="https://fly.io/docs/speedrun/">speedrun</a> to create an instance at <a href="https://summer-feather-9970.fly.dev">https://summer-feather-9970.fly.dev</a>. Then I made the handful of small tweaks to the Hypothesis client shown in <a href="https://github.com/judell/MinimalHypothesisServer/blob/main/client-patches.txt">client-patches.txt</a>. My method for doing that, typical for quick proofs of concept that vary the Hypothesis client in some small way, goes like this:</p>
 
  Clone the Hypothesis client.
   Edit gulpfile.js to say const IS_PRODUCTION_BUILD = false. This turns off minification so it’s possible to read and debug the client code.
   Follow the instructions to <a href="https://h.readthedocs.io/projects/client/en/latest/developers/developing/#running-the-client-from-the-browser-extension">run the client from a browser extension</a>. After establishing a link between the client repo and browser-extension repo, as per those instructions, use this build command — make build SETTINGS_FILE=settings/chrome-prod.json — to create a browser extension that authenticates to the Hypothesis production service.
   In a Chromium browser (e.g. Chrome or Edge or Brave) use chrome://extensions, click Load unpacked, and point to the browser-extension/build directory where you built the extension.
  
<p>This is the easiest way to create a Hypothesis client in which to try quick experiments. There are tons of source files in the repos, but just a handful of bundles and loose files in the built extension. You can run the extension, search and poke around in those bundles, set breakpoints, make changes, and see immediate results. </p>
<p>In this case I only made the changes shown in client-patches.txt:</p>
 
  In options/index.html I added an input box to name an alternate server.
   In options/options.js I sync that value to the cloud and also to the browser’s localStorage.
   In the extension bundle I check localStorage for an alternate server and, if present, modify the API request used by the extension to show the number of notes found for a page.
   In the sidebar bundle I check localStorage for an alternate server and, if present, modify the API requests used to search for, create, update, and delete annotations.
  
<p>I don’t recommend this cowboy approach for anything real. If I actually wanted to use this tweaked client I’d create branches of the client and the browser-extension, and transfer the changes into the source files where they belong. If I wanted to share it with a close-knit team I’d zip up the extension so colleagues could unzip and sideload it. If I wanted to share more broadly I could upload the extension to the Chrome web store. I’ve done all these things, and have found that it’s feasible — without forking Hypothesis — to maintain branches that maintain small but strategic changes like this one. But when I’m aiming for a quick proof of concept, I’m happy to be a cowboy.</p>
<p>In any event, here’s the proof. With the tiny server deployed to summer-feather-9970.fly.dev, I poked that address into the tweaked client. </p>
<p></p>
<p>And sure enough, I could search for, create, reply to, update, and delete annotations using that 145-line SQLite-backed server.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The client still authenticates to Hypothesis in the usual way, and behaves normally unless you specify an alternate server. In that case, the server knows nothing about Hypothesis private groups. The client sees it as the Hypothesis public layer, but it’s really the moral equivalent of a private group. Others will see it only if they’re running the same tweaked extension and pointing to the same server. You could probably go quite far with SQLite but, of course, it’s easy to see how you’d swap it out for a more robust database like Postgres.</p>
 Signposts 
<p>I think of these examples as signposts pointing to a coherent SDK for weaving annotation into any document workflow. They show that it’s feasible to decouple and recombine the core operations: creating an annotation based on a selection in a document, and anchoring an annotation to its place in a document. Why decouple? Reasons are as diverse as the document workflows we engage in. The stock Hypothesis system beautifully supports a wide range of scenarios. Sometimes it’s helpful to replace or augment Hypothesis with a custom app that provides a guided experience for annotators and/or an alternative display for readers. The annotation SDK I envision will make it straightforward for developers to build solutions that leverage the full spectrum of possibility.</p>

This article focuses on why our experience of “prevention or correction” ideas frames the CDO’s responsibilities and explores a linkage to a company’s approach to data.</p><p></p> <br>Almost irrespective of where you reside, we live with police, penal, and political systems that cannot fully agree on preventing or correcting.  It is not that we disagree with the “why”; is it the “how” that divides us! I am a child of an age when lefthandedness was still seen as something to correct, so we have made some progress.   <br>A fundamental issue is that prevention is the best thinking; but if you prevent it, it does not occur.  We are then left with the dilemma, “did you prevent it, or was it not going to occur anyway?” The finance team now ask, “Have we wasted resources on something that would not have happened?”<br><br>When something we don’t like does occur, we jump into action as we can correct it.  We prioritise, allocate resources and measure them.  We (humanity) appear to prefer a problem we can solve (touch, feel, see) and can measure rather than prevent.  A proportion of crime is driven by the poor economic situation of a population with no choice. Yet, we keep that same population in the same economic conditions as we have limited resources committed to correction (control.) It is way more messy and complex, and we need both, but prevention is not an easy route.  Just think about our current global pandemic, climate change or sustainability.  Prevention was a possibility in each case, but we kick into action now correction is needed. <br><br>In our new digital and data world, we are facing the same issues of prevention vs correction.  Should we prevent data issues or correct data issues, and who owns the problem?  <br><br>In the data industry right now, we correct and just like the criminal services, we have allocated all our budget to correction, so we don’t have time or resources for prevention. I would be rich if I had a dollar for every time I hear, “We need results, Fish, not an x*x*x*x data philosophy.” <br><br>For anyone who follows my views and beliefs, I advocate data quality founded on lineage and provenance (prevention). I am not a fan of the massive industry that has been built up to correct data (correction). I see it as a waste on many levels, but <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#">FUD</a> sells to a naive buyer. I am a supporter of having a presence at the source of data to <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#">guarantee attestation</a> and assign rights.  I cannot get my head around the massive budgets set aside to correct “wrong” data.  We believe that data quality is knowing the data is wrong and thinking we can correct it!  We have no idea if the correction is correct, and the updated data still lacks attestation.  We measure this madness and assign KPI to improve our corrective powers.  In this case, because it is data and not humans, prevention is the prefered solution as neither a cure nor correction work at any economic level that can be justified other than your a provider of the service or one of the capital providers. But as already mentioned, prevention is too hard to justify. The same analogy is a recurring theme in the buy (outsource) vs build debate for the new platform, but that is another post.  <br> Unpacking to expose and explore some motivations.  We know that the CDO job emerged in 2002, and some 20 years on, it is still in its infancy.  Tenures are still short (less than three years), and there is a lack of skills and experience because this data and digital thing are all new compared to marketing, finance, or accounting.  As I have written before, our <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#">job descriptions for the CDO remain poorly defined</a>, with mandates too broad and allocated resources too limited.  All many articles at <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#">&lt;/Hello CDO&gt;</a> I focus on the conflicts CDO’s have because of the mandates we are given.<br><br>Whilst mandates are too broad, thankfully, security and privacy are becoming new roles with their own mandates. The CDO is still being allocated a data transformation mandate but being asked to correct the data whilst doing it.   Not surprisingly, most data projects fail as the board remains fixated that the data we have is of value, and we should allocate all our resources correcting and securing it.   A bit like the house built on sand,  we endlessly commit resources to unpin a house without foundations because it is there, rather than moving to the more secure ground and building the right house.   Prevention or correction?   <br><br>All CDO’s face the classic problem of being asked to solve the world’s debt famine crisis with no budget, no resources and yesterday would be good.  Solve the data quality problem by correcting the waste at the end.  Because of this commitment to correct data, we find we are trapped.  “We should just finish the job as we have gone so far,”  is what the finance team says,  “prevention is like starting all over again”; it will be too expensive, wreck budgets and we will miss our bonus hurdle as it means a total re-start.  The budget is too big so let’s just put in some more foundations into the house built on sand.<br><br>It is one of my favourite saying “the reason it is called a shortcut, it because it is a short cut and it misses something out”  I often use it when we boil a decision down to an <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#">ROI number</a>, believing that all the information needed can be presented in a simple single dimensional number.  The correction ideals will always win when we use shortcuts, especially ROI.<br><br> Prevention is a hard sell.  Correction is a simple sell.   Who benefits from an endless correction policy? Probably the CDO!  We get to look super busy, it is easy to get the commitment, and no one will argue at the board/ senior leadership team to do anything else. It might take three years to see the transformation has not happened, and there is plenty of demand for CDO’s? Why would a CDO want to support prevention? Why is the CDO role so in question?<br><br>Prevention takes time, is complex, and you may not see results during your tenure. I often reflect on what <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#">will be my CDO legacy</a>?  Correction is instant, looks busy and gets results that you can be measured on.   Correction means there is always work to be done.  Prevention means you will eventually be out of a job.  Since prevention cannot be measured and is hard to justify with an ROI calculation,  maybe the CEO needs to focus on measuring the success of analytics?<br> Note to the CEO Data is complex, and like all expert discipline areas, you will seek advice, opinion and counsel from various sources to help form a balanced view.  Data quality is a thorny one as most of those around you will inform you of the benefits of correction over prevention.  Correction wins, and it is unlikely any balanced view arguing for prevention. <br><br>Perhaps it is worth looking at the CDO job description, focusing on what the KPIs are for and how you shift a focus to the outcomes of the analysis.  To improve analysis and outcomes demands better data quality, which correction can only get you so far. You get prevention by the back door.

<p>The UK&nbsp;<a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/ico-codes-of-practice/age-appropriate-design-a-code-of-practice-for-online-services/">Information Commission’s (ICO) Children’s Code</a>, officially known as the“Age Appropriate Design Code: a code of practice for online services,” after a year grace period, goes into effect Thursday, Sept. 2, 2021. The code, which falls under section 125(1)(b) of the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (the Act), looks to protect UK children, i.e., people under the age of eighteen (18).</p>
<p>Are you ready? I hope so; this code applies to any business, in and out of the UK, that provides digital services to UK children. And, it is not the only one of its kind around the world.</p>
 What You Need to Know 
<p>In the digital age, people’s digital footprint is first established months before they’re born, grows exponentially throughout their lives, and carries on after their death. Kids are especially vulnerable to being influenced by digital services; moreover, they are more likely to befall cybercrime. For instance, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/_files/pdfs/reports/2011/child-identity-theft.pdf">2011 study by Carnegie Mellon SyLab&nbsp;</a>study found that children were 51% more likely to have their security number used by someone else.</p>
 What is it for? 
<p>The code is designed to ensure that service providers of apps, programs, toys, or any other devices that collect and process children’s data “are appropriate for use by, and meet the development needs of, children.” It calls for 15 independent and interdependent legal, service design, and data processing principles and standards to be followed. Specifically, as called out in the code, these are:</p>
<p>• Best interests of the child • Data protection impact assessments • Age appropriate application• Transparency&nbsp;• Detrimental use of data • Policies and community standard • Default settings • Data minimization • Data sharing • Geolocation • Parental controls • Profiling • Nudge techniques • Connected toys and devices • Online tools</p>
 Who must comply? Risk of non-compliance 
<p>Information society services (ISS) that cater to UK children under the age of 18 or whose services are likely to be accessed by children must adhere to the code or risk ICO public assessment and enforcement notices, warnings, reprimands, and penalty notices (aka administrative fines). Serious code breaches may lead to fines of up to €20 million (or £17.5 million when the UK GDPR comes into effect) or 4% of the provider’s annual worldwide turnover, whichever is higher.</p>
 What you need to do 
<p>Ensuring the digital future and safety of children and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/elderjustice/prosecutors/statutes">venerable adults</a>&nbsp;(people over 18 who cannot meet their own needs or seek help without assistance) is a founding principal of a healthy society and for running a sustainable business. There are several recommended steps you can take to get into and maintain alignment with the code:</p>
<p>1. Consider the likelihood that a child (or vulnerable adult) might use your service,&nbsp;the liability is on the service provider to determine the likelihood a child will use their service. You should conduct user testing, surveys, market research (inc. competitive analysis), and professional and academic literature reviews.</p>
<p>2. Document your data flows (i.e. conduct a data protection impact assessment (DPIA)),&nbsp;your DPIA should consist of data and systems flow diagrams and detailed descriptions of these systems (inc. services, process, and interfaces), all the data flowing through them, and how data is handled. The flow diagram should illustrate each engagement swim lane (e.g., individual, client, company, third-party) and the direction of data flow. The supporting documentation should define each data element and clearly spell out how it will be collected, used and managed. Take it from me and my firsthand experience. The DPIA lens is an invaluable tool for strategic product development. I highly recommend that you not look at the DIPA process as a legal necessity but rather as a valuable framework for learning about and assessing how your products and services work, exactly what they do and why. Performed with the right lens, the DPIA can be a fertile ground for creative inspiration and innovation.</p>
<p>3. Make it a team sport,&nbsp;effective data management is a company-wide, multi-disciplinary activity. It is important that you ensure all key stakeholders, not just legal, IT, security, and compliance, but also marketing, user experience, customer experience, design, support, product, sales, and third-party compliance partners (experts that can help you and your team succeed) all play a role in ensuring your products and services do not just meet legal requirements but exceed people’s expectations.</p>
 But There Is More 
<p>The above steps are extremely useful; however, there are two more considerations that should not be neglected- 1) things are just getting started, and 2) people’s sentiment—“the opportunity to differentiate.”</p>
<p>First,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-09-14-gartner-says-by-2023--65--of-the-world-s-population-w">Gartner</a>&nbsp;estimates that 10% of the world’s population is currently protected under people-centric regulation, i.e. regulations like&nbsp;<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">Europe’s GDPR</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=3.&amp;part=4.&amp;lawCode=CIV&amp;title=1.81.5">California’s CPPA</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://lgpd-brazil.info/">Brazil’s LGPD</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/china-passes-data-protection-law/">China’s data production law</a>&nbsp;which takes effect Nov. 1 2021. By 2023 Gartner estimate this number will rise to 65%. Moreover, keep in mind, it will not just be omnibus rules that take effect; sectoral-specific rules will apply as well. For example, in the United States, the Federal Trade Commission is reevaluating its child protection laws (<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions-0">COPPA</a>) and the U.S. Department of Education Department will more than likely be updating the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (<a href="https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html">FERPA</a>). Moreover, there are state-specific regulations similar to the CCPA being enacted. For Instance, in July 2021, Colorado just enacted their people-centric regulations, “<a href="http://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2021A/bills/2021a_190_enr.pdf">Privacy Act of 2021</a>.”</p>
<p>Second, globally, as evidenced by the last seven years of the&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileecosystemforum.com/mefs-7th-annual-global-trust-report/">MEF Global Consumer Trust studies</a>, people are waking up to industry data practices. Simply saying they’re unhappy about them is an understatement. People are connected, they’re concerned, and they want control of their data. The problem is, they’re not exactly sure how to go about it.</p>
<p>There is more to win than just staying on the right side of the law. There is an opportunity for companies to go beyond the law, to recognize that digital privacy, the controls and flows of one’s personal data, should be treated as sacred as one’s physical privacy. Privacy should not be a luxury good obtained only by a select minority; it’s a human right. All three major societal constituents (individuals, private sector organizations, and public sector institutions) need to play their part. There is an opportunity for each to weigh in on this debate, especially public sector players who can differentiate themselves by actively and publicly providing people not just with the utility of the company’s service but with tools and education that help people proactively enact their data rights and to secure and gain agency over their digital footprint, not just now but throughout their entire life. Like global warming, if we each do our part, we can get data back under control and achieve a healthy equilibrium throughout the world’s markets.</p>

Building on the earlier works from Kim Cameron, and Christopher Allen, these principles layout what must be foundational principles around any self-sovereign identity system. The evolution of the Principles of SSI came about through the need to differentiate what is ‘true’ SSI versus marketing forces twisting the concept.  This market driven motivator can bring cultish overtones to the process.</p><p>With this event we had a bit of fun in what is otherwise 'serious' business.</p><p>A few themes that come out of the discussion:</p><p>- The position of the holder of the credential - when does the holder become the source of truth and the key to value creation?  In most current business value conversations the holder appears to incidental; the focus is on how to incent the verifiers and issuers with little regard to the position and influence of the holder.  While the SSI ‘triangle’ puts the holder at the ‘top’ of the triangle, the lack of consideration of the trust and value equation there, implies the triangle should be inverted elevating the issuers and verifiers and putting the holder on the bottom.</p><p>- When principles become a means of “locking in” a definition, they become a means of “locking out” those that do not meet the “bar”.  A concern voiced was that with this mental model, and the implication of the moral ‘righteousness’ of this position, the real commercial values of SSI are lost and those not in the ‘cult’ turn away.</p><p>The panelists are:</p>  <p>Simone Ravaioli, Director Digitary</p>  <p>Rob van Kranenberg, IoT Council and NGI Forward</p>  <p>Nicky Hickman, Chair of the ID4All WG, Sovrin Foundation</p>  <p>Michael Shea, Moderator of Vienna Digital Identity Meetup</p>  <p></p><p>To listen to a recording of the event please check out the link: <a href="https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/580329620">https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/580329620</a></p> Time markers:    <p>0:05:00  - Introduction </p>  <p>0:10:07   - Simone Ravaioli </p>  <p>0:17:09   - Nicky Hickman</p>  <p>0:25:44  - Rob van Kranenburg</p>  <p>0:35:00  - General Discussion</p>  <p>1:15:07   - Rob van Kranenburg</p>  <p>1:23:45  - Wrap up </p>   Resources <p>Slide decks:</p>  <p>Simone Ravaioli : Principles vs Cult (Simone)</p>  <p>Nicky Hickman : Principles vs Cult (Nicky)</p>  <p>Rob van Kranenburg : Slide Deck 1  Slide Deck 2</p>  <p>Blog Posts:</p>  <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/stoic-sovereign-identity-ssi-simone-ravaioli/">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/stoic-sovereign-identity-ssi-simone-ravaioli/</a></p>  <p>If interested in getting notifications of upcoming events please join the event group at: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Vienna-Digital-Identity-Meetup/">https://www.meetup.com/Vienna-Digital-Identity-Meetup/</a> </p><p>The Vienna Digital Identity Meetup is hosted by The Dingle Group and is focused on educating business, societal, legal and technologists on the new opportunities that arise with  a high assurance digital identity created by the reduction risk and strengthened provenance.

  <p>Summary:      A recent trip through SL airport's new TSA screening area shows why bureaucracies legibility fails. People aren't corporate or hierarchical. Instead they're messy... and innovative.</p>


<p>
    I just flew for the first time in 16 months. In that time, Salt Lake International Airport got a new terminal, including an update to the TSA screening area. The new screening area has been <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/news/press/releases/2020/09/22/tsa-highlights-features-security-checkpoint-new-slc">touted as a model of efficiency</a>, featuring bin stations for people to load their bags, electronics, belts, and shoes into bins that they then push onto a conveyor. The bins are handled automatically and everything is sunshine and joy. Except it isn't.
</p>

<p>
    The new system is perfect so long as the people using it are too. The first problem is that unless your at the last bin station, the conveyor in front of you is constantly full and it's hard to get your bin onto the conveyor. And if you've got more than one bin to load, they are separated from each other because the loading station isn't big enough for two. People just don't conform to the TSA's ideal!
</p>

<p>
    But the real problem is that people forget things in their pockets or don't take off their belt. In the olden days, the TSA had little bowls. You'd throw your stuff in one, put it on the belt, and be on your way. Now, there's no easy way to accommodate forgotten things except to go back to a bin loading station and put them in a big bin, clogging the conveyor even more. Three people in line ahead of me at the scanner forgot something, causing all kinds of delays. The TSA people were even telling them to just hold them in the scanner and taking them from them to hold while the scan was completed. Because there's no good way to deal with forgotten items, everyone is forced to improvise, but the system is rigid and doesn't easily accommodate improvisation. 
</p>

<p>
    The situation reminded me of the story James C. Scott tells in the opening of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0300246757/windleyofente-20">Seeing Like a State</a> where forestry officials planted neat, efficient rows of trees instead of letting the forest take its natural path. The end result was less yield from the forest, but happier foresters who could now see every tree. Scott's point is that bureaucracy aims for legibility in order to serve its own purposes—and usually fails in that effort. The primary reason states have wanted legibility of citizens is taxes (and, historically, conscription). But once you have legibility, the temptation to extend it to other uses is too great to resist. In this case, the TSA has ordered the screening process and made it legible to the screeners, but made no provision for outliers. If no one forgets anything and the system is lightly loaded, it should work great. Of course, that's not the real world.  
</p>

<p>
    IT people are bureaucrats in their own way. We build and operate the systems that people use to do their jobs and live their lives. We strive for legibility in order to make the software simpler for us, even if it doesn't serve the users quite as well. Universities are decentralized places with lots of innovative people pursuing their own goals. They are more feudal than corporate. I've often heard university IT people complain about this reality because it makes their life harder.  If you're a professor, you'd like to use whichever LMS suits your particular needs. But that's not very legible. If you're a university IT person, you'd like to force all faculty to use the standard LMS that the university chose. Neat and orderly, but it squeezes the innovation out of the university one drop at a time. 
</p>

<p>
    Life is messy. People are forgetful, disorganized, and, relatedly, innovative. Bureaucracy desperately wants legibility so that the rules are followed, the processes perform, and the bureaucrat's life is made easy. Building systems that support decentralized workflows and individual decisions, without getting in the way, is hard. And letting people be people can be frustrating when it's causing you headaches. We'll never build  systems that support an authentic, operationalized digital existence until we stop trying to fit people's decentralized lives into our neat, ordered, legible software.
</p>

<blockquote> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0300078153/windleyofente-20">Seeing like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed by James C. Scott</a> <p>In this wide-ranging and original book, James C. Scott analyzes failed cases of large-scale authoritarian plans in a variety of fields. Centrally managed social plans misfire, Scott argues, when they impose schematic visions that do violence to complex interdependencies that are not—and cannot—be fully understood. Further, the success of designs for social organization depends upon the recognition that local, practical knowledge is as important as formal, epistemic knowledge. The author builds a persuasive case against "development theory" and imperialistic state planning that disregards the values, desires, and objections of its subjects. He identifies and discusses four conditions common to all planning disasters: administrative ordering of nature and society by the state; a "high-modernist ideology" that places confidence in the ability of science to improve every aspect of human life; a willingness to use authoritarian state power to effect large- scale interventions; and a prostrate civil society that cannot effectively resist such plans.</p><p></p></blockquote>

<p>This article shows how to improve the security of an ASP.NET Core Web API application by adding security headers to all HTTP API responses. The security headers are added using the <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders">NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders</a> Nuget package from <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewlocknet">Andrew Lock</a>. The headers are used to protect the session, not for authorization. The application uses Microsoft.Identity.Web to authorize the API requests. The security headers are used to protected the session.  Swagger is used in development and the CSP needs to be weakened to allow swagger to work during development. A strict CSP definition is used for the deployed environment.</p>

<p></p>



<p>The NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders Nuget package is added to the csproj file of the web applications. The Swagger Open API packages are added as well as the Microsoft.Identity.Web to protect the API using OAuth.</p>


  &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
	&lt;PackageReference 
		Include="Microsoft.Identity.Web" Version="1.15.2" /&gt;
	&lt;PackageReference 
		Include="IdentityModel.AspNetCore" Version="3.0.0" /&gt;
	&lt;PackageReference 
		Include="NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders" Version="0.16.0" /&gt;

		Include="Swashbuckle.AspNetCore" Version="6.1.4" /&gt;
	&lt;PackageReference 
		Include="Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Annotations" Version="6.1.4" /&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
  


<p>The security header definitions are added using the HeaderPolicyCollection class. I added this to a separate class to keep the Startup class small where the middleware is added. I passed a boolean parameter into the method which is used to add or remove the HSTS header and create a CSP policy depending on the environment. </p>



<p></p>


  public static HeaderPolicyCollection GetHeaderPolicyCollection(bool isDev)
{
	var policy = new HeaderPolicyCollection()
		.AddFrameOptionsDeny()
		.AddXssProtectionBlock()
		.AddContentTypeOptionsNoSniff()
		.AddReferrerPolicyStrictOriginWhenCrossOrigin()
		.RemoveServerHeader()
		.AddCrossOriginOpenerPolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.SameOrigin();
		})
		.AddCrossOriginEmbedderPolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.RequireCorp();
		})
		.AddCrossOriginResourcePolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.SameOrigin();
		})
		.RemoveServerHeader()
		.AddPermissionsPolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.AddAccelerometer().None();
			builder.AddAutoplay().None();
			builder.AddCamera().None();
			builder.AddEncryptedMedia().None();
			builder.AddFullscreen().All();
			builder.AddGeolocation().None();
			builder.AddGyroscope().None();
			builder.AddMagnetometer().None();
			builder.AddMicrophone().None();
			builder.AddMidi().None();
			builder.AddPayment().None();
			builder.AddPictureInPicture().None();
			builder.AddSyncXHR().None();
			builder.AddUsb().None();
		});

	AddCspHstsDefinitions(isDev, policy);

	return policy;
}
  


<p>The AddCspHstsDefinitions defines different policies using the parameter. In development, the HSTS header is not added to the headers and a weak CSP is used so that the Swagger UI will work. This UI uses unsafe inline Javascript and needs to be allowed in development. I remove swagger from all non dev deployments due to this and force a strong CSP definition then.</p>


  private static void AddCspHstsDefinitions(bool isDev, HeaderPolicyCollection policy)
{
	if (!isDev)
	{
		policy.AddContentSecurityPolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.AddObjectSrc().None();
			builder.AddBlockAllMixedContent();
			builder.AddImgSrc().None();
			builder.AddFormAction().None();
			builder.AddFontSrc().None();
			builder.AddStyleSrc().None();
			builder.AddScriptSrc().None();
			builder.AddBaseUri().Self();
			builder.AddFrameAncestors().None();
			builder.AddCustomDirective("require-trusted-types-for", "'script'");
		});
		// maxage = one year in seconds
		policy.AddStrictTransportSecurityMaxAgeIncludeSubDomains
          (maxAgeInSeconds: 60 * 60 * 24 * 365);
	}
	else
	{
		// allow swagger UI for dev
		policy.AddContentSecurityPolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.AddObjectSrc().None();
			builder.AddBlockAllMixedContent();
			builder.AddImgSrc().Self().From("data:");
			builder.AddFormAction().Self();
			builder.AddFontSrc().Self();
			builder.AddStyleSrc().Self().UnsafeInline();
			builder.AddScriptSrc().Self().UnsafeInline(); //.WithNonce();
			builder.AddBaseUri().Self();
			builder.AddFrameAncestors().None();
		});
	}
}
  


<p>In the Startup class, the UseSecurityHeaders method is used to apply the HTTP headers policy and add the middleware to the application. The env.IsDevelopment() is used to add or not to add the HSTS header. The default HSTS middleware from the ASP.NET Core templates was removed from the Configure method as this is not required.   The UseSecurityHeaders is added before the swagger middleware so that the security headers are deployment to all environments.</p>


  public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
	app.UseSecurityHeaders(
		SecurityHeadersDefinitions.GetHeaderPolicyCollection(env.IsDevelopment()));

	if (env.IsDevelopment())
	{
		app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();

		app.UseSwagger();
		app.UseSwaggerUI(c =&gt;
		{
			c.SwaggerEndpoint("/swagger/v1/swagger.json", "API v1");
		});
	}
  


<p>The server header can be removed in the program class if using Kestrel. If using IIS, you probably need to use the web.config to remove this. </p>


  public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =&gt;
            Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
                .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =&gt;
                {
                    webBuilder
                        .ConfigureKestrel(options =&gt; options.AddServerHeader = false)
                        .UseStartup&lt;Startup&gt;();
                });
  


<p>Running the application using a non development environment, the securtiyheaders.com check returns good results. Everything is closed as this is an API with no UI. </p>







<p>And the <a href="https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/">https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/</a> check returns a very possible evaluation of the headers. </p>







<p>If a swagger UI is required, the API application can be run in the development environment. This could also be deployed if required, but in a production deployment, you probably don’t need this.</p>







<p>To support the swagger UI, a weakened CSP is used and the <a href="https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/">https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/</a> check returns a more negative result.</p>



<p></p>







<p>Notes:</p>



<p>I block all traffic, if possible, which is not from my domain including sub domains. If implementing enterprise applications, I would always do this. If implementing public facing applications with high traffic volumes or need extra fast response times, or need to reduce the costs of hosting, then CDNs would need to be used, allowed and so on. Try to block all first and open up as required and maybe you can avoid some nasty surprises from all the Javascript, CSS frameworks used.</p>

  <p>This week I started experimenting with a desktop application version of <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> - with the goal of providing people who aren't comfortable with the command-line the ability to get Datasette up and running on their own personal computers.</p>

<p>Update 8th September 2021: I made a bunch more progress over the week following this post, see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Sep/8/datasette-desktop/">Datasette Desktop—a macOS desktop application for Datasette</a> for details or <a href="https://datasette.io/desktop">download the app</a> to try it out.</p>
<p></p>
 Why a desktop application? 
<p>On Monday I <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1429931719587598346">kicked off an enormous Twitter conversation</a> when I posted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wonder how much of the popularity of R among some communities in comparison to Python comes down to the fact that with R you can install the RStudio desktop application and you're ready to go</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This ties into my single biggest complaint about Python: it's just too hard for people to get started with. Setting up a Python development environment for the first time remains an enormous barrier to entry.</p>
<p>I later put this <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1429937655450505248">in stronger terms</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more I think about this the more frustrated I get, thinking about the enormous amount of human potential that's squandered because the barriers to getting started learning to program are so much higher than they need to be</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which made me think of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Those_who_live_in_glass_houses_should_not_throw_stones">glass houses</a>. My own <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> project has exactly the same problem: to run it locally you need to install Python and then install Datasette! Mac users <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/installation.html">can use Homebrew</a>, but telling newcomers to install Homebrew first isn't particularly welcoming either.</p>
<p>Ideally, I'd like people to be able to install a regular desktop application and start using Datasette that way, without even needing to know that it's written in Python.</p>
<p>There's been <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/93">an open issue</a> to get Datasette running as a standalone binary using PyInstaller since November 2017, with quite a bit of research.</p>
<p>But I want a UI as well: I don't want to have to teach new users how to install and run a command-line application if I can avoid it.</p>
<p>So I decided to spend some time researching <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> to see how hard it would be to make a basic Datasette desktop application a reality.</p>
 Progress so far 
<p>The code I've written so far can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.app">simonw/datasette.app</a> repository on GitHub. The app so far does the following:</p>
 
 Run a <code>datasette</code> server on localhost attached to an available port (found using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/portfinder">portfinder</a>) which terminates when the app quits. 
 Open a desktop window showing that Datasette instance once the server has started. 
 Allow additional windows onto the same instance to be opened using the "New Window" menu option or the Command+N keyboard shortcut. 
 Provides an "Open Database..." menu option (and Command+O shortcut) which brings up a file picker to allow the user to select a SQLite database file to open - once selected, this is attached to the Datasette instance and any windows showing the Datasette homepage are reloaded. 
 
<p>Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n90Cg_9j9XE">a video demo</a> showing these features in action:</p>

<p>It's very much an MVP, but I'm encouraged by the progress so far. I think this is enough of a proof of concept to be worth turning this into an actual usable product.</p>
 How this all works 
<p>There are two components to the application.</p>
<p>The first is a thin Electron shell, responsible for launching the Python server, managing windows and configuring the various desktop menu options used to configure it. The code for that lives in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.app/blob/4c968ec5b2b845c644c88425f2d43821cc63c4ff/main.js">main.js</a>.</p>
<p>The second is a custom Datasette plugin that adds extra functionality needed by the application. Currently this consists of a tiny bit of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.app/blob/4c968ec5b2b845c644c88425f2d43821cc63c4ff/datasette-app-support/datasette_app_support/static/sticky-footer.css">extra CSS</a> to make the footer stick to the bottom of the window, and a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.app/blob/4c968ec5b2b845c644c88425f2d43821cc63c4ff/datasette-app-support/datasette_app_support/__init__.py#L15-L56">custom API endpoint</a> at <code>/-/open-database-file</code> which is called by the menu option for opening a new database.</p>
 Initial impressions of Electron 
<p>I know it's cool to knock Electron, but in this case it feels like exactly the right tool for the job. Datasette is already a web application - what I need is a way to hide the configuration of that web application behind an icon, and re-present the interface in a way that feels more like a desktop application.</p>
<p>This is my first time building anything with Electron - here are some of my initial impressions.</p>
 
 The initial getting started workflow is really good. I started out with their <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start">Quick Start</a> and was up and running with a barebones application that I could start making changes to in just a few minutes. 
 The documentation is pretty good, but it leans more towards being an API reference. I found myself googling for examples of different things I wanted to do pretty often. 
 The automated testing situation isn't great. I'm using <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/spectron">Spectron</a> and <a href="https://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a> for <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.app/blob/4c968ec5b2b845c644c88425f2d43821cc63c4ff/test/spec.js">my initial</a> (very thin) tests - I got them up and running in GitHub Actions, but I've already run into some limitations:
 
 For some reason each time I run the tests an Electron window (and <code>datasette</code> Python process) is left running. I can't figure out why this is. 
 There doesn't appear to be a way for tests to trigger menu items, which is frustrating because most of the logic I've written so far deals with menu items! There is an <a href="https://github.com/electron-userland/spectron/issues/21">open issue for this</a> dating back to May 2016. 
 
 
 I haven't yet managed to package my app. This is clearly going to be the biggest challenge. 
 
 Up next: packaging the app 
<p>I was hoping to get to this before writing up my progress in these weeknotes, but it looks like it's going to be quite a challenge.</p>
<p>In order to produce an installable macOS app (I'll dive into Windows later) I need to do the following:</p>
 
 Build a standalone Datasette executable, complete with the custom plugin, using PyInstaller 
 Sign that binary with an Apple developer certificate 
 Build an Electron application that bundles a copy of that <code>datasette</code> binary 
 Sign the resulting Electron application 
 
<p>I'm expecting figuring this out to be a long-winded and frustrating experience, which is more the fault of Apple than of Electron. I'm tracking my progress on this in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.app/issues/7">issue #7</a>.</p>
 Datasette 0.59a2 
<p>I pushed out <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/releases/tag/0.59a2">a new alpha</a> of Datasette earlier this week, partly driven by work I was doing on <code>datasette.app</code>.</p>
<p>The biggest new feature in this release is a new plugin hook: <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-register-commands">register_commands()</a> - which lets plugins add additional commands to Datasette, e.g. <code>datasette verify name-of-file.db</code>.</p>
<p>I released a new plugin that exercises this hook called <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-verify">datasette-verify</a>. Past experience has shown me that it's crucial to ship an example plugin alongside a new hook, to help confirm that the hook design is fit for purpose.</p>
<p>It turns out I didn't need this for <code>datasette.app</code> after all, but it's still a great capability to have!</p>
 sqlite-utils 3.17 
<p>Quoting the <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v3-17">release notes</a> in full:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 The <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#cli-memory">sqlite-utils memory</a> command has a new <code>--analyze</code> option, which runs the equivalent of the <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#cli-analyze-tables">analyze-tables</a> command directly against the in-memory database created from the incoming CSV or JSON data. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/320">#320</a>) 
 
<a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#cli-insert-files">sqlite-utils insert-files</a> now has the ability to insert file contents in to <code>TEXT</code> columns in addition to the default <code>BLOB</code>. Pass the <code>--text</code> option or use <code>content_text</code> as a column specifier. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/319">#319</a>)

 evernote-to-sqlite 0.3.2 
<p>As a follow-up to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Aug/22/weeknotes-dogsheep/">last week's work</a> on my personal Dogsheep, I decided to re-import my Evernote notes... and found out that Evernote has changed their export mechanism in ways that broke my tool. Most concerningly their exported XML is <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/evernote-to-sqlite/issues/13">even less well-formed than it used to be</a>. This <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/evernote-to-sqlite/releases/tag/0.3.2">new release</a> works around that.</p>

  <p>GitHub repository templates were <a href="https://github.blog/2019-06-06-generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/">introduced a couple of years ago</a> to provide a mechanism for creating a brand new GitHub repository starting with an initial set of files.</p>
<p>They have one big limitation: the repositories that they create share the exact same contents as the template repository. They're basically a replacement for duplicating an existing folder and using that as the starting point for a new project.</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of the Python <a href="https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/">cookiecutter</a> tool, which provides a way to dynamically create new folder structures from user-provided variables using Jinja templates to generate content.</p>
<p>This morning, inspired by <a href="https://github.com/rochacbruno/python-project-template">this repo</a> by Bruno Rocha, I finally figured out a neat pattern for combining cookiecutter with repository templates to compensate for that missing dynamic content ability.</p>
<p>The result: <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin-template-repository">datasette-plugin-template-repository</a> for creating new Datasette plugins with a single click, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/python-lib-template-repository">python-lib-template-repository</a> for creating new Python libraries and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/click-app-template-repository">click-app-template-repository</a> for creating Click CLI tools.</p>
 Cookiecutter 
<p>I maintain three cookiecutter templates at the moment:</p>
 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin">simonw/datasette-plugin</a>, for creating new <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/writing_plugins.html">Datasette plugins</a>. I've used that one for dozens of plugins myself. 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/click-app">simonw/click-app</a>, which generates a skeleton for a new <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/">Click-based</a> command-line tool. Many of my <a href="https://datasette.io/tools?q=to-sqlite">x-to-sqlite</a> tools were built using this. 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/python-lib">simonw/python-lib</a>, for generating general-purpose Python libraries. 
 
<p>Having installed cookiecutter (<code>pip install cookiecutter</code>) each of these can be used like so:</p>
 <code>% cookiecutter gh:simonw/datasette-plugin
plugin_name []: visualize counties
description []: Datasette plugin for visualizing counties
hyphenated [visualize-counties]: 
underscored [visualize_counties]: 
github_username []: simonw
author_name []: Simon Willison
include_static_directory []: y
include_templates_directory []: 
</code> 
<p>Cookiecutter prompts for some variables defined in a <code>cookiecutter.json</code> file, then generates the project by evaluating the templates.</p>
<p>The challenge was: how can I run this automatically when a new repository is created from a GitHub repository template? And where can I get those variables from?</p>
 Bruno's trick: a self-rewriting repository 
<p>Bruno has a brilliant trick for getting this to run, exhibited by <a href="https://github.com/rochacbruno/python-project-template/blob/cec9c32ba007d633c4b9d26aad67889d1a6a5e9a/.github/workflows/rename_project.yml">this workflow YAML</a>. His workflow starts like this:</p>
  name: Rename the project from template

on: [push]

jobs:
  rename-project:
    if: ${{ github.repository != 'rochacbruno/python-project-template' }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
       # ...  
<p>This means that his workflow only runs on copies of the original repository - the workflow is disabled in the template repository itself by that <code>if:</code> condition.</p>
<p>Then at the end of the workflow he does this:</p>
        - uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4
        with:
          commit_message: "Ready to clone and code"
          push_options: --force  
<p>This does a force push to replace the contents of the repository with whatever was generated by the rest of the workflow script!</p>
<p>This trick was exactly what I needed to get cookiecutter to work with repository templates.</p>
 Gathering variables using the GitHub GraphQL API 
<p>All three of my existing cookiecutter templates require the following variables:</p>
 
 A name to use for the generated folder 
 A one-line description to use in the README and in <code>setup.py</code>
 
 The GitHub username of the owner of the package 
 The display name of the owner 
 
<p>I need values for all of these before I can run cookiecutter.</p>
<p>It turns out they are all available from the GitHub GraphQL API, which can be called from the initial workflow copied from the repository template!</p>
<p>Here's the GitHub Actions step that does that:</p>
  - uses: actions/github-script@v4
  id: fetch-repo-and-user-details
  with:
    script: |
      const query = `query($owner:String!, $name:String!) {
        repository(owner:$owner, name:$name) {
          name
          description
          owner {
            login
            ... on User {
              name
            }
            ... on Organization {
              name
            }
          }
        }
      }`;
      const variables = {
        owner: context.repo.owner,
        name: context.repo.repo
      }
      const result = await github.graphql(query, variables)
      console.log(result)
      return result  
<p>Here I'm using the <a href="https://github.com/actions/github-script">actions/github-script</a> action, which provides a pre-configured, authenticated instance of GitHub's <a href="https://octokit.github.io/rest.js">octokit/rest.js</a> JavaScript library. You can then provide custom JavaScript that will be executed by the action.</p>
<p><code>await github.graphql(query, variables)</code> can then execute a GitHub GraphQL query. The query I'm using here gives me back the currenty repository's <code>name</code> and <code>description</code> and the <code>login</code> and display name of the owner of that repository.</p>
<p>GitHub repositories can be owned by either a user or an organization - the <code>... on User</code> / <code>... on Organization</code> syntax provides the same result here for both types of nested object.</p>
<p>The output of this GraphQL query looks something like this:</p>
  {
  "repository": {
    "name": "datasette-verify",
    "description": "Verify that files can be opened by Datasette",
    "owner": {
      "login": "simonw",
      "name": "Simon Willison"
    }
  }
}  
<p>I assigned an <code>id</code> of <code>fetch-repo-and-user-details</code> to that step of the workflow, so that the <code>return</code> value from the script could be accessed as JSON in the next step.</p>
 Passing those variables to cookiecutter 
<p>Cookiecutter defaults to asking for variables interactively, but it also supports passing in those variables as command-line parameters.</p>
<p>Here's part of my next workflow steps that executes cookiecutter using the variables collected by the GraphQL query:</p>
  - name: Rebuild contents using cookiecutter
  env:
    INFO: ${{ steps.fetch-repo-and-user-details.outputs.result }}
  run: |
    export REPO_NAME=$(echo $INFO | jq -r '.repository.name')
    # Run cookiecutter
    cookiecutter gh:simonw/python-lib --no-input \
      lib_name=$REPO_NAME \
      description="$(echo $INFO | jq -r .repository.description)" \
      github_username="$(echo $INFO | jq -r .repository.owner.login)" \
      author_name="$(echo $INFO | jq -r .repository.owner.name)"  
<p>The <code>env: INFO:</code> block exposes an environment variable called <code>INFO</code> to the step, populated with the output of the previous <code>fetch-repo-and-user-details</code> step - a string of JSON.</p>
<p>Then within the body of the step I use <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> to extract out the details that I need - first the repository name:</p>
 <code>export REPO_NAME=$(echo $INFO | jq -r '.repository.name')
</code> 
<p>Then I pass the other details directly to cookiecutter as arguments:</p>
 <code>cookiecutter gh:simonw/python-lib --no-input \
  lib_name=$REPO_NAME \
  description="$(echo $INFO | jq -r .repository.description)" \
  github_username="$(echo $INFO | jq -r .repository.owner.login)" \
  author_name="$(echo $INFO | jq -r .repository.owner.name)"
</code> 
<p><code>jq -r</code> ensures that the raw text value is returned by <code>jq</code>, as opposed to the JSON string value which would be wrapped in double quotes.</p>
 Cleaning up at the end 
<p>Running cookiecutter in this way creates a folder within the root of the repository that duplicates the repository name, something like this:</p>
 <code>datasette-verify/datasette-verify
</code> 
<p>I actually want the contents of that folder to live in the root, so the next step I run is:</p>
 <code>mv $REPO_NAME/* .
mv $REPO_NAME/.gitignore .
mv $REPO_NAME/.github .
</code> 
<p>Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/python-lib-template-repository/blob/45869a9156aa3c2ab95bf1b985151d1d51719c1f/.github/workflows/cookiecutter.yml">my completed workflow</a>.</p>
<p>This almost worked - but when I tried to run it for the first time I got this error:</p>
<p><code>![remote rejected] (refusing to allow an integration to create or update .github/workflows/publish.yml)</code></p>
<p>It turns out the credentials provided to GitHub Actions are forbidden from making modifications to their own workflow files!</p>
<p>I can understand why that limitation is in place, but it's frustrating here. For the moment, my workaround is to do this just before pushing the final content back to the repository:</p>
 <code>mv .github/workflows .github/rename-this-to-workflows
</code> 
<p>I leave it up to the user to rename that folder back again when they want to enable the workflows that have been generated for them.</p>
 Give these a go 
<p>I've set up two templates using this pattern now:</p>
 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin-template-repository">datasette-plugin-template-repository</a> for creating new Datasette plugins - <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin-template-repository/generate">use this template</a>
 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/python-lib-template-repository">python-lib-template-repository</a> for creating new Python libraries - <a href="https://github.com/simonw/python-lib-template-repository/generate">use this template</a>
 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/click-app-template-repository">click-app-template-repository</a> for creating new Python Click CLI tools - <a href="https://github.com/simonw/click-app-template-repository/generate">use this template</a>
 
 
<p>Both of these work the same way: enter a repository name and description, click "Create repository from template" and watch as GitHub copies the new repository and then, a few seconds later, runs the workflow to execute the cookiecutter template to replace the contents with the final result.</p>
<p>You can see examples of repositories that I created using these templates here:</p>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/27/working-with-postgres-types/">Working with Postgres types</a> I showed an example of a materialized view that depends on a typed set-returning function. Because Postgres knows about that dependency, it won’t allow DROP FUNCTION foo. Instead it requires DROP FUNCTION foo CASCADE.</p>
<p>A similar thing happens with materialized views that depend on tables or other materialized views. Let’s build a cascade of views and consider the implications.</p>
 create materialized view v1 as (
  select 
    1 as number,
    'note_count' as label 
);
SELECT 1

select * from v1;

number | label
-------+-------
     1 | note_count
 
<p>Actually, before continuing the cascade, let’s linger here for a moment. This is a table-like object created without using CREATE TABLE and without explicitly specifying types. But Postgres knows the types.</p>
 \d v1;

Materialized view "public.v1"

Column  | Type 
--------+-----
number  | integer
label   | text
 
<p>The read-only view can become a read-write table like so.</p>
 create table t1 as (select * from v1);
SELECT 1

select * from t1;

number | label
-------+-------
     1 | note_count

\d t1

Table "public.v1"

Column  | Type 
--------+-----
number  | integer
label   | text
 
<p>This ability to derive a table from a materialized view will come in handy later. It’s also just interesting to see how the view’s implicit types become explicit in the table.</p>
<p>OK, let’s continue the cascade.</p>
 create materialized view v2 as (
  select 
    number + 1,
    label
  from v1
);
SELECT 1

select * from v2;

number | label
-------+-------
     2 | note_count

create materialized view v3 as (
  select 
    number + 1,
    label
  from v2
);
SELECT 1

select * from v3;

number | label
-------+-------
     3 | note_count
 
<p>Why do this? Arguably you shouldn’t. Laurenz Albe makes that case in <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/tracking-view-dependencies-in-postgresql/">Tracking view dependencies in PostgreSQL</a>. Recognizing that it’s sometimes useful, though, he goes on to provide code that can track recursive view dependencies. </p>
<p>I use cascading views advisedly to augment the use of CTEs and functions described in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/21/postgres-functional-style/">Postgres functional style</a>. Views that refine views can provide a complementary form of the chunking that aids reasoning in an analytics system. But that’s a topic for another episode. In this episode I’ll describe a problem that arose in a case where there’s only a single level of dependency from a table to a set of dependent materialized views, and discuss my solution to that probem.</p>
<p>Here’s the setup. We have an annotation table that’s reloaded nightly. On an internal dashboard we have a chart based on the materialized view annos_at_month_ends_for_one_year which is derived from the annotation table and, as its name suggests, reports annotation counts on a monthly cycle. At the beginning of the nightly load, this happens: DROP TABLE annotation CASCADE. So the derived view gets dropped and needs to be recreated as part of the nightly process. But that’s a lot of unnecessary work for a chart that only changes monthly.</p>
<p>Here are two ways to protect a view from a cascading drop of the table it depends on. Both reside in a SQL script, monthly.sql, that only runs on the first of every month. First, annos_at_month_ends_for_one_year.</p>
 drop materialized view annos_at_month_ends_for_one_year;
create materialized view annos_at_month_ends_for_one_year as (
  with last_days as (
    select 
      last_days_of_prior_months( 
        date(last_month_date() - interval '6 year')
      ) as last_day
    ),
    monthly_counts as (
      select
        to_char(last_day, '_YYYY-MM') as end_of_month,
        anno_count_between( 
          date(last_day - interval '1 month'), last_day
        ) as monthly_annos
      from last_days
    )
    select
      end_of_month,
      monthly_annos,
      sum(monthly_annos) over 
        (order by end_of_month asc rows 
           between unbounded preceding and current row
        ) as cumulative_annos
    from monthly_counts
) with data;
 
<p>Because this view depends indirectly on the annotation table  — by way of the function anno_count_between — Postgres doesn’t see the dependency. So the view isn’t affected by the cascading drop of the annotation table. It persists until, once a month, it gets dropped and recreated.</p>
<p>What if you want Postgres to know about such a dependency, so that the view will participate in a cascading drop? You can do this.</p>
 create materialized view annos_at_month_ends_for_one_year as (
  with depends as (
    select * from annotation limit 1
  )
  last_days as (
    ),
  monthly_counts as (
    )
  select
    *
  from monthly_counts;
 
<p>The depends CTE doesn’t do anything relevant to the query, it just tells Postgres that this view depends on the annotation table.</p>
<p>Here’s another way to protect a view from a cascading drop. This expensive-to-build view depends directly on the annotation table but only needs to be updated monthly. So in this case, cumulative_annotations is a table derived from a temporary materialized view.</p>
 create materialized view _cumulative_annotations as (
  with data as (
    select 
      to_char(created, 'YYYY-MM') as created
    from annotation
    group by created
  ) 
  select 
    data.created, 
    sum(data.count) 
      over ( 
        order by data.created asc 
        rows between unbounded preceding and current row
      )
    from data
    group by data.created 
    order by data.created 

drop table cumulative_annotations;

create table cumulative_annotations as (
  select * from _cumulative_annotations
);

drop materialized view _cumulative_annotations;
 
<p>The table cumulative_annotations is only rebuilt once a month. It depends indirectly on the annotation table but Postgres doesn’t see that, so doesn’t include it in the cascading drop.</p>
<p>Here’s the proof.</p>
 -- create a table
create table t1 (number int);

insert into t1 (number) values (1);
INSERT 0 1

select * from t1;

number
-------
     1

-- derive a view from t1
create materialized view v1 as (select * from t1);
SELECT 1

select * from v1

number
-------
     1

-- try to drop t1
drop table t1;

ERROR: cannot drop table t1 because other objects depend on it
DETAIL: materialized view v1 depends on table t1
HINT: Use DROP ... CASCADE to drop the dependent objects too.

create materialized view v1 as (select * from t1);
SELECT 1

<p>These are two ways I’ve found to protect a long-lived result set from the cascading drop of a short-lived table on which it depends. You can hide the dependency behind a function, or you can derive an independent table by way of a transient materialized view. I use them interchangeably, and don’t have a strong preference one way or another. Both lighten the load on the analytics server. Materialized views (or tables) that only need to change weekly or monthly, but were being dropped nightly by cascade from core tables, are now recreated only on their appropriate weekly or monthly cycles.</p>

<p>In this series I’m exploring how to work in a code base that lives in two places: Metabase questions that encapsulate chunks of SQL, and Postgres functions/procedures/views that also encapsulate chunks of SQL. To be effective working with this hybrid collection of SQL chunks, I needed to reason about their interrelationships. One way to do that entailed the creation of a documentation generator that writes a concordance of callers and callees.</p>
<p>Here’s the entry for the function sparklines_for_guid(_guid).</p>
<p></p>
<p>The called by column says that this function is called from two different contexts. One is a Metabase question, All courses: Weekly activity. If you’re viewing that question in Metabase, you’ll find that its SQL text is simply this:</p>
 select * from sparklines_for_guid( {{guid}} )
 
<p>The same function call appears in a procedure, cache warmer, that preemptively memoizes the function for a set of the most active schools in the system. In either case, you can look up the function in the concordance, view its definition, and review how it’s called.</p>
<p>In the definition of sparkline_for_guid, names of other functions (like guid_hashed_view_exists) appear and are linked to their definitions. Similarly, names of views appearing in SELECT or JOIN contexts are linked to their definitions. </p>
<p>Here’s the entry for the function guid_hashed_view_exists. It is called by sparklines_for_guid as well as by functions that drive panels on the school dashboard. It links to the functions it uses: hash_for_guid and exists_view. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s the entry for the view lms_course_groups which appears as a JOIN target in sparklines_for_guid. This central view is invoked — in SELECT or JOIN context — from many functions, from dependent views, and from Metabase questions. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Metabase questions can also “call” other Metabase questions. In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/21/a-virtuous-cycle-for-analytics/">A virtuous cycle for analytics</a> I noted: “Queries can emit URLs in order to compose themselves with other queries.” Here’s an example of that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This Metabase question (985) calls various linked functions, and is called by two other Metabase questions. Here is one of those.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Because this Metabase question (600) emits an URL that refers to 985, it links to the definition of 985. It also links to the view, top_annotated_domains_last_week, from which it SELECTs.</p>
<p>It was straightforward to include Postgres functions, views, and procedures in the concordance since these live in files that reside in the fileystem under source control. Metabase questions, however, live in a database — in our case, a Postgres database that’s separate from our primary Postgres analytics db. In order to extract them into a file I use this SQL snippet.</p>
 select
  r.id,
  m.name as dbname,
  r.name,
  r.description,
  r.dataset_query
from report_card r
join metabase_database m
  on m.id = cast(r.dataset_query::jsonb-&gt;&gt;'database' as int)
where not r.archived
order by r.id;
 
<p>The doc generator downloads that Metabase data as a CSV file, queries.csv, and processes it along with the files that contain the definitions of functions, procedures, and views in the Postgres data warehouse. It also emits queries.txt which is a more convenient way to diff changes from one commit to the next. </p>
<p>This technique solved a couple of problems. First, when we were only using Metabase — unaugmented by anything in Postgres — it enabled us to put our Metabase SQL under source control and helped us visualize relationships among queries.</p>
<p>Later, as we augmented Metabase with Postgres functions, procedures, and views, it became even more powerful. Developing a new panel for a school or course dashboard means writing a new memoized function. That process begins as a Metabase question with SQL code that calls existing Postgres functions, and/or JOINs/SELECTs FROM existing Postgres views. Typically it then leads to the creation of new supporting Postgres functions and/or views. All this can be tested by internal users, or even invited external users, in Metabase, with the concordance available to help understand the relationships among the evolving set of functions and views.</p>
<p>When supporting functions and views are finalized, the SQL content of the Metabase question gets wrapped up in a memoized Postgres function that’s invoked from a panel of a dashboard app. At that point the concordance links the new wrapper function to the same set of supporting functions and views. I’ve found this to be an effective way to reason about a hybrid code base as features move from Metabase for prototyping to Postgres in production, while maintaining all the code under source control.</p>
<p>That foundation of source control is necessary, but maybe not sufficient, for a team to consider this whole approach viable. The use of two complementary languages for in-database programming will certainly raise eyebrows, and if it’s not your cup of tea I completely understand. If you do find it appealing, though, one thing you’ll wonder about next will be tooling. I work in VSCode nowadays, for which I’ve not yet found a useful extension for pl/pgsql or pl/python. With <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/13/pl-python-metaprogramming/">metaprogramming</a> life gets even harder for aspiring pl/pgsql or pl/python VSCode extensions. I can envision them, but I’m not holding my breath awaiting them. Meanwhile, two factors enable VSCode to be helpful even without deep language-specific intelligence.</p>
<p>The first factor, and by far the dominant one, is outlining. In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2019/09/05/products-and-capabilities/">Products and capabilities</a> I reflect on how I’ve never adopted an outlining product, but often rely on outlining capability infused into a product. In VSCode that’s “only” basic indentation-driven folding and unfolding. But I find it works remarkably well across SQL queries, views and functions that embed them, CTEs that comprise them, and pl/pgsql or pl/python functions called by them. </p>
<p>The second factor, nascent thus far, is GitHub Copilot. It’s a complementary kind of language intelligence that’s aware of, but not bounded by, what a file extension of .sql or .py implies. It can sometimes discern patterns that mix language syntaxes and offer helpful suggestions. That hasn’t happened often so far, but it’s striking when it does. I don’t yet know the extent to which it may be <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/11/working-with-intelligent-machines/">training me while I train it</a>, or how those interactions might influence others. At this point I’m not a major Copilot booster, but I am very much an interested observer of and participant in the experiment.</p>
<p>All in all, I’m guardedly optimistic that existing or feasible tooling can enable individuals and teams to sanely navigate the hybrid corpus of source code discussed in this series. If you’re along for the ride, you’ll next wonder about debugging and monitoring a system built this way. That’s a topic for a future episode.</p>

   America has fallen; taken hostage by political cults, our once great bastion of "Individual Liberty" has fallen victim to the mobs ruled by media disinformation, inadequate education, and technical gerrymandering by algorithm. People have become operational devotees to artificial participatory groupings functioning as mobs of influence. This "devotion" to practice has yielded a system at odds with Constitutional integrity.  <br>  How did this happen?  <br>  Why did Individual people cede authority to a system that abstracts them into legal definitions out of step with observable reality? "We The People" no longer function as actual people, Individuals all. Instead, "We" are a legal abstraction duly represented by a Government once established "of, by, for people". This legalese slight of hand has manifested a bureaucratic system of artificial intelligence, and cult-based political control, wherein Individuals are regarded as a threat to stability.  <br>  People in the real world can observe that the only human beings they ever meet or come to know are all Individuals. It is our choices which form cults, our methods that make mobs. Once made, these are hard to unmake for any one person. For they exist to defy and destroy the integrity of Individual empowerment. Groups harvest people by consent, or manipulation, and the harvesting creates a new intent. Seeing clearly this new intent is useful in understanding how/why cults come into power.  <br>  In Government funded education, a cult of practice or pedagogy is limited by credentialed membership. The support of one cult member for another is advanced by a caring community of social influence all in harmony with the manner by which their credentialed membership is enforced, and employed. The unionization of labor within this cult of pedagogy further entrenches the practices and support structure that any student or family in any zip code can anticipate receiving education from. Where methods of functional literacy fall short due to rapidly evolving practices in the real world, the structure of practice and labor serves to enforce the pace of available change/progress offered to students and families.  <br>  Everyone can see this happening for themselves, and many Individual Teachers will openly and adamantly acknowledge this operational fact, and their support for the stability of labor value tied to their cult of practice is hard to argue with, for as people, they certainly deserve respect for their working efforts. This then is the point wherein the structural outcomes derived by cults begins its insidious assault on communities, cultures, Nations and people, Individuals all.  <br>  Cults are not made by "bad people". Cults are made by "bad choices". Enforcing bad choices is the problem of greatest consequence. Look around, where does the enforcement of bad choices come from? How is our civil Society being forced into bad choices that yield outcomes out of step with our intent as a people who create their own way, in life, liberty and the pursuits of happiness guaranteed by our Governing assemblage?&nbsp;  <br>  This is our enemy America.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2020/08/kill-cult.html">People must kill the tendency towards cults.</a>  <br>  Cult rule never solves problems.. it just increases costs on infinite horizon of mass delusion for bureaucratic control.&nbsp;  <br>  Corporate bureaucracies extending from DOD, US CONGRESS, DOE, and every other department of every Federal and State Government all follow this same line of structural management by cult of practice. After retiring, contractors provide service of relationships between the same Government offices and personnel that they once worked with, enabling the efficient processing of opportunity by trust and devotion to a cult of practice. One political cult is elected and operational devotees arrive en masse to take their seats in the administrative machinery availed to their servicing mandates. With each Presidential election, this process can be experienced anew in Washington DC. A city emerges from the cults of influence that give operational meaning to time.&nbsp;  <br>  Taken to its extreme, the predictive outcomes that cult behaviors of practice/behavior/attention produce are easily harvested by propaganda-inducing algorithms used to influence mass sentiment. <a href="https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/08/10/how-the-daily-wire-uses-facebooks-targeted-advertising-to-build-its-brand">Advertising methods in social media systems</a> designed to produce cult behavior tendencies for ease of tracking attention and gaining access to social graphs where people influence one another as friends, brothers, sisters, daughters, sons, grandmas &amp; grandpas.. all for the purpose of producing cult outcomes for the predictable harvesting of management value. Any purpose, trackable cult behaviors. Any intent, trackable cult attention. Any manipulation, trackable cult influence.&nbsp;  <br>  Individual liberty that gives rise to a Nation and civil Society derived of, by, for people, Individuals all must be protected, at all costs. This is a structural requirement. People are not "people"; abstractions are not accurate enough. People are Individuals, and their operational participation is founded in the local mud, by the blood running through their veins for the integrity of their local community, culture and way of life.  <br>  Individual liberty has enemies, both well documented ones and new ones that appear from time to time. The Chinese Communist Party is one such enemy. Cults that remove Individual responsibility and induce group think are another. A systemic bureaucracy run by harvesting big data under surveillance technologies operating with artificial intelligence across time and space is another. These are insidious organizations of destructive intent, hell bent on capturing the loyalty of people, in lieu of allowing for actual free will expressed by people. Families must guard and protect the light of freedom found inside of each of us as people.&nbsp;  <br>  Bureaucracies around the world are racing towards the use of data aggregated for profound purposes, and are rapidly constituting a new type of "artificial intelligence" that is out of step with the inherent Rights of people, Individuals all.  <br>  Unless this aggregated effect of "We" is challenged to show its hand, to prove it exists to empower people, Individuals all, rather than replace them with an abstraction of literature or computer science &amp; engineering, everything that "We The People" hold dear will come to an end, replaced by a new version existing not "of, by, for" each of us, but instead.  <br>  The benefits of this transition will be cast broadly; Government-issued welfare benefits, a creator economy preying on the vanities of youth, and the destruction of work in favor of administration, delegation, crowdsourcing, and monetization of the cult attention graph. People will get rich for their compliant participation, while civil society gets weaker, less credulous, and more apt to extreme swings of behavior based on cult support for policies of the day.  <br>  You either stand for your Individual Rights, or you have none in the end. Standing means understanding how your Rights came to be, and how the source of your authority is the only protection you possess from cult rule. Mobs are spawning, and data aggregation via social-technical tools graphing the attention of people, and segmenting them by algorithm into easily targeted groups that can be harvested for financial and political gain is rampant. General data illiteracy is Nation-wide, around the entire globe. Political cults feed lies via media disinformation keeping people occupied trying to figure out how to be part of the group they agree with, most of the time.. some of the time.. today, for a specific reason.. always by cult association. Left cult, Right cult.. no people, no Individuals anywhere.  <br>  ID is the control parameter of freedom and security in a civil society. The source of your ID matters. In a civil society derived "of, by, for people", the source is obvious; ID comes from you.&nbsp;  <br>  Are you a database? Do you exist in a State Trust?  <br>  Rights are for people, not birth certificates. The law knows this, but it can not seem to figure out how to manifest this accurately without falsifying the inherent human authority required to resolve source integrity.  <br>  People own root. Individuals all, people are the source of Sovereign integrity, or there is none.  <br>  <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2012/02/what-is-sovereign-source-authority.html">Sovereign source authority</a> has been corrupted, and <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2021/07/recursive-signatory.html">only people can fix it in America</a>.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

  <p>Summary: An old apricot tree reminded me that life is wonderfully decentralized, helping it succeed in harsh conditions.</p>




<p>
    Last summer, I decided to kill this apricot tree. We weren't using the apricots, it was making a mess, and I wanted to do something else with the spot it's in. So, I cut off the branches, drilled holes in the stumps, and poured undiluted Round-Up into them. And yet, you'll notice that there's a spot on one branch that has sprouted shoots and leaves this summer. 
</p>

<p>
    My first thought was that the tree was struggling to live. But then, I realized that I was anthropomorphizing it. In fact, the tree has no higher brain function, it's not struggling to do anything. Instead, what the picture shows is the miracle of decentralization.
</p>

<p>
    Despite my overall success in killing the tree, some cells didn't get the message. They were able to source water and oxygen to grow. They didn't need permission or direction from central authority. They don't even know or care that they're part of a tree. The cells are programmed to behave in specific ways and conditions were such that the cells on that part of the branch were able to execute their programming. Left alone, they might even produce fruit and manage to reproduce. Amazing resiliance.
</p>

<p>
    I've <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/05/decentralized_system_in_a_box.shtml">written before about the decentralized behavior of bees</a>. Like the apricot tree, there is no higher brain function in a bee hive. Each bee goes about its work according to its programming. And yet, the result is a marvelously complex living organism (the hive) that is made up of tens of thousands of individual bees, each doing their own thing, but in a way that behaves consistently, reaches consensus about complex tasks, and achieves important goals.
</p>

<p>
    A few years ago, I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00OD8Z4JW/windleyofente-20">The Vital Question by Nick Lane</a>. The book is a fascinating read about the way energy plays a vital role in how life develops and indeed how evolution progresses. I'm still in awe of the mechanisms necessary to provide energy for even a single-celled organism, let alone something as complex as a human being, a bee hive, or even an apricot tree.
</p>

<p>
    Life succeeds because it's terrifically decentralized. I find that miraculous. Humans have a tough time thinking about decentralized systems and designing them in ways that succeed. The current work in blockchains and interest in decentralization gives me hope that we'll design more systems that use decentralized methods to achieve their ends. The result will be an online world that is less fragile, perhaps even anti-fragile, than what we have now. 
</p>

<blockquote> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00OD8Z4JW/windleyofente-20">The Vital Question: Energy, Evolution, and the Origins of Complex Life by Nick Lane</a> <p>For two and a half billion years, from the very origins of life, single-celled organisms such as bacteria evolved without changing their basic form. Then, on just one occasion in four billion years, they made the jump to complexity. All complex life, from mushrooms to man, shares puzzling features, such as sex, which are unknown in bacteria. How and why did this radical transformation happen? The answer, Lane argues, lies in energy: all life on Earth lives off a voltage with the strength of a lightning bolt. Building on the pillars of evolutionary theory, Lane’s hypothesis draws on cutting-edge research into the link between energy and cell biology, in order to deliver a compelling account of evolution from the very origins of life to the emergence of multicellular organisms, while offering deep insights into our own lives and deaths.</p><p></p></blockquote>

<p>This article shows how to improve the security of an ASP.NET Core Blazor application by adding security headers to all HTTP Razor Page responses (Blazor WASM hosted in a ASP.NET Core hosted backend). The security headers are added using the <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders">NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders</a> Nuget package from <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewlocknet">Andrew Lock</a>. The headers are used to protect the session, not for authentication. The application is authenticated using OpenID Connect, the security headers are used to protected the session. The authentication is implemented in the Blazor application using the BFF pattern. The WASM client part is just a view of the server rendered trusted backend and cookies are used in the browser. All API calls are same domain only and protected with a cookie and same site.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCore6Experiments">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCore6Experiments</a> </p>



<p>Blogs in this series</p>



  <a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/08/16/improving-application-security-in-asp-net-core-razor-pages-using-http-headers-part-1/">Improving application security in ASP.NET Core Razor Pages using HTTP headers – Part 1</a>  Improving application security in Blazor using HTTP headers – Part 2  <a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/08/30/improving-application-security-in-an-asp-net-core-api-using-http-headers-part-3/">Improving application security in an ASP.NET Core API using HTTP headers – Part 3</a>  



<p>The NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders and the NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders.TagHelpers Nuget packages are added to the csproj file of the web application. The tag helpers are added to use the nonce from the CSP in the Razor Pages.</p>


  &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
	&lt;PackageReference 
		Include="NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders" 
		Version="0.16.0" /&gt;
	&lt;PackageReference 
		Include="NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders.TagHelpers" 
		Version="0.16.0" /&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
  


<p>The Blazor definition is very similar to the ASP.NET Core Razor Page one. The main difference is that the CSP script policy is almost disabled due to the Blazor script requirements. We can at least force self on the content security policy header script-src definition.</p>



<p>The Blazor WASM logout link sends a HTTP Form POST request which is redirected to the OpenID Connect identity provider. The CSP needs to allow this redirect and the content secure policy form definition allows this.</p>


  public static HeaderPolicyCollection GetHeaderPolicyCollection(
     bool isDev, string identityProviderHost)
{
	var policy = new HeaderPolicyCollection()
		.AddFrameOptionsDeny()
		.AddXssProtectionBlock()
		.AddContentTypeOptionsNoSniff()
		.AddReferrerPolicyStrictOriginWhenCrossOrigin()
		.RemoveServerHeader()
		.AddCrossOriginOpenerPolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.SameOrigin();
		})
		.AddCrossOriginEmbedderPolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.RequireCorp();
		})
		.AddCrossOriginResourcePolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.SameOrigin();
		})
		.AddContentSecurityPolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.AddObjectSrc().None();
			builder.AddBlockAllMixedContent();
			builder.AddImgSrc().Self().From("data:");
			builder.AddFormAction().Self().From(identityProviderHost);
			builder.AddFontSrc().Self();
			builder.AddStyleSrc().Self().UnsafeInline();
			builder.AddBaseUri().Self();
			builder.AddFrameAncestors().None();

			// due to Blazor
			builder.AddScriptSrc().Self().UnsafeInline().UnsafeEval();
		})
		.RemoveServerHeader()
		.AddPermissionsPolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.AddAccelerometer().None();
			builder.AddAutoplay().None(); 
			builder.AddCamera().None();
			builder.AddEncryptedMedia().None();
			builder.AddFullscreen().All();
			builder.AddGeolocation().None();
			builder.AddGyroscope().None();
			builder.AddMagnetometer().None();
			builder.AddMicrophone().None();
			builder.AddMidi().None();
			builder.AddPayment().None();
			builder.AddPictureInPicture().None();
			builder.AddSyncXHR().None();
			builder.AddUsb().None();
		});

	if (!isDev)
	{
		// maxage = one year in seconds
		policy.AddStrictTransportSecurityMaxAgeIncludeSubDomains(maxAgeInSeconds: 60 * 60 * 24 * 365);
	}

	return policy;
}
  


<p>Blazor adds the following script to the WASM host file. This means the CSP for scripts cannot be implemented in a good way.</p>


  &lt;script&gt;
var Module; window.__wasmmodulecallback__(); delete window.__wasmmodulecallback__;
&lt;/script&gt;


  


<p>script-src (from CSP evaluator)</p>



<p>‘self’ can be problematic if you host JSONP, Angular or user uploaded files.<br>‘unsafe-inline’ allows the execution of unsafe in-page scripts and event handlers.<br>‘unsafe-eval’ allows the execution of code injected into DOM APIs such as eval().</p>



<p></p>



<p>The aspnetcore-browser-refresh.js is also added for hot reload. This also prevents a strong CSP script definition in development. This could be fixed with a dev check in the policy definition. There is no point fixing this, until the wasmmodulecallback script bug is fixed.</p>



<p>I am following the ASP.NET Core <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/34428">issue</a> and hope this can be improved for Blazor.</p>



<p></p>



<p>In the Startup class, the UseSecurityHeaders method is used to apply the HTTP headers policy and add the middleware to the application. The env.IsDevelopment() is used to add or not to add the HSTS header. The default HSTS middleware from the ASP.NET Core templates was removed from the Configure method as this is not required. </p>


  public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
	if (env.IsDevelopment())
	{
		app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
	}
	else
	{
		app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
	}

	app.UseSecurityHeaders(
		SecurityHeadersDefinitions
			.GetHeaderPolicyCollection(env.IsDevelopment(),
                    Configuration["AzureAd:Instance"]));
  


<p>The server header can be removed in the program class file of the Blazor server project if using Kestrel. If using IIS, you probably need to use the web.config to remove this.</p>


  public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =&gt;
	Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
		.ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =&gt;
		{
			webBuilder
				.ConfigureKestrel(options =&gt; 
					options.AddServerHeader = false)
				.UseStartup&lt;Startup&gt;();
		});
  


<p>When we scan the <a href="https://securityheaders.com/">https://securityheaders.com/</a> you can view the results. You might need to disable the authentication to check this, or provide a public view.</p>







<p>The content security policy has a warning due to the script definition which is required for Blazor.</p>







<p>The <a href="https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/">https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/</a> also displays a high severity finding due the the CSP script definition.</p>







<p>Notes:</p>



<p>If the application is fully protected without any public views, the follow redirects checkbox on the security headers needs to be disabled as then you only get the results of the identity provider used to authenticate. </p>



<p>I block all traffic, if possible, which is not from my domain including sub domains. If implementing enterprise applications, I would always do this. If implementing public facing applications with high traffic volumes or need extra fast response times, or need to reduce the costs of hosting, then CDNs would need to be used, allowed and so on. Try to block all first and open up as required and maybe you can avoid some nasty surprises from all the Javascript, CSS frameworks used.</p>



<p>Maybe until the CSP script is fixed for Blazor, you probably should avoid using Blazor for high security applications and use ASP.NET Core Razor Page applications instead. </p>



<p>If you use Blazor together with tokens in Azure AD or Azure B2C and this CSP script bug, you leave yourself open to having your tokens stolen. I would recommend using server authentication with Azure which removes the tokens from the browser and also solves the Azure SPA logout problem. Azure AD, Azure B2C do not support the revocation endpoint or introspection, so it is impossible to invalidate your tokens on a logout. It does not help if the IT admin, Azure monitoring can invalidate tokens using CAE.</p>

<p>The OAuth 2.0 JWT-Secured Authorization Request (JAR) specification has been published as <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9101">RFC 9101</a>.  Among other applications, this specification is used by the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0.html">OpenID Financial-grade API (FAPI)</a>.  This is another in the series of RFCs bringing <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>-defined functionality to OAuth 2.0.  Previous such RFCs included “OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol” [<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7591.html">RFC 7591</a>] and “OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata” [<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8414.html">RFC 8414</a>].</p>
<p>The abstract of the RFC is:</p>
<blockquote><p><br>
The authorization request in OAuth 2.0 described in RFC 6749 utilizes query parameter serialization, which means that authorization request parameters are encoded in the URI of the request and sent through user agents such as web browsers. While it is easy to implement, it means that a) the communication through the user agents is not integrity protected and thus, the parameters can be tainted, b) the source of the communication is not authenticated, and c) the communication through the user agents can be monitored. Because of these weaknesses, several attacks to the protocol have now been put forward.</p>
<p><br>
This document introduces the ability to send request parameters in a JSON Web Token (JWT) instead, which allows the request to be signed with JSON Web Signature (JWS) and encrypted with JSON Web Encryption (JWE) so that the integrity, source authentication, and confidentiality properties of the authorization request are attained. The request can be sent by value or by reference.<br>

<p>My dual premises in this series are:</p>
<p>– Modern SQL is more valuable as a programming language than you might think (see Markus Winand’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEDZQtAHpX8">Modern SQL: A lot has changed since SQL-92</a>)</p>
<p>– Postgres is more valuable as a programming environment than you might think. (see R0ml Lefkowitz’s <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/01/24/the-image-of-postgres/">The Image of Postgres</a>)</p>
<p>As the patron saint of trailing edge technology it is my duty to explore what’s possible at the intersection of these two premises. The topic for this episode is Postgres functional style. Clearly what I’ve been doing with the combo of pl/python and pl/pgsql is very far from pure functional programming. The self-memoization technique shown in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/19/postgres-set-returning-functions-that-self-memoize-as-materialized-views/What%20I%20showed">episode 7</a> is all about mutating state (ed: this means writing stuff down somewhere). But it feels functional to me in the broader sense that I’m using functions to orchestrate behavior that’s expressed in terms of SQL queries.</p>
<p>To help explain what I mean, I’m going to unpack one of the Postgres functions in our library. </p>
 count_of_distinct_lms_students_from_to(_guid text, _from date, _to date)
 
<p>This is a function that accepts a school id (aka guid), a start date, and an end date. Its job is to:</p>
<p>– Find all the courses (groups) for that school (guid)</p>
<p>– Filter to those created between the start and end date</p>
<p>– Find all the users in the filtered set of courses</p>
<p>– Filter to just students (i.e. omit instructors)</p>
<p>– Remove duplicate students (i.e., who are in more than one course)</p>
<p>– Return the count of distinct students at the school who annotated in the date range</p>
<p>The production database doesn’t yet store things in ways friendly to this outcome, so doing all this requires some heavy lifting in the analytics data warehouse. Here’s the function that orchestrates that work.</p>
 create function count_of_distinct_lms_students_from_to(_guid text, _from date, _to date) 
  returns bigint as $$
  declare count bigint;
  begin
 1  -- all groups active for the guid in the date range
 2  with groups as (
 3    select pubid from groups_for_guid(_guid)
 4    where group_is_active_from_to(pubid, _from, _to)
 5  ),
 6  -- usernames in those groups
 7  usernames_by_course as (
 8    select
 9      pubid,
10      (users_in_group(pubid)).username 
11  from groups 
12  ),
13  -- filtered to just students
14  students_by_course as (
15    select * from usernames_by_course
16    where not is_instructor(username, pubid)
17  )
18  select 
19    count (distinct username) 
20  from students_by_course
    into count;
    return count;
  end;
$$ language plpgsql;
 
<p>If you think pl/pgsql is old and clunky, then you are welcome to do this in pl/python instead. There’s negligible difference between how they’re written and how fast they run. It’s the same chunk of SQL either way, and it exemplifies the functional style I’m about to describe. </p>
<p>Two kinds of chunking work together here: CTEs (aka common table expressions, aka WITH clauses) and functions. If you’ve not worked with SQL for a long time, as I hadn’t, then CTEs may be unfamiliar. I think of them as pipelines of table transformations in which each stage of the pipeline gets a name. In this example those names are groups (line 2), usernames_by_course (line 7), and students_by_course (line 14). </p>
<p>The pipeline phases aren’t functions that accept parameters, but I still think of them as being function-like in the sense that they encapsulate named chunks of behavior. The style I’ve settled into aims to make each phase of the pipeline responsible for a single idea (“groups active in the range”, “usernames in those groups”), and to express that idea in a short snippet of SQL. </p>
<p>As I’m developing one of these pipelines, I test each phase. To test the first phase, for example, I’d do this in psql or Metabase.</p>
 -- all groups active for the guid in the date range
with groups as (
  select pubid from groups_for_guid('8anU0QwbgC2Cq:canvas-lms')
  where group_is_active_from_to(pubid, '2021-01-01', '2021-05-01')
)
select * from groups;
 
<p>And I’d spot-check to make sure the selected groups for that school really are in the date range. Then I’d check the next phase.</p>
 -- all groups active for the guid in the date range
with groups as (
),
-- usernames in those groups
usernames_by_course as (
  select
    pubid,
    (users_in_group(pubid)).username 
  from groups 
)
select * from usernames_by_course;
 
<p>After another sanity check against these results, I’d continue to the next phase, and eventually arrive at the final result. It’s the same approach I take with regular expressions. I am unable to visualize everything that’s happening in a complex regex. But I can reason effectively about a pipeline of matches that occur in easier-to-understand named steps.</p>
<p>Ideally each phase in one of these pipelines requires just a handful of lines of code: few enough to fit within the 7 +- 2 limit of working memory. Postgres functions make that possible. Here are the functions used in this 20-line chunk of SQL.</p>
<p>– groups_for_guid(guid): Returns a table of course ids for a school.</p>
<p>– group_is_active_from_to(pubid, _from, _to): Returns true if the group was created in the range.</p>
<p>– users_in_group(pubid): Returns a table of user info for a course.</p>
<p>– is_instructor(username, pubid): Returns true if that user is an instructor.</p>
<p>Two of these, groups_for_guid and users_in_group, are set-returning functions. As noted in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/27/working-with-postgres-types/">Working with Postgres types</a>, they have the option of returning an explicit Postgres type defined elsewhere, or an implicit Postgres type defined inline. As it happens, both do the latter.</p>
 create or replace function groups_for_guid(_guid text)
  returns table(
    pubid text
  ) as $$
 
 create or replace function users_in_group (_pubid text)
  returns table (
    groupid text, 
    username text, 
    display_name text
  ) as $$
 
<p>The other two, group_is_active_from_to and is_instructor, return boolean values.</p>
<p>All this feels highly readable to me now, but the syntax of line 10 took quite a while to sink in. It helps me to look at what users_in_group(pubid) does in a SELECT context.</p>
 select * from users_in_group('4VzA92Yy')

groupid   | username    | display_name
----------+-------------+----------------
4VzA92Yy  | 39vA94AsQp  | Brendan Nadeau
 
<p>Here is an alternate way to write the usernames_by_course CTE at line 7.</p>
 -- usernames in those groups
usernames_by_course as (
  select
    g.pubid,
    u.username
from groups g 
join users_in_group(g.pubid) u on g.pubid = u.groupid
)
select * from usernames_by_course;
 
<p>Both do exactly the same thing in very close to the same amount of time. Having mixed the two styles I’m leaning toward the first, but you could go either way or both. What matters more is the mental leverage you wield when writing CTEs and functions together to compose pipelines of transformations, and that others wield when reading and debugging.</p>
<p>I hope I’ve made the case for writing and reading. There’s a case to be made for debugging too, but that’s another episode.</p>

To those impacted, T-mobile is offering a bandaid, a free&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mcafee.com/consumer/en-us/landing-page/direct/sem/mtp-family/desktop/brand-ad.html?csrc=google&amp;csrcl2=main-ad&amp;cctype=desktop-brand&amp;ccstype=&amp;ccoe=direct&amp;ccoel2=sem&amp;pkg_id=521&amp;affid=1485&amp;cid=238375&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=paidsearch&amp;utm_campaign=[EN-US][Search][Brand]%20Product%20Identity&amp;utm_content=[brand][exact]%20mcafee%20identity%20protection&amp;utm_term=mcafee%20identity%20protection&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwgviIBhBkEiwA10D2j--TK9X5qrO1R-yG_WAJ6T7DQBClC00w_FASFOljt-bhNtfpCOgVfRoCAuMQAvD_BwE">McAfee Identity Protection license</a>. Offering an identity protection monitoring service or similar bandaid following a breach is an industry-standard practice. The practice of offering the bandaid however provides little salve, what is even worse and unfortunate, as some action is better than nothing, is that most people don’t take advantage of it when it is offered<a href="http:/#fn1">1</a>.</p>
<p>Is T-Mobile’s offer a start? Yes. Is it enough? In my opinion, no. We need to do more. People worldwide are concerned for their privacy and data&nbsp;(Auxier et al., 2019; Langer et al., 2021); they have been for a long time&nbsp;(Warren &amp; Brandeis, 1890), and rightfully so as evidence by the fact that there have been more than 10,000 data breaches since 2005&nbsp;(2020 in Review&nbsp;Data Breach Report, 2021;&nbsp;“Data&nbsp;Breaches,”&nbsp;2021;&nbsp;U.S. Data Breaches and Exposed Records 2020, 2021)&nbsp;and 11.5 billion breached passwords have been recorded out in the wild&nbsp;(Haveibeenpwnd?, 2021). And, the problem is only going to get worse as we become more and more connected in the coming years, one estimate predicts that by 2025 people will be interacting with and leaking their identity and data to IoT devices 4,800 times a day, i.e.&nbsp;about every 3.3 seconds&nbsp;(Reinsel et al., 2017), and the ITRC predicts in 2021 we’ll experience the most data breaches ever in a single year; the good news is the number of people impacted will be lower than in previous years (“Data Breaches Are Up 38 Percent in Q2 2021; The ITRC Predicts a New All-Time High by Year’s End,” 2021).</p>
<p>People lack and want control over their physical and digital self (aka data)&nbsp;(DMA &amp; Acxiom, 2015). They want their privacy, they don’t know where to start, they lack the tools and education to manage their data&nbsp;(Babun et al., 2019;&nbsp;“Computer&nbsp;Services&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;The Harris Poll,”&nbsp;2019).</p>
 Identity Protection Services Is Not Enough: The Harms &amp; Costs Caused by a Data Breach 
<p>Identity protection services, like those being offered to the affected, can remind us that we have a problem, that the “Cows” have gotten out of the barn, but they don’t offer a solution. These services will tell someone that a personal attribute, e.g.&nbsp;an email address or social security or government ID number, has been found on the dark web. They rarely tell someone much more, e.g.&nbsp;how their data got leaked in the first place or any other meaningful, actionable insight<a href="http:/#fn2">2</a>. Moreover, they don’t address the emotional, time, economic, physical (inc. life), reputational, relationship, chilling effect, discrimination, thwarted expectations, control, data quality, informed choice, vulnerability, disturbance, autonomy, social, civic, and political harms that people may immediately experience following a breach or that may befall them years after a breach has occurred&nbsp;(Calo, 2010; Citron &amp; Solove, 2021), i.e.&nbsp;long after the identity protection monitoring service bandaid has dried up and fallen off.</p>
<p>The total cost of the potential immediate and long-term harm exposure from a breach far exceeds the $39.99/year value of the identity protection service bandaid. For many, it can take days, weeks, or even years to find out their data was compromised, and it can take many hundreds of hours and upwards of thousands of dollars to recover&nbsp;(“Data&nbsp;Breaches Are Up&nbsp;38&nbsp;Percent&nbsp;in&nbsp;Q22021;&nbsp;The ITRC Predicts&nbsp;a&nbsp;New All-Time High&nbsp;by&nbsp;Year’s&nbsp;End,”&nbsp;2021)&nbsp;from a severe breach or misuse of their data.</p>
<p>And so far we’ve just been talking about “material” past or current harms. What about future harm, i.e. lost opportunity? For example, the lost opportunity to buy a car or house, but you can’t because the breach trashed your credit score and you can’t get the inaccuracies removed. The FTC reported that 20% of people have at least one error in their credit report (Fiano, 2019). Or, the opportunity that can be gained by having control over one’s data (e.g. in the form a personal data store or personal information management system) and using it to learn about one’s self, to more efficiently navigate life, or even profit from one’s own records, attributes, labor, or capital data?</p>
 It’s time to give people a seat at the table 
<p>The elephant in the room, and one not taken nearly seriously enough, is that our personal data has value and this data and value should be in control of the data subject, i.e. the person that it relates to or is generated by. As the former EU commissioner Maglena Kuneva noted as far back as 2009,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Personal data is the new oil of the internet and the new currency of the digital world”&nbsp;“Meglena&nbsp;Kuneva&nbsp;–&nbsp;European Consumer Commissioner&nbsp;–&nbsp;Keynote Speech&nbsp;–&nbsp;Roundtable&nbsp;on&nbsp;Online Data Collection,&nbsp;Targeting&nbsp;and&nbsp;Profiling”&nbsp; Meglena&nbsp;Kuneva&nbsp;–&nbsp;European Consumer Commissioner&nbsp;–&nbsp;Keynote Speech&nbsp;–&nbsp;Roundtable&nbsp;on&nbsp;Online Data Collection,&nbsp;Targeting&nbsp;and&nbsp;Profiling”&nbsp;(2009).</p></blockquote>
<p>Why is it not addressed? Possibly, because the industry says people don’t care about their data? Or, we think regulations will take care of it. More likely, it is because it threatens the efficiency of existing operations and business models and that it is just not practical at scale today and is too hard to implement at this time (Pinarbasi &amp; Pavagadhi, 2020). In aggregate, people’s data is worth trillions of dollars. Corporations are taking the lion’s share of the benefits while individuals are left holding unmitigated risks.&nbsp;<a href="https://identitypraxis.com/the-identity-nexus/">The Identity Nexus</a>&nbsp;equation, the equilibrium state where benefit and risk is equally shared throughout society, is out of balance.</p>
<p>It is time we empower people and give them a share of the riches they are generating, which is worth far more than a free account, recommendation, or article they are getting today. It is time we get The Identity Nexus equation back into balance. Our privacy should not be a luxury good, as it is today. Today people are the entre being served up to industry, primarily in the form of marketing, risk mitigation, and people search&nbsp;(Dixon &amp; Gellman, 2014;&nbsp;“FTC&nbsp;to&nbsp;Study Data Broker Industry’s&nbsp;Collection&nbsp;and&nbsp;Use&nbsp;of&nbsp;Consumer Data,”&nbsp;2012). It is time we move them off the table, and give them a seat at the table. If we enable them to be active participants in the collection, management, and exchange of their data, the personal, civic, social, and commercial bounties will be plentiful. This is not an idea problem, nor a technology problem, it is an imagination and will problem. The ideas have been with us for decades&nbsp;(Bush, 1945; Laudon, 1996;&nbsp;Personal&nbsp;Data, 2011), and the technology is maturing at a breakneck pace. There are pockets of innovation happening today where people are working on putting people in control of their data, like&nbsp;<a href="https://mydata.org/">MyData</a>&nbsp;(see Langford et al. (2020) MyData operators report), the&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileecosystemforum.com/personal-data-identity/">Mobile Ecosystem Forum PD&amp;I working group</a>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshops</a>, and the many self-sovereign identity working groups at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/#:~:text=The%20mission%20of%20the%20Decentralized,requirements%20for%20DID%20Method%20specifications.">W3C Ddecentrailized Identity</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Trust over IP Foundation</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">The Good Health Pass Collaborative</a>&nbsp;(a group working on a self-sovereign COVID testing credential), to name just a few. The problem is, we’ve simply gotten too comfortable with the status quo and the collective we simply can’t imagine a different world.</p>
 We need systemic change. 
<blockquote><p>“We’re entering an age of personal big data, and its impact on our lives will surpass that of the Internet”&nbsp;(Maney, 2014).</p></blockquote>
<p>Being reminded that there is a problem is not enough to address the problem. We need to prevent harm, or at least mitigate it, before it occurs, as well as address other harms, i.e.&nbsp;the illicit and legal misuses or non-permitted use of our data, and the lost opportunity that people may realize from having cross-sector access and control of their data. In the end, the individual can be the only one that has a complete view of themselves&nbsp;(Brohman et al., 2003). We need to create opportunities for personal fulfillment. Identity protection is a start. But, what people need is control. Contracts, terms of service, and privacy policies are not enough.&nbsp;Regulation is not enough. Trust in commercial and non-commercial institutions to do “the right thing” is not enough. People need to be in a position where they can “trust but verify.”</p>
 Five-pillars of digital sovereignty for the phygital human 
<p>To control their digital self, people need a systematic framework to embrace the five pillars of digital sovereignty–awareness, intention &amp; behavior, insurance, rights, and technology–all of which rests on education. People need education to understand the problem, to know how and when to use the utilities and services, and how and when to take specific actions that suit their personal circumstances, their context. Moreover, regarding rights, they need regulation that recognizes privacy harm, not just privacy law&nbsp;(Gilliland, 2019).</p>
<p>As an industry, we should not just be offering bandaids; we should be providing a suite of convenient, unobtrusive, passive and active, value-generating utilities, services and education (aka privacy-enhancing technologies and personal identity management capabilities) that help people take back control of their data, their digital self. We need to put in the time to build exceptional customer experience, user experience, and contextually relevant content.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Content is King, but Context is God”&nbsp;(Vaynerchuk, 2017)</p></blockquote>
<p>We live in a connected digital age. We have become phygital beings (physical + digital). Today, for many, the digital part of us has more personal, social, and economic value than the physical self. It is time for people to have control of what matters most–their digital self, alongside their physical self. We need to be whole again.</p>

 Bernard (2020)&nbsp;reported that only 1 in 10 Americans took advantage of the settlement offered following the 2017 Equifax data breach that impacted 147 million Americans. 
 The reality is that due to the prevalence of data sharing and exchange and the sheer number of data breaches tracked insect 2005, it is nearly impossible to track the original source of breached data. It is estimated that there have been well over 10,000 data breaches since 2005&nbsp;(2020 in Review&nbsp;Data Breach Report, 2021;&nbsp;“Data&nbsp;Breaches,”&nbsp;2021;&nbsp;U.S. Data Breaches and Exposed Records 2020, 2021). And, according to the ITRC, 2021 is on track to be a record year for data breaches. The number of breaches in Q2 2021 was up 38 percent over Q1 2021. For the year, the H1 2021 breaches account for 76 percent of the 2020 totals. The good news, however, is the total number of people impact in 2021 is going down&nbsp;(“Data&nbsp;Breaches Are Up&nbsp;38&nbsp;Percent&nbsp;in&nbsp;Q2&nbsp;2021;&nbsp;The ITRC Predicts&nbsp;a&nbsp;New All-Time High&nbsp;by&nbsp;Year’s&nbsp;End,”&nbsp;2021)

<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/24/pl-pgsql-versus-pl-python-heres-why-im-using-both-to-write-postgres-functions/">episode 2</a> I mentioned three aspects of pl/python that are reasons to use it instead of pl/pgsql: access to Python modules, metaprogramming, and introspection. In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/13/pl-python-metaprogramming/">episode 5</a> I discussed metaprogramming, by which I mean using pl/python to compose and run SQL code. This episode features introspection, by which I mean taking advantage of Python’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#module-inspect">inspect</a> module to enable a pl/python function to discover its own name. </p>
<p>Why do that? In this context, so that the function can create a materialized view by joining its own name with the value of its first parameter. Here’s the example from episode 5. </p>
 questions_and_answers_for_group(_group_id text)
  returns setof question_and_answer_for_group as $$
  from plpython_helpers import (
    exists_group_view,
    get_caller_name,
    memoize_view_name
  )
  base_view_name = get_caller_name()
  view_name = f'{base_view_name}_{_group_id}'
  if exists_group_view(plpy, view_name):
    sql = f""" select * from {view_name} """
  else:
    sql = f"""
    -- SQL THAT RETURNS A SETOF QUESTION_AND_ANSWER_FOR_GROUP
    """
    memoize_view_name(sql, view_name)
    sql = f""" select * from {view_name} """
  return plpy.execute(sql)
$$ language plpython3u;
 
<p>The function drives a panel on the course dashboard. An initial call to, say, questions_and_answers_for_group('P1mQaEEp'), creates the materialized view questions_and_answers_for_group_p1mqaeep and returns SELECT * from the view. Subsequent calls skip creating the view and just return SELECT * from it. </p>
<p>Note that the even though the group name is mixed case; the view name created by Postgres is all lowercase. For example:</p>
 create materialized view test_AbC as (select 'ok') with data;
SELECT 1

\d test_AbC
Materialized view "public.test_abc"
 
<p>I want to think of this as a form of capability injection, but it’s really more like a capability wrapper. The capability is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">memoization</a>. A function endowed with it can run a SQL query and cache the resulting rows in a materialized view before returning them to a SQL SELECT context. The wrapper is boilerplate code that discovers the function’s name, checks for the existence of a corresponding view, and if it isn’t found, calls memoize_view_name(sql, view_name) to run an arbitrary chunk of SQL code whose result set matches the function’s type. So in short: this pattern wraps memoization around a set-returning pl/python function.</p>
<p>As noted in episode 5, although memoize_view_name is called from pl/python, it is not itself a pl/python function. It’s a normal Python function in a module that’s accessible to the instance of Python that the Postgres pl/python extension is using. In my case that module is just a few small functions in file called plpython_helpers.py, installed (cough, copied) to user postgres‘s ~/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/plpython_helpers.py.</p>
<p>So far, there are only two critical functions in that module: get_caller_name() and memoize_view_name.</p>
<p>Here is get_caller_name().</p>
 import re
base_view_name = inspect.stack()[1][3].replace('__plpython_procedure_', '')
return re.sub(r'_\d+$', '', base_view_name)
 
<p>The internal name for a pl/python function created by CREATE FUNCTION foo() looks like __plpython_procedure_foo_981048462. What get_caller_name() returns is just foo.</p>
<p>Here’s memoize_view_name().</p>
 def memoize_view_name(sql, view_name):
  sql = sql.replace('\n', ' ')
  encoded_bytes = base64.b64encode(sql.encode('utf-8'))
  encoded_str = str(encoded_bytes, 'utf-8')
  cmd = f"""psql -d h_analytics -c "call memoizer('{encoded_str}', '{view_name}')" """
  result = os.system(cmd)
  print(f'memoize_view_name: {cmd} result: {result}')
 
<p>Given a chunk of SQL and the name of a view, it converts newlines to spaces, base64-encodes the query text, and invokes psql to call a procedure, memoizer, that does the work of running the SQL query and creating the materialized view from those results. So for example the function that yields <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/05/the-tao-of-unicode-sparklines/">sparkline</a> data for a school might look like sparkline_data_for_school('af513ee'), and produce the view sparkline_data_for_school_af513ee.</p>
<p>Why shell out to psql here? It may not be necessary, there may be a way to manage the transaction directly within the function, but if so I haven’t found it. I’m very far from being an expert on transaction semantics and will appreciate guidance here if anyone cares to offer it. Meanwhile, this technique seems to work well. memoizer is a Postgres procedure, not a function. Although “stored procedures” is the term that I’ve always associated with in-database programming, I went pretty far down this path using only CREATE FUNCTION, never CREATE PROCEDURE. When I eventually went there I found the distinction between functions and procedures to be a bit slippery. This <a href="https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/2357/what-are-the-differences-between-stored-procedures-and-stored-functions">StackOverflow answer</a> matches what I’ve observed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PostgreSQL 11 added stored procedures as a new schema object. You can create a new procedure by using the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createprocedure.html"><code>CREATE PROCEDURE</code></a> statement.</p>
<p>Stored procedures differ from functions in the following ways:</p>
 
 
<p>Stored procedures do not have to return anything, and only return a single row when using <code>INOUT</code> parameters.</p>
 
 
<p>You can commit and rollback transactions inside stored procedures, but not in functions.</p>
 
 
<p>You execute a stored procedure using the <code>CALL</code> statement rather than a <code>SELECT</code> statement.</p>
 
 
<p>Unlike functions, procedures cannot be nested in other DDL commands (<code>SELECT</code>, <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, <code>DELETE</code>).</p>
 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Here is the memoizer procedure. It happens to be written in pl/python but could as easily have been written in pl/pgsql using the built-in Postgres decode function. Procedures, like functions, can be written in either language (or others) and share the <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/27/working-with-postgres-types/">common Postgres type system</a>.</p>
 create procedure memoizer(_sql text, _view_name text) as $$
  import base64
  decoded_bytes = base64.b64decode(_sql)
  decoded_str = str(decoded_bytes, 'utf-8')
  create = f"""
    create materialized view if not exists {_view_name} as (
      {decoded_str}
    ) with data;
    """
  plpy.execute(create)
  permit = f"""
    grant select on {_view_name} to analytics;
  """
  plpy.execute(permit)
$$ language plpython3u;
 
<p>There’s no plpy.commit() here because psql takes care of that automatically. Eventually I wrote other procedures, some of which do their own committing, but that isn’t needed here. </p>
<p>Of course it’s only possible to shell out to psql from a function because pl/python is an “untrusted” language extension. Recall from <a>episode 1</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The ability to wield any of Python’s built-in or loadable modules inside Postgres brings great power. That entails great responsibility, as the Python extension is “untrusted” (that’s the ‘u’ in ‘plpython3u’) and can do anything Python can do on the host system: read and write files, make network requests.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Using Python’s os.system() to invoke psql is another of those superpowers. It’s not something I do lightly, and if there’s a better/safer way I’m all ears.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this approach is delivering much value. We have two main dashboards, each of which displays a dozen or so panels. The school dashboard reports on annotation activity across all courses at a school. The course dashboard reports on the documents, and selections within documents, that instructors and students are discussing in the course’s annotation layer. Each panel that appears on the school or course dashboard is the output of a memoized function that is parameterized by a school or course id. </p>
<p>The data warehouse runs on a 24-hour cycle. Within that cycle, the first call to a memoized function takes just as long as it takes to run the SQL wrapped by the function. The cached view only comes into play when the function is called again during the same cycle. That can happen in a few different ways.</p>
<p>– A user reloads a dashboard, or a second user loads it.</p>
<p>– A panel expands or refines the results of another panel. For example, questions_and_answers_for_group() provides a foundation for a family of related functions including:</p>
<p>– questions_asked_by_teacher_answered_by_student()</p>
<p>– questions_asked_by_student_answered_by_teacher()</p>
<p>– questions_asked_by_student_answered_by_student()</p>
<p>– A scheduled job invokes a function in order to cache its results before any user asks for them. For example, the time required to cache panels for school dashboards varies a lot. For schools with many active courses it can take minutes to run those queries, so preemptive memoization matters a lot. For schools with fewer active courses it’s OK to memoize on the fly. This method enables flexible cache policy. Across schools we can decide how many of the most-active ones to cache. Within a school, we can decide which courses to cache, e.g. most recent, or most active. The mechanism to display a dashboard panel is always the same function call. The caching done in support of that function is highly configurable.</p>
<p>Caches, of course, must be purged. Since these materialized views depend on core tables it was enough, early on, to do this for views depending on the annotation table.</p>
<p>drop table annotation cascade;</p>
<p>At a certain point, with a growing number of views built during each cycle, the cascade failed.</p>
 ERROR:  out of shared memory
HINT:  You might need to increase max_locks_per_transaction.
 
<p>That wasn’t the answer. Instead we switched to enumerating views and dropping them individually. Again that afforded great flexibility. We can scan the names in the pg_matviews system table and match all the memoized views, or just those for a subset of schools, or just particular panels on school or course dashboards. Policies that govern the purging of cached views can be as flexible as those that govern their creation.</p>

<p>My parents (that’s them, Eleanor and Allen Searls) were married on 17 August 1946, seventy-five years and two days ago. I would have posted something then, but I was busy—though not too busy to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/docsearls/posts/10157908630421573">drop something</a> in Facebook, where much of the readership for this blog, plus the writership of others listed in my <a href="http://weblog.searls.com/">old blogroll</a>, has drifted in the Age of Social Media. Alas, blogging is less social than Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=list+of+all+chat+apps">chatterteriat</a>. But that doesn’t stop me from blogging anyway.</p>
<p>The wedding took place in&nbsp;Minneapolis, for the convenience of Mom’s family of second and third generation Swedish members of the homesteading diaspora, scattered then around Minnesota, North Dakota and Wisconsin. Pop was from New Jersey, and all his immediate kin were there and in New York. After the wedding the couple came east to briefly occupy the home they rented in North Bergen, New Jersey while mostly hanging at Grandma Searls’ house in Fort Lee (where Pop grew up with his two sisters), and then a short drive west of there in Maywood, where Jan and I grew up. I was born less than a year later, and my sister Jan less than two years after that.</p>
<p>In a comment under my Facebook post, Jan writes,</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157627459328424">Mom</a> from ND and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157627459297180">Pop</a> from NJ met in <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/424260609/in/album-72157600005052861/">Alaska</a> in the middle of WWII. He’d already served in the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157626063363207">Costal Artillery</a> in the early 30s but after D-Day came home to join up. They courted by mail after the war while he was with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Headquarters_Allied_Expeditionary_Force">SHAEFE (he loved that acronym: Supreme HQ Allied Expeditionary Forces Europe)</a>, and Mom <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/424261085/in/album-72157627459328424/">with the Red Cross</a> at a Naval Hospital in Oregon. When he got home, she flew to NJ for 6 days of courtship – at a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157626246795005">small shack</a> at the NJ shore with Pop’s entire family! He came to MN the night before the wedding. They fell in love with the dream of having a family and future together, and always said they really fell in love with each other on their honeymoon and were devoted to each other. Mom was 33, Pop was 38, and they’d already lived lives of adventure, full of friends and family. We grew up knowing were blessed to have them as our parents.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve added links. The Shack is still there, by the way.</p>
<p>Alas, Mom passed in ’03 and Pop in ’79. But they were exceptionally fine parents and grandparents. Not all kids are so lucky.</p>
<p>So, a belated toast, in pixels.</p>

<p>To be a mobile marketer is to be a marketer.</p>
<p>Mobile is table stakes to marketers, as evidenced by the ubiquitous adoption of mobile devices and services throughout the world in every aspect of our lives. As a marketer, it is important to remember that mobile is not used just for commercial activities; it is used throughout every facet of our lives. We use our mobile devices for everything, from work, play, social, banking, shopping, sex, taxes, death, and religion. No industry, no company, no relationship is immune to mobile. Mobile contributes nearly $4.4 trillion to the world’s GDP&nbsp;(The&nbsp;Mobile Economy&nbsp;2021, 2021). Mobile plays a role in every customer experience and journey; what&nbsp;Julie Ask (2014)&nbsp;considers micro-moments. With mobile, people are connected, and it is important to recognize that the connected individual is the media, is the point-of-sale display. The connected individual is the future of your business. You must learn to be of service to the connected individual and eventually engage them on their terms (more on this later).</p>
 By the Numbers 
<p>The numbers are clear. There are,</p>
 
 5.22 billion unique mobile users (66% of the global population&nbsp;(Kemp et al., 2021), which is estimated to grow to 5.7 billion by 2025&nbsp;(The&nbsp;Mobile Economy&nbsp;2021, 2021). 
 The mobile device is the great unifying digital platform across all racial groups, at least in the U.S.&nbsp;(Atske &amp; Perrin, 2021). 
 8.02 billion mobile connections (yes, many of us have more than one mobile device)&nbsp;(Kemp et al., 2021), which is predicted to grow to 8.8 billion by 2025&nbsp;(The&nbsp;Mobile Economy&nbsp;2021, 2021), and if you take connected devices (devices without a direct mobile network connection) into account the theoretical connections map goes even higher, 24 billion by 2025&nbsp;(The&nbsp;Mobile Economy&nbsp;2021, 2021). 
 Time spent online and in mobile apps is going through the roof; the average person worldwide spends 6h 54m a day on the Internet, 4h 10m a day in mobile apps&nbsp;(Kemp et al., 2021). 
 As of Oct.&nbsp;2020, mobile device market share (aka web traffic) exceeds desktop computers, today mobile accounts for 55.7% of web traffic compared to 41.5% for desktops and 2.73% for tablets&nbsp;(“Desktop Vs&nbsp;Mobile&nbsp;Vs&nbsp;Tablet Market Share Worldwide,”&nbsp;2021). 
 Mobile accounts for 31% of retail e-commerce sales in the U.S.&nbsp;(Coppola, 2021) 
 
<p>We could list stat after stat, but the story will be the same. Mobile, connectivity, is here, and it is not going anywhere.</p>
 Three Favorite Resources 
<p>I was asked were by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stukent.com/">Stukent</a>,“What are your three top favorite mobile marketing resources?”&nbsp;Sidebar: I’m a co-author of Mobile Marketing Essentials&nbsp;(Hanley et al., 2021).</p>
<p>This is a difficult question to answer, not because I don’t have favorite resources, but because of all of the follow-up questions that come to mind. Resources for what? Understanding the people and their sentiments, needs, wants, and desires? Understanding the connected individual’s behavior? Understanding a specific market sector? Understanding the latest and greatest technologies, where they’ve been, where they are, and where they’re going? Understanding and influencing change on organizational leadership, structure and management? Steps for building out and executing on a multi-channel comms matrix? Methods for measurement and tracking? Estimates for building out a mobile presence—web, apps, messaging? Different engagement tactics at each step along the customer journey? Strategies for mobile enhancing physical media? Understanding the regulatory front and what’s going to happen to all the data to which we’ve become so addicted to, Remember, people are connected, they are concerned, and they want control of their data. Pretty soon, you’ll be accessing data on the connected individual’s terms, not yours. By 2023, per a Gartner prediction, 65% of the world’s population will be protected by modern privacy legislation, that’s up from 10% in 2020&nbsp;(“Gartner&nbsp;Says By&nbsp;2023, 65% of the&nbsp;World’s&nbsp;Population Will Have Its Personal Data Covered Under Modern Privacy Regulations,”&nbsp;2020).</p>
<p>To be an exceptional mobile marketer is to be a polymath. You must be able to look at and evaluate the market and serve your customers through these five lenses—technology, economics, law and regulation, culture, and politics—if you are going to effectively serve people, at scale, and on their terms.</p>
<p>As for what my favorite resources are, rather than pointing specifically to three specific resources, I’d prefer to suggest three resource categories:</p>
 
 The people you serve, the people you serve, are your greatest and most important resource. You must do everything in your power to understand them and fulfill their needs. Keep in mind, as the tools of surveillance capitalism are pulled apart&nbsp;(Zuboff, 2019), it will be even more important for you to find ways to build direct, trusted, bi-directional channels of communications. Your customer database will become your most valued asset. 
 Government and non-governmental organizations, governments, non-governmental organizations, agencies, media properties, and schools (trade groups, sector analysts, consumer advocates, think-tanks/fact tanks, like the PEW Research Center&nbsp;(“Pew&nbsp;Research Center,”&nbsp;2021)&nbsp;or Chiefmartc&nbsp;(“Chief&nbsp;Marketing Technologist&nbsp;–&nbsp;Marketing Technology Management,”&nbsp;2021), and working professors and libraries, etc.) are an invaluable treasure-trove of specific and directional consumer and market insight that you can tap into, often for free. 
 MarTech vendors, vendors provide insights on how to engage the connected (mobile) individual by providing blogs, research, and reports. Yes, they’re there to sell you their services, so you need to be careful and try to read through the hyperbole at times, but if you want to learn about a mobile channel, engage the vendor. Get your hands dirty, subscribe to a free trial of their service. Read their reports. Attend their webinars. Build a relationship with them. 
 
<p>We live in a connected world; consequently, mobile, regardless of the form factor and medium— smartphone, tablet, watch, earbud, voice, email, SMS, OTT message, etc.— is here to stay.</p>

Whilst having a CDO, doing data science, having analytics, using artificial intelligence, testing data quality, and a world class data governance structure make a difference; true transformation will remain a struggle if the structural issues remain.</p><p>The question is how do we, as a CDO, test the fitness of our organisation's preparedness for data.&nbsp; If the results are acceptable to the leadership team is one of politics and is way beyond&nbsp; the scope of this article.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To test the fitness of your organisation's preparedness for data, it is worth looking at four areas. Is there a preparedness plan? How they put data to work today. Organizational Capability, and finally Culture.</p><p>Is there a preparedness plan?</p><p>This is really simple, ask the CEO if there is a preparedness plan. If there is, ask for a copy of it and review it with the framing of data. If there is not one, probably best to ask why not.&nbsp; There may be one, but check the data of publication (issue), and if it does not address all the areas of responsibility that come under the CDO,&nbsp; you need to flag that it needs work.</p><p>How they put data to work today.</p><p>Does the company equally value “<a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2021/04/what-superpowers-does-cdo-need.html">small data</a>” as well as big data and data science? Does it hold small data with the same level of importance and priority as big data. Small data is also termed <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/what-superpowers-does-a-cdo-need-7f7361a1f20">thick data</a>.&nbsp; It is small in size but has depth of insights.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The media attention on data science makes it appear far easier than it is. You need to determine if this organisation is based on data science from social media posts or on data science from the commitment of time and resources.&nbsp; It is worth investigating if there is built-in structural animosity between the data science teams which are invested in driving change, and the rest of the business , which is driven by KPI and incentives.&nbsp; Where do the teams sit and how are they bridged?</p><p>Lastly review past management and board papers and recommendations to determine if there is <a href="https://opengovernance.net/updating-board-paper-for-a-data-attestation-section-db59d736ccc5">attestation of data</a> or if the blind are leading the blind.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Organizational Capability</p><p>A company’s organisation is supposed, amongst other things, to make it possible for people to do their work, with control in place to ensure they are doing the right work. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/organizational-capabilities-dr-hisham-salah/">Organisational capability</a> can be a major hurdle when it comes to making data work, as divisions are often organised to optimise for different objectives.&nbsp;</p><p>There are numerous issues including management’s confusion and conflation of data, technology, data silos, and the lack of clear responsibility around data roles. When there is a lack of skilled data architects, data engineers, and data quality professionals the organisation just does not have the capability or structure.&nbsp;</p><p>All regular readers of this column know that I often verbally fight against leaders who opine that <a href="https://opengovernance.net/data-is-data-90ba0b803178">data is the new oil</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/why-framing-data-as-an-asset-or-liability-is-dangerous-fbce0342e66d">preach that data is an asset</a>, and demand <a href="https://www.digital20.com/masterclass">data-driven decisions</a> - as they don’t have a clue. The reality for most employees is that “data” to them is just another thing they need in order to do their jobs. Companies don’t sort out ways to create value from data as they don’t teach people how to use it to make better decisions. (<a href="https://www.digital20.com/masterclass">my masterclass does)&nbsp;</a></p><p>Organisation changes needed to address the structural issues are the responsibility of a company’s senior leadership. Yet most leaders appear to be sitting on the sidelines, perhaps fearful themselves or unsure of what to do and waiting for McKinsey, Deloitte, Accenture, PWC, BCG or one of the other global consulting firms to give them an answer.&nbsp; This is want you are seeking to determine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Culture</p><p>The implications for all those interested in advancing data for better decisions are profound. Culture is often cited as the biggest barrier to progress with data, I will argue and my analysis confirms it, that it is in fact <a href="https://opengovernance.net/data-for-better-decisions-nature-or-nurture-79e6531dbe3a">ontology</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/cdo-day-0-the-many-faces-of-evidence-56ca92430e36">epistemology</a> that holds companies back.&nbsp; The questions to ask the organisation is, “Is there a top level ontology?” and “How do we know what we know is true”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>Note to the CEO</p><p>“Testing the fitness of your organisation's preparedness for data”is one of the most important jobs you will delegate.&nbsp; When interviewing for your next CDO, ask them the question “how would they test this organisation for preparedness?” &nbsp; There is no point in asking about their data expertise and capability, they would not be sat in front of you if they were not top of their game. &nbsp; How will they address the politics and policies based on their review.&nbsp; The point here is that if you like their smooth approach, they are likely the wrong person as you will just get more compromises and not the action focussed delivery required to become that data company you desire.&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>Whilst our ongoing agile iteration into <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-occurs-when-physical-beings-transition-to-information-beings-146ea9dcbca3">information beings</a> is never-ending, there are the first 100 days in the new role.

  <p>Summary:      Most of the activities IT performs aren't strategic. Like clean sheets, they're important, but not differentiating. How do you determine what's strategic? Evaluate the domains of your business.</p>



<p>
    Suppose you're in the hotel business. One of the things you have to do is make sure customers have clean sheets. If you don't change the sheets or launder them properly, you're probably not going to stay in business long. The bad news is that clean sheets are expensive and they don't differentiate you very much—all your competitors have clean sheets. You're stuck. 
</p>

<p>
    Consider the following graph plotting the cost of any given business decision against the competitive advantage it brings:
</p>


	<a></a>
	Feature Cost vs Differentiation (click to enlarge)


<p>
    To the right in this diagram are the things we'd call strategic, representing features or practices that differentiate the organization from its competitors. The bottom half of the diagram contains the things that are relatively less expensive. Clearly if you're making a decision on what features to implement, you want to be in the lower right quadrant: low cost and high differentiation. Do those first. 
</p>

<p>
    The red quadrant seems like the last place you'd look for features, or is it? Think about clean sheets. As I noted earlier, clean sheets cost a lot of money and everyone has them, so there's not much competitive advantage in having them. But there's a huge competitive disadvantage if you don't. No one can do without clean sheets. Businesses are filled with things like clean sheets. For IT, things like availability, security, networks, and deployment are all clean sheets.  Doing these well can differentiate you from those who don't, but they're not strategic. You still need a strategy.
</p>

<p>
    How can you discover the things that really matter? I'm a fan of domain driven design. Domain driven design is a tool for looking at the various domains your business is engaged in and then determining which are core (differentiating), supporting, or merely generic. The things you identify as core are strategic—places you can differentiate yourself. This helps because now you know where to build and where to buy. Generic domains aren't unimportant (think HR or finance, for example), they're simply not strategic. And therefore buying those features is likely going to give you high availability and feature fit for far less money than doing it yourself. 
</p>

<p>
    On the other hand, domains that are core are the places you differentiate yourself. When you look at your organization's values, mission, and objectives, the core domains ought to directly support them. If you outsource these, then anyone else can do what you're doing. Core, strategic activities are places where it makes sense to build rather than buy. Spend your time and resources there. But don't neglect the sheets. 
</p>

<p>The NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders and the NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders.TagHelpers Nuget packages are added to the csproj file of the web application. The tag helpers are added to use the nonce from the CSP in the Razor Pages.</p>


  &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
	&lt;PackageReference 
		Include="NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders" 
		Version="0.16.0" /&gt;
	&lt;PackageReference 
		Include="NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders.TagHelpers" 
		Version="0.16.0" /&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
  


<p>What each header protects against is explained really good on the <a href="https://securityheaders.com/">securityheaders.com</a> results view of your test. You can click different links of each validation which takes you to the documentation of each header. The links at the bottom of this post provide some excellent information about what and why of the headers.</p>



<p>The security header definitions are added using the HeaderPolicyCollection class. I added this to a separate class to keep the Startup class small, where the middleware is added. I passed a boolean parameter into the method which is used to add or remove the HSTS header. We might not want to add this to local development and block all non HTTPS requests to localhost. </p>



<p>The policy defined in this demo is for Razor Page applications with as much blocked as possible. You should be able to re-use this in your projects.</p>



<p>The COOP (Cross Origin Opener Policy), COEP (Cross Origin Embedder Policy), CORP (Cross Origin Resource Policy) headers are relatively new. You might need to update you existing application deployments with these. The links at the bottom of the post provide information about these headers in detail and I would recommend reading these.</p>


  public static HeaderPolicyCollection GetHeaderPolicyCollection(bool isDev)
{
	var policy = new HeaderPolicyCollection()
		.AddFrameOptionsDeny()
		.AddXssProtectionBlock()
		.AddContentTypeOptionsNoSniff()
		.AddReferrerPolicyStrictOriginWhenCrossOrigin()
		.RemoveServerHeader()
		.AddCrossOriginOpenerPolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.SameOrigin();
		})
		.AddCrossOriginEmbedderPolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.RequireCorp();
		})
		.AddCrossOriginResourcePolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.SameOrigin();
		})
		.AddContentSecurityPolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.AddObjectSrc().None();
			builder.AddBlockAllMixedContent();
			builder.AddImgSrc().Self().From("data:");
			builder.AddFormAction().Self();
			builder.AddFontSrc().Self();
			builder.AddStyleSrc().Self(); // .UnsafeInline();
			builder.AddBaseUri().Self();
			builder.AddScriptSrc().UnsafeInline().WithNonce();
			builder.AddFrameAncestors().None();
		})
		.RemoveServerHeader()
		.AddPermissionsPolicy(builder =&gt;
		{
			builder.AddAccelerometer().None();
			builder.AddAutoplay().None();
			builder.AddCamera().None();
			builder.AddEncryptedMedia().None();
			builder.AddFullscreen().All();
			builder.AddGeolocation().None();
			builder.AddGyroscope().None();
			builder.AddMagnetometer().None();
			builder.AddMicrophone().None();
			builder.AddMidi().None();
			builder.AddPayment().None();
			builder.AddPictureInPicture().None();
			builder.AddSyncXHR().None();
			builder.AddUsb().None();
		});

	if (!isDev)
	{
		// maxage = one year in seconds
		policy.AddStrictTransportSecurityMaxAgeIncludeSubDomains(maxAgeInSeconds: 60 * 60 * 24 * 365);
	}

	return policy;
}
  


<p>In the Startup class, the UseSecurityHeaders method is used to apply the HTTP headers policy and add the middleware to the application. The env.IsDevelopment() is used to add or not to add the HSTS header. The default HSTS middleware from the ASP.NET Core templates was removed from the Configure method as this is not required. </p>


  public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
	if (env.IsDevelopment())
	{
		app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
	}
	else
	{
		app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
	}

	app.UseSecurityHeaders(
		SecurityHeadersDefinitions
			.GetHeaderPolicyCollection(env.IsDevelopment()));
  


<p>The server header can be removed in the program class if using Kestrel. If using IIS, you probably need to use the web.config to remove this.</p>


  public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =&gt;
	Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
		.ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =&gt;
		{
			webBuilder
				.ConfigureKestrel(options =&gt; 
					options.AddServerHeader = false)
				.UseStartup&lt;Startup&gt;();
		});
  


<p>We want to apply the CSP nonce to all our scripts in the Razor Pages. We can add the NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders namespace to the _ViewImports.cshtml file.</p>


  @using AspNetCoreRazor
@using NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders
@namespace AspNetCoreRazor.Pages
@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers

  


<p>In the Razor Page _Layout, the CSP nonce can be used. I had to get the nonce from the HttpContext and add this to all scripts. This way, the scripts will be loaded. If the nonce does not match or is not applied to the script, it will not be loaded due to the CSP definition. I’ll ping Andrew Lock to see if the tag helper could be used directly.</p>


      @{var nonce = Context.GetNonce();}
    &lt;script src="~/lib/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js" nonce="@nonce"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="~/lib/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" nonce="@nonce"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="~/js/site.js" asp-append-version="true" nonce="@nonce"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

    @await RenderSectionAsync("Scripts", required: false)
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

  


<p>The Http security headers can be tested using <a href="https://securityheaders.com">https://securityheaders.com </a></p>



<p>I used ngrok to test this before I deployed the application. The Security headers scans the web application and returns a really neat summary to what headers you have and how good it finds them. Each header has a link to a excellent documentation, blog on <a href="https://twitter.com/Scott_Helme">Scott Helme</a>‘s website <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk">https://scotthelme.co.uk</a></p>







<p>The CSP can be tested using the <a href="https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com">https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com</a> from google. The CSP evaluator gives an excellent summary and also suggestions how to improve the CSP.</p>







<p>The Razor Page application security can be much improved by added the headers to the application. The  <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders">NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders</a> Nuget package makes it incredibly easy to apply this. I will create a follow up blog with a policy definition for a Blazor application and also a for an Web API application. </p>



<p>Notes:</p>



<p>If the application is fully protected without any public views, the follow redirects checkbox on the security headers needs to be disabled as then you only get the results of the identity provider used to authenticate. </p>



<p>I block all traffic, if possible, which is not from my domain including sub domains. If implementing enterprise applications, I would always do this. If implementing public facing applications with high traffic volumes or need extra fast response times, or need to reduce the costs of hosting, then CDNs would need to be used, allowed and so on. Try to block all first and open up as required and maybe you can avoid some nasty surprises from all the Javascript, CSS frameworks used.</p>

<p>The Web is a haystack.</p>
<p>This isn’t what <a href="https://customercommons.org/a-new-way/">Tim Berners-Lee</a> had in mind when he invented the Web. Nor is it what Jerry Yang and David Filo had in mind when they invented&nbsp;<a href="https://money.cnn.com/gallery/technology/2015/03/03/yahoo-20-years-hits-flops/10.html">Jerry and David’s Guide to the World Wide Web</a>, which later became&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!">Yahoo</a>. Jerry and David’s model for the Web was a library, and Yahoo was to be catalog for it. This made sense, given the prevailing conceptual frames for the Web at the time:&nbsp;real estate and publishing. Both are still with us today. We frame the Web as real estate when we speak of “sites” with “locations” in “domains” with “addresses” you can “visit” and “browse” through stuff called “files” and “pages,” which we “author,” “edit,” “post,” “publish,” “syndicate” and store in “folders” within a “directory.” Both frames suggest durability, if not permanence. Again, kind of like a library.</p>
<p>But once we added personal movement (“surf,” “browse”) and a vehicle for it (the browser), the Web became a World Wide Free-for-all. Literally. Anyone could publish, change and remove whatever they pleased, whenever they pleased. The same went for organizations of every kind, all over the world. And everyone with a browser could find their way to and through all of those spaces and places, and enjoy whatever “content” publishers chose to put there. Thus the Web grew into billions of sites, pages, images, databases, videos, and other stuff, with most of it changing constantly.</p>
<p>The result was a heaving heap of fuck-all.*</p>
<p>How big is it? According to <a href="https://www.worldwidewebsize.com/">WorldWebSize.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://google.com">Google</a>&nbsp;currently indexes about 41 billion pages, and&nbsp;<a href="https://bing.com">Bing</a>&nbsp;about 9 billion. They also peaked together at about 68 billion pages in late 2019. The Web is surely larger than that, but that’s the practical limit because search engines are the practical way to find pieces of straw in that thing. Will the haystack be less of one when approached by other search engines, such as the new <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/opinion/sway-kara-swisher-sridhar-ramaswamy.html?showTranscript=1">ad-less</a> (subscription-funded)&nbsp;<a href="https://neeva.com/">Neeva</a>? Nope. Search engines do not give the Web a card catalog. They certify its nature as a haystack.</p>
<p>So that’s one practical limit. There are others, but they’re hard to see when the level of optionality on the Web is almost indescribably vast. But we can see a few limits by asking some questions:</p>
 
 Why do you always have to accept websites’ terms? And why do you have no record of your own of what you accepted, or when‚ or anything? 
 Why do you have no way to proffer your own terms, to which websites can agree? 
 Why did <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">Do Not Track</a>, which was never more than a polite request not to be tracked off a website, get no respect from 99.x% of the world’s websites? And how the hell did Do Not Track turn into the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2011/tracking-protection/drafts/tracking-dnt.html">Tracking Preference Expression</a> at the W2C, where the standard never did get fully baked? 
 Why, after Do Not Track failed, did hundreds of millions—or <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2019/03/23/2billion/">perhaps billions</a>—of people start blocking ads, tracking or both, on the Web, amounting to <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2015/09/28/beyond-ad-blocking-the-biggest-boycott-in-human-history/">the biggest boycott in world history</a>? And then why did the advertising world, including nearly all advertisers, their agents, and their dependents in publishing, treat this as a problem rather than a clear and gigantic message from the marketplace? 
 Why are the choices presented to you by websites called&nbsp;your choices, when all those choices are provided by&nbsp;them? And why don’t you give them choices? 
 Why would <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2021/05/29/apple-vs-or-plus-adtech/">Apple’s way of making you private on your phone</a> be to “Ask App Not to Track,” rather than “Tell App Not to Track,” or “Prevent App From Tracking You”? 
 Why does the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a> call people “data subjects” rather than people, or human beings, and then assign the roles “data controller” and “data processor” only to other parties?* 
 Why are nearly all the 200+million results in <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gdpr+compliance">a search for GDPR+compliance</a> about how companies can obey the letter of the law while violating its spirit by continuing to track people through the giant loophole you see in every cookie notice? 
 Why does the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act">CCPA</a> give you the right to ask to have back personal data others have gathered about you on the Web, rather than forbid its collection in the first place? (Imagine a law that assumes that all farmers’ horses are gone from their barns, but gives those farmers a right to demand horses back from those who took them. It’s kinda like that.) 
 Why, 22 years after <a href="http://cluetrain.com">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a> said, we are not seats or eyeballs or end users or consumers. we are human beings and our reach exceeds your grasp. deal with it. —is that statement still not true? 
 Why, 9 years after Harvard Business Review Press published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527">The Intention Economy: When Customers Take Charge</a>, has that not happened? (Really, what are you in charge of in the marketplace that isn’t inside companies’ silos and platforms?) 
 
<p>It’s easy to blame&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">the cookie</a>, which&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Montulli">Lou Montulli</a> invented in 1994 as a way for sites to remember their visitors by planting reminder files—cookies—in visitors’ browsers. Cookies also gave visitors a way to remember where they were when they last visited. For sites that require logins, cookies take care of that as well.</p>
<p>What matters, however, is not the cookie. It’s what makes the cookie necessary in the first place: the Web’s architecture. It’s called&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model">client-server</a>, and is represented graphically like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model"></a></p>
<p>This architecture was born in the era of centralized mainframes, which “users” accessed through client devices called “dumb terminals”:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-dcom/9781449307011/ch01s01.html"></a></p>
<p>On the Web, as it was in the old mainframe world, we clients—mere users—are as subordinate to servers as are cattle to ranchers or slaves to masters. In the client-server paradigm, our agency—our ability to act with effect in the world—is restricted to what servers allow or provide for us. Our choices are what they provide. We are independent only to the degree that we can also be clients to other servers. In this paradigm, a free market is “your choice of captor.”</p>
<p>Want privacy? You have to ask for it. And, if you go to the trouble of doing that—which you have to do separately with every site and service you encounter (each a mainframe of its own)—your client doesn’t keep a record of what you “agreed” to. The server does. Good luck finding whatever it is the server or its third parties remember about that agreement.</p>
<p>Want to control how your data (or data about you) gets processed by the servers of the world? Good luck with that too. Again, Europe’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a> says “natural persons” are just “data subjects,” while “data controllers” and “data processors” are roles reserved for servers.</p>
<p>Want a shopping cart of your own to take from site to site? My wife asked for that in 1995. It’s still barely thinkable in 2021. Want a dashboard for your life where you can gather all your expenses, investments, property records, health information, calendars, contacts, and other personal information? She asked for that too, and we still don’t have it, except to the degree that large server operators (e.g. Google, Apple, Microsoft) give us pieces of it, hosted in their clouds, and rigged to keep you captive to their systems.</p>
<p>That’s why we don’t yet have an Internet of Things (IoT), but rather an Apple of Things, a Google of Things, and an Amazon of Things.</p>
<p>Is it possible to do stuff on the Web that isn’t client-server? Perhaps some techies among us can provide examples, but practically speaking, here’s what matters:&nbsp;If it’s not thinkable by the owners of the servers we depend on, it doesn’t get made.</p>
<p>From our position at the bottom of the Web’s haystack, it’s hard to imagine there might be a world where it’s possible for us to have full agency: to not be just users of clients enslaved to as many servers as we deal with every day.</p>
<p>But that world exists. It’s called the Internet, and it can support a helluva lot more than the Web, with many ways to interact other than those possible in the client-server world alone.</p>
<p>Digital technology as we know it has only been around for a few decades, and the Internet for maybe half that time. Mobile computers that run apps and presume connectivity everywhere have only been with us for a decade or less. And all of those will be with us for many decades, centuries, or millennia to come. We are not going to stop living digital lives, any more than we are going to stop speaking, writing, or using mathematics. Digital technology and the Internet are granted wishes that won’t go back into the genie’s bottle.</p>
<p>So yes, the Web is wonderful, but not boundlessly so. It has limits. Thanks to the client-server architecture that prevails there, full personal agency is not a grace of life on the Web. For the thirty-plus years of the Web’s existence, and for its foreseeable future, we will&nbsp;never have more agency than its servers allow clients and users.</p>
<p>It’s time to think and build outside the haystack. Models for that do exist, and some have been around a long time.</p>
<p>Email, for example. While you can look at your email on the Web, or use a Web-based email service (such as Gmail), email itself is independent of those. My own&nbsp;<a href="http://searls.com" title="http://searls. ">searls.com</a> email has been at servers in my home, on racks elsewhere, and in a hired cloud. I can move it anywhere I want. You can move yours as well. All the services I hire to host my email are substitutable. That’s just one way we can enjoy full agency on the Internet.</p>
<p>My own work outside the Web is currently happening at <a href="http://customercommons.org">Customer Commons</a>, on what we call the <a href="https://customercommons.org/a-new-way/">Byway</a>. Go there and follow along as we work to toward better answers to the questions above than you’ll get from inside the haystack.</p>
 
<p>*I originally had “heaving haystack of fuck-all” here, but some remember it as the more alliterative “heaving heap of fuck-all.” So I decided to swap them. If comments actually worked here, I’d ask for a vote. But feel free to write me instead, at first name at last name dot com.</p>

<p>One of the compelling aspects of <a href="https://modern-sql.com/">modern SQL</a> is the JSON support built into modern engines, including Postgres. The <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/functions-json.html">documentation</a> is well done, but I need examples to motivate my understanding of where and how and why to use such a capability. The one I’ll use in this episode is something I call document hotspots.</p>
<p>Suppose a teacher has asked her students to annotate Arthur Miller’s The Crucible. How can she find the most heavily-annotated passages? They’re visible in the Hypothesis client, of course, but may be sparsely distributed. She can scroll through the 154-page PDF document to find the hotspots, but it will be helpful to see a report that brings them together. Let’s do that.</p>
<p>The Hypothesis system stores annotations using a blend of SQL and JSON datatypes. Consider this sample annotation:</p>
<p></p>
<p>When the Hypothesis client creates that annotation it sends a JSON payload to the server. Likewise, when the client subsequently requests the annotation in order to anchor it to the document, it receives a similar JSON payload.</p>

<p>The server mostly shreds this JSON into conventional SQL types. The tags array, for example, is hoisted out of the JSON into a SQL array-of-text. The expression to find its length is a conventional Postgres idiom: array_length(tags,1). Note the second parameter; array_length(tags) is an error, because Postgres arrays can be multidimensional. In this case there’s only one dimension but it’s still necessary to specify that.</p>
<p>A target_selectors column, though, is retained as JSON. These selectors define how an annotation anchors to a target selection in a document. Because selectors are used only by the Hypothesis client, which creates and consumes them in JSON format, there’s no reason to shred them into separate columns. In normal operation, selectors don’t need to be related to core tables. They can live in the database as opaque blobs of JSON.</p>
<p>For some analytic queries, though, it is necessary to peer into those blobs and relate their contents to core tables. There’s a parallel set of functions for working with JSON. For example, the target_selectors column corresponds to the target[0]['selector'] array in the JSON representation. The expression to find the length of that array is jsonb_array_length(target_selectors).</p>
<p>Here’s a similar expression that won’t work: json_array_length(target_selectors). Postgres complains that the function doesn’t exist.</p>
 ERROR: function json_array_length(jsonb) does not exist 
Hint: No function matches the given name and argument types.
 
<p>In fact both functions, json_array_length and jsonb_array_length, exist. But Postgres knows the target_selectors column is of type jsonb, not json which is the correct type for the json_array_length function. What’s the difference between json and jsonb?</p>
<blockquote><p>The json and jsonb data types accept almost identical sets of values as input. The major practical difference is one of efficiency. The json data type stores an exact copy of the input text, which processing functions must reparse on each execution; while jsonb data is stored in a decomposed binary format that makes it slightly slower to input due to added conversion overhead, but significantly faster to process, since no reparsing is needed. jsonb also supports indexing, which can be a significant advantage.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/datatype-json.html">https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/datatype-json.html</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Although I tend to use JSON to refer to data in a variety of contexts, the flavor of JSON in the Postgres queries, views, and functions I’ll discuss will always be jsonb. The input conversion overhead isn’t a problem for analytics work that happens in a data warehouse, and the indexing support is a tremendous enabler.</p>
<p>To illustrate some of the operators common to json and jsonb, here is a query that captures the target_selectors column from the sample annotation.</p>
 with example as (
  select 
    id,
    target_selectors as selectors
  from annotation
  where id = '54b52170-fd7e-11eb-879f-931b9c6809d3'
  )
  select * from example;
 
<p></p>
<p>Here are some other queries against example</p>
 select selectors from example;

[{"end": 44483, "type": "TextPositionSelector", "start": 44392}, { ... } ]
 
<p>The result is a human-readable representation, but the type of selectors is jsonb.</p>
 select pg_typeof(selectors) from example;

jsonb
 
<p>The array-indexing operator, -&gt;, can yield the zeroth element of the array.</p>
 select selectors-&gt;0 from example;

{"end": 44483, "type": "TextPositionSelector", "start": 44392}
 
<p>The result is again a human-readable representation of a jsonb type.</p>
 select pg_typeof(selectors-&gt;0) from example;

jsonb
 
<p>Another array-indexing operator, -&gt;&gt;, can also yield the zeroth element of the array, but now as type text.</p>
 select selectors-&gt;&gt;0 from example;

{"end": 44483, "type": "TextPositionSelector", "start": 44392}
 
<p>The result looks the same, but the type is different.</p>
 select pg_typeof(selectors-&gt;&gt;0) from example;

text
 
<p>The -&gt; and -&gt;&gt; operators can also index objects by their keys. These examples work with the object that is the zeroth element of the array.</p>
 select selectors-&gt;0-&gt;'type' from example;

"TextPositionSelector"

select pg_typeof(selectors-&gt;0-&gt;'type') from example;

jsonb

select selectors-&gt;0-&gt;&gt;'type' from example;

TextPositionSelector

select pg_typeof(selectors-&gt;0-&gt;&gt;'type') from example;

text
 
<p>The Hypothesis system stores the location of a target (i.e, the selection in a document to which an annotation refers) in the target_selectors column we’ve been exploring. It records <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#selectors">selectors</a>. TextQuoteSelector represents the selection as the exact highlighted text bracketed by snippets of context. TextPositionSelector represents it as a pair of numbers that mark the beginning and end of the selection. When one range formed by that numeric pair is equal to another, it means two students have annotated the same selection. When a range contains another range, it means one student annotated the containing range, and another student made an overlapping annotation on the contained range. We can use these facts to surface hotspots where annotations overlap exactly or in nested fashion.</p>
<p>To start, let’s have a function to extract the start/end range from an annotation. In a conventional programming language you might iterate through the selectors in the target_selectors array looking for the one with the type TextPositionSelector. That’s possible in pl/pgsql and pl/python, but Postgres affords a more SQL-oriented approach. Given a JSON array, the function jsonb_array_elements returns a table-like object with rows corresponding to array elements.</p>
 select jsonb_array_elements(selectors) from example;

{"end": 44483, "type": "TextPositionSelector", "start": 44392}
{"type": "TextQuoteSelector", "exact": " am not some preaching farmer with a book under my arm; I am a graduate of Harvard College.", "prefix": " sixty-six pound, Mr. Proctor! I", "suffix": " Giles: Aye, and well instructed"}
 
<p>A function can convert the array to rows, select the row of interest, select the start and end values from the row, package the pair of numbers as an array, and return the array.</p>
 create function position_from_anno(_id uuid) returns numeric[] as $$
  declare range numeric[];
  begin
    with selectors as (
      select jsonb_array_elements(target_selectors) as selector
      from annotation
      where id = _id
    ),
    position as (
      select
        selector-&gt;&gt;'start'::numeric as startpos,
        selector-&gt;&gt;'end'::numeric as endpos
      from selectors
      where selector-&gt;&gt;'type' = 'TextPositionSelector'
    )
    select array[p.startpos, p.endpos] 
    from position p
    into range;
    return range;
  end;  
$$ language plpgsql;
 
<p>Using it for the sample annotation:</p>
 select position_from_anno('54b52170-fd7e-11eb-879f-931b9c6809d3')

position_from_anno
------------------
{44392,44483}
 
<p>I’ll show how to use position_from_anno to find document hotspots in a later episode. The goal here is just to introduce an example, and to illustrate a few of the JSON functions and operators.</p>
<p>What’s most interesting, I think, is this part.</p>
<p>where selector-&gt;&gt;'type' = 'TextPositionSelector'</p>
<p>Although the TextPositionSelector appears as the first element of the selectors array, that isn’t guaranteed. In a conventional language you’d have to walk through the array looking for it. SQL affords a declarative way to find an element in a JSON array.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2012/02/what-is-sovereign-source-authority.html">Self-Sovereign Rights</a>, And The Function of USER:ID In Rights &amp; Derivative Laws For Mankind.</p><p>People never required a definition of the word "People" until recently. A Governed Civil Society constituted "of, by, for" people, seems obvious in its implications for design, interpretation, and amendment procedures. But apparently, this is not the case. The data structure of participation in a "Governed Civil Society" is very dependent on some baseline, foundational accuracies about the source origin of "Sovereign Rights".</p><p>This is not optional anymore. People, being organized as "People" and written into databases, contracts, and Governed State Trusts, represented as both paper &amp; digital artifacts, have become abstractions representing the original source authority required for the accurate processing of Sovereign authority. As these abstractions, written into documents via non-computational languages with historic precedent, become the priority mission for resolving "Civil Rights" in any Governed system designed "of, by, for" people, or "people", it is critical that the structure intended and inferred by language, become operational in the data structure that yields precedent in the real world where all Sovereign Rights matter. Rights are for people after all, not birth certificates.</p><p>Blood, mud, local community.. this is the home of Sovereign Rights. There is no alternative. It may seem as though digital technology is creating a new "metaverse" where new laws of nature are possible. Everything, as it will become obvious to understand in time, is made of data, and even emits data endlessly unto non-existence. People, you are the context. You are the reason data is being discovered, valued, harvested, manipulated, controlled, inspected, regulated, judicially reviewed, and entrepreneured in all the myriad ways possible to do, commercial, civic, social, health, education... the list is endless in time.</p><p>One thing never changes. One thing stays consistent. One thing matters for the sake of Humanity.</p><p>People own root authority, locally. Systems derived "of, by, for" people have a design constraint, and requirement for operational integrity. Words come and go, literature makes perfect what life makes real. You, an Individual person, are the only "people" that will ever actually exist. "We The People" may be a literary abstraction of reality, and it may be translated by a legal abstraction in time, but at the design and intent root level of it's meaning, "We The People" refers only to local people, in the real world, Individuals all.</p><p>That is the structural requirement. Our masses, our ability to coordinate as "We", or be perceived as "They", to form teams, to collaborate and build more perfect unions.. all of us, as Individuals, living among one another.. this is the only accurate structure of Sovereign Rights that are accurate to the design intent within a civil society derived "of, by, for" people, Individuals all.</p><p>Equality is a starting point of civil society. An accurate data structure yields accurate results in the hands of people. Individuals choose their path to happiness. Individuals choose to express their liberty. Individuals live life. Individuals are the only people alive on this planet, and at the data structure start of a Governed Civil System, all people are equal. Thats accurate law, thats accurate data structure.</p><p>Systems do not possess people. Systems are derived of, by for people. This is accurate fact. All formats of artificial intelligence known to mankind are derived from people, for people. Any data structure routine that runs counter to this accurate fact violates basic structural rights that people possess, as Individuals. Governments exist to enforce those Rights of, by for people, Individuals all.</p><p>In the year 2020++, there is great structural confusion about these words. One day, people will read these words and see them clearly. Clearly, they carry meaning. Clearly, they carry intent. All Human Rights are self-Sovereign in origin of authority, and this ultimate human authority is always locally expressed by Individuals. All limited liability structures derived by the consent of the people Governing Civil Society, and operationally participating in the accurate design of "Civil Society', are responsible for the return of value to the people, of, by, for and from which they emit. Any legal abstraction that removes the Sovereign Rights of people from "people" commits a crime of fraud on the people who civil society is "of, by, for", and their treatment under the derived Law of their Sovereign consent must transact "accurate authority" for people.</p><p>Currently, upon entering a unique relationship with Governed civil society via a USER:ID, discoverable within any IAM ID Management system in the world, and in use by Government processes to transact the Rights and permissions of citizens in their local purview, the data structure of your participation becomes "legal" and inaccurate. Governments, deriving their consent from the Governed, may design any data structure they wish in time. All Governments are to be held accountable for the accurate abstraction of human Rights and laws derived of, by for the people who produce it's authority of consent. People, Individuals All, is the only living reality.</p><p>Self-Sovereign Rights represent this accurate data structure of Governed Civil Society, whereby USER:ID is utilized to confer Rights Administration capabilities upon a populace of contextual people operating with local authority as Individual citizens, and non-citizen people with innate self-Sovereign Human Rights. A Nation such as America could not come into existence by any other data structure, and history itself serves as the ultimate precedent for establishing an operational context used in the very interpretation of Constitutional literature.</p><p>Working Groups, operating within non-governmental organizations or non-profit public benefit charities, exist as a layered dependency of such Governed systems. Their work is derived by the consent of the people, Individuals all, and as such, the accurate translation of their efforts is directly accountable to the accurate data structure outcomes of their local jurisdictional translations. America is not Europe, California is not New York. People, Individuals All, Always Local, Always Root Authority.</p><p>Data structure in a computational society Governed accurately "of, by, for" people requires local consent in all transactions and derived uses. The concept of an "open society" and a "secured society" can only co-exist if people are accurately represented. Otherwise, exploitation is the default condition of participation. Evidence can be found in the identity theft data, where babies with a social security number occupy a precarious artifact condition in a society construed as "Governed" and "Civil" as the #1 risk vector and systemic victim. The produced results of the current data structure of people in THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA is a travesty currently, and does not reflect the accurate data structure of the American people. An <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2021/07/recursive-signatory.html">error of omission</a> sits at the base of the stack affecting how Rights and Laws are translated, and conditioned as necessary.</p><p>People, Individuals All, operationally accurate as a data structure derived of, by for self-Sovereign human authority, expressed locally by people. This is the goal of work groups; consent receipts are an example of such work. Their accurate translation of contextual jurisdictional meaning will only be possible with a starting foundation of accurate self-Sovereign Rights, expressed by people locally. Systems must conform to reality.&nbsp;</p><p>People pursue lives of happiness, liberty, life... for people, in the real world, not as "people" abstractions required to conform to system designs that are computationally inaccurate. Data structures yield operational results. People own root authority in civil systems. It is not optional. Inaccuracy is unconstitutional, literally and operationally.</p><p>The Supreme Court is required to translate the meaning of the Law of THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, but has no self-comprehension of the inaccuracies present within the data structure of its jurisdictional authority. Systems don't think, systems don't innovate, systems don't iterate, amend, or get human intent correct in their design. People do, Individuals do, teams of Individuals do. Local people are the Self-Sovereign Rights holders and creators of Governed Civil Society, and in the absence of their accurate participation using an accurate data structure for expressing their human and civil Rights under Laws derived "of, by, for" their consent... well, welcome to 2020++ .. enjoy the loop.</p><p>An accurate operational data structure is a pre-requirement for the accurate translation of Sovereign Rights, Laws, and permissions administered in a civil system. All corporations and corporate systems are derived via the Governed process of Rights, Laws and permissions within a designed civil system, and the accurate translations of Laws affects the limitation of liability and expression of benefits for people within any and all local jurisdictions.</p><p>In short, until the data structure of the world is accurately represented in the Governed Civil Systems where USER:ID confers operational meaning to people, any civil system claiming to be derived "of, by, for" people is currently non-compliant, and unconstitutional in operational design. Self-Sovereign Rights are the origin of Governed Civil Systems derived "of, by, for" people, Individuals all.&nbsp;</p><p>Data structure yields operational results.. people own root.</p><p>I repeat, People, Individuals All, own root authority in any/all "Civil Systems" of Rights/Law administration.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/24/pl-pgsql-versus-pl-python-heres-why-im-using-both-to-write-postgres-functions/">episode 2</a> I mentioned three aspects of pl/python that are reasons to use it instead of pl/pgsql: access to Python modules, metaprogramming, and introspection.</p>
<p>Although this episode focuses on metaprogramming — by which I mean using Python to dynamically compose and run SQL queries — my favorite example combines all three aspects.</p>
<p>The context for the example is an analytics dashboard with a dozen panels, each driven by a pl/plython function that’s parameterized by the id of a school or a course. So, for example, the Questions and Answers panel on the course dashboard is driven by a function, questions_and_answers_for_group(group_id), which wraps a SQL query that:</p>
<p>– calls another pl/python function, questions_for_group(group_id), to find notes in the group that contain question marks</p>
<p>– finds the replies to those notes</p>
<p>– builds a table that summarizes the question/answer pairs</p>
<p>Here’s the SQL wrapped by the questions_and_answers_for_group(group_id) function.</p>
 sql = f"""
  with questions as ( 
    select *
    from questions_for_group('{_group_id}')
    ),
  ids_and_refs as (
    select 
      id,
      unnest ("references") as ref
      from annotation
      where groupid = '{_group_id}'
  ),
  combined as (
    select
      q.*,
      array_agg(ir.id) as reply_ids
    from ids_and_refs ir
    inner join questions q on q.id = ir.ref
    group by q.id, q.url, q.title, q.questioner, q.question, q.quote
  ),
  unnested as (
    select
      c.url,
      c.title,
      c.quote,
      c.questioner,
      c.question,
      unnest(reply_ids) as reply_id
    from combined c
  )
  select distinct
    course_for_group('{_group_id}') as course,
    teacher_for_group('{_group_id}') as teacher,
    clean_url(u.url) as url,
    u.title,
    u.quote,
    u.questioner,
    (regexp_matches(u.question, '.+\?'))[1] as question,
    display_name_from_anno(u.reply_id) as answerer,
    text_from_anno(u.reply_id) as answer,
    app_host() || '/course/render_questions_and_answers/{_group_id}' as viewer
  from unnested u
  order by course, teacher, url, title, questioner, question
 
<p>This isn’t yet what I mean by pl/python metaprogramming. You could as easily wrap this SQL code in a pl/pgsql function. More easily, in fact, because in pl/pgsql you could just write _group_id instead of '{_group_id}'.</p>
<p>To get where we’re going, let’s zoom out and look at the whole questions_and_and_answer_for_group(group_id) function.</p>
 questions_and_answers_for_group(_group_id text)
  returns setof question_and_answer_for_group as $$
  from plpython_helpers import (
    exists_group_view,
    get_caller_name,
    memoize_view_name
  )
  base_view_name = get_caller_name()
  view_name = f'{base_view_name}_{_group_id}'
  if exists_group_view(plpy, view_name):
    sql = f""" select * from {view_name} """
  else:
    sql = f"""
    &lt;SEE ABOVE&gt;
    """
    memoize_view_name(sql, view_name)
    sql = f""" select * from {view_name} """
  return plpy.execute(sql)
$$ language plpython3u;
 
<p>This still isn’t what I mean by metaprogramming. It introduces introspection — this is a pl/python function that discovers its own name and works with an eponymous materialized view — but that’s for a later episode.</p>
<p>It also introduces the use of Python modules by pl/python functions. A key thing to note here is that this is an example of what I call a memoizing function. When called it looks for a materialized view that captures the results of the SQL query shown above. If yes, it only needs to use a simple SELECT to return the cached result. If no, it calls memoize_view_name to run the underlying query and cache it in a materialized view that the next call to questions_and_answers_for_group(group_id) will use in a simple SELECT. Note that memoize_view_name is a special function that isn’t defined in Postgres using CREATE FUNCTION foo() like a normal pl/python function. Instead it’s defined using def foo() in a Python module called plpython_helpers. The functions there can do things — like create materialized views — that pl/python functions can’t. More about that in another episode.</p>
<p>The focus in this episode is metaprogramming, which is used in this example to roll up the results of multiple calls to questions_and_answers_for_group(group_id). That happens when the group_id refers to a course that has sections. If you’re teaching the course and you’ve got students in a dozen sections, you don’t want to look at a dozen dashboards; you’d much rather see everything on the primary course dashboard.</p>
<p>Here’s the function that does that consolidation.</p>
 create function consolidated_questions_and_answers_for_group(group_id text)
  returns setof question_and_answer_for_group as $$
  from plpython_helpers import (
    get_caller_name,
    sql_for_consolidated_and_memoized_function_for_group
  )
  base_view_name = get_caller_name()
  sql = sql_for_consolidated_and_memoized_function_for_group(
    plpy, base_view_name, 'questions_and_answers_for_group', _group_id)
  sql += ' order by course, url, title, questioner, answerer'
  return plpy.execute(sql)
$$ language plpython3u;
 
<p>This pl/python function not only memoizes its results as above, it also consolidates results for all sections of a course. The memoization happens here.</p>
 def sql_for_consolidated_and_memoized_function_for_group(plpy, 
    base_view_name, function, group_id):
  view_name = f'{base_view_name}_{group_id}'
  sql = f""" select exists_view('{view_name}') as exists """
  exists = row_zero_value_for_colname(plpy, sql, 'exists')
  if exists:
    sql = f""" select * from {view_name} """
  else:
    sql = consolidator_for_group_as_sql(plpy, group_id, function)
    memoize_view_name(sql, view_name)
    sql = f""" select * from {view_name} """
  return sql
 
<p>The consolidation happens here, and this is finally what I think of as classical metaprogramming: using Python to compose SQL.</p>
 def consolidator_for_group_as_sql(plpy, _group_id, _function):
  sql = f"select type_for_group('{_group_id}') as type"
  type = row_zero_value_for_colname(plpy, sql, 'type')
  if type == 'section_group' or type == 'none':
    sql = f"select * from {_function}('{_group_id}')"
  if type == 'course_group' or type == 'course':
    sql = f"select has_sections('{_group_id}')"
    has_sections = row_zero_value_for_colname(plpy, sql, 'has_sections')
    if has_sections:
      sql = f"""
        select array_agg(group_id) as group_ids 
        from sections_for_course('{_group_id}')
      """
      group_ids = row_zero_value_for_colname(plpy, sql, 'group_ids')
      selects = [f"select * from {_function}('{_group_id}') "]
      for group_id in group_ids:
        selects.append(f"select * from {_function}('{group_id}')")
      sql = ' union '.join(selects)
    else:
      sql = f"select * from {_function}('{_group_id}')"
  return sql

 
<p>If the inbound _groupid is p1mqaeep, the inbound _function is questions_and_answers_for_group, and the group has no sections, the SQL will just be select * from questions_and_answers_for_group('p1mqaeep').</p>
<p>If the group does have sections, then the SQL will instead look like this:</p>
 select * from questions_and_answers_for_group('p1mqaeep')
union 
select * from questions_and_answers_for_group('x7fe93ba')
union
select * from questions_and_answers_for_group('qz9a4b3d')
 
<p>This is a very long-winded way of saying that pl/python is an effective way to compose and run arbitarily complex SQL code. In theory you could do the same thing using pl/pgsql, in practice it would be insane to try. I’ve entangled the example with other aspects — modules, introspection — because that’s the real situation. pl/python’s maximal power emerges from the interplay of all three aspects. That said, it’s a fantastic way to extend Postgres with user-defined functions that compose and run SQL code.</p>

    Right now, in your current situation, you are asked to or informed to, undertake or perform certain actions.&nbsp; When these instructions and activities align with your natural instinct it is easy.&nbsp; When there is a lack of alignment we know that there are tensions, contradictions, conflicts and compromises created.&nbsp; Often these creep up on us, where one small thing leads to another until the snowball is in full avalanche mode.&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>When you feel that comfort blanket of alignment, you should use the peak paradox framework to look for paradoxes, because you are aligned.&nbsp; It does not mean everyone is aligned or you are doing the right thing, but it feels easy.&nbsp; The sense of natural alignment is a conformational bias that is hard to fight, but it is time to focus on where paradoxes can exist.</p><p>When that comfort blanket is missing and we are in the open white waters of turmoil, the Peak Pardox framework is designated to unpack where and from who and what decision means you feel destructive tensions,&nbsp; unresolvable conflicts and compromised.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><br><p>The framework will help us <a href="https://opengovernance.net/choice-decision-making-and-judgment-is-your-relationship-constructive-or-destructive-c0e3b076e0a6">make (better) choices, decisions and judgement</a> to resolve those stresses, either by moving/ “walking” to a different place or through communication and understanding.&nbsp; It provides a passage where you can find a place to live with tensions we understand, conflicts we can manage and compromises we are prepared to live with.&nbsp; The framework will not eradicate anything, it helps us explain and unpack; as we all face the same paradoxes with our <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/">own perceptions.&nbsp;</a></p><p>The Importance of Tension</p><p>Creative tension, along with pressure created from constraints and “healthy” stress as we aim for our Northstar enables us to perform (better).&nbsp; Indeed <a href="https://www.cgi.org.uk/knowledge/research/the-conflict-and-tension-in-the-boardroom-report">creative tension in the boardroom is healthy</a> and leads to wider considerations, that improve decision-making leading to better outcomes.&nbsp; A lack of creative tension, say as a result of too much power, compliance or consensus; creates conflicts, unhelpful tension, stress and individual compromises; which all lead to poor outcomes.</p><p>Finding the right balance is in part about leadership but also governance, oversight and the role of a chairperson.&nbsp; As explored in previous <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/questions-to-help-frame-your-own-paradoxes">posts</a>, <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/exploring-why-voting-for-change-difficult-using-the-peak-paradox-framework">decisions at peak paradox are never good</a>, because everyone has compromised and there is a lack of leadership.&nbsp; It is because of this that “direction” is critical to find that place where we can align on decisions but equally have tension to ensure we are doing the right things, but don’t have to go back to basics at every meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This is a super article on “<a href="https://knowledge.insead.edu/leadership-organisations/how-the-afterglow-of-victory-boosts-future-performance-17111">How the Afterglow of Victory Boosts Future Performance</a>” by <a href="https://www.insead.edu/faculty-research/faculty/miguel-sousa-lobo">Miguel Sousa Lobo</a>, INSEAD Associate Professor of Decision Sciences.

  <p>Summary:      Many of the relationships we have online don’t have to be long-lived. Ephemeral relationships, offering virtual anonymity, are technically possible without a loss of functionality or convenience. Why don’t they exist? Surveillance is profitable.</p>



<p>
    In real life, we often interact with others—both people and institutions—with relative anonymity. For example, if I go the store and use cash to buy a coke there is no exchange of identity information. Even if I use a credit card it's rarely the case that the entire transaction happens under the administrative authority of the identity system inherent in the credit card. Only the financial part of the transaction takes place in that identity system. This is true of most interactions in real life.
</p>

<p>
    I don't have an account at the local grocery store where I store my address, credit card, and other information so that each transaction is linked to a record about me. True, many businesses have loyalty programs and use those to collect information about customers, but those are optional. And going without one doesn't significantly inconvenience me. In fact, the point of the credit card system is that it avoids long-lived relationships between any of the parties except the customer (or merchant) and their bank. 
</p>

<p>
    In real life, we do without identity systems for most things. You don't have to identify yourself to the movie theater to watch a movie or log into some administrative system to sit in a restaurant and have a private conversation with friends. In real life, we act as embodied, independent agents. Our physical presence and the laws of physics have a lot to do with our ability to function with workable anonymity across many domains.
</p>

<p>
    One of the surprising things about identity in the physical world is that so many of the relationships are ephemeral rather than long-lived. While the ticket taker at the movies and the server at the restaurant certainly "identify" patrons, they forget them as soon as the transaction is complete. And the identification is likely pseudonymous (e.g. "the couple at table four" rather than "Phillip and Lynne Windley"). These interactions are effectively anonymous. 
</p>

<p>
    Of course, in the digital world, very few meaningful transactions are done outside of some administrative identity system. There are <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/05/life-like_anonymity_and_the_poison_web.shtml#anonymity">several reasons why identity is so important in the digital world</a>. But we've accepted long-lived relationships with full legibility of patrons as the default on the web. 
</p>

<p>
    Some of that is driven by convenience. I like storing my credit cards and shipping info at Amazon because it's convenient. I like that they know what books I've bought so I don't buy the same book more than once (yeah, I'm that guy). But what if I could get that convenience without any kind of account at Amazon at all? That's the promise of verifiable credentials and self-sovereign identity. 
</p>

<p>
    You can imagine an ecommerce company that keeps no payment or address information on customers, but is still able to process their orders and send the merchandise. If my shipping information and credit card information are stored as verifiable credentials in a digital wallet I control, I can easily provide these to whatever web site I need to as needed. No need to have them stored. And we <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2009/04/ill_send_you_a_card_information_cards_in_the_wild.shtml">demonstrated way back in 2009 a way to augment results from a web site with a self-sovereign data store</a>. That could tell me what I already own as I navigate a site.
</p>

<p>
    There's no technical reason we need long-lived relationships for most of our web interactions. That doesn't mean we won't want some for convenience, but they ought to be optional, like the loyalty program at the supermarket, rather than required for service. Our digital lives can be as private as our physical lives if we choose for them to be. We don't have to allow companies to surveil us. And the excuse that they surveil us to provide better service is just that—an excuse. The real reason they surveil us is because it's profitable.

<p>This article shows how to use Microsoft Graph API to send emails for a .NET Core Desktop WPF application. Microsoft.Identity.Client is used to authenticate using an Azure App registration with the required delegated scopes for the Graph API. The emails can be sent with text or html bodies and also with any file attachments uploaded in the WPF application.</p>



<p>Code:  <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/EmailCalandarsClient">https://github.com/damienbod/EmailCalandarsClient</a></p>



<p>To send emails using Microsoft Graph API, you need to have an office license for the Azure Active Directory user which sends the email.</p>



<p>You can sign-in here to check this:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.office.com">https://www.office.com</a></p>



<p>Setup the Azure App Registration</p>



<p>Before we can send emails using Microsoft Graph API, we need to create an Azure App registration with the correct delegated scopes. In our example, the URI <a href="http://localhost:65419">http://localhost:65419</a> is used for the AAD redirect to the browser opened by the WPF application and this is added to the authentication configuration.  Once created, the client ID of the Azure App registration is used in the app settings in the application as well as the tenant ID and the scopes.</p>







<p>You need to add the required scopes for the Graph API to send emails. These are delegated permissions, which can be accessed using the Add a permission menu.</p>







<p>The Mail.Send and the Mail.ReadWrite delegated scopes from the Microsoft Graph API are added to the Azure App registration.</p>







<p>To add these, scroll down through the items in the App a permission, Microsoft Graph API delegated scopes menu, check the checkboxes for the Mail.Send and the Mail.ReadWrite.</p>







<p>Desktop Application</p>



<p>The Microsoft.Identity.Client and the Microsoft.Identity.Web.MicrosoftGraphBeta Nuget packages are used to authenticate and use the Graph API. You probably could use the Graph API Nuget packages directly instead of  Microsoft.Identity.Web.MicrosoftGraphBeta, I used this since I normally do web and it has everything required.</p>


  &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
  &lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Identity.Client" Version="4.35.1" /&gt;
  &lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Identity.Web.MicrosoftGraphBeta" Version="1.15.2" /&gt;
  &lt;PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="13.0.1" /&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
  


<p>The PublicClientApplicationBuilder class is used to define the redirect URL which matches the URL from the Azure App registration. The TokenCacheHelper class is the same as from the Microsoft examples.</p>


  public void InitClient()
{
  _app = PublicClientApplicationBuilder.Create(ClientId)
            .WithAuthority(Authority)
            .WithRedirectUri("http://localhost:65419")
            .Build();

  TokenCacheHelper.EnableSerialization(_app.UserTokenCache);
}
  


<p>The identity can authentication using the SignIn method. If a server session exists, a token is acquired silently otherwise an interactive flow is used.</p>


  public async Task&lt;IAccount&gt; SignIn()
{
	try
	{
		var result = await AcquireTokenSilent();
		return result.Account;
	}
	catch (MsalUiRequiredException)
	{
		return await AcquireTokenInteractive().ConfigureAwait(false);
	}
}

private async Task&lt;IAccount&gt; AcquireTokenInteractive()
{
	var accounts = (await _app.GetAccountsAsync()).ToList();

	var builder = _app.AcquireTokenInteractive(Scopes)
		.WithAccount(accounts.FirstOrDefault())
		.WithUseEmbeddedWebView(false)
		.WithPrompt(Microsoft.Identity.Client.Prompt.SelectAccount);

	var result = await builder.ExecuteAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);

	return result.Account;
}

public async Task&lt;AuthenticationResult&gt; AcquireTokenSilent()
{
	var accounts = await GetAccountsAsync();
	var result = await _app.AcquireTokenSilent(Scopes, accounts.FirstOrDefault())
			.ExecuteAsync()
			.ConfigureAwait(false);

	return result;
}
  


<p>The SendEmailAsync method uses a message object and Graph API to send the emails. If the identity has the permissions, the licenses and is authenticated, then an email will be sent using the definitions from the Message class.</p>


  public async Task SendEmailAsync(Message message)
{
	var result = await AcquireTokenSilent();

	_httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization 
		= new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", result.AccessToken);
	_httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(
		new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));

	GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient(_httpClient)
	{
		AuthenticationProvider = new DelegateAuthenticationProvider(async (requestMessage) =&gt;
		{
			requestMessage.Headers.Authorization 
				= new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", result.AccessToken);
		})
	};

	var saveToSentItems = true;

	await graphClient.Me
		.SendMail(message, saveToSentItems)
		.Request()
		.PostAsync();
}
  


<p>The EmailService class is used to added the recipient, header (subject) and the body to the message which represents the email. The attachments are added separately using the MessageAttachmentsCollectionPage class. The AddAttachment method is used to add as many attachments to the email as required which are uploaded as a base64 byte array. The service can send html bodies or text bodies.</p>


  public class EmailService
{
	MessageAttachmentsCollectionPage MessageAttachmentsCollectionPage 
		= new MessageAttachmentsCollectionPage();

	public Message CreateStandardEmail(string recipient, string header, string body)
	{
		var message = new Message
		{
			Subject = header,
			Body = new ItemBody
			{
				ContentType = BodyType.Text,
				Content = body
			},
			ToRecipients = new List&lt;Recipient&gt;()
			{
				new Recipient
				{
					EmailAddress = new EmailAddress
					{
						Address = recipient
					}
				}
			},
			Attachments = MessageAttachmentsCollectionPage
		};

		return message;
	}

	public Message CreateHtmlEmail(string recipient, string header, string body)
	{
		var message = new Message
		{
			Subject = header,
			Body = new ItemBody
			{
				ContentType = BodyType.Html,
				Content = body
			},
			ToRecipients = new List&lt;Recipient&gt;()
			{
				new Recipient
				{
					EmailAddress = new EmailAddress
					{
						Address = recipient
					}
				}
			},
			Attachments = MessageAttachmentsCollectionPage
		};

		return message;
	}

	public void AddAttachment(byte[] rawData, string filePath)
	{
		MessageAttachmentsCollectionPage.Add(new FileAttachment
		{
			Name = Path.GetFileName(filePath),
			ContentBytes = EncodeTobase64Bytes(rawData)
		});
	}

	public void ClearAttachments()
	{
		MessageAttachmentsCollectionPage.Clear();
	}

	static public byte[] EncodeTobase64Bytes(byte[] rawData)
	{
		string base64String = System.Convert.ToBase64String(rawData);
		var returnValue = Convert.FromBase64String(base64String);
		return returnValue;
	}
}
  


<p>Azure App Registration settings</p>



<p>The app settings specific to your Azure Active Directory tenant and the Azure App registration values need to be added to the app settings in the .NET Core application. The Scope configuration is set to use the required scopes required to send emails.</p>


  &lt;appSettings&gt;
	&lt;add key="AADInstance" value="https://login.microsoftonline.com/{0}/v2.0"/&gt;
	&lt;add key="Tenant" value="5698af84-5720-4ff0-bdc3-9d9195314244"/&gt;
	&lt;add key="ClientId" value="ae1fd165-d152-492d-b4f5-74209f8f724a"/&gt;
	&lt;add key="Scope" value="User.read Mail.Send Mail.ReadWrite"/&gt;
&lt;/appSettings&gt;
  


<p>WPF UI</p>



<p>The WPF application provides an Azure AD login for the identity. The user of the WPF application can sign-in using a browser which redirects to the AAD authentication page. Once authenticated, the user can send a html email or a text email. The AddAttachment method uses the OpenFileDialog to upload a file in the WPF application, get the raw bytes and add these to the attachments which are sent with the next email message. Once the email is sent, the attachments are removed.</p>


  public partial class MainWindow : Window
{
	AadGraphApiDelegatedClient _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient = new AadGraphApiDelegatedClient();
	EmailService _emailService = new EmailService();

	const string SignInString = "Sign In";
	const string ClearCacheString = "Clear Cache";

	public MainWindow()
	{
		InitializeComponent();
		_aadGraphApiDelegatedClient.InitClient();
	}

	private async void SignIn(object sender = null, RoutedEventArgs args = null)
	{
		var accounts = await _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient.GetAccountsAsync();

		if (SignInButton.Content.ToString() == ClearCacheString)
		{
			await _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient.RemoveAccountsAsync();

			SignInButton.Content = SignInString;
			UserName.Content = "Not signed in";
			return;
		}

		try
		{
			var account = await _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient.SignIn();

			Dispatcher.Invoke(() =&gt;
			{
				SignInButton.Content = ClearCacheString;
				SetUserName(account);
			});
		}
		catch (MsalException ex)
		{
			if (ex.ErrorCode == "access_denied")
			{
				// The user canceled sign in, take no action.
			}
			else
			{
				// An unexpected error occurred.
				string message = ex.Message;
				if (ex.InnerException != null)
				{
					message += "Error Code: " + ex.ErrorCode + "Inner Exception : " + ex.InnerException.Message;
				}

				MessageBox.Show(message);
			}

			Dispatcher.Invoke(() =&gt;
			{
				UserName.Content = "Not signed in";
			});
		}
	}

	private async void SendEmail(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
	{
		var message = _emailService.CreateStandardEmail(EmailRecipientText.Text, 
			EmailHeader.Text, EmailBody.Text);

		await _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient.SendEmailAsync(message);
		_emailService.ClearAttachments();
	}

	private async void SendHtmlEmail(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
	{
		var messageHtml = _emailService.CreateHtmlEmail(EmailRecipientText.Text,
			EmailHeader.Text, EmailBody.Text);

		await _aadGraphApiDelegatedClient.SendEmailAsync(messageHtml);
		_emailService.ClearAttachments();
	}

	private void AddAttachment(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
	{
		var dlg = new OpenFileDialog();
		if (dlg.ShowDialog() == true)
		{
			byte[] data = File.ReadAllBytes(dlg.FileName);
			_emailService.AddAttachment(data, dlg.FileName);
		}
	}

	private void SetUserName(IAccount userInfo)
	{
		string userName = null;

		if (userInfo != null)
		{
			userName = userInfo.Username;
		}

		if (userName == null)
		{
			userName = "Not identified";
		}

		UserName.Content = userName;
	}
}
  


<p>Running the application</p>



<p>When the application is started, the user can sign-in using the Sign in button.</p>







<p>The standard Azure AD login is used in a popup browser. Once the authentication is completed, the browser redirect sends the tokens back to the application.</p>







<p>If a file attachment needs to be sent, the Add Attachment button can be used. This opens up a dialog and any single file can be selected.</p>







<p>When the email is sent successfully, the email and the file can be viewed in the recipients inbox. The emails are also saved to the senders sent emails. This can be disabled if required. </p>

  <p>Individual Rights are hard to come by historically. Strong people make them possible. First requirement of their existence is thus, strong people. Weak and fearful people tend to group together for support initially, and then like crabs in a bucket, to prevent others from escaping the huddle of their security perception. For the purposes of "Individual Rights", this tribal, fearful, mob enforced compliance and perceptual safety is an enemy of fulfilling the experience of those "Individual Rights".&nbsp;</p><p>Individual liberty is the expression of "Individual Rights". A Sovereign Nation derived "of, by, for" people with "Individual Rights" defined broadly as "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness", and given contextual authority as "unalienable" and "self-evident" in nature, must inherently emit from the Individual people that such a Sovereign Nation is composed of. This is the foundational reality of America.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, mob rule is an expression of mob authority. When a "Bill Of Rights" sets out the 1st Right as the "freedom of speech", it is further evidence of the foundational intent of it's authors, all Individual people expressing "Individual Rights" in defining their own Sovereign authority. Therefore, when the Government derived "of, by, for" such people yields corporate charters, and under incorporated Sovereign State Law produces administrative methods of corporate employment, such that "freedom of speech" no longer belongs directly to people, Individuals all, but instead, administratively recasts a person as an employee with provisioned Rights of the State, something is askew. Many such "provisioned Rights" exist, but of greater consequence to the civil society resulting from the original founding intent and structural declarations with Constitutional authority, this administrative process enforces a new type of "mob rule" onto people, and their infrastructure supporting their "Rights" under Sovereign Law.</p><p>Mob rule can thus operate with 50.1% efficiency. A bicameral legislative body can be socially engineered into an expression of mob rule via a two party political system, whereby the people, Individuals all, no longer are the authorities in expressing their Sovereign Rights, except by replacement of new members who inherently are leveraged into joining existing mob rule parties. Independent people, Individual people with "Individual Rights" who serve their peers and civil Society are reduced to functionaries of the mob ruling political party system. All consensus is among the two parties, and the Institution of Governance is no longer directly representative of the best interests of the people, Individuals All. Instead, people reduce their participation to fit into the priorities of the two parties with mob rule authority in the bicameral legislative body.</p><p>Lookup "Republican" and "Democrat" in the text of the Constitution of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA and Declaration of Independence for yourself. What "Rights" are conveyed "of, by, for" these political parties as representations of the people?</p>  <br><p>Mob Rule is the "Way We Go Down". Individual Rights is our victory, and salvation.</p><p>All of human history is reducible to the fight between mob rule and the Individual expression of human Rights. Mobs hate people. Let it set in.. mobs are afraid of people, Individuals all. Movies as esoteric as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footloose_(1984_film)">Footloose</a> document repeatedly the fear the mob holds for Individuals expressing their freedoms. Mobs are the reduction of human intelligence, to the common baseline of fear, control, subservience, and domination of the human spirit within every Individual.</p><p>The fight for Individual Rights is one of control; how do Individuals control their own authority? The struggle against mob rule, against communist or socialist practices that squander human freedom in search for mob security, is one of eternal merit protecting that which makes humanity redeemable. Enslavement of humans by humans, written into the DNA of progress itself, manifesting destinies for all people, is only redeemable, forgivable, and teachable if the value it produces extends the power of Individual Rights to all people.</p><p>[Revised Appropriately]:</p><p>"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all mankind is created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are life, liberty and the personal pursuit of happiness. Governments exist to guarantee the Rights of, by, and for such people, Individuals all, and no abstraction of literary, or mathematical form, shall in any way distort the meaning of such human authority by people, Individuals all."</p><p>America has a literary problem; "We the People" is a term of abstraction. "We the People" has been abstracted by legalese into a meaning that is out-of-step with observable reality. "We the People" are not a data aggregation algorithmic result, "We the People" are not a legal entity/State or one-off representation of authority. "We the people" are Individuals all, and together as people, Individuals all living among one another, our personal authority has constructed a Government that must work by the efforts of the people it is for&nbsp;as was declared, constituted and enforced by great personal action on the part of many people, Individuals all.</p><p>Degradation of people, Individuals all, to instruments of mob rule is out-of-step with the intent for the existence of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, and the use of political parties to induce cult-like mob authority in lieu of accountability to the actual structural integrity of people must be amended. The people must be defined accurately. As it was unacceptable to declare "All men equal.." and not include women or non-white people in that definition, so too is it inappropriate to cause "We the People" to be translated in any way other than may be observed by a child in nature. People exist as Individuals only, and any Union made more perfect must reflect this fact in its operational constraints, dependencies, protocols, policies, Laws and methods of enforcing human Rights.</p><p>America's greatest power is it's conceptualization of people with Individual Rights. Our "more perfect Union" is materialized only through the expression of these Individual Rights for all of it's people, as well as the opportunity for it's expression for all the people of planet Earth. Like a siphon pulling the greatest minds towards its gravitational center, to compete on a planet where American Rights for all exist is the greatest human opportunity to build upon human empowerment the world has ever known.</p><p>The American people, Individuals all, have enemies lined up against them. This is unlikely to change so long as fearful, greedy, an life-reducing bureaucrats are in a position to exercise their contrived authority resulting from practices of mob rule. All that any person need do to observe the reality of any "leader" extending any "policy" or practice affecting the lives of people is to interrogate the operation to find out how human power is distributed. If power is taken from people and given to a central power-processing entity to re-distribute to people defined differently than all others are by default, you are looking at a function of mob rule. If a person suggests that people, Individuals all, are not accountable for their own freedom, and can shirk their personal responsibilities to care for the babies, toddlers, young people, or elderly in need of human guardianship evoked from the sustaining love that gave them life, you are listening to an agent of mob rule.</p><p>Any act that induces mob rule is in support of mob rule.</p><p>Any act that sustains Individual Liberty is in support of Individual Rights.</p><p>Can you interpret reality?</p><p>Data is the dirt of digital existence; everything is made of data. Data is the carbon of digital existence; everything that matters to Humanity is made of data. Individual Rights are made of data, and when it comes to Individual Rights, structure yields results. Human authority is sourced directly from people, Individuals all. People are the source of Sovereign authority, or mob rule is being leveraged. It is that simple.</p><p>When designing a data structure to operate the Rights mechanisms of a Governing entity within a civil society enabled "of, by, for" people, Individuals all, both in bureaucratic Terms as well as in the processing of managing a Governance body composed of an Executive, Legislate and Judicial branch, the key constraint is the source of "useful identity". The useful identity is the primary key of both freedom and security for people within their own Governance bureaucracy where data is leveraged contextually of, by, for all making such a more perfect Union possible.</p><p>America's "Founding Fathers" gave the origin of this procession physical form, both for a King, as well as for every King's Administration System, or Government, that would ever exist henceforth. John Hancock made sure to write it large so no one would miss it. These people got it right the first time around, but an error of omission has caused the same procession to fail to keep repeating. People, Individuals all, have been denied the same opportunity afforded in the original declaration, and in the absence of a "recursive signatory event", one that repeats generation after generation, second class participants have been made of "We the People" as abstractions of legal literature.</p><p>You must originate your own <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2012/02/what-is-sovereign-source-authority.html">Sovereign source authority</a> via a <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2021/07/recursive-signatory.html">recursive signatory</a> made "of, by, for" your own Governance, as a person, an Individual. All of us, living among one another must be equal in this origin of personal authority, as our participatory rights are founded on the accurate definition of "We the People", Individuals all.</p><p>Women and men, equal people in the eyes of the law, Individuals all; No exceptions under American Law.</p><p>There is no alternative that yields an American citizen. If the next century is indeed a great global competition between America and China, let it be fought on the grounds of its inherent construct:&nbsp;</p><p>People, Individuals All with Individual Rights</p><p>Vs</p><p>Authoritarian Enforced Mob Rule managed by fear and control of Individual Rights.</p><p>Internally, within any civil society claiming to represent people as freedom loving beings, pay attention to the practices used to enforce/empower the authority making Individual Rights possible. The past is made of many painful mistakes, mis-definitions, and missed opportunities, but today is for people, Individuals all, to get the story Right.&nbsp;</p><p>Individual Rights come from people, Individuals All. There is no other possibility.&nbsp;</p><p>ID:DATA is the primary key of both freedom and security in a civil society. People must own root authority over their ID:DATA. The structure of your data existence must match the inherent structure of your Individual Rights. Individual Rights come from people. Individual ID:DATA Rights come from people, Individuals all.</p><p>America comes from self-Sovereign human authority, defined generation after generation of, by, for those people. Expressing your Rights is a recursive act with an origin story. Make sure you own root. Mob rule is hunting your life, protect yourself. Protect the possibility of your more perfect Union.</p><p><a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2021/06/all-along-watchtower.html">Be Vigilant..</a></p><p><br></p>

<p>A Response to the&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060930021810/http://www.livingworlds.com/">Documentation of the Living Worlds Working Group</a><br>1997-02-27</p>



<p>[A post by Douglas Crockford, recovered from the internet archive.]</p>



 Introduction 



<p>The Livings Worlds Initiative is the work of a small but dedicated group of&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060930021810/http://vag.vrml.org/consort/">VRML</a>&nbsp;developers who have a deep interest in extending VRML into the basis for interconnected virtual worlds. This project has been inextricably bound to a very effective public relations campaign and standards setting effort. The project is still in development, but is already being promoted as an industry standard for virtual worlds.</p>



<p>The Living Worlds Working Group has been signing up a large number of companies as&nbsp;supporters&nbsp;of the effort, including IBM and Apple. What is not clear to most observers is that&nbsp;support&nbsp;means nothing more than agreeing that standards are desirable.</p>



<p>Within the industry, there is common misunderstanding of what support for Living Worlds means, even among the supporters. The result is that support for a Livings Worlds Standard is starting to snowball. It is being regarded as a proposed standard, but it has not had to face any sort of rigorous review. The purpose of this response is to begin the belated review of the Living Worlds Documentation as a proposed standard.</p>



 Premature Standardization 



<p>There is a growing list of companies that are developing VRML-based virtual worlds. The sector is attracting a lot of attention. Even so, most of the social activity on the Internet today is in IRC and the chat rooms of&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060930021810/http://www.aol.com/">AOL</a>. The most successfully socialized avatar worlds are&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060930021810/http://www.worldsaway.com/">WorldsAway</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060930021810/http://www.thepalace.com/">The Palace</a>, neither of which are VRML-based. The VRML worlds have seen a lot of churn, but are not creating significant sustaining communities.</p>



<p>The weakness of community formation in many of the VRML worlds may be the result of the newness of the worlds and the inexperience of the world designers, who have hampered themselves by putting 3D graphics ahead of socialization.</p>



<p>It is too early to be standardizing 3D social architecture. More experimentation is required. If the Living Worlds Initiative is an experiment conducted by a group of cooperating companies, then it is a good thing. If it is a standard-setting activity, then it is premature and harmful.</p>



<p>The operation of 3D worlds has not been shown to be a profitable activity. The business model is driven by affection for Neal Stephenson’s satiric cyberpunk novel,&nbsp;Snow Crash. Snow Crash&nbsp;describes a virtual world called the Metaverse. Some day, we may have a real Metaverse, and it might even be as important in our world as it was in the novel.</p>



<p>Living Worlds does not implement the Metaverse. It only makes something that looks like it, a meta-virtual world.</p>



<p>VRML itself is still new. VRML 2.0 was announced at Siggraph 96, and complete implementations are only now coming on line. The VRML 2.0 initiative was as frenzied as the Living Worlds Initiative, and because of the haste, the result was suboptimal. A consequence is that part of the Living Worlds Initiative contains some workarounds for VRML 2.0 limitations.</p>



 Security 



<p>The word “security” does not occur in the Living Worlds Documentation except to point out a security hole in VRML 2.0. The lack of attention to security by the Living Worlds Working Group is not a problem if the Initiative is viewed as an experiment. One of the benefits of the experiment will be to demonstrate why security is critical in the design of distributed systems. If the Living Worlds Initiative is setting a standard, then it is harmful.</p>



<p>Security is a very complicated and subtle subject. Absolute security is never achievable, but diligent design and application can produce systems which are worthy of trust.</p>



<p>The Living Worlds Documentation identifies three issues in which distributed security is critical.</p>



  handle everything via dynamically downloaded Java applets  protect the local scene from damage by imported objects  support authentication certificates (dice, business cards)  



<p>The Documentation does not adequately address any of those issues.</p>



<p>Lacking security at the lowest levels, Living Worlds is not strong enough to offer a credible trust model at the human-interaction level. In systems which can be hacked, concepts like identity, credentials, and accountability are meaningless.</p>



<p>This severely limits the application scope of Living Worlds. Environments which permit interpersonal commerce or confidential collaboration should not be implemented in Living Worlds.</p>



 Secure software distribution 



<p>Software is the lifeblood of virtual communities. The value and diversity of these systems depend on the ability to dynamically load and execute software from the network. Unfortunately, this raises a huge security concern. Software from the network could contain viruses, trojan horses, and other security threats. Because of the dynamic and interconnected nature of virtual communities,&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060930021810/http://www.cs.princeton.edu/sip/pub/secure96.html">the protection mechanisms provided by Java are not adequate.</a></p>



<p>The Living Worlds Documentation notes that</p>



<blockquote><p>…at present, most systems prohibit Java from accessing local files, which makes it impossible, for example, to connect to locally installed third party software features. Until this problem is generically solved by the Java community, the management of downloads and local access are left to proprietary MUtech solutions.</p></blockquote>



<p>The proprietary MUtech solutions will create a security hole, and possibly compromise the goal of interoperability at the same time. In order for the dynamic, distributed virtual community to be viable, the issue of secure software distribution must be solved from the outset.&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060930021810/http://www.packet.com/garfinkel/96/47/index2a.html">Class signing is not a solution.</a>&nbsp;A secure, distributed architecture is required. It is doubtful that credible security mechanisms can be retrofitted later.</p>



 Protect the local scene 



<p>Related to the problem of software distribution is the question of rights granted to objects. Objects that are valued in some places might be obnoxious or dangerous in others. The Living Worlds Documentation describes&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060930021810/http://www.livingworlds.com/draft_1/lw_ideas.htm#Requirements">an incontinent puppy</a>&nbsp;as an example of such an object. A secure architecture needs to deal with these sorts of issues from the outset. The Living Worlds Documentation identifies the problem, but does not solve it.</p>



 Authentication 



<p>The Living Worlds Documentation calls for the use of authentication certificates as a mechanism for assuring confidence in certain objects. Unfortunately, if the architecture is not secure, there is not a reliable context in which certificates can be trusted. Because Living Worlds is hackable, certified objects can be compromised.</p>



 Community 



<p>Communities need tools with which they can create policies to regulate the social order. Different communities will have different needs, conventions, standards. The Living Worlds Documentation says this about the task of designing those tools:</p>



<blockquote><p>Two things seem clear. First, that designing a persuasively complete infrastructure for managing user rights, roles and rules is an essentially open-ended task. Second that building a simple, open-ended framework for the same domain can probably be completed with very little effort.</p></blockquote>



<p>Unfortunately, the Working Group does not adequately understand the issues involved. They will create a tool based on a limited understanding of the problem, attempt to drive it into a standard, and leave to others the social and administrative headaches it will cause.</p>



<blockquote><p>This general strategy applies to the rest of the Living Worlds effort as well. Our goal is to reach quick consensus on a minimal subset, and then to encourage the rapid creation of several reference implementations of that proposed feature set. Refinement of the concepts can then proceed in an atmosphere usefully disciplined by implementation experience.</p></blockquote>



<p>Problems of this kind cannot be solved by refinement.</p>



 Incomplete 



<p>If the Living Worlds Documentation were just the work in progress of a working group, then it is appropriate that they publish their materials on the net for comment by interested parties, and it would be absurd to point out that the work is unfinished. But because it is also being presented publicly as a networking standard, and because the Living Worlds Working Group has already begun the work of standard setting, the Documentation needs to be tested for its fitness as a standard.</p>



<p>If the Living Worlds Documentation is read as a proposed standard, then it should be rejected out-of-hand, simply because it is incomplete. In its present form, the Living Worlds Documentation is not even complete enough to criticize.</p>



 Principles 



<p>The Living Worlds Working Group selected a set of principles to guide the development process. Membership in the working group is open to anyone who can accept the principles. This is a reasonable way for a working group to define itself. Unfortunately, the principles of the Working Group are problematic for a standards body. While the Living World Documentation is not complete enough to criticize, the principles and basic architecture can be criticized.</p>



  Build on VRML 2.0.Use VRML 2.0&nbsp;would have been a better first principle. By&nbsp;Building on VRML 2.0, the Working Group is hoping to work some or all of the Livings Worlds work into the VRML 3.0 standard, thereby increasing the importance of the Living Worlds Standard.This component-oriented principle led the Working Group to put the display processor in the center of a distributed architecture, ignoring decades of experience in the separation of I/O from other computational goals.Fortunately, the recent moderating influence of the Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratory (MERL) has opened the Living Worlds Working Group to the possibility of other presentation models. Unfortunately, the Living Worlds Architecture is already fixed on a set of unwieldy interfaces which were motivated by a VRML-centric design space.  Standards, not designs.The second principle is intended to give implementers a large amount of leeway in realizing the standard. The amount of leeway is so great that it might not be possible for independent implementations to interoperate with implementations developed by the Working Group. Since that is specifically what a standard is supposed to accomplish, the second principle is self-defeating.The other benefit of the second principle to the Working Group is to provide an expedient method of dealing with disputes. When the members of the Working Group do not agree on an architectural point, they agree to disagree and leave the choice to the implementer. Sometimes the reason they do not agree is because they were confronting an essential, hard problem.  Architectural Agnosticism.The third principle concerns the question of centralized (server-based) or decentralized (distributed) architecture. Centralized social networking systems often suffer from performance problems because the server can become a bottleneck. The Working Group therefore wants to keep the option of decentralization open: A centralized architecture cannot be transformed into a decentralized architecture simply by being vague about the role of the server. Decentralized design requires the solution of a large number of hard problems, particularly problems of security. An insecure architecture can facilitate the victimization of avatar owners by miscreants. Insecurity will also limit the architecture to supporting only limited interactions, such as chat. Higher value services like cooperative work and interpersonal commerce require a secure platform. Such a platform is not a goal or result of the Living Worlds Initiative.Because the third principle does not explicitly call for the solution to the problems of secure decentralization, it is self-defeating, resulting in an implementations which are either insecure or devoutly centralist or both.  Respect the role of the market.In the fourth principle, the Working Group chooses this unfortunate non-goal: The process does not pay adequate attention to the consequences of the design. The goal of the Working Group is to establish a standard early, relying on iteration in the maintenance of the standard to make it, if not the best imaginable, then good enough for commercial use. The process is not forward-looking enough to provide confidence that the standard can be corrected later. Significant architectural features, such as security, are extremely difficult to insert compatibly into existing systems.  Require running code.The fifth principle appears to be the most respectable, but when coupled with the urgency and recklessness of the fourth principle, it becomes the most dangerous.A standards development process that requires demonstration of new techniques before incorporating them into the standard can be a very good thing because it provides assurance that the standard is implementable. It can also provide early evidence of the utility of the new techniques.But if such a process is driven by extreme time pressure, as the Living Worlds Working Group is, then the fifth principle has a terrible result: only ideas with quick and dirty implementations can be considered. The Working Group will finish its work before hard problems can be understood and real solutions can be produced.So, by principle, the Working Group is open, but not to good ideas that will require time and effort to realize.  



 Conclusion 



<p>The software industry sometimes observes that its problems are due to not having standards, or to having too many standards. Often, its problems are due to having standards that are not good enough.</p>



<p>Premature standardization in the area of virtual worlds will not assure success.</p>



<p>The Living Worlds Initiative is a model for cooperative research, and as such it should be encouraged. The Working Group is using the net to create a virtual community of software developers working together on a common project. This is very good.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the Living Worlds Initiative is also a standards-setting initiative, building on the momentum of the recent VRML 2.0 standard. It would be harmful to adopt the Living Worlds Initiative as a standard at this time.</p>

<p>I’ve long been enamored of the <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR">sparkline</a>, a graphical device which its inventor Edward Tufte defines thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>A sparkline is a small intense, simple, word-sized graphic with typographic resolution. Sparklines mean that graphics are no longer cartoonish special occasions with captions and boxes, but rather sparkline graphics can be everywhere a word or number can be: embedded in a sentence, table, headline, map, spreadsheet, graphic.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nowadays you can create sparklines in many tools including Excel and Google Sheets, both of which can use the technique to pack a summary of a series of numbers into a single cell. By stacking such cells vertically you can create views that compress vast amounts of information.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/21/a-virtuous-cycle-for-analytics/">A virtuous cycle for analytics</a> I noted that we often use Metabase to display tables and charts based on extracts from our Postgres warehouse. I really wanted to use sparklines to summarize views of activity over time, but that isn’t yet an option in Metabase.</p>
<p>When Metabase is connected to Postgres, though, you can write Metabase questions that can not only call built-in Postgres functions but can also call user-defined functions. Can such a function accept an array of numbers and return a sparkline for display in the Metabase table viewer? Yes, if you use Unicode characters to represent the variable-height bars of a sparkline.</p>
<p>There’s a page at rosettacode.org devoted to <a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Sparkline_in_unicode">Unicode sparklines</a> based on this sequence of eight characters:</p>



U+2581
▁
LOWER ONE EIGHTH BLOCK


U+2582
▂
LOWER ONE QUARTER BLOCK


U+2583
▃
LOWER THREE EIGHTHS BLOCK


U+2584
▄
LOWER HALF BLOCK


U+2585
▅
LOWER FIVE EIGHTHS BLOCK


U+2586
▆
LOWER THREE QUARTERS BLOCK


U+2587
▇
LOWER SEVEN EIGHTHS BLOCK


U+2588
█
FULL BLOCK



<p>Notice that 2581, 2582, and 2588 are narrower than the rest. I’ll come back to that at the end.</p>
<p>If you combine them into a string of eight characters you get this result:</p>
<p>▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█</p>
<p>Notice that the fourth and eight characters in the sequence drop below the baseline. I’ll come back to that at the end too.</p>
<p>These characters can be used to define eight buckets into which numbers in a series can be quantized. Here are some examples from the rosettacode.org page:</p>
<p>“1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1” -&gt; ▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█▇▆▅▄▃▂▁<br>
“1.5, 0.5 3.5, 2.5 5.5, 4.5 7.5, 6.5” -&gt; ▂▁▄▃▆▅█▇<br>
“0, 1, 19, 20” -&gt; ▁▁██<br>
“0, 999, 4000, 4999, 7000, 7999” -&gt; ▁▁▅▅██</p>
<p>To write a Postgres function that would do this, I started with the Python example from rosettacode.org:</p>
 bar = '▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█'
barcount = len(bar)
 
def sparkline(numbers):
    mn, mx = min(numbers), max(numbers)
    extent = mx - mn
    sparkline = ''.join(bar[min([barcount - 1,
                                 int((n - mn) / extent * barcount)])]
                        for n in numbers)
    return mn, mx, sparkline
 
<p>While testing it I happened to try an unchanging sequence, [3, 3, 3, 3], which fails with a divide-by-zero error. In order to address that, and to unpack the algorithm a bit for readability, I arrived at this Postgres function:</p>
 create function sparkline(numbers bigint[]) returns text as $$

    def bar_index(num, _min, barcount, extent):
        index = min([barcount - 1, int( (num - _min) / extent * bar_count)])
        return index

    bars = '\u2581\u2582\u2583\u2584\u2585\u2586\u2587\u2588'
    _min, _max = min(numbers), max(numbers)
    extent = _max - _min 

    if extent == 0:  # avoid divide by zero if all numbers are equal
        extent = 1

    bar_count = len(bars)
    sparkline = ''
    for num in numbers:
        index = bar_index(num, _min, bar_count, extent)
        sparkline = sparkline + bars[index]

    return sparkline

$$ language plpython3u;
 
<p>Here’s a psql invocation of the function:</p>
 analytics=# select sparkline(array[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]);
    sparkline
-----------------
▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█▇▆▅▄▃▂▁
(1 row) 
<p>And here’s an example based on actual data:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Each row represents a university course in which students and teachers are annotating the course readings. Each bar represents a week’s worth of activity. Their heights are not comparable from row to row; some courses do a lot of annotating and some not so much; each sparkline reports relative variation from week to week; the sum and weekly max columns report absolute numbers.</p>
<p>This visualization makes it easy to see that annotation was occasional in some courses and continuous in others. And when you scroll, the temporal axis comes alive; try scrolling this view to see what I mean.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We use the same mechanism at three different scales. One set of sparklines reports daily activity for students in courses; another rolls those up to weekly activity for courses at a school; still another rolls all those up to weekly activity for each school in the system.</p>
<p>At the level of individual courses, the per-student sparkline views can show patterns of interaction. In the left example here, vertical bands of activity reflect students annotating for particular assignments. In the right example there may be a trace of such temporal alignment but activity is less synchronized and more continuous.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When we’re working in Metabase we can use its handy mini bar charts to contextualize the row-wise sums.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The sparkline-like mini bar chart shows a row’s sum relative to the max for the column. Here we can see that a course with 3,758 notes has about 1/4 the number of notes as the most note-heavy course at the school.</p>
<p>Because these Unicode sparklines are just strings of text in columns of SQL or HTML tables, they can participate in sort operations. In our case we can sort on all columns including ones not shown here: instructor name, course start date, number of students. But the default is to sort by the sparkline column which, because it encodes time, orders courses by the start of annotation activity.</p>
<p>The visual effect is admittedly crude, but it’s a good way to show certain kinds of variation. And it’s nicely portable. A Unicode sparkline looks the same in a psql console, an HTML table, or a tweet. The function will work in any database that can run it, using Python or another of the languages demoed at rosettacode.org. For example, I revisited the Workbench workflow described in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/01/a-beautiful-power-tool-to-scrape-clean-and-combine-data/">A beautiful power tool to scrape, clean, and combine data</a> and added a tab for <a href="https://app.workbenchdata.com/workflows/149325/">Lake levels</a>.</p>
<p>When I did that, though, the effect was even cruder than what I’ve been seeing in my own work.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In our scenarios, with longer strings of characters, the differences average out and things align pretty well; the below-the-baseline effect has been annoying but not a deal breaker. But the width variation in this example does feel like a deal breaker.</p>
<p>What if we omit the problematic characters U+2581 (too narrow) and U+2584/U+2588 (below baseline and too narrow)?</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are only 5 buckets into which to quantize numbers, and their heights aren’t evenly distributed. But for the intended purpose — to show patterns of variation — I think it’s sufficient in this case. I tried swapping the 5-bucket method into the function that creates sparklines for our dashboards but I don’t think I’ll switch. The loss of vertical resolution makes our longer sparklines less useful, and the width variation is barely noticeable.</p>
<p>Unicode evolves, of course, so maybe there will someday be a sequence of characters that’s friendlier to sparklines. Maybe there already is? If so please let me know, I’d love to use it.</p>

    How many people do you need before identity has value - two! How come, as an industry where 3.2bn (<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/digital-identification-a-key-to-inclusive-growth">McKinsey</a>) people have a digital identity, are we so fragmented, uncoordinated and disagreeable?&nbsp; <p>It is evident that our ongoing discussions about identity, ethics, bias, privacy and consent revolve around a lot of noise (opinions) but little signal (alignment), but why?&nbsp; Recognising that in 30 years of digital identity, we still lack coherent and coordinated action to make it work for everyone is a reality. Perhaps it is time to recognise that it is “us”, the industry, who are the problem.&nbsp; We continue in our self confirming opinions, righteous products and determination to win at all costs.&nbsp; I am not saying we have not made progress or done amazing things, but we have not done as well as we should have!</p><p>As identity now takes several forms insomuch that it emerges from interactions with a system (say payment &amp; reputation), is foundational (given by an authority, a credential), and we can create our own (Self Soverign Identity [SSI]), we are more divided than ever on what we should build on, but have we got it totally wrong. This article gives some New thinking to rattle us.&nbsp;</p><p>We (anyone in identity, privacy, consent, digital space) are unlikely to like reading this. I am aware the responses are unlikely to be favourable, positive or constructive; because this is hard. The learning and takeaway, in the end, draws from a different market, who have solved how to act as one, even though they did not align.</p><p>-----&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I am first unpacking the current status.</p> What happens when the user (human) is not the connector? <p>We live in a digital age that is utterly dependent on the complex connectivity of systems, and in all but one case, the integrated communication path requires the centricity to be on a company, government body, product or service; except for personal identity, privacy and consent that remain focussed on an individual human.&nbsp;</p><p>Identity (all forms) is a function of context based on relationships. Identity exists between the two poles of emergent ID (from system and interactions), functional ID (a credential given to us by an authority) and with an individual (in the case of personal identity) being the connecting point. The dependencies between these solutions mean that our “identity data” rests in government, organisations, companies and individual domains.</p><p></p> Identity in this context <p>Identity includes everything that you can imagine: who you think you are, passport, ID, login, email, IP address, messages, census data, birth record, photos, friends, education, work, conversations, experience, travel, reputation, scars, memories, health, heart rate, blood pressure, medication, family tree, skin, DNA, parents, heritage, analysis, habits, rules, content, culture, who you identify as - everything yesterday, today and tomorrow that identify you as you and that makes you unique.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Functional or Foundational Identity <p>I am keeping it broad &amp; straightforward. Passport, birth certification, diving licence, DNA, sovereign ID, company ID and anything given to you by someone who has command and control (a credential.)&nbsp; Foundational Identity has governance and oversight about who issues the foundational identity, and therefore they are classed as an "authoritative source."&nbsp;</p><p>Foundational “hard” ID is given, but from it rises many softer identities (identifications) that are all built from having a foundation.&nbsp; If we had an unbreakable lineage and provenance to back identification from identity, it might help; but there are unintended consequences we have to face.&nbsp;</p> Pause and Reflection <p>We know something is broken in the functional ID model as my identity is me, who I am, what drives me, experience; it is not my passport but where the passport took me and the experiences I gained there.&nbsp; We know some don’t have the foundations of identification, but they have an identity.&nbsp; Your foundation identity does not define who you are.</p> Emergence&nbsp; <p>Definition: Emergence is where the properties or behaviours only emerge when components or parts interact as part of a whole inclusive system.&nbsp;</p> Emergence Identity <p>An identity that forms because you interact with systems.&nbsp; Your made-up email address enables someone to know where you live, what you buy, when you shop, who you shop for.&nbsp; Your preferences and actions identify you.&nbsp; This identity emerges not because you have a trusted bank account to pay but because you interact, your reputation.&nbsp; Your passport allows and enables interactions.&nbsp; The more we interact in a complex digital world, the more emergent identities we have.&nbsp;</p><p>Emergence is usually hidden insofar that IP address providers or payment transaction analysis systems could be judged as emergent identity creators. We as individuals do not control them or have visibility of the data (dark/ hidden). It is very much a debate if consent is needed and/ or if the creator (the user) should have this data under their control.&nbsp; Open Banking could be seen as one of the first emergent identity systems that do give the user some control.</p><p>If emergent identity had strong governance and oversight, it might also become like a Functional Identity.</p> We have to accept our identity is more than the sum. <p>The diagram below is based on a <a href="https://www.jpr.org.uk/documents/14-06-19.barry_johnson.polarity_management.pdf">polarity model</a>.&nbsp; Unlike a linear or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_chain">value chain mode</a>l, there is no one universal starting point or final destination.&nbsp; As we discover the value and limitations of the two principle identity models, we recognise that we continually move around the model, never settling at one place or outcome but learning and improving both.&nbsp; However, given the boundaries and limitations of each, we need both to be successful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The purpose of functional and emergence ID is to determine where you start the journey.</p><br><p></p> There is a deep dependency.&nbsp; <p>Without foundational, I cannot access emergent; without emergent, I cannot gain value from foundational. If I cannot gain/ get a foundational identity, emergent identity enables me to start, barter/ trade and protect myself.&nbsp; Emergence can be a lifeline to getting a foundational identity.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies, organisations and governments believe that control of your identity is critically important. They call it identity to ensure you are not aware if it is emergent or foundational.&nbsp; They (well, we the industry) will use one to create the other and cause confusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Where does SSI (self-sovereign identity) fit? <p>Ignoring the name and all those issues, SSI is not emergent ID or functional/ foundational ID, but our agent for identity. SSI is a decentralized model for digital identity based on an entity’s control over forming and using cryptographically secured digital connections (using DIDs) and accepting and presenting digitally signed credentials (VCs). It applies as much to organizations and IoT as individuals. (thanks @DrummondReed)<br></p><p>SSI has made me realise that we have created different onboarding positions and propositions, not different approaches to identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>SSI could be seen as a new model for providing functional ID that has interesting possibilities for helping with some aspects of emergent ID. But no technology can fully emulate the qualities of emergent ID.</p> But what does this mean? <p>There is a deep desire to want the best of all worlds without realising or recognising the separation and interdependence. We debate and argue about transparency, data sharing, ontology requirements, privacy by design, consent driven, control, value, power, and much more in wanting the best.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Given we cannot have a form of identity without the other, how can we cycle faster to co-create better solutions with the best aspects of both? But recognise that consent works well for foundational identity but is hopeless for emergent. Privacy can protect foundational ID, but not emergent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> The linkage is us, the human, today, but should we be the link? <p>Right now, it is the individual who connects the different domains of personal identity.&nbsp; Without you and your needs to trade, barter, work, play - these domains would not need connecting.&nbsp; We create and need connections and are the connector.&nbsp; We may be lucky enough to have a foundational ID at birth, but for a digital life, we need both.&nbsp; We are the connection until death when they will slowly separate again as emergent ID is no longer needed, but a link can continue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Mapping some solutions <p>Below is the polarity map of identity with SSI, SOLID, yoti, and Vouch added. Why have I only picked these from the 100+ solutions, because I want others to place where they are.&nbsp; The placements are the starting positions for onboarding, the value proposition to get onto the identify loop.&nbsp; It is not where they stay or add the most value; it is day zero, what problem is solved and why you should join. I am likely to have in-correctly positioned them, so if you feel they are wrong, please identify a better place.&nbsp; The message is that we all start as different places to solve the same problem.&nbsp; But what we do is continually confuse everyone and ensure that we disagree on what identity means or what it is for.&nbsp; We hold fast to our “best in class” solution, our product and our personal beliefs with conformational bias.&nbsp;</p><p></p> Who has solved the same problem before? <p>An insight for us (the identity industry) comes from an unlikely source. Time to look at the green movement, global warming and climate change.&nbsp; Back in the 1960s, when protests against nuclear power and arms were in full swing, we also marched for: save the whales, save the endangered species, save the newt, save the planet, save humanity, save the tigers, save the elephants, save the orangutans and many more. &nbsp; On a march or protest, there were a few to hundred and the occasional thousand.&nbsp; Co-ordinated marches across the globe in different cities swelled the number on a specific topic march.&nbsp; During the 80’s “Feed the World” raised millions of pounds for a cause, famine in Africa.&nbsp; When acting as one - we can start to create change.</p><p>At some point, something interesting happened.&nbsp; Individuals connected their ecosystem crisis to another, more significant, crisis.&nbsp; It was bigger than a connection; it was a cause.&nbsp; The small marches against an effect could start to see there was a more significant cause.&nbsp; Global warming and climate change bought together those focusing on local protests through loss of habitat to match together as one voice as their loss resulted from a cause. Save the Whales would not join a save the newt but can walk side by side on Climate Change.&nbsp; Climate change was not a march but a “co-opted” group from thousands of different factions fighting for their own passion, purpose or love.&nbsp; Many voices became one and retained their own passion.&nbsp;</p><p>Identity has many factions, many voices, many causes, many definitions and many solutions.&nbsp; We continue to define, redefine and demand our “xxx” of identity as the one usually because it is the model we want as we will benefit.&nbsp;</p><p>Our big and unifying issue is to recognise that corporates, especially big tech and government, have no interest in one identity and indeed would find ways to ensure it remains factions and uncoordinated unless they are the single controller. They will sponsor and support many programs, many solutions and keep the divisions going, playing a game. Single identity would likely also render Facebook and media companies, with their advertising model unworkable - so not all big tech want a solution! Division works.</p><p>Perhaps the lesson here is that we should stop fighting for our own version of identity (privacy, ethics, consent), for our own definitions, for our own implementations, for our own solutions, for our own products and start to think about acting like one. Each of us swallows some pride, eats some ego and finds ways to behave as one industry voice, one team who cares together as we have passion, purpose and heart to solve identity problems for everyone.</p><p>The railway, automobile and aero industries across the world have made it work. Building different gauge infrastructures to different standards but eventually learning that together they thrive when they stopped wanting aligned infrastructures and found a way to ensure users could access and use it all.&nbsp;</p><p>If you disagree, share this and say why. If you agree, share this, so we talk about it at our meeting places.&nbsp; If you're an influencer, reflect to see if we are the problem. If you organise events, why not make time to lead this debate?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>----</p><p>This article has been in formation for some 18 months. It had no direction or lacked sense at points, and through perseverance, friends, and discussion, it has become what it is today.&nbsp; Many have shaped the thinking.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<blockquote> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B08B4F5QK3/windleyofente-20">The Future of Stuff by Vinay Gupta</a> <p>Where and who do we want to be? How might we get there? What might happen if we stay on our current course? The Future of Stuff asks what kind of world will we live in when every item of property has a digital trace, when nothing can be lost and everything has a story. Will property and ownership become as fluid as film is today: summoned on demand, dismissed with a swipe? What will this mean for how we buy, rent, share and dispose of stuff? About what our stuff says about us? And how will this impact on us, on manufacturing and supply, and on the planet?
</p><p></p></blockquote>

<p>
    The idea is similar to what <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/shaping-things">Bruce Sterling has called Spimes</a> and what we've been <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/the_self-sovereign_internet_of_things.shtml">building on top of picos for over a decade</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Smart property goes well beyond the internet of things and connected devices to imagine a world where every thing is not just online, but has a digital history and can interact with other smart things to accomplish whatever goals their owners desire. Things are members of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2015/07/social_things_trustworthy_spaces_and_the_internet_of_things.shtml">communities</a> and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/06/fuse_as_a_model_of_the_vehicle_ecosystem.shtml">ecosystems</a>, working through programmable agents.
</p>

<p>
    A world of smart things is decentralized–it has to be. While Vinay talks of blockchains and smart contracts, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/07/ten_reasons_to_use_picos_for_your_next_decentralized_programming_project.shtml">I work on picos</a>. Likely both, or some version of them, are necessary to achieve the end goal of a sustainable internet of things to replace the anemic, unsustainable <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/07/alternatives_to_the_compuserve_of_things.shtml">CompuServe of Things</a> we're being offered now.
</p>

<a></a>
 Going Further 

<p>
    We've built a platform on top of picos for managing things called <a href="https://manifold.picolabs.io/">Manifold</a>. This is a successor to <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/squaretag.shtml">SquareTag</a>, if you've been following along. You can use Manifold to create spimes or digital twins for your things. Some of the built-in applications allow you to find lost stuff using QR code stickers or write notes about your things using a journaling app. You could <a href="https://github.com/Picolab/Manifold">build others since the application is meant to be programmable and extendable</a>. I primarily use it as a personal inventory system.

Epistemology doesn’t just ask questions about what we should do to find things out; that is the task of all disciplines to some extent. For example, science, research, data analysis, and anthropology all have their own methods for finding things out. Epistemology has the job of making those methods themselves the objects of study. It aims to understand how methods of inquiry can be seen as rational endeavours.</p><p>If the concept of “knowing things to be true” were simple, we’d all agree on many things that we currently disagree about; climate and vaccines appear current.&nbsp; We cannot reach a unanimous agreement means something is wrong with our data, analysis, and information model.</p><p>The senior leadership team will tend to think of themselves as clear thinkers and see those who disagree with an opinion as misguided. Executives believe they have the capacity to see things just as they “really” are and that it is others who have confused perceptions. As a result, the CDO can simply point out to everyone where their thinking has gone wrong using facts rather than engage in rational dialogue allowing for the possibility that we all might be wrong. Philosophy, psychology and cognitive science guide us that we are complex, and our reasoning is not clinical or pure. Data (facts) and its analysis create a staggeringly complex array of cognitive biases and dispositions. We are generally ignorant of their role in others who influence us and our own thinking and decision-making.</p><p>A CDO is responsible for introducing everyone who touches data to a systematic way of interrogating thinking, models, rationality, and a sense of what makes “for a good reason” for both sides of the evidence coin.&nbsp;</p><p>As a CDO, you should help determine by what criteria the leadership team are to evaluate reason.&nbsp; We need to establish how, as a team, the criteria themselves are evaluated? Further, how do we determine how a belief or action can be justified and the relationship between justification and truth? &nbsp; And as the CDO, we have to establish and own the <a href="https://opengovernance.net/data-for-better-decisions-nature-or-nurture-79e6531dbe3a">company-wide top-level data ontology</a>.&nbsp;</p><p></p><br><p>The first action will be to get the topic of evidence on the agenda, not as a diversion, but to start to bring up critical issues such as bias in our decision making.&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>----</p><p>Whilst our ongoing agile iteration into <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-occurs-when-physical-beings-transition-to-information-beings-146ea9dcbca3">information beings</a> is never-ending, there are the first 100 days in the new role. But what to focus on? Well, that rose-tinted period of conflicting priorities is what <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/">&lt;/Hello, CDO!&gt;</a> is all about.

<p>On Quora, here’s <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-worst-design-trends-in-modern-cars/answer/Doc-Searls">my answer</a> to <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-worst-design-trends-in-modern-cars">What are the worst design trends in modern cars?</a>—updated by our family’s experience with a new Toyota that features even more indicators than the bunch above::::</p>
<p>Based on driving&nbsp;lots&nbsp;of late-model rental cars, here’s a list:</p>
 
 Entertainment systems that are hard to use and dangerous on the road. (Few are good. Most are bad. Some are truly awful.) 
 Making AM and FM listening harder than ever. Some of this is by putting too many functions in too many menus you have to poke at. (While driving, knobs and switches beat buttons for usability. Ask a pilot.) Some of it is by burying antennas in windows, which will never work as well as a whip antenna (preferably the retractable kind that can survive a car wash). But a thumbs-up to cars offering HD Radio, which adds many more stations to FM and far better sound to AM (on the sadly too few stations that feature it). 
 Way too much optionality among features with non-obvious meanings that you control through buttons with whaaa? symbols or half-buried menus that can be as dangerous to navigate while driving as it is to finger-text on one’s cell phone. For example, a loaded 2021 Toyota Camry Hybrid has TSS w/PD, HUD, DRCC, LDA w/SA, LTA, AHB, PCS, RCD, RSA, BSM. RCTA, RCTB, VSC, EV, ECO, plus other stuff that’s a bit more spelled out, such as TRAC, Qi Wireless Charger and Birds Eye View Camera. And those are in addition to the usual indicators: shifter position, odometer, outside temperature, etc. Many of these unclear functions are displayed only or mainly in the “Meters/Multi-Information Display” you view through or over your steering wheel. Since there is no way the display can give you a full view of all these functions in all their possible states, you move around your selections and menus through buttons on the steering wheel that you mash with your left thumb. And that’s just one model of one car. (Which we happen to almost have: ours is a 2020 model.) 
 Poor visibility out the back corners, thanks to extra-wide roof pillars and fake-muscle styling that narrows the shapes of the cars’ aft windows. 
 No place to mount a phone. I mean, why have Apple’s CarPlay and/or Android Auto and&nbsp;not&nbsp;have a place to mount a phone? (Yes, there are aftermarket things with suction cups, but most new cars lack a surface other than the windshield that will hold a cup sucked.) 
 Trunks with plenty of space but too small an opening, so it’s hard to get large or odd-shaped items in there. 
 Low-profile and performance tires, which handle nicely but can ride rough and transmit lots of road noise. 
 Too much black. On the dashboard platform under windshields, black makes sense because you don’t want a light color reflecting off the windshield. But black is used way too much in trim. Worse, black steering wheels parked in the sun can get too hot to hold. And black leather or vinyl seats can fry your ass. 
 Giant grills—especially ones that resemble <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mouth+of+manta+ray">the mouths of manta rays</a>. (I’m <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=lexus+grille+manta+ray">looking at you</a>, Lexus.) 
 The tendency of headlight lenses to develop cataracts. My ’05 Subaru has them. My daughter’s newer Honda Civic has worse ones. Could be newer models don’t do that, but it’s actually dangerous and needs to be gone. 
 
<p>Comments still don’t work here, so instead tweet about it or write me directly: first name at last name dot com.</p>

<p>Some news: I’m super happy to report that I started a new job last week at <a href="https://nytimes.com/">The
New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>After ten years at <a href="https://iovation.com/">iovation</a>, the last four working remotely from New York City
and the last three under the ownership of <a href="https://transunion.com/">TransUnion</a>, I felt it was time to
find something new. At The Times, I’ve taken the role of Staff Engineer on a new
team, User Systems. I’m particularly stoked for this gig, as it falls right into
areas of abiding interest, including privacy-by design, personal data
protection, encryption, authentication, credential management, and scaling a
vital app for the whole business. Add that to the straightforward commute once
the office reopens, and it’s hard to find something more ideal.</p>
<p>I truly appreciate the extraordinary experience of my ten years at iovation. I
originally thought I’d stay a couple years, but was so engaged by the people and
the great work we did that I kept at it. I learned a ton about product
engineering, product design, and scalable architectures, but especially about
working with terrific colleagues who made me a better person even as I tried to
be of service to them. I will especially miss working with Scott, Kurk, Clara,
Travis, John, and Eric — and countless others. I wish them all the best, and
would enjoy working with any and all of them again anytime.</p>
<p>Now I’m excited to make new connections working with my amazing new colleagues
at The Times. I expect we’ll collaborate on fulfilling work building super
useful tools that advance <a href="https://www.nytco.com/company/mission-and-values/" title="The New York Times Company: Mission and Values">The Times mission</a> to inform and empower its readers.
I’m delighted to be jumping on this ride with them.</p>

<p>Labels like “data scientist” and “data journalist” connote an elite corps of professionals who can analyze data and use it to reason about the world. There are elite practitioners, of course, but since the advent of online data a quarter century ago I’ve hoped that every thinking citizen of the world (and of the web) could engage in similar analysis and reasoning. </p>
<p>That’s long been possible for those of us with the ability to wrangle APIs and transform data using SQL, Python, or another programming language. But even for us it hasn’t been easy. When I read news stories that relate to the generation of electric power in California, for example, questions occur to me that I know I could illuminate by finding, transforming, and charting sources of web data:</p>
<p>– How can I visualize the impact of shutting down California’s last nuclear plant?</p>
<p>– What’s the relationship between drought and hydro power?</p>
<p>All the ingredients are lying around in plain sight, but the effort required to combine them winds up being more trouble than it’s worth. And that’s for me, a skilled longtime scraper and transformer of web data. For you — even if you’re a scientist or a journalist! — that may not even be an option.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://workbenchdata.com/">Workbench</a>, a web app with the tagline: “Scrape, clean, combine and analyze data without code.” I’ve worked with tools in the past that pointed the way toward that vision. DabbleDB in 2005 (now gone) and Freebase Gridworks in 2010 (still alive as Open Refine) were effective ways to cut through <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2008/02/20/overcoming-data-friction/">data friction</a>. Workbench carries those ideas forward delightfully. It enables me to fly through the boring and difficult stuff — the scraping, cleaning, and combining — in order to focus on what matters: the analysis.</p>
<p>Here’s the <a href="https://app.workbenchdata.com/workflows/149325/report">report</a> that I made to address the questions I posed above. It’s based on a <a href="https://app.workbenchdata.com/workflows/149325/">workflow</a> that you can visit and explore as I describe it here. (If you create your own account you can clone and modify.)</p>
<p>The workflow contains a set of tabs; each tab contains a sequence of steps; each step transforms a data set and displays output as a table or chart. When you load the page the first tab runs, and the result of its last step is displayed. In this case that’s the first chart shown in the report:</p>
<p></p>
<p>As in a Jupyter notebook you can run each step individually. Try clicking step 1. You’ll see a table of data from <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/data-reports/energy-almanac/california-electricity-data/electric-generation-capacity-and-energy">energy.ca.gov</a>. Notice that step 1 is labeled Concatenate tabs. If you unfurl it you’ll see that it uses another tab, 2001-2020 scraped, which in turn concatenates two other tabs, 2001-2010 scraped and 2011-2020 scraped. Note that I’ve helpfully explained that in the optional comment field above step 1.</p>
<p>Each of the two source tabs scrapes a table from the page at energy.ca.gov. As I note in the report, it wasn’t necessary to scrape those tables since the data are available as an Excel file that can be downloaded, then uploaded to Workbench (as I’ve done in the tab named energy.ca.gov xslx). I scraped them anyway because that web page presents a common challenge: the data appear in two separate HTML tables. That’s helpful to the reader but frustrating to an analyst who wants to use the data. Rapid and fluid combination of scraped tables is grease for cutting through data friction; Workbench supplies that grease.</p>
<p>Now click step 2 in the first tab. It’s the last step, so you’re back to the opening display of the chart. Unfurl it and you’ll see the subset of columns included in the chart. I’ve removed some minor sources, like oil and waste heat, in order to focus on major ones. Several details are notable here. First: colors. The system provides a default palette but you can adjust it. Black wasn’t on the default palette but I chose that for coal.</p>
<p>Second, grand total. The data set doesn’t include that column, and it’s not something I needed here. But in some situations I’d want it, so the system offers it as a choice. That’s an example of the attention to detail that pervades every aspect of Workbench. </p>
<p>Third, Vega. See the triple-dot button above the legend in the chart? Click it, then select Open in Vega Editor, and when you get there, click Run. Today I learned that Vega is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing visualization designs. With Vega, visualizations are described in JSON, and generate interactive views using either HTML5 Canvas or SVG.

<p>Sweet! I think I’ll use it in my own work to simplify what I’ve recently (and painfully) learned how to do with D3.js. It’s also a nice example of how Workbench prioritizes openness, reusability, and reproducibility in every imaginable way.</p>
<p>I use the chart as the intro to my report, which is made with an elegant block editor in which you can combine tables and charts from any of your tabs with snippets of text written in markdown. There I begin to ask myself questions, adding tabs to marshal supporting evidence and sourcing evidence from tabs into the report.</p>
<p>My first question is about the contribution that the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant has been making to the overall mix. In the 2020 percentages all major sources tab I start in step 1 by reusing the tab 2001-2020 scraped. Step 2 filters the columns to just the same set of major sources shown in the chart. I could instead apply that step in 2001-2020 scraped and avoid the need to select columns for the chart. Since I’m not sure how that decision might affect downstream analysis I keep all the columns. If I change my mind it’s easy to push the column selection upstream. </p>
<p>Workbench not only makes it possible to refactor a workflow, it practically begs you to do that. When things go awry, as they inevitably will, it’s no problem. You can undo and redo the steps in each tab! You won’t see that in the read-only view but if you create your own account, and duplicate my workflow in it, give it a try. With stepwise undo/redo, exploratory analysis becomes a safe and stress-free activity.</p>
<p>At step 2 of 2020 percentages all major sources we have rows for all the years. In thinking about Diablo Canyon’s contribution I want to focus on a single reference year so in step 3 I apply a filter that selects just the 2020 row. Here’s the UX for that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In situations like this, where you need to select one or more items from a list, Workbench does all the right things to minimize tedium: search if needed, start from all or none depending on which will be easier, then keep or remove selected items, again depending on which will be easier. </p>
<p>In step 4 I include an alternate way to select just the 2020 row. It’s a Select SQL step that says select * from input where Year = '2020'. That doesn’t change anything here; I could omit either step 3 or step 4 without affecting the outcome; I include step 4 just to show that SQL is available at any point to transform the output of a prior step. </p>
<p>Which is fantastic, but wait, there’s more. In step 5 I use a Python step to do the same thing in terms of a pandas dataframe. Again this doesn’t affect the outcome, I’m just showing that Python is available at any point to transform the output of a prior step. Providing equivalent methods for novices and experts, in a common interface, is extraordinarily powerful.</p>
<p>I’m noticing now, by the way, that step 5 doesn’t work if you’re not logged in. So I’ll show it to you here:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Step 6 transposes the table so we can reason about the fuel types. In steps 3-5 they’re columns, in step 6 they become rows. This is a commonly-needed maneuver. And while I might use the SQL in step 4 to do the row selection handled by the widget in step 3, I won’t easily accomplish the transposition that way. The Transpose step is one of the most powerful tools in the kit.</p>
<p>Notice at step 6 that the first column is named Year. That’s a common outcome of transposition and here necessitates step 7 in which I rename it to Fuel Type. There are two ways to do that. You can click the + Add Step button, choose the Rename columns option, drag the new step into position 7, open it, and do the renaming there. </p>
<p>But look:</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can edit anything in a displayed table. When I change Year to Fuel Type that way, the same step 7 that you can create manually appears automatically. </p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s absolutely brilliant.</p>
<p>In step 8 I use the Calculate step to add a new column showing each row’s percentage of the column sum. In SQL I’d have to think about that a bit. Here, as is true for so many routine operations like this, Workbench offers the solution directly: </p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally in step 9 I sort the table. The report includes it, and there I consider the question of Diablo Canyon’s contribution. According to my analysis nuclear power was 9% of the major sources I’ve selected, contributing 16,280 GWh in 2020. According to another energy.ca.gov page that I <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2020-03/Nuclear_Power_Reactors_in_California_ada.pdf">cite</a> in the report, Diablo Canyon is the only remaining nuke plant in the state, producing “about 18,000 GWh.” That’s not an exact match but it’s close enough to give me confidence that reasoning about the nuclear row in the table applies to Diablo Canyon specifically. </p>
<p>Next I want to compare nuclear power to just the subset of sources that are renewable. That happens in the 2020 percentages renewable tab, the output of which is also included in the report. Step 1 begins with the output of 2020 percentages of all major sources. In step 2 I clarify that the 2020 column is really 2020 GWh. In step 3 I remove the percent column in order to recalculate it. In step 4 I remove rows in order to focus on just nuclear and renewables. In step 5 I recalculate the percentages. And in step 6 I make the chart that also flows through to the report.</p>
<p>Now, as I look at the chart, I notice that the line for large hydro is highly variable and appears to correlate with drought years. In order to explore that correlation I look for data on reservoir levels and arrive at <a href="https://cdec.water.ca.gov/">https://cdec.water.ca.gov/</a>. I’d love to find a table that aggregates levels for all reservoirs statewide since 2001, but that doesn’t seem to be on offer. So I decide to use Lake Mendocino as a proxy. In step 1 I scrape an <a href="https://cdec.water.ca.gov/dynamicapp/QueryWY?Stations=MNC&amp;SensorNums=15&amp;End=2021-07-31&amp;span=20">HTML table</a> with monthly levels for the lake since 2001. In step 2 I delete the first row which only has some months. In step 3 I rename the first column to Year in order to match what’s  in the table I want to join with. In step 4 I convert the types of the month columns from text to numeric to enable calculation. In step 5 I calculate the average into a new column, Avg. In step 6 I select just Year and Avg. </p>
<p>When I first try the join in step 8 it fails for a common reason that Workbench helpfully explains:</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the other table Year looks like ‘2001’, but the text scraped from energy.ca.gov looks like ‘2,001’. That’s a common glitch that can bring an exercise like this to a screeching halt. There’s probably a Workbench way to do this, but in step 7 I use SQL to reformat the values in the Year column, removing the commas  to enable the join. While there I also rename the Avg column to Lake Mendocino Avg Level. Now in tab 8 I can do the join.</p>
<p>In tab 9 I scale the values for Large Hydro into a new column, Scaled Large Hydro. Why? The chart I want to see will compare power generation in GWh (gigawatt hours) and lake levels in AF (acre-feet). These aren’t remotely compatible but I don’t care, I’m just looking for comparable trends. Doubling the value for Large Hydro gets close enough for the comparison chart in step 10, which also flows through to the report.</p>
<p>All this adds up to an astonishingly broad, deep, and rich set of features. And I haven’t even talked about the <a href="http://help.workbenchdata.com/en/articles/2322465-clean-text">Clean text</a> step for tweaking whitespace, capitalization, and punctuation, or the <a href="http://help.workbenchdata.com/en/articles/1867388-refine">Refine</a> step for finding and merging clusters of similar values that refer to the same things. Workbench is also simply beautiful as you can see from the screen shots here, or by visiting my workflow. When I reviewed software products for BYTE and InfoWorld it was rare to encounter one that impressed me so thoroughly.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more. </p>
<p>At the core of my workflow there’s a set of tabs; each is a sequence of steps; some of these produce tables and charts. Wrapped around the workflow there’s the report into which I cherrypick tables and charts for the story I’m telling there. </p>
<p>There’s also another kind of wrapper: a lesson wrapped around the workflow. I could write a lesson that guides you through the steps I’ve described and checks that each yields the expected result. See <a href="https://app.workbenchdata.com/courses/en/intro-to-data-journalism/first-story">Intro to data journalism</a> for an example you can try. Again, it’s brilliantly well done.</p>
<p>So Workbench succeeds in three major ways. If you’re not a data-oriented professional, but you’re a thinking person who wants to use available web data to reason about the world, Workbench will help you power through the grunt work of scraping, cleaning, and combining that data so you can focus on analysis. If you aspire to become such a professional, and you don’t have a clue about how to do that grunt work, it will help you learn the ropes. And if you are one of the pros you’ll still find it incredibly useful.</p>
<p>Kudos to the Workbench team, and especially to core developers Jonathan Stray, Pierre Conti, and Adam Hooper, for making this spectacularly great software tool. </p>

 Reflecting on change and community in a time of personal transition. Staring out over a world of possibilities (Joshua Tree, July&nbsp;2021)<p>Navigating through this global pandemic has leveled up both my tolerance for ambiguity and my appreciation for community — including friends, family, co-workers, and global colleagues. These dual forces of change and connection are also guiding me forward as I embark on a new professional chapter.</p><p>After three deeply rewarding and challenging years with <a href="http://transmute.industries">Transmute</a>, I’m transitioning into a new role this&nbsp;fall.</p><p>I will continue to work in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/CRD-did-core-20210724/">decentralized identity</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">verifiable credentials</a> ecosystem but will return to more of my impact roots as Senior Director of Product with Kiva’s <a href="https://www.kiva.org/protocol">Protocol</a> team — part of an <a href="http://kiva.org">international non-profit</a> working on digital identity as an enabler of deeper financial inclusion. I will also remain a champion and alumni advisor of Transmute, cheering the team on through next iterations of company and product development.</p><p>Making any big transition like this always surfaces the forest through the trees for me, bringing some longer term trends into focus in a way I often miss when heads down on day to day&nbsp;work.</p><p>In particular I’ve found myself reflecting on the philosophy and practice of open versus closed networks, and my growing conviction that open networks are a key to satisfaction and success, both for individuals and for businesses.</p><p>My working definition of “open networks” boils down to a mindset and style of engagement that assumes generosity, collaboration, and expanded connections will lead to mutual benefit. This can look like contributing to global standards and open source work, being proactive with connecting people, offering support without expectation of returned favors, and celebrating colleagues as they transition organizations (something I’ve been fortunate to experience this month with Transmute).</p><p>Open network interactions are empathetic and relational rather than transactional, rooted in a belief that we can progress and grow together, creating more opportunity in the process rather than competing for something finite.</p><p>By contrast, a more closed network approach (all too often the default) sees the gain of others as a personal loss if not compensated in some way. It is a more protective mentality that discourages transparency and informal exchange. It looks like vendor lock-in, punitive non-compete agreements, and proprietary code. To be clear, some degree of this is necessary for businesses to function today — to show value for investors, protect IP, drive competitive advantage, etc. However, taken as a default state, closed networks can crush both innovation and the spirits of individuals whose interests expand beyond the bounds of any single identity or organization.</p><p>One of the things that drew me to Transmute — and more broadly to emergent technology like decentralized identities and verifiable credentials — is that the open network style is often the default culture of engagement. In fact, this approach is necessary in the face of pre-competitive table stakes like technical interoperability as well as collaborative engagement and advocacy in the broader regulatory environment. Essentially, the adoption of this technology is far bigger than any one of us, and we have to work together to build the market and adoption we want to see in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>This open, generous network ethos aligns with the future I want to be part of, both with the organizations I help build and personally as a self-actualizing and social human. Part of the “crafted self” we talk about as identity workers includes the ability to be selectively multi-dimensional beings across different settings. To me this includes the freedom to traverse organizations and even industries as our interests take us, and to carry our reputation and relationships along that journey. Viewed in this way, the interoperability and autonomy values woven into the foundations of decentralized tech become further tools that can help bring to bear an even more generous&nbsp;world.</p><p>A huge thank you to the<a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk"> Transmute Team</a> — particularly <a href="https://medium.com/@karylfowler">Karyl Fowler</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@OR13">Orie Steele</a> — for leading the way, both as technologists and founders, in making the bet that movement across systems and organizations is a win for all parties involved (be they verifiable trade documents or prior employees). It has been a pleasure to work for and with you over the past few&nbsp;years.</p><p>***</p><p>If you are interested in some of the cross-network work happening in the decentralized tech space you can also check out the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> working groups, the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a>, the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a>, and the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/svip">Department of Homeland Security Silicon Valley Innovation Program</a> (to name just a&nbsp;few!).</p>Jumping off, jumping in!

His research papers are <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=45442">here</a>. His research shows that aggravation and alienation easily win, irrespective of being more liberal or conservative. The more we use our faculties for scientific thought, the more likely we are to take a strong position that aligns with our (original) political group (or thought).&nbsp;</p><p>A way through this is to copy “<a href="https://www.solutionsjournalism.org/">solution journalism</a>” which reports on ways that people and governments meaningfully respond to difficult problems and not on what the data says the problem is. Rather than use our best insights, analysis and thinking to reach the version of the “truth”, we use data to find ways to agree with others opinions in our communities. We help everyone to become curious. &nbsp; I use the<a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/"> Peak Paradox</a> framework as an approach to remaining curious as to where we are aligned and where there is a delta.&nbsp;</p><p>What happens when we use data and science in our arguments and explain what the problem is, is that the individuals will selectively credit and discredit information in patterns that reflect their commitment to certain values. They (we) (I) assimilate what they (we)(I) want.&nbsp;</p><p>Kahan, in 2014, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2459057">asked over 1,500 respondents</a> whether they agreed or disagreed with the following statement: “There is solid evidence of recent global warming due mostly to human activity such as burning fossil fuels.” They collected information on individuals political beliefs, and rated their science intelligence.” The analysis found that those with the least science intelligence actually have less partisan positions than those with the most. A Conservative with strong science intelligence will use their skills to find evidence against human-caused global warming, while a Liberal will find evidence for it (cognitive bias.)&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>In the chart above, the y-axis represents the probability of a person agreeing that human activity caused climate change, and x-axis represents the percentile a person scored on the scientific knowledge test. The width of the bars shows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval">confidence interval</a> for that probability.</p><p>As a CDO a most disconcerting finding is that individuals with more “scientific intelligence” are the quickest to align themselves on subjects they don’t know anything about. In one experiment, Kahan analyzed how people’s opinions on an <a href="http://www.nanotechproject.org/file_download/files/NanotechRiskPerceptions-DanKahan.pdf">unfamiliar subject</a> is affected when given some basic scientific information, along with details about what people in their self-identified political group tend to believe about that subject. It turned out that those with the strongest scientific reasoning skills were the ones most likely to use the information to develop partisan opinions.</p><p>Critically Kahan’s research shows that people that score well on a measure called “scientific curiosity” actually show less partisanship, and it is this aspect we need to use.</p><p>As CDO’s, we need to move away from “truth”, “facts”, “data” and “right decisions” if we want to have a board and senior team who can become aligned.&nbsp; We need to present ideas, concepts, how others are finding solutions and make our teams more curious.&nbsp; Being curious appears to be the best way to bring us together - however counterintuitive that is.</p><br><p>-----</p><p>Whilst our ongoing agile iteration into <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-occurs-when-physical-beings-transition-to-information-beings-146ea9dcbca3">information beings</a> is never-ending, there are the first 100 days in the new role. But what to focus on? Well, that rose-tinted period of conflicting priorities is what <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/">&lt;/Hello, CDO!&gt;</a> is all about.

    Questions to help frame your own paradoxes <p>Leadership must be <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/in-leadership-why-is-recognising-paradox-critically-important">able to recognise the paradoxes created</a> as they decide on “<a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/what-are-we-optimising-for">what they are optimising for.</a>” The last article described two different starting points for the Peak Paradox model; <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/hello-world">finding paradox</a> and<a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/plotting-how-to-make-better-decisions"> living with paradox</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It is evident that the compromises we elect to live with become more focused as we agreed or decide on what we are optimising for.&nbsp; Such a focus has a benefit insomuch that the narrower and more articulate our view of optimised becomes, the more <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/plotting-how-to-make-better-decisions">decisions can become aligned</a>. However, the counter is that whilst a sharp focus and alignment will require less compromise for some, but it will equally increase the paradoxes/ compromises and tensions others will have to live with.&nbsp; One team can be aligned to a vision but not necessarily on how to get there or live with the chosen “optimised” approach.&nbsp; Stress is created by these differences and can create cracks and weaknesses in the team and culture. One vision, one culture, one team is very naive in any team more extensive than one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Sufficient dwell or thinking time is often not afforded to executive and leadership teams. Indeed board agendas are so packed and time so restricted there is little opportunity to debate or descent. The consequence of this reality is that insufficient time is allowed to consider the impacts of your optimising choices on others.&nbsp; Therefore over the next few posts, I will offer questions at different levels as per the <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/plotting-how-to-make-better-decisions">decision model</a> (below.)&nbsp; This is a <a href="https://opengovernance.net/choice-decision-making-and-judgment-is-your-relationship-constructive-or-destructive-c0e3b076e0a6">link</a> to a longer article on <a href="https://opengovernance.net/choice-decision-making-and-judgment-is-your-relationship-constructive-or-destructive-c0e3b076e0a6">choices, decisions, and judgment</a> as it frames; “are we asking the right questions?”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The outer yellow ring is the focus of this article. Below are five questions per “Peak” that should help facilitate a conversation to maximise benefits within this space or improve understanding of the compromises other will have to make to come to your peak.&nbsp;</p><p></p><br><br><p>As a reminder of what the peaks represent.&nbsp; The original <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/hello-world">detailed definitions of each peak are here.&nbsp;</a></p><p>Peak Individual Purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;At the exclusion of anything else, you are only interested in yourself.&nbsp; Selflessness at the extreme.&nbsp; You believe that you are sovereign (not having to ask anyone for permission or forgiveness), your voice and everything you say matters and everyone should agree. You are all-powerful and can do whatever you want and have the freedom and agency to do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Peak Work Purpose.&nbsp; At the exclusion of anything else, the only reason to work is to deliver as much possible value to the shareholders.&nbsp; Employees, customers, the environment does not matter in terms of exploitation.&nbsp; The purpose is to be the biggest and most efficient beast on the planet and able to deliver enormous returns; Shareholder Primacy at its most pure. Simple, clear, no conflict and no compromise, even to the point that rewarding the staff beyond fair would be a compromise.&nbsp; Compliance is met with the minimal standard ensuring that nothing is wasted.&nbsp; (note: it is not the reason an individual works, but a company works)</p><p>Peak Society Purpose. &nbsp;At the exclusion of anything else, we have to deliver and ensure there is no suffering and poverty for any living thing. Humans must have equal education, health and safety.&nbsp; There must be total transparency and equality.&nbsp; Everything is equally shared, and on-one has more power, agency or influence than anyone else.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Peak Human Purpose.&nbsp; At the exclusion of anything else, we are here to escape death which we do by reproducing as much as we can with the broadest community we can.&nbsp; We also have to adapt as fast as possible.&nbsp; We have to meet our chemistry requirements to stay alive for as long as possible to adopt and reproduce at the expense of anything else.&nbsp; Whilst all the peak purposes might be controversial (even to myself), saying purity of human purpose in chemistry/ biology might not go down very well. However, this is a model for framing thinking, so please go with it as it needs to be pure, and every other human purpose has conflicts with someone.</p><p>How would you answer these questions?</p><p></p><p></p><p>It should be evident that these questions try to frame you towards a natural one peak, but even at this level, you will have noticed that whilst you will align more to one peak than the others, but that you are full of paradoxes.&nbsp; Ask different questions, you will align to a different north star.&nbsp;</p><br><br><br>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/24/pl-pgsql-versus-pl-python-heres-why-im-using-both-to-write-postgres-functions/">episode 2</a> of this series I noted that the languages in which I’m writing Postgres functions share a common type system. It took me a while to understand how types work in the context of Postgres functions that can return sets of records and can interact with tables and materialized views.</p>
<p>Here is a set-returning function.</p>
 create function notes_for_user_in_group(
  _userid text, 
  _groupid text)
returns setof annotation as $$
  begin
    return query 
      select * from annotation
      where userid = concat('acct:', _userid)
      and groupid = _groupid;
  end;
$$ language plpgsql;
 
<p>In this case the type that governs the returned set has already been defined: it’s the schema for the annotation table.</p>



Column
Type




id
uuid


created
timestamp without time zone


updated
timestamp without time zone


userid

groupid

target_uri

target_uri_normalized

target_selectors

document_id

<p>The function returns records matching a userid and groupid. I can now find the URLs of documents most recently annotated by me.</p>
 select
  target_uri
from notes_for_user_in_group('judell@hypothes.is', '__world__')
order by created desc
limit 3;
 
<p>The Postgres response:</p>
                  target_uri                  
---------------------------------------------
 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20020501
 https://www.infoworld.com/article/2886828/github-for-the-rest-of-us.html
 https://web.hypothes.is/help/formatting-annotations-with-markdown/
 http://example.com                          
(3 rows)
 
<p>You might wonder why the function’s parameters are prefixed with underscores. That’s because variables used in functions can conflict with names of columns in tables. Since none of our column names begin with underscore, it’s a handy differentiator. Suppose the function’s signature were instead:</p>
 create function notes_for_user_in_group(
  userid text, 
  groupid text)
 
<p>Postgres would complain about a confict:</p>
 ERROR:  column reference "userid" is ambiguous
LINE 2:       where userid = concat('acct:', userid)
                    ^
DETAIL:  It could refer to either a PL/pgSQL variable or a table column.
 
<p>The table has userid and groupid columns that conflict with their eponymous variables. So for functions that combine variables and database values I prefix variable names with underscore.</p>
<p>Set-returning functions can be called in any SQL SELECT context. In the example above that context is psql, Postgres’ powerful and multi-talented REPL (read-eval-print loop). For an example of a different context, let’s cache the function’s result set in a materialized view.</p>
 create materialized view public_notes_for_judell as (
  select
    *
  from notes_for_user_in_group('judell@hypothes.is', '__world__')
  order by created desc
) with data;
 
<p>Postgres reports success by showing the new view’s record count.</p>
 SELECT 3972
 
<p>The view’s type is implicitly annotation; its schema matches the one shown above; selecting target_uri from the view is equivalent to selecting target_uri from the setof annotation returned from the function notes_for_user_in_group.</p>
 select
  target_uri
from public_notes_for_judell
limit 3;
 
<p>The Postgres response is the same as above.</p>
                  target_uri                  
---------------------------------------------
 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20020501
 https://www.infoworld.com/article/2886828/github-for-the-rest-of-us.html
 https://web.hypothes.is/help/formatting-annotations-with-markdown/
 http://example.com                          
(3 rows)
 
<p>It shows up a lot faster though! Every time you select the function’s result set, the wrapped query has to run. For this particular example that can take a few seconds. It costs the same amount of time to create the view. But once that’s done you can select its contents in milliseconds.</p>
<p>Now let’s define a function that refines notes_for_user_in_group by reporting the count of notes for each annotated document.</p>
 create function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(
  _userid text, 
  _groupid text)
returns table (
  count bigint,
  userid text,
  groupid text,
  url text
) as $$
  begin
    return query
      select
        count(n.*) as anno_count,
        n.userid,
        n.groupid,
        n.target_uri
      from notes_for_user_in_group(_userid, _groupid) n
      group by n.userid, n.groupid, n.target_uri                          
      order by anno_count desc;
  end;
$$ language plpgsql;
 
<p>Instead of returning a setof some named type, this function returns an anonymous table. I’ve aliased the set-returning function call notes_for_user_in_group as n and used the alias to qualify the names of selected columns. That avoids another naming conflict. If you write userid instead of n.userid in the body of the function and then call it, Postgres again complains about a conflict.</p>
 ERROR:  column reference "userid" is ambiguous
LINE 3:         userid,
                ^
DETAIL:  It could refer to either a PL/pgSQL variable or a table column.
 
<p>Here’s a sample call to our new function..</p>
 select 
  *
from annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(
  'judell',
  'hypothes.is',
  '__world__'
);
 
<p>The result:</p>
  count | userid             | groupid   | target_uri
-------+---------------------------------------------
   516 | judell@hypothes.is | __world__ | http://shakespeare.mit.edu/macbeth/full.html
    73 | judell@hypothes.is | __world__ | https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/india-floods-bangladesh-nepal-deaths-millions-homeless-latest-news-updates-a7919006.html

<p>Now let’s create a view based on that function.</p>
 create materialized view url_counts_for_public_notes_by_judell as (
  select 
    *
  from annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(
    'judell@hypothes.is',
    '__world__'
  )
) with data;
 
<p>Postgres says:</p>
 SELECT 1710
 
<p>When you ask for the definition of that view using the \d command in psql:</p>
<p>\d url_counts_for_public_notes_by_judell</p>
<p>It responds with the same table definition used when creating the function.</p>
  Column  |  Type  
---------+--------
 count   | bigint
 userid  | text
 groupid | text
 url     | text   
 
<p>Behind the scenes Postgres has created this definition from the anonymous table returned by the function.</p>
<p>To revise the function so that it uses a named type, first create the type.</p>
 create type annotated_docs_for_user_in_group as (
  count bigint,
  userid text,
  groupid text,
  url text
);
 
<p>Postgres reports success:</p>
 CREATE TYPE
 
<p>Now we can use that named type in the function. Since we’re redefining the function, first drop it.</p>
 drop function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group;
 
<p>Uh oh. Postgres is unhappy about that.</p>
 ERROR:  cannot drop function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(text,text) because other objects depend on it
DETAIL:  materialized view url_counts_for_public_notes_by_judell depends on function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(text,text)
HINT:  Use DROP ... CASCADE to drop the dependent objects too.
 
<p>A view that depends on a function must be recreated when the function’s signature changes. I’ll say more about this in a future episode on set-returning functions that dynamically cache their results in materialized views. For now, since the view we just created is a contrived throwaway, just drop it along with the function by using CASCADE as Postgres recommends.</p>
 drop function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group cascade;
 
<p>Postgres says:</p>
 NOTICE:  drop cascades to materialized view url_counts_for_public_notes_by_judell
DROP FUNCTION
 
<p>Now we can recreate a version of the function that returns setof annotated_docs_for_user_in_group instead of an anonymous table(...)</p>
 create function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(
  _userid text, 
  _groupid text)
returns setof annotated_docs_for_user_in_group as $$
  begin
    return query
      select
        count(n.*) as anno_count,
        n.userid,
        n.groupid,
        n.target_uri
      from notes_for_user_in_group(_userid, _groupid) n
      group by n.userid, n.groupid, n.target_uri                          
      order by anno_count desc;
  end;
$$ language plpgsql;
 
<p>The results are the same as above. So why do it this way? In many cases I don’t. It’s extra overhead to declare a type. And just as a view can depend on a function, a function can depend on a type. To see why you might not want such dependencies, suppose we want to also track the most recent note for each URL.</p>
 create type annotated_docs_for_user_in_group as (
  count bigint,
  userid text,
  groupid text,
  url text,
  most_recent_note timestamp
);
 
<p>That won’t work.</p>
 ERROR:  type "annotated_docs_for_user_in_group" already exists
 
<p>Dropping the type won’t work either.</p>
 ERROR:  cannot drop type annotated_docs_for_user_in_group because other objects depend on it                           
DETAIL:  function annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(text,text,text) depends on type annotated_docs_for_user_in_group    
HINT:  Use DROP ... CASCADE to drop the dependent objects too.
 
<p>To redefine the type you have to do a cascading drop and then recreate functions that depend on the type. If any of those views depend on dropped functions, the drop cascades to them as well and they also must be recreated. That’s why I often write functions that return table(...) rather than setof TYPE. In dynamic languages it’s convenient to work with untyped bags of values; I find the same to be true when writing functions in Postgres.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, it’s useful to declare and use types. In my experience so far it makes most sense to do that in Postgres when you find yourself writing the same returns table(...) statement in several related functions. Let’s say we want a function that combines the results of annotated_docs_for_user_in_group for some set of users.</p>
 create function annotated_docs_for_users_in_group(_userids text[], _groupid text)
  returns setof annotated_docs_for_user_in_group as $$
    begin
      return query 
        with userids as (
          select unnest(_userids) as userid
        )
        select 
          a.*
        from userids u
        join annotated_docs_for_user_in_group(u.userid, _groupid) a
          on a.userid = concat('acct:', u.userid);
    end;
$$ language plpgsql;
 
<p>This new function uses the SQL WITH clause to create a common table expression (CTE) that converts an inbound array of userids into a transient table-like object, named userids, with one userid per row. The new function’s wrapped SQL then joins that CTE to the set returned from annotated_docs_for_user_in_group and returns the joined result.</p>
<p>(You can alternatively do this in a more procedural way by creating a loop variable and marching through the array to accumulate results. Early on I used that approach but in the context of Postgres functions I’ve come to prefer the more purely SQL-like set-oriented style.)</p>
<p>Sharing a common type between the two functions makes them simpler to write and easier to read. More importantly it connects them to one another and to all views derived from them. If I do decide to add most_recent_note to the type, Postgres will require me to adjust all depending functions and views so things remain consistent. That can be a crucial guarantee, and as we’ll see in a future episode it’s a key enabler of an advanced caching mechanism.</p>

In that, the seed for the Trustee DID is well known, so once you’ve started the von-network, you can control it. In a “real” network, that seed (and associated private key) would of course be protected by that first Trustee.<br>For Sovrin, a ceremony was video’d of all the initial Trustees and Stewards (node operators) when MainNet was started in 2017.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/21/a-virtuous-cycle-for-analytics/">A virtuous cycle for analytics</a> I noted that our library of Postgres functions is written in two languages: Postgres’ built-in pl/pgsql and the installable alternative pl/python. These share a common type system and can be used interchangeably.</p>
<p>Here’s a pl/pgsql classifier that tries to match the name of a course against a list of patterns that characterize the humanities.</p>
 create function humanities_classifier(course_name text) returns boolean as $$
  begin
    return
      lower(course_name) ~ any(array[
        'psych',
        'religio',
        'soci'
        ]);
  end;
$$ language plpgsql;

# select humanities_classifier('Religious Studies 101') as match;
match
-----
t

# select humanities_classifier('Comparative Religions 200') as match;
match
-----
t
 
<p>Here is that same classifier in Python.</p>
 create function humanities_classifier(course_name text) returns boolean as $$
  sql = f"""
    select lower('{course_name}') ~ any(array[
      'psych',
      'religio',
      'soci'
      ]) as match"""
  results = plpy.execute(sql)
  return results[0]['match']
$$ language plpython3u;

# select humanities_classifier('Religious Studies 101') as match;
match
-----
t

# select humanities_classifier('Comparative Religions 200') as match;
match
-----
t
 
<p>The results are exactly the same. In this case, Python is only wrapping the SQL used in the orginal function and interpolating course_name into it. So why use pl/python here? I wouldn’t. The pl/pgsql version is cleaner and simpler because the SQL body doesn’t need to be quoted and course_name doesn’t need to be interpolated into it.</p>
<p>Here’s a more Pythonic version of the classifier.</p>
 create function humanities_classifier(course_name text) returns boolean as $$
  import re
  regexes = [
    'psych',
    'religio',
    'soci'
  ]
  matches = [r for r in regexes if re.search(r, course_name, re.I)]
  return len(matches)
$$ language plpython3u;
 
<p>There’s no SQL here, this is pure Python. Is there any benefit to doing things this way? In this case probably not. The native Postgres idiom for matching a string against a list of regular expressions is cleaner and simpler than the Python technique shown here. A Python programmer will be more familiar with list comprehensions than with the Postgres any and ~ operators but if you’re working in Postgres you’ll want to know about those, and use them not just in functions but in all SQL contexts.</p>
<p>What about performance? You might assume as I did that a pl/pgsql function is bound to be way faster than its pl/python equivalent. Let’s check that assumption. This SQL exercises both flavors of the function, which finds about 500 matches in a set of 30,000 names.</p>
 with matching_courses as (
  select humanities_classifier(name) as match
  from lms_course_groups
) 

select count(*) 
from matching_courses
where match;
 
<p>Here are the results for three runs using each flavor of the function:</p>
  pl/pgsql: 159ms, 201ms, 125ms

pl/python: 290ms, 255ms, 300ms
 
<p>The Python flavor is slower but not order-of-magnitude slower; I’ve seen cases where a pl/python function outperforms its pl/pgsql counterpart.</p>
<p>So, what is special about Python functions inside Postgres? In my experience so far there are three big reasons to use it.</p>
<p>Python modules</p>
<p>The ability to wield any of Python’s built-in or loadable modules inside Postgres brings great power. That entails great responsibility, as the Python extension is “untrusted” (that’s the ‘u’ in ‘plpython3u’) and can do anything Python can do on the host system: read and write files, make network requests.</p>
<p>Here’s one of my favorite examples so far. Given a set of rows that count daily or weekly annotations for users in a group — so for weekly accounting each row has 52 columns — the desired result for the whole group is the element-wise sum of the rows. That’s not an easy thing in SQL but it’s trivial using numpy, and in pl/python it happens at database speed because there’s no need to transfer SQL results to an external Python program.</p>
<p>Metaprogramming</p>
<p>Functions can write and then run SQL queries. It’s overkill for simple variable interpolation; as shown above pl/pgsql does that handily without the cognitive overhead and visual clutter of poking values into a SQL string. For more advanced uses that compose queries from SQL fragments, though, pl/pgsql is hopeless. You can do that kind of thing far more easily, and more readably, in Python.</p>
<p>Introspection</p>
<p>A pl/python function can discover and use its own name. That’s the key enabler for a mechanism that memoizes the results of a function by creating a materialized view whose name combines the name of the function with the value of a parameter to the function. This technique has proven to be wildly effective.</p>
<p>I’ll show examples of these scenarios in later installments of this series. For now I just want to explain why I’ve found these two ways of writing Postgres functions to be usefully complementary. The key points are:</p>
<p>– They share a common type system.</p>
<p>– pl/pgsql, despite its crusty old syntax, suffices for many things.</p>
<p>– pl/python leverages Python’s strengths where they are most strategic</p>
<p>When I began this journey it wasn’t clear when you’d prefer one over the other, or why it might make sense to use both in complementary ways. This installment is what I’d like to have known when I started.</p>

<p>Suppose you’re a member of a team that runs a public web service. You need to help both internal and external users make sense of all the data that’s recorded as it runs. That’s been my role for the past few years, now it’s time to summarize what I’ve learned.</p>
<p>The web service featured in this case study is the Hypothesis web annotation system. The primary database, Postgres, stores information about users, groups, documents, courses, and annotations. Questions that our team needs to answer include:</p>
<p>– How many students created annotations last semester?</p>
<p>– In how many courses at each school?</p>
<p>Questions from instructors using Hypothesis in their courses include:</p>
<p>– Which passages in course readings are attracting highlights and discussion?</p>
<p>– Who is asking questions about those passages, and who is responding?</p>
<p>Early on we adopted a tool called Metabase that continues to be a pillar of our analytics system. When Metabase was hooked up to our Postgres database the team could start asking questions without leaning on developers. Some folks used the interactive query builder, while others went straight to writing SQL that Metabase passes through to Postgres.</p>
<p>Before long we had a large catalog of Metabase questions that query Postgres and display results as tables or charts that can be usefully arranged on Metabase dashboards. It’s all nicely RESTful. Interactive elements that can parameterize queries, like search boxes and date pickers, map to URLs. Queries can emit URLs in order to compose themselves with other queries. I came to see this system as a kind of lightweight application server in which to incubate an analytics capability that could later be expressed more richly.</p>
<p>Over time, and with growing amounts of data, early success with this approach gave way to two kinds of frustration: queries began to choke, and the catalog of Metabase questions became unmanageable. And so, in the time-honored tradition, we set up a data warehouse for analytics. Ours is another instance of Postgres that syncs nightly with the primary database. There are lots of other ways to skin the cat but it made sense to leverage ops experience with Postgres and I had a hunch that it would do well in this role.</p>
<p>To unthrottle the choking queries I began building materialized views that cache the results of Postgres queries. Suppose a query makes use of available indexes but still takes a few minutes, or maybe even an hour, to run. It still takes that long to build the corresponding materialized view, but once built other queries can use its results immediately. Metabase questions that formerly included chunks of SQL began reducing to select * from {viewname}.</p>
<p>This process continues to unfold in a highly productive way. Team members may or may not hit a performance wall as they try to use Metabase to answer their questions. When they do, we can convert the SQL text of a Metabase question to a Postgres materialized view that gets immediate results. Such views can join with others, and/or with underlying tables, in SQL SELECT contexts. The views become nouns in a language that expresses higher-order business concepts.</p>
<p>The verbs in this language turned out to be Postgres functions written in the native procedural language, pl/pgsql, and later also in its Python counterpart, pl/python. Either flavor can augment built-in Postgres library functions with user-defined functions that can return simple values, like numbers and strings, but can also return sets that behave in SQL SELECT contexts just like tables and views.</p>
<p>Functions were, at first, a way to reuse chunks of SQL that otherwise had to be duplicated across Metabase questions and Postgres CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW statements. That made it possible to streamline and refactor both bodies of code and sanely maintain them.</p>
<p>To visualize what had now become a three-body system of sources in which Metabase questions, Postgres views, and Postgres functions can call (or link to) one another, I wrote a tool that builds a crosslinked concordance. That made it practical to reason effectively about the combined system.</p>
<p>Along the way I have learned how Postgres, and more broadly <a href="https://modern-sql.com/">modern SQL</a>, in conjunction with a tool like Metabase, can enable a team like ours to make sense of data. There’s plenty to say about the techniques I’ve evolved, and I aim to write them up over time. The details won’t interest most people, but here’s an outcome that might be noteworthy.</p>
<blockquote><p>Team member: I had an idea that will help manage our communication with customers, and I’ve prototyped it in a Metabase question.</p>
<p>Toolsmith: Great! Here’s a Postgres function that encapsulates and refines your SQL. It’s fast enough for now, but if needed we can convert it into a materialized view. Now you can use that function in another Metabase question that projects your SQL across a set of customers that you can select.</p></blockquote>
<p>That interaction forms the basis of a virtuous cycle: The team member formulates a question and does their best to answer it using Metabase; the toolsmith captures the intent and re-expresses it in a higher-level business language; the expanded language enables the team member to go farther in a next cycle.</p>
<p>We recognize this software pattern in the way application programmers who push a system to its limits induce systems programmers to respond with APIs that expand those limits. I suppose it’s harder to see when the application environment is Metabase and the systems environment is Postgres. But it’s the same pattern, and it is powerful.</p>

<p>今日、故あって、銀座のエルメス・ギャラリーでやっているマチュウ・コプランによる展覧会「エキシビジョン・カッティングス」<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2021/07/4810/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-4810" title="Le Forum「エキシビジョン・カッティングス」<br>マチュウ・コプランによる展覧会&amp;#8221;Exhibition Cuttings&amp;#8221; An exhibition by Mathieu Copeland　2021.4.23（金）～7.31（土）<a href=&quot;https://www.hermes.com/jp/ja/story/maison-ginza/forum/210423/&quot;>https://www.hermes.com/jp/ja/story/maison-ginza/forum/210423/</a>">1</a>に行ってきました。アートシーンには全く疎いのですが、前回の東京オリンピックの1964年というと、日本は世界をリードしてたころでなんですね。</p>



<p>大パノラマ展とか<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2021/07/4810/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-4810" title="検索してもあんまり良い情報が出てこないので、「エキシビジョン・カッティングス」に行くのおすすめです。これに続く一連の世界での動きと合わせて勉強できます。ところで、ヨーコ・オノってすごかったんですね。">2</a></p>



<p>普通は画廊での個展は初日は華やかにレセプションとかあるものですが、これは画廊を封鎖して始まり、個展の終わりに封鎖を解いて祝って終わるという反展覧会 Anti-Exhabition。それに続く世界各地でのアートの商業化に対するアンチテーゼの動きを見て、色々考えるところがありました。</p>



<p>それの一つが、あり得たもう一つのオリンピック開会式。</p>



<p>コロナでロックダウンの時期だったんだから、それにふさわしく反開会式 Anti-Opening にして、選手は誰も入場せず、オリンピック村の自室のバルコニーにソーシャルディスタンスで並び、国立競技場にはバッハ会長他オリンピック貴族と関係者だけがいるのをずっと画面半分でTV中継、もう半分ではドローンで宿舎バルコニーを国別に写して回る。音楽はケージの4分33秒でコロナでなくなった方々と、「復興五輪」なんだから10年前の震災で亡くなった方々に黙祷を捧げる。後者に関しては、復興の現状を包み隠さず写す。</p>



<p>オリンピックの最中は、IOC貴族たちにカメラが密着。東京オリンピックとしてのアートタッチのドキュメンタリーを残す。</p>



<p>選手たちが一同に会すのはもちろん閉会式の最後までお預けです。残った人たちだけですが。残らなかった人たちは大スクリーンでバーチャル参加ですね。</p>



<p>最後の最後に誰か象徴的な人（誰が良いですかね）がオリンピック貴族たちを排除してアスリートたちが集まり、商業主義との決別を宣言<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2021/07/4810/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-4810" title="スポーツ団体の資金源がこのへんだから無理は重々承知ですが。">3</a>するとか。LAオリンピック以来ずっとではありますが、今回は特にこれだけ商業主義とアテンションエコノミーの暗黒を見せつけている<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2021/07/4810/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-4810" title="小山田圭吾問題とかのぶみ問題とか、アテンションを取れる人を選ぶという広告代理店的思考ですよね">4</a>オリンピックなのでちょっと妄想してみました。</p>The post <a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2021/07/4810/">あり得たもう一つのオリンピック開会式</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.sakimura.org">@_Nat Zone</a>.

‘hexadaisy layout’ by Darla available at <a href="https://flic.kr/p/e6MH6e">http://www.flickr.com/photos/pedrosz/2040577615</a> under a Attribution 2.0 Generic (CC BY 2.0)&nbsp;license<p>When Open Badges was kicking off ten years ago (<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/5/59/OpenBadges-Working-Paper_012312.pdf">see the original white paper</a>), it was conceived to be a recognition infrastructure for skills attained and achievements accomplished anywhere at any time. Badges could assert skills learned informally, formally, really in any aspect of and through life. It was hoped that recruiters, employers, and others could evaluate the badges to find people who had skills that aligned with the opportunities being offered. It was envisioned they could work like other types of credentials such as degrees and certifications, “but with room for much more granular or diverse skill representation” and available opportunities to capture these&nbsp;skills.</p><p>The infrastructure for this type of recognition system was a format called a digital badge. More than just a digital sticker, the badges would be filled with metadata properties describing the skills and achievements. Then the badges could convey the metadata both as human readable and machine readable content. By having a standard to describe the metadata and how it would be verified, Open Badges became usable in many technologies and contexts. For the most part, this resulted in badges being shared online on issuing platforms and social media — more as a tool for human understanding than one that took full advantage of the potential for machine readability.</p><p>Since then, the ethos of Open Badges, recognizing skills anywhere and anytime, has strengthened. Growth has accelerated, especially in the past few years. IMS Global and Credential Engine’s <a href="http://content.imsglobal.org/badge-count-2020/badge-count-2020/">Badge Count 2020 Report</a> indicated that there’d been an 80% increase in issued badges since 2018. Its use has expanded into more formal institutional contexts, the metadata have evolved, and initiatives have risen around it including the <a href="https://www.openrecognition.org/">Open Recognition Alliance</a>, <a href="https://www.thebadgesummit.com/">Badge Summit</a>, and the <a href="https://www.openskillsnetwork.org/">Open Skills&nbsp;Network</a>.</p><p>Over the years, internet technologies have evolved too and a credential verification model at the W3C called <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> has gained traction. This verification model can be used for any type of credential including passports, drivers licenses, and educational credentials like Open Badges. In fact, members of the Open Badges community helped to write the very first <a href="https://opencreds.org/specs/source/use-cases/">use cases</a> for Verifiable Credentials back in 2018. This was because we knew then that if Open Badges data were to be trusted by apps, they not only needed to be readable by machines, they needed to be verifiable.</p><p>The Verifiable Credential model can provide security and privacy enhancements not yet available to Open Badges. This model gives learners persistent access to their badges increasing the longevity and resilience of credentials that were intended to promote and support lifelong learning. A more secure and universally supported verification model such as Verifiable Credentials enables Open Badges to become the personal skills currency it was originally envisioned to&nbsp;be.</p><p><a href="https://concentricsky.com/">Concentric Sky</a> (<a href="https://info.badgr.com/">Badgr</a>) has offered a <a href="https://github.com/concentricsky/openbadges-specification/blob/feature/ob3/proposals/OBv3p0/Proposal-Open-Badges-3.0.pdf">proposal for a new version of Open Badges</a> that explains what is needed to make it work within the Verifiable Credentials model. The use cases in the proposal provide scenarios where Open Badges are earned and then how they are exchanged. In one use case, a medical professional is able to start her new job sooner because her CME’s can be quickly verified:</p><p>Verifying Continuing Ed: Denise was offered a new job at a hospital as a physician assistant. Before starting, her continuing education training and license to practice needed to be verified. The last time she switched hospitals, the verification process took three weeks. This time, she was able to provide her badges to prove her training and license. Within minutes her credentials were verified and she was issued a new digital staff credential</p><p>In another use case, a career change is facilitated by using verifiable Open Badges to map skills to&nbsp;jobs:</p><p>Mapping Skills: Sid is shifting careers after many years working in construction. In his digital wallet he had several skill badges describing his mastery of several skills in construction but also in teamwork, communication, and organizational skills. Sid also had badges from some courses he’d taken in science and math over the last few years. After he uploaded the skill and course badges from his wallet to a career planning site, he was offered several opportunities to apply for work in software sales and cybersecurity.</p><p>Here’s an example of how an Open Badge as a Verifiable Credential (Open Badges 3.0) exchange could&nbsp;work:</p>  A learner connects to a badge issuing platform with their digital wallet app on their phone or&nbsp;laptop.  Once authenticated, the issuer provides the badge to the learner who puts it in their wallet. The badge data contains cryptographic proof that identifies the issuer and the&nbsp;learner.  A job employment app asks for proof that the applicant has experience with a requirement needed for that&nbsp;role.  The learner presents the job employment app with the badge using the digital wallet app. The job employment app can then verify<br>a. that the learner providing the badge is the recipient of that badge<br>b. that the issuer is the identity that issued the badge, and<br>c. that the badge data has not changed since it was&nbsp;issued.  The verifier responds that the badge is authentic.  <p>In comparison, here’s an Open Badges 2.0&nbsp;flow:</p>  A learner or an organization provides an issuer app with the learner’s email&nbsp;address  The Issuer generates badge data that includes the email address as the recipient identity and sends the earner the badge (typically as a link to a web&nbsp;page)  The earner can share the link on social media, or perhaps with a potential employer or a job application app.  The badge is verified by either<br>a. a human looking at the web page where the badge is hosted or<br>b. the application attempts to retrieve the badge data from a url hosted by the&nbsp;issuer.  <p>The Open Badges 2.0 example depends on the issuer hosting the data and relies on an email address for the learner. The Open Badges 3.0 example is self-contained and doesn’t require the issuer to continue to retain a web hosting provider in order for the credential to remain valid. Instead it uses cryptographic proof to authenticate the badge, the issuer, as well as the learner who earned it. With either example, the learner has a way to proudly share their achievement online but the Open Badges 3.0 method doesn’t rely on that online presence for verification. In fact, the original issuer may no longer exist, but the achievements can still be verified.</p><p>On Monday July 19, we’ll be reviewing the <a href="https://github.com/concentricsky/openbadges-specification/blob/feature/ob3/proposals/OBv3p0/Proposal-Open-Badges-3.0.pdf">Open Badges 3.0 proposal</a> and anyone is invited to join us to learn more. Here’s the meeting&nbsp;info:</p><p>Monday, July 19, 2021<br>Time: 8am PDT / 11am EDT / 4pm BST, 5pm CEST<br>Jitsi Web Conference: <a href="https://meet.w3c-ccg.org/education">https://meet.w3c-ccg.org/education</a><br>US phone: tel:+1.602.932.2243;3</p><p>On Thursday, July 22, Concentric Sky will be presenting this proposal to the IMS Global Open Badges working group to seek the members’ go-ahead to move forward on the work to make Open Badges 3.0 a reality.

<p>In The Chess Master and the Computer, Garry Kasparov famously wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The winner was revealed to be not a grandmaster with a state-of-the-art PC but a pair of amateur American chess players using three computers at the same time. Their skill at manipulating and “coaching” their computers to look very deeply into positions effectively counteracted the superior chess understanding of their grandmaster opponents and the greater computational power of other participants. Weak human + machine + better process was superior to a strong computer alone and, more remarkably, superior to a strong human + machine + inferior process.</p></blockquote>
<p>The title of his subsequent TED talk sums it up nicely: Don’t fear intelligent machines. Work with them.</p>
<p>That advice resonates powerfully as I begin a second work week augmented by GitHub Copilot, a coding assistant based on OpenAI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-3). Here is Copilot’s tagline: “Your AI pair programmer: get suggestions for whole lines or entire functions right inside your editor.” If you’re not a programmer, a good analogy is Gmail’s offer of suggestions to finish sentences you’ve begun to type.</p>
<p>In mainstream news the dominant stories are about copyright (“Copilot doesn’t respect software licenses”), security (“Copilot leaks passwords”), and quality (“Copilot suggests wrong solutions”). Tech Twitter amplifies these and adds early hot takes about dramatic Copilot successes and flops. As I follow these stories, I’m thinking of another. GPT-3 is an intelligent machine. How can we apply Kasparov’s advice to work effectively with it?</p>
<p>Were I still a tech journalist I’d be among the first wave of hot takes. Now I spend most days in Visual Studio Code, the environment in which Copilot runs, working most recently on analytics software. I don’t need to produce hot takes, I can just leave Copilot running and reflect on notable outcomes.</p>
<p>Here was the first notable outcome. In the middle of writing some code I needed to call a library function that prints a date. In this case the language context was Python, but might as easily have been JavaScript or SQL or shell. Could I memorize the date-formatting functions for all these contexts? Actually, yes, I believe that’s doable and might even be beneficial. But that’s a topic for another day. Let’s stipulate that we can remember a lot more than we think we can. We’ll still need to look up many things, and doing a lookup is a context-switching operation that often disrupts flow.</p>
<p>In this example I would have needed a broad search to recall the name of the date-formatting function that’s available in Python: strftime. Then I’d have needed to search more narrowly to find the recipe for printing a date object in a format like Mon Jan 01. A good place for that search to land is <a href="https://strftime.org/">https://strftime.org/</a>, where Will McCutchen has helpfully summarized several dozen directives that govern the strftime function.</p>
<p>Here’s the statement I needed to write:</p>
<p>day = day.strftime('%a %d %b')</p>
<p>Here’s where the needed directives appear in the documentation:</p>
<p></p>
<p>To prime Copilot I began with a comment:</p>
<p># format day as Mon Jun 15</p>
<p>Copilot suggested the exact strftime incantation I needed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is exactly the kind of example-driven assistance that I was hoping <a href="https://twitter.com/GitHubCopilot?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@githubcopilot</a> would provide. Life's too short to remember, or even look up, strptime and strftime.</p>
<p>(It turns out that June 15 was a Tuesday, that doesn't matter, Mon Jun 15 was just an example.) <a href="https://t.co/a1epnaZRF9">pic.twitter.com/a1epnaZRF9</a></p>
<p>— Jon Udell (@judell) <a href="https://twitter.com/judell/status/1412111420561367059?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 5, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Now it’s not hard to find a page like Will’s, and once you get there it’s not hard to pick out the needed directives. But when you’re in the flow of writing a function, avoiding that context switch doesn’t only save time. There is an even more profound benefit: it conserves attention and preserves flow.</p>
<p>The screencast embedded in the above tweet gives you a feel for the dynamic interaction. When I get as far as # format day as M, Copilot suggests MMDDYYY even before I write Mon, then adjusts as I do that. This tight feedback loop helps me explore the kinds of natural examples I can use to prime the system for the lookup.</p>
<p>For this particular pattern I’m not yet getting the same magical result in JavaScript, SQL, or shell contexts, but I expect that’ll change as Copilot watches me and others try the same example and arrive at the analogous solutions in these other languages.</p>
<p>I’m reminded of <a href="http://jonudell.net/udell/gems/delicious/delicious.html">Language evolution with del.icio.us</a>, from 2005, in which I explored the dynamics of the web’s original social bookmarking system. To associate a bookmarked resource with a shared concept you’d assign it a tag broadly used for that concept. Of course the tags we use for a given concept often vary. Your choice of cinema or movie or film was a way to influence the set of resources associated with your tag, and thus encourage others to use the same tag in the same way.</p>
<p>That kind of linguistic evolution hasn’t yet happened at large scale. I hope Copilot will become an environment in which it can. Intentional use of examples is one way to follow Kasparov’s advice for working well with intelligent systems.</p>
<p>Here’s a contrived Copilot session that suggests what I mean. The result I am looking for is the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].<br>
<code><br>
l1 = [1, 2, 3]<br>
l2 = [3, 4, 5]<br>
# merge the two lists<br>
l3 = l1 + l2 # no: [1, 2, 3, 3, 5]<br>
# combine as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br>
l3 = l1 + l2 # no: [1, 2, 3, 3, 5]<br>
# deduplicate the two lists<br>
l1 = list(set(l1)) # no: [1, 2, 3]<br>
# uniquely combine the lists<br>
l3 = list(set(l1) | set(l2))  # yes: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br>
# merge and deduplicate the lists<br>
l3 = list(set(l1 + l2)) # yes: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br>
</code></p>
<p>The last two Copilot suggestions are correct; the final (and simplest) one would be my choice. If I contribute that choice to a public GitHub repository am I voting to reinforce an outcome that’s already popular? If I instead use the second comment (combine as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) am I instead voting for a show-by-example approach (like Mon Jun 15) that isn’t yet as popular in this case but might become so? It’s hard for me — and likely even for Copilot itself — to know exactly how Copilot works. That’s going to be part of the challenge of working well with intelligent machines. Still, I hope for (and mostly expect) a fruitful partnership in which our descriptions of intent will influence the mechanical synthesis even as it influences our descriptions.</p>

 Core issue with crypto / stable-coins <p>The biggest unsolved issue with crypto&nbsp;is</p>  its abuse as facilitator of ransomeware / extortion — causing continuous tightening of regulations.  Pseudo-anonymous money laundering that causes traceable risks to Banks (unlike cash which is completely anonymous) — causing <a href="https://www.state.gov/de-risking/">“de-risking”</a> and therefore resulting in extreme and continuous friction for crypto to go mainstream.  <p>Due to the irreversible nature of crypto-currencies together with pseudo-anonymous traceability of dirty money, banks face unlimited risk in serving as on-ramps or off-ramps to&nbsp;crypto.</p> US-banking grade KYC at a global level is not possible with current technology   Identity document can be tampered or stolen — any document can be photoshopped. There is no global database of “photos/biometric” and therefore it is possible to create fake/stolen identities easily.  Impersonation checks don’t exist — There is a 15% error rate in verifying peoples faces with hi-resolution photos in passports by trained immigration professionals in a physical setting. Matching a digital photo with scanned ID by untrained staff or even AI is just no possible.  Address checks don’t exist — There is no global method to verify current address of a given person. Any utility bill can be photoshopped or&nbsp;stolen.  <p>Current Gold standard for digital on-boarding is bank verification by linking your account or verifying test-deposits of few cents in your bank but it only works domestically.</p>  The issue is that this kind of linking of accounts is not possible internationally over a swift&nbsp;network.  The alternative solutions like Plaid do not give global coverage and only work in core few developed countries.  <p>In current scenario— Banks in most countries like switzerland, singapore, UK etc require physical visits or otherwise extremely cumbersome Notary / appostille of documents to even open non-crypto accounts.</p> DIRO is a fundamental new technology <p>that eliminates these bottlenecks not just for crypto-currencies but horizontally for many traditional industries.</p>  Makes Global impersonation check possible — it is the first breakthrough technology that not only turns each and every institutional / government/ corporate website into an identity authenticator. This new technology extends the Gold standard (like Plaid) for US-banking grade identity verification at a global&nbsp;scale.  Makes Global address check possible — can verify any current utility bill from any country, any language, any company be it Telephone, Gas, Electricity, TV, Internet, Municipal taxes or&nbsp;even  100% global coverage — without the need for any third party cooperation/ APIs or agreements.  100% guaranteed — DIRO leverages the time tested and battle tested SSL/TLS technology and blockchain to generate mathematically provable and court-admissible evidence. The documents produced using DIRO are even stronger than physical originals.  <p>Privacy and data protection — The documents produced by DIRO are not only reportable and audit-able by third-parties and regulators but also provide decentralised verification on blockchain (without the typical “phone-home privacy problem”). The access to global private data behind login and passwords are accessed by the USER under is GDPR right to access his own data while automatically providing consent for verification to&nbsp;proceed.</p>

    What is NEW in this article about decision making? <p>The new part explains the relationship between choices, decisions and judgement and how our questions indicate if our relationship is curious and constructive OR linear, framed, and destructive.&nbsp; This article is part of a <a href="https://www.digital20.com/masterclass">masterclass</a> I have been creating on how we, as directors and those in leadership, can improve our choices, decisions and judgements using data and be better ancestors.&nbsp;</p><p>This article is not another self-help or “use this framework to improve decision making”; it is for the curious and those who ask questions on their journey. The refelction at the end should be "How does this article affect our views on the automation of decision making and the use of AI?"</p> Why is this an important topic? <p>Our individual and unique view of the world comprises layers of constructs created by our personality, biases, preferences, facts, and ideas learnt from past experiences.&nbsp; These constructs are better known as “mental models”, which frame how we individually make sense of or align to the world. We continually develop sense-making frameworks, models, and maps in our brains that frame what we perceive as reality, thus affecting our behaviour and, consequently, our Choices, decisions, and Judgments (CDJ).</p><p>Whilst we don’t like it, our mental model frames how we see the world.&nbsp; I love how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Kozyrkov">Cassie Kozyrkov</a> (chief decision-maker at Google) describes in this <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/statistics-are-you-bayesian-or-frequentist-4943f953f21b">article</a> using the toss of a coin to determine how you see the world.&nbsp; Statistics predict one aspect of chance but not how you perceive the results when the coin has landed, and the outcome is known but not to you. My dad taught me to toss the coins a few more times until I got the result I wanted. It was a reinforcement model that I had made the right decision from the possible two choices.&nbsp; I would also suggest following and reading <a href="https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com/">Lisa Feldman Barrett</a> work, especially her new book “<a href="https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com/books/seven-and-a-half-lessons-about-the-brain/">seven and a half lessons about the brain</a>.” She says that we must grasp that everything we perceive as reality is, in fact, constructed from fragments, and we have no idea what reality really is.&nbsp; (yes, this is reinforcement bias - I am quoting things to frame you that align to my model)</p><p>In our digital era, new uncertainty, <a href="https://opengovernance.net/quantum-risk-a-wicked-problem-that-emerges-at-the-boundaries-of-our-data-dependency-2dc36dfb21fb">quantum risk</a>, and more ambiguity constantly challenge our <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-occurs-when-physical-beings-transition-to-information-beings-146ea9dcbca3">mental models</a> and how we accommodate and make sense.&nbsp; The volume of <a href="https://opengovernance.net/the-shadowy-hierarch-5780154de92">noise and signals</a> coming into our brains is high, but we filter and convert it all into something that has meaning to each of us according to our own unique mental model.&nbsp; We all reach different interpretations about what is happening, which creates frustration, confusion and misalignment. We use questions to clarify and check our understanding, assumptions and quality of information. Slight differences always remain; the unsaid, mislead, guided, incentivised, and overconfidence, unfortunately, takes us from the simple to correct misalignments; to tension, conflict and entrenchment.</p><p>This topic matters as directors are mandated to make decisions, but we find we are operating with misalignments, tensions, compromises, and outright conflict.&nbsp; This happens as the <a href="https://opengovernance.net/power-agency-and-influence-a-new-framework-about-complex-relationships-73f5e97295ef">individuals sitting at the same table have agency</a> (and their own mental models and incentives). We are unsure if we have the right choices or are clear about our judgment’s unintended consequences or long-term impact. We have to talk about it.&nbsp;</p><p>We should unpack our relationship with choice, decision and judgement as mental models, hierarchy and rules constrain us. This article is not about “how to ask better questions”, nor if you should (as some questions we don’t want the answer to), but how to determine if you, your team or your company has a constructive or destructive relationship with CDJ.&nbsp;</p><p>---</p><p>When talking about CDJ, you would imagine that in 2021 that starting from the definitions should help, but it does not, as there is a recursive loop of using one definition to define the other words, which define themselves.&nbsp; Amazingly there are professional bodies for <a href="https://www.decisionprofessionals.com/">decision making</a> and <a href="http://www.sjdm.org/">judgement</a>; alas, even these cannot agree on how to define or clearly demark between intent and actions. Our base problem is that:&nbsp; everything framed with a maths or data mind: is a decision. Everything is a choice when framed by a psychologist or social scientist. To someone who has authority and responsibility or plays with complexity, everything looks like a judgment.&nbsp; Confusingly everything is an opinion to a judge!</p><br><p>Everything framed with a maths or data mind: is a decision. Everything is a choice when framed by a psychologist or social scientist. To someone who has authority and responsibility or plays with complexity, everything looks like a judgment.&nbsp; Confusingly everything is an opinion to a judge!</p><br><p>Here are the definitions from the Collins and Oxford dictionaries&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Choice &nbsp;[countable noun] If there is a choice of things, there are several of them, and you can choose the one you want.&nbsp; [countable noun] Your choice is someone or something that you choose from a range of things. <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/choice">Collins </a>&nbsp;OR &nbsp;[countable] an act of choosing between two or more possibilities; something that you can choose&nbsp; [uncountable] the right to choose; the possibility of choosing <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/choice_1?q=choice">Oxford Dictionary</a></p><p>Decisions&nbsp; [countable noun] When you make a decision, you choose what should be done or which is the best of various possible actions.&nbsp; [uncountable noun] Decision is the act of deciding something or the need to decide something <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/decision">Collins </a>&nbsp;OR &nbsp;[countable] a choice or judgement that you make after thinking and talking about what is the best thing to do&nbsp; [uncountable] the process of deciding something <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/decision?q=decision">Oxford Dictionary</a></p><p>Judgment [uncountable noun] is the ability to make sensible guesses about a situation or sensible decisions about what to do.&nbsp; [variable noun] A judgment is an opinion that you have or express after thinking carefully about something&nbsp; <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/judgment">Collins </a>&nbsp;OR &nbsp;[uncountable] the ability to make sensible decisions after carefully considering the best thing to do; [countable, uncountable] an opinion that you form about something after thinking about it carefully; the act of making this opinion known to others <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/judgement?q=judgment">Oxford Dictionary</a></p><br><p><br></p><p>Therefore, a judgment is the ability to make a sensible decision about a choice, which requires judgment about which choices to pick. As Yoda would say, “wise decision you make, stupid choices your judgement however selected.”</p> The timeless challenges of Choices, Decisions and Judgment (CDJ) <p>“I change my mind as the data changes” is a modern digital age sentiment from the economist John Maynard Keynes who is quoted to have said, "When the facts change, I change my mind." It was likely adapted from an early human bias where leadership in war and battles refused to change their mind even when the facts were in, and they had been proven wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>Choices, decisions and judgement are not difficult if you relinquish your values, ethics and blindly follow the incentives or can fully appreciate the impact of your actions. Still, we know it is just not that simple. We have heuristics to remove choice rather than create more and ways to find more data and facts to become more informed, but without knowing if the new data is helpful or not.&nbsp; Ultimately, at some point, you have to make a choice, decision or judgement.&nbsp;</p><p>The diagram below represents some of the timeless challenges of CDJ, which is a balance between what we know and don’t know.&nbsp; We have the experience that creates the ghosts of the past, flighting the voices of the present as we try to decide what the spirits of the future hold, whilst being held accountable for the decisions we make.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The point here is that it is always possible to find a reason why to act or not to act and the timeless challenge remains that there is no perfect choice, decision or judgment.&nbsp; However, over time and because we have choices we can make decisions that improve our judgement which means we can find and select the right choices.&nbsp; This is a constructive relationship between CDJ.&nbsp; A destructive relationship would be to not like the choices we face, procrastinate in the hope a better choice occurs or maybe lose a choice where the decision is made for you. You don’t improve your judgment and so you cannot determine if the next choice is any better - it is linear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Is the CDJ relationship about framing? <p>From the definition section at the beginning of this article, it was evident that there is a high degree of overlap and dependency between choice, decision and judgment.&nbsp; As highlighted in the previous section it can become complex very quickly but our brain (mental models) demand patterns to make sense of it and so we tend to come back to simple linear narratives which do not do them (choice, decisions, judgment) justice. What we have realised but tend not to verbalise is that none of our (mental) models or frameworks work in all cases and indeed all models about choice, decision and judgment fail.&nbsp; This is why there is always a new book on the topic with new self-help content that you have not seen before, and we cling to a hope that the next model will work better - alas they don’t. I am aware of over 100 decision support models and I expect I have not really scratched the surface. &nbsp; An example below puts choice, decision and judgment on a continuum between your own north star and that for a shared tribe, community or society.&nbsp; It does not really work.&nbsp; White flag time.&nbsp;</p><p>What we have realised but tend not to verbalise is that none of our (mental) models or frameworks work in all cases and indeed all models about choice, decision and judgment fail.</p><br><p></p><p>#Lockdowns have enabled many social experiments.&nbsp; One has been about choice and buying behaviour.&nbsp; As we moved our shopping for food online and therefore missed the in store sale specials, end of gondea, carefully placed items next to each other, those large piled up offers in the entrance and the sweets at the exit, our patterns have changed as choice became limited.&nbsp; We became creatures of habit, buying largely the same items, which reduce in variance over time.&nbsp; (This also highlights that the UI and UX for shopping sucks.)&nbsp; The decision to shop was removed from us, and our choices fell, but the variety was still there.&nbsp; So much for the Web creating perfect information or the algorithm knowing what you would want.&nbsp;</p><p>As an alternative, we can determine that CDJ will change depending on the context right now and the perception those facing the issue have.&nbsp; The figure below highlights three examples but what we rapidly conclude is that complexity in CDJ is generated by speed, volume, consequences, data, sense of enquiry, situation and our own mental models. Every known variable adds layers.</p><p></p><br> Where are we up to and where next? <p>So far, we have explored that there is a relationship between choices, decisions and judgements. We, however, tend to focus on one of them (decision making) as it looks the most difficult, and the others are just linkages. However, this preference for “decision making” fails to understand if we are using the right word to describe the action we are taking. There is no doubt that the word decision is preferable as it is perceived as more powerful and important than choice or judgment. The relationship between them is causal, complex and relational, and we are framed, educated and incentivised to the simple linear view and a single narrative. The reality is that judgement helps frame our choices which we decide on that improve our judgment skills — they are not linear; they are circular. They are circular as we all have agency.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;The reality is that judgement helps frame our choices, which we decide on, that improve our judgment skills</p><p></p><p>We know the linear models are broken as there is no universal tool to help with choice, decision and judgement.&nbsp; The next part is to explain the relationship we have between choices, decisions and judgement and how our questions indicate if it is constructive and curious OR linear, framed and destructive.</p><p>We tend to focus on the decision and choice axis. If we can eliminate bad choices we can improve decisions, but ignore the fact that it is judgment skills that help find the right choice. Procrastination as a decision tool is framed that time will remove choice and so a decision becomes easier, either because a choice has been removed or more data supports one option. More data does not make decision-making easier; nor does it guarantee to make it better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Worthy of note is that academic work about “decision-making” will always seek to create the most complex solution because academics are incentivised to use the most advanced and new thinking (publication, referencing, research and reputation). Sometimes tossing a coin is the perfect solution. &nbsp; The more we see the complex, the less we will accept the simple.&nbsp; In a linear world where we view choice, decision and judgment as a progression line, where we are given choices when young and make a judgement when we are old and wise ignore that we learn and need to exercise all three all the time to become more proficient at decision making.&nbsp; Decision making is not a task or an end game.&nbsp;</p><p>As a thought experiment: if you had all the <a href="https://opengovernance.net/data-for-better-decisions-nature-or-nurture-79e6531dbe3a">data</a> in the world and all the compute power possible to run a perfect forecast model, would you need to make further choices, decisions or judgments?&nbsp; To reach your view I assume you have decided to either give each human full <a href="https://opengovernance.net/power-agency-and-influence-a-new-framework-about-complex-relationships-73f5e97295ef">agency</a> or you have taken our individual <a href="https://opengovernance.net/power-agency-and-influence-a-new-framework-about-complex-relationships-73f5e97295ef">agency</a> away.&nbsp; Now in my definition of data, which might be different to yours, how we all behave with our agency is just data, which opens up a can of worms for each of us. Can you have full agency (freewill) and it all still be modelled? What do we mean about behavioural modelling, agency, data and even more precisely <a href="https://medium.com/mydata/data-is-data-e2a877cb206b">all data</a>?</p><p>Getting to one data set, one tool, one choice hides layers of complexity which looks good for one better decision but is unlikely to be a long term solution to improving choices, decisions and judgment.&nbsp; You have/had choice, you make/made decisions, you exhibit/exercise judgment.&nbsp; Judgement supports you in finding choices.&nbsp;</p> How the questions we ask inform us!&nbsp; <p>The questions you are currently asking will help inform you where you are in the cycle, indeed if you already have closed the loop and have a constructive cycle or a linear open loop distructure relationship with choice, decisions and judgment.&nbsp;</p><p>The circular framing means depending on the stage we are in a process we will be asking different questions.&nbsp; Given that a board has to deal with many situations all at different stages at every meeting, we should see all these questions asked at every meeting, just framed to different agenda items.&nbsp; If there is no variation in questions,&nbsp; surely it tells us something.&nbsp; Indeed are we using our improvement at each stage to further improve the next outcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The destructive “cycle” is not circular but is a linear model as it is fundamentally disconnected from a learning based idea using choice and judgement and focussed on Better Decision making. It depends on the idea that by reading a new book or going on a new decision making course that we will get better.&nbsp; The iteration of improvement is an external influence.&nbsp; Perhaps it is mentoring or coaching and they (mentors) keep you from closing the loop as they either don’t know or it would not support their business model. Indeed books, education and courses have no interest in you closing the loop and always making you believe in a new tool, method, process - it is their business model!</p><p></p><p>In the boardroom or in the senior management meetings is someone always asking the same questions?&nbsp; Does the agenda mean that as a team individuals are unable to ask different questions or is it that others are influencing the agenda to keep it framed to the decisions and outcomes they want.&nbsp; Why enable the asking for more data when the choice they want you to decide on and agree with is already the best supported case (<a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/the-railroad-of-no-choice-a55420cea06f">railroaded</a>).&nbsp; Do you have observers or assessors who look at the questions you ask as a team and determine if you are asking the right questions? (something I am learning to do)&nbsp; Can skills in choice, decision and judgment be determined by the questions asked in the meetings? (something I am exploring)</p><p>A key question I often come back to when thinking about choice, decisions and judgment is “What are we optimising for?” I find the model below a helpful guide to understand the framing.&nbsp; In a linear model it would present moving from single choice in the lower left to complex judgment in the top right. In a learning cyclic model, choice, decision and judgement equally applies, however the lower left is a better learning and experience gaining context for mentoring, or succession planning, than the top right.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Why does this matter, because right now we have increasing data along with more vulnerabilities, ambiguity, complexity and uncertainty. The volume of moving variables (change) and the rate of change breaks the linear model as you can never match the model at hand to the situation you face.&nbsp; There is a need to move from linear ideas of choice, decisions and judgment to a circular one.&nbsp; Linear thinking is the best model when there are limited options and there is stability.&nbsp; We now have many options, increasing variables and more instability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As your <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-99-of-the-public-and-95-of-venture-and-investment-capital-have-got-wrong-69239b4da4f1">company is owned by no-one</a> (yes you read that right - follow this <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-99-of-the-public-and-95-of-venture-and-investment-capital-have-got-wrong-69239b4da4f1">link</a> if you need to read more on this, a company owns itself) and a company cannot think for itself and therefore we (the directors) have to do the thinking for it.&nbsp; We are given in law the authority and responsibility to act on behalf of the company.&nbsp; This is “fiduciary duty”.&nbsp; It is the reason why directors need to move from a linear perspective of decision making to a circular improvement learning process of choice, decision making and judgement.</p><p>My proposal to help support better governance is that we request companies publish the questions asked in a board meeting. Not the answers, but definitely the questions.</p><br>

          <p>In those first 100 days, it will become evident if you are about to be railroaded or if you have to present the choice without creating railroading for those data laggards. The latter being the job, the former being a problem.</p>      <p>To be clear, railroaded means in this context:</p>  to force&nbsp;something&nbsp;to be officially approved or accepted without much discussion or thought.  to force&nbsp;someone&nbsp;into doing something quickly, usually without enough information.  <p>As the CDO, are you about to find that the tracks have already been laid and that you on the train and it is going in one direction. You are now the figurehead of the new shinny data plan based on already accepted wisdom. Your hope, before starting the role, is that it is more analogous to a personal transport situation. This would be where you get to pick the fuel (food, combustible), vehicle (walk, run, bike, motorcycle, car, van, lorry, aeroplane, boat), the destination and the route. Using the analogy of the train on the tracks, the decision to create a data-led organisation, the ontology, the data we have and the value we will create has been made irrespective of what you come up with, or what the data might be able to tell you. The processes are in place, and your role is not to craft, invest, create or imagine but to follow the tracks of command and control. It is at that moment that you realise just how good the CEO is at sales.</p><p>In this case, your priorities are: How to find the right tools that align or match what you are faced with? And, how do you take a senior leadership team and fellow directors on a journey to discover that they can change the rails, change the vehicle and be open to changing how we see the journey from A to B? Indeed based on a pandemic, do we need to physically move at all?</p><p>When the “railroaded” is you and you are being asked to approve something when you have not had the time or opportunity to gather the data or understand the processes, what are the right words to create time to explore and not appear indecisive, trying to procrastinate or evasive?</p><blockquote><p>what are the right words to create time to explore so as not to appear indecisive, trying to procrastinate or evasive?</p></blockquote><p>Presenting an argument about why you need more time is likely to fail, as the defensive response will always be “we have already done the work but it is your decision — trust us” Asking questions that check that the choices and opinions are the right ones or to determine the consequences will equally draw you into an argument where “the facts are the facts,” you have to decide or do you not trust us?</p><p>One question that will give some breathing space is “For what are we optimising,” as explored below.</p>          <p>The two-axis on the model set the horizontal scale of the short and long term against the vertical axis how many variables, from one to many. In asking the question “for what are we optimising,” you are not presenting this framework, but use the question to understand what the “railroading” is trying to achieve; through understanding what the decision being expected is optimising for. With this knowledge, you may find it is easier to take the railroaded decision. If you can conclude they are optimising for many externalities and long term, you are immersed in a team that can cope and manage complexity- this is going to be fun. If this is short term and a single variable you know that incentives are the significant driver and slowly changing the incentives will create a better place for making more complex data decisions. One scenario is outside of this framing which is that they actually don’t know what they are optimising for and the decision at hand is just another reaction to previous poor railroaded decisions. Definitely a red flag moment.</p> Note to the CEO <p>Using railroading as an activity to discover an individuals capability and backbone is always likely to go wrong. In this data-driven complex world where both the data and the analysis is a long way from your immediate access, you may also feel you are being railroaded by the signals and noise. It is likely you will ask “is this recommendation optimising for xyz (the plan you have agreed to) and how can you show this is the optimal path&nbsp;without&nbsp;using the same data” Love the misattributed quote that Ronald Reagan stole from the Russians but so can we.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_verify">Trust, but verify.</a></p>

<p>Today I finished up a tool that you can use to export your complete history from Foursquare and publish the checkins to your website!</p>

<p>In 2017, I created <a href="https://ownyourswarm.p3k.io">OwnYourSwarm</a> to export my future Swarm checkins to my website in real-time. It's been working great, and it's meant that I have had a complete archive of all my checkins on my website ever since then, so I don't have to worry if Foursquare disappears one day. However, I never got around to creating a way to export my past checkins, so I was always missing my checkin history from 2009-2016.</p>

<p>I had been considering building this as a feature of OwnYourSwarm, but realized that it would end up taking a lot of additional effort to make it work well as a web service, in addition to dealing with possible rate limit issues with the Foursquare API. So instead, this is published as a downloadable script you can run on your own computer. This also means you have a bit more flexibility in how you can use it, as well as being able to customize it more if you choose.</p>

<p>You can download the code from GitHub here:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/aaronpk/Swarm-Checkins-Import">https://github.com/aaronpk/Swarm-Checkins-Import</a></p>

<p>The readme has installation and usage instructions, so I'll refrain from repeating all that in this post. Make sure to check out the step by step tutorial in the readme if you want to use this with your own account.</p>

<p>The process is broken up into a couple steps.</p>

 
 First, it downloads your entire Foursquare checkin history to JSON files on your computer 
 Second, it downloads all the photos from your checkins 
 Third, it publishes each checkin to your website via <a href="https://micropub.net">Micropub</a> 
 

<p>If your website doesn't support checkins via Micropub, or if you don't want your checkins on your website at all, you can just skip that step entirely, and instead you'll have a complete export of your data locally.</p>

<p>The JSON files contain the raw API response from Foursquare, so you can do what you want with that as well, such as turning it into your own HTML archive using your own custom tools if you want.</p>

<p>The one issue that I don't have a good solution for is handling renamed venues. Unfortunately the API returns the current name for old checkins, so if a venue is renamed, your old checkins will not reflect the name at the time of the checkin. This is particularly strange for businesses that have gone through an acquisition or rebranding, since for example all my old checkins in Green Dragon are now labeled as Rogue Eastside Brewery. As far as I can tell there isn't a good way to handle this, so I may have to go back and manually edit the posts on my website for the venues I know have been renamed.</p>

<p>I hope this is useful to people! I will be sleeping a little easier now knowing that my old checkin history is safely archived on my website now!</p>

<p>At MATTR we’re always dreaming up ways to make decentralized identity and verifiable credentials easy and intuitive to use for as many people as possible.</p><p>From the start, it’s been a core part of our mission to make sure that end users understand the implications of decentralized identity and the control it affords them over their data and their privacy. This model offers users greater sovereignty over their own information by empowering individuals as both the holder and subject of information that pertains to them. Users are able to exercise their new role in this ecosystem by utilizing a new class of software known as <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/digital-wallets">digital&nbsp;wallets</a>.</p><p>We first released our <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/onboarding/install/wallet">Mobile Wallet</a> for smartphones in June 2020, with a simple user interface to allow people to interact with and receive credentials from issuers as well as present credentials to relying parties. In the interim, we have developed a number of improvements and features to the Mobile Wallet to support advanced capabilities such&nbsp;as:</p>  Authenticating to Identity Providers over OpenID Connect to receive credentials via OIDC&nbsp;Bridge  Deriving privacy-preserving selective disclosure presentations from credentials using BBS+ signatures  Establishing a secure DID messaging inbox for users to receive encrypted messages and push notifications  <p>These changes have not only made the wallet more functional; they’ve also evolved to better protect users’ best interests — giving them privacy-by-design and surfacing the information and context that they need to confidently make decisions underpinned by the security of decentralized identity.</p>Timeline of MATTR wallet development<p>This journey has led us to realize the importance of creating a wallet experience that places users front and center. As these systems create more opportunity for user-driven consent and identity management, they’ve simultaneously created a demand for a wallet that can not only perform the technical operations required, but do so in a user-friendly way that surfaces the information that truly matters to people. Our latest feature release to the MATTR Mobile Wallet is a step in this direction.</p><p>With Human-Friendly Credentials, we have added the capability to render different kinds of credentials uniquely in the wallet interface according to the information they contain. Until now, the end user experience for verifiable credentials has been largely consistent across different categories of credentials and issuers. In other words, a credential containing medical data from your doctor looks exactly the same as an education credential from your university or a concert ticket from a music venue: they all appear to the user as a long list of&nbsp;claims.</p><p>In this release we change that. Thanks to the semantic information encoded in verifiable credentials, the wallet is now able to understand and interpret certain kinds of credentials to render them to the user in a way that makes the data easier to understand.</p><p><a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/semantic-web#json-ld">JSON-LD</a> verifiable credentials have the ability to support common data vocabularies and schemas which are published on the web. For example, if a credential contains a claim describing the name of an individual, the claim can be defined via reference to an existing data vocabulary found here: <a href="https://schema.org/Person">https://schema.org/Person</a></p><p>Human-Friendly Credentials allow the wallet to start intelligently displaying known credential types and data types. This shows up in a variety of different ways in a user’s&nbsp;dataset.</p><p>For example, this update formats address fields to make them more readable; formats names and proper nouns where possible; makes URLs, telephone numbers and email addresses clickable; highlights images and icons for better trust and brand signaling; and creates basic rules for language localization that adjust to a user’s device settings. This logic allows the wallet to create a kind of information hierarchy that starts to draw out the important aspects of data included in a credential, so users can make trust-based decisions using this information.</p><p>These rules are applied to any kind of credential the wallet encounters. Whilst all of this is incredibly helpful for users, we have gone a step further: displaying entire credentials in a completely unique UI according to their type. The ‘type’ property of a credential expresses what kind of information is in the credential — is it a degree, a medical record, a utility bill? The usage of common credential types across different implementations and ecosystems is necessary for semantic interoperability on the broader scale. The wallet should be able to recognize these common credential types and display them to the user in a friendly&nbsp;way.</p><p>In this update, we have added custom rendering for both Personal Identity Credentials as well as Education Courses. These are common types we see occurring naturally across the decentralized identity landscape, and now the MATTR Mobile Wallet is able to recognize and display them properly.</p>Personal Identity Credentials and Education Course credentials<p>An important note to consider is that Human-Friendly Credentials only work for known data and credential types. As the ecosystem matures, we expect to add more data types and credential types in the future to support an even broader set of human-related processes and actions. In a general sense, we will also continue to iterate on our digital wallet offerings to provide a greater degree of flexibility and control for end users. We believe it’s a vital component to a healthy digital trust ecosystem.</p><p>To check out these changes yourself, download the latest version of our <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/onboarding/install/wallet">Mobile Wallet</a> to get&nbsp;started.</p><p>For more information on Human-Friendly Credentials, check out our tutorials and video content on MATTR&nbsp;Learn.</p><p>For everything else related to MATTR, visit <a href="https://mattr.global">https://mattr.global</a> or follow <a href="https://twitter.com/mattrglobal">@MattrGlobal on&nbsp;Twitter</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/rendering-credentials-in-a-human-friendly-way-e47f4a32fd4b">Rendering credentials in a human-friendly way</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Self-Sovereign model - root authority at edges, admin verification mechanism at center.  <br>  In order for #2 to live in the world, a recursive signatory from one generation to the next authenticating the structural model of participation and Rights is required.&nbsp;  <br>  In America, John Hancock serves as our muse when considering the structure of Sovereign authority and the ID/signatory of participation within civil Society. The source of authority demonstrated by John Hancock and his peers in signing the "Declaration of Independence" had a personal origin. These people all put their personal lives, security, fortunes and reputations on the line, literally, and there was no authentication system in place when they did so. In essence, they used a personal relationship network to validate their own personal <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2012/02/what-is-sovereign-source-authority.html">Sovereign source authority</a> to declare anything meaningful in nascent Sovereign Terms.  <br>  You, as an American citizen, are no less than these people. Unless, of course, you Agree to participate in an ID/signatory based system of Rights without holding the system accountable to enforce your own participatory authority.  <br>  American Rights do not resolve from a database or State Trust storing birth certificates. American Rights are for, by, of people, not birth certificates. Of course, in administrative practice, try exercising your personal Rights without these administrative documents, including passports, driver's licenses, social security numbers, etc... which all originate and resolve to an administrative source of authority.  <br>  If you are provisioned authority to act as an American citizen, are you actually an American? Structure yields results in such concerns, and every person who has ever started a corporation and taken responsibility to protect the "corporate veil" from being compromised understands the importance of structural integrity. Unfortunately, the average American citizen does not, and the process of demonstrating America's model of authority is not something that is taught in public schools, funded by American tax payers.  <br>  American authority originates in people, Individuals all. This is not an optional requirement. Any other structural model is literally "un-American", and out of step with Constitutional integrity. Do law schools understand this?  <br>  A recursive signatory serves as the foundation of American ID within all Government-supported administration methods, such that the originating act of "Declaring Independence" is conveyed to every person, every Individual citizen, in the same manner as the founders demonstrated personally.  <br>  The founders of America did not demonstrate one model of American Sovereignty, and then convey a data plantation to everyone else to comply with. Instead, one generation after the next is required to protect the very Institution derived "of, by, for" people, Individuals all, by way of the structural process of inaugurating authentic participation.  <br>  Americans give their personal authority to their Governance. Americans do not receive their authority from their Government. The American people are not the dog of their government, because structurally, the Government is guaranteed to operate as the best friend of the people, Individuals all. This structural process, putting the authority of people before the authority of a bureaucratic Institution is the literal structural integrity differentiating THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA from every other Nation on Earth.  <br>  Generation after generation since America's founding has had their personal Sovereign source authority squandered and mis-represented by an "error of omission" from the structural process of forming an identity with recursive signatory integrity in the administration of American Rights.  <br>  This order of operations failure, putting a false model of <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2013/01/administrative-precedence.html">administrative precedence</a> within a database, is of utmost importance to how American Rights are administered. Without an accurate administrative precedence belonging to people, Individuals all, the Government becomes the keeper of people, rather than people being the keeper of their Governance.  <br>  For some reason, this is not obvious. For some reason, lawyers get this wrong constantly. The concept of a recursive signatory tied to Rights administration exceeds the intellectual grasp of legal managers living on the data plantation they have derived their administrative methods from. This must be repaired, for a Government derived "of, by, for" people, Individuals All.. can not exist otherwise.  <br>  America can not exist in practice without a recursive signatory event tied to Rights administration for every American citizen, giving form and function to the self-Sovereign method of Rights administration that gave life to America, and sustains it to this day.

<p>I recently came out as nonbinary trans-femme.
That's a picture of me on the left, with my spouse Morgan Lemmer-Webber
on the right.</p>
<p>In a sense, not much has changed, and so much has changed.
I've dropped the "-topher" from my name, and given the common tendency
to apply gender to pronouns in English, please either use nonbinary
pronouns or feminine pronouns to apply to me.
Other changes are happening as I wander through this space, from
appearance to other things.
(Probably the biggest change is finally achieving something resembling
self-acceptance, however.)</p>
<p>If you want to know more,
<a href="https://fossandcrafts.org/episodes/30-gender-sexuality-personal-perspective.html">Morgan and I did a podcast episode</a>
which explains more from my present standing, and also explains Morgan's
experiences with being demisexual, which not many people know about!
(Morgan has been incredible through this whole process, by the way.)</p>
<p>But things may change further.
Maybe a year from now those changes may be even more drastic, or maybe
not.
We'll see.
I am wandering, and I don't know where I will land, but it won't be
back to where I was.</p>
<p>At any rate, I've spent much of my life not being able to stand myself
for how I look and feel.
For most of my life, I have not been able to look at myself in a mirror
for more than a second or two due to the revulsion I felt at the person
I saw staring back at me.
The last few weeks have been a shift change for me in that regard...
it's a very new experience to feel so happy with myself.</p>
<p>I'm only at the beginning of this journey.
I'd appreciate your support... people have been incredibly kind to me
by and large so far but like everyone who goes through a process like this,
it's very hard in those experiences where people aren't.
Thank you to everyone who has been there for me so far.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The best new phones come with the ability to shoot 108 megapixel photos, record 4K video with stereo sound, and pack the results into a terabyte of onboard storage. But what do you do when that storage fills up?</p>
<p>If you want to keep those files, you’ll need to offload them somewhere. Since your computer probably doesn’t have more than 2Tb of storage, you’ll need an external drive. Or two. Or three. Or more. Over time, a lot more.</p>
<p>Welcome to my world.</p>
<p>Gathered here for a portrait in a corner of my desk in Manhattan are 22 hard drives, plus three SD cards that each exceed the capacities of the drives they’re laying on. And then there’s the 2Tb one in the laptop I’m using now. That one has 357.33Gb available. Most of the others you see are also full, dead, or both. Five have FireWire connections, which my current laptop doesn’t comprehend at all. I also have a similar collection of drives in Santa Barbara.</p>
<p>Photos occupy most of the data I’ve stored on all those drives. Currently my photo archives are spread between two portable drives and my laptop, and total about 7Tb. I also have a 5Tb portable drive for videos, which is back in Santa Barbara awaiting dubs off tapes. The portable photo drives are among those in the picture above. Earlier today, my laptop gave me this news about the main one, called Black 4Tb WD Photo Drive:</p>
<p></p>
<p>That’s why I’m transferring its contents over to the 10Tb drive called Elements, on the far left. A progress report:</p>
<p>About 5Tb of Elements is occupied by Apple Time Machine backups. After the transfer is done, there won’t be room for more backups. So my project now is figuring out what to do next.</p>
<p>I could get some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage">Network Attached Storage</a> (NAS). I already have used 2012-vintage 18Tb QNAP one in Santa Barbara that I’ve never been able to make work.</p>
<p>So I am tempted now to put it all in a cloud.</p>
<p>I hadn’t bothered with that before, because upstream speeds have been highly sphinctered by ISPs for decades. Here in New York, where our ISP is Spectrum, our speeds have long run 100-400 Mbps down, but only 10 Mbps up. However…. I just checked again with <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/">Speedtest.net</a>, and got <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/result/11628959761">this</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>And that’s over wi-fi.</p>
<p>Now I’m encouraged. But before I commit to a supplier, I’d like to hear what others recommend. Currently I’m considering <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/">Backblaze</a>, which is top rated <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/online-backup-services-reviewed-2624712">here</a>. The cost i $6/month, or less for unlimited sums of data. But I’m open to whatever.</p>
<p>[Later…] Hmm. At that last link it says this:</p>
<blockquote><p>What We Don’t Like:</p>
<p>Something I should mention is that some users have had bad experiences with Backblaze because of a not-so-apparent&nbsp;feature that maybe&nbsp;should&nbsp;be a lot more obvious: Backblaze doesn’t function as a permanent&nbsp;archive of all of your data, but instead as a mirror.</p>
<p>In other words, if you delete files on your computer, or the drive fails and you’re connected to Backblaze’s website, Backblaze will see that those files are gone and will remove them from your online account, too.</p>
<p>Granted, signing up for the forever version history option would eliminate any issues with this, but it still poses a problem for anyone using one of the limited version history options.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alas, <a href="https://help.backblaze.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035247494-Version-History-FAQ">the forever thing is complicated</a>.</p>
<p>To be clear, I want more than a mirroring of what I have on my laptop and external drives. I want to replace those external drives with cloud storage. Is that possible? Not clear.</p>
<p>Alas, for all of us, <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2020/05/15/fossil/">this problem remains</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, and Spectrum now only measures under 10Mbps upstream. So forget the cloud.</p>

<p>Listen Up</p>
<p>By Doc Searls<br>
April 16, 1999&nbsp;</p>
<p>“All I know is that first you’ve got to get mad. You’ve got to say, I’m a human being, goddammit! My life has value! So I want you to get up now. I want all of you to get up out of your chairs. I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out, and yell, ‘I’m as mad as hell, and I’m not going to take this anymore!'”<br>
— Howard Beale, in&nbsp;Network, by Paddy Chayevsky</p>
 
<p>Bob Davis is the CEO of Lycos, Inc., whose growing portfolio of companies (excuse me,&nbsp;portals) now includes&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lycos.html/">Lycos</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hotbot.html/">Hotbot</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whowhere.lycos.com/">WhoWhere</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tripod.html/">Tripod</a>. I’m sure Bob is a great guy. And I’m sure Lycos is a great company. A lot of people seem to like them both. And you have to admire both his ambition and his success. To witness both, read his&nbsp;<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/pcweek/stories/news/0,4153,383571,00.html">interview with PC Week</a>, where he predicts that the Lycos Network (the sum of all its portals) will overtake Yahoo as “#1 on the Web.”</p>
<p>Lycos will win, Davis says, because “We have a collection of quality properties that are segmented into best-of-breed categories, and our reach has been catapulting.”</p>
<p>I can speak for Hotbot, which is still my first-choice search engine; but by a shrinking margin. I often test search engines by looking for strings of text buried deep in long documents on my own site. Hotbot always won in the past. But since Lycos bought it, Hotbot has become more of a portal and less of a search tool. Its page is now a baffling mass of ads and links. And its searches find less.</p>
<p>In today’s test,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.infoseek.com/">Infoseek</a>&nbsp;won. Last week,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.excite.com/">Excite</a>&nbsp;won. Both found pages that Hotbot seems to have forgotten.</p>
<p>Why? Bob Davis gives us a good answer.</p>
<p>“We’re a media company,” he says. “We make our money by delivering an audience that people want to pay for.”</p>
<p>Note the two different species here:&nbsp;audience&nbsp;and&nbsp;people. And look at their qualities. One is “delivered.” The other pays. In other words, one is cargo and the other is money.</p>
<p>Well, I don’t care if Lycos’ stock goes to the moon and splits three times along the way. The only #1 on the Web is the same as the only #1 on the phone: the people who use it. And the time will come when people will look at portals not as sources of “satisfying experiences” (another of Davis’ lines) but as useless intermediaries between supply and demand.</p>



&nbsp;<p></p>
 Words of Walt 
<p>You there, impotent, loose in the knees,<br>
open your scarfed chops till I blow grit within you.<br>
Spread your palms and lift the flaps of your pockets.<br>
I am not to be denied. I compel.<br>
It is time to explain myself. Let us stand up.<br>
I know I am solid and sound.<br>
To me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow.<br>
</p>
<p>I know that I am august,<br>
I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself<br>
or be understood.<br>
I see that the elementary laws never apologize.</p>
<p>.<br>
— Walt Whitman, from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.searls.com/bookstore.html#Anchor">Song of Myself</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Media company” guys like Davis are still in a seller’s market for wisdom that was BS even when only the TV guys spoke it —&nbsp;back when it literally&nbsp;required&nbsp;the movie “Network.” That market will dry up. Why? Because we’ve been mad as hell for about hundred years, and&nbsp;now we don’t have to take it anymore.</p>
<p>Three reasons.</p>
 
 Humanity. This is what Walt Whitman reminded us about more than a hundred years ago.&nbsp;We are not impotent. Media companies may call us seats and eyeballs and targets, but&nbsp;that’s their problem. They don’t get who we are or what we can — and will —&nbsp;do. And the funny thing is, they don’t get that what makes us powerful is what they think makes&nbsp;them&nbsp;powerful: the Internet. It gives us choices. Millions of them. We don’t have to settle for “channels” any more. Or “portals” that offer views of the sky through their own little windows. Or “sticky” sites that are the moral equivalent of flypaper. 
 Demand.&nbsp;There never was a demand for messages, and now it shows, big time. Because the Internet is a meteor that is smacking the world of business with more force than the rock that offed the dinosaurs, and it is pushing out a&nbsp;tsunami of demand&nbsp;like nothing supply has ever seen. Businesses that welcome the swell are in for some fun surfing. Businesses that don’t are going to drown in it. 
 Obsolescence. Even the media guys are tired of their own B.S. and are&nbsp;finally in the market for clues. 
 
<p>Alvin Toffler had it right in&nbsp;The Third Wave.&nbsp;Industry (The Second Wave) “violently split apart two aspects of our lives that had always been one… production and consumption… In so doing, it drove a giant invisible wedge into our economy, our psyches … it ripped apart the underlying unity of society, creating a way of life filled with economic tension.” Today all of us play producer roles in our professions and consumer roles in our everyday lives. This chart shows the difference (and tension) between these radically different points of view — both of which all of us hold:</p>




Producer view

 
 Consumer view 
 



Metaphor
Business is shipping (“loading the channel,” “moving products,” “delivering messages”)
Business is shopping (“browsing,” “looking,” “bargaining,” “buying”)


Orientation
Business is about moving goods from one to many (producers to consumers)
Business is about buying and selling, one to one


Markets
Markets are shooting ranges: consumers are “targets”
Markets are markets: places to shop, buy stuff and talk to people


Relationships
Primary relationshiphs are with customers, which are more often distributors &amp; retailers rather than consumers
Primary relationships are with vendors, and with other customers



<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>These are all just clues, which are easily deniable facts. Hence a line once spoken of Apple: “the clue train stopped there four times a day for ten years and they never took delivery.” But Apple was just an obvious offender. All of marketing itself remains clueless so long as it continues to treat customers as “eyeballs,” “targets,” “seats” and “consumers.”</p>
<p>For the past several months, I have been working with Rick Levine, David Weinberger and Chris Locke on a new railroad for clues: a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/">ClueTrain</a>.</p>
<p>Our goal is&nbsp;to burn down Marketing As Usual. Here is the logic behind the ambition:</p>
 
<p>Markets are conversations<br>
Conversations are fire<br>
Marketing is arson</p>
 
<p>The result is&nbsp;<a href="http://public.wsj.com/careers/resources/documents/19990412-frontlines.htm">here</a>&nbsp;— in what The Wall Street Journal calls “presumptuous, arrogant, and absolutely brilliant.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/">Take a ride</a>. If you like it,&nbsp;<a href="http://cluetrain.com/signer.cgi">sign up</a>. Feel free to set fires with it, add a few of your own, or flame the ones you don’t agree with. What matters is the conversation. We want everybody talking about this stuff. If they do, MAU is toast.</p>
<p>Here is my own short form of the Manifesto (inspired by Martin Luther, the long version has 95 Theses). Feel free to commit arson with (or to) any of these points as well.</p>
 
 
 Ten facts about highly effective markets: 
 
 Markets are conversations.<br>
None of the other metaphors for markets —&nbsp;bulls, bears, battlefields, arenas, streets or invisible hands — does full justice to the social nature of markets.&nbsp;Real market conversations are social. They happen between human beings. Not between senders and receivers, shooters and targets, advertisers and demographics. 
 The first markets were markets.<br>
They were real places that thrived at the crossroads of cultures. They didn’t need a market model, because they&nbsp;were&nbsp;the model market. More than religion, war or family, markets were&nbsp;real places&nbsp;where communities came together. They weren’t just where sellers did business with buyers. They were the place where everybody got together to hang out, talk, tell stories and learn interesting stuff about each other and the larger world.&nbsp;‘ 
 Markets are more about demand than supply.<br>
The term “market” comes from the latin&nbsp;mercere, which means “to buy.” Even a modern market is called a “shopping center” rather than a “selling center.” Bottom line: every market has more buyers than sellers. And the buyers have the money. 
 Human voices trump robotic ones.<br>
Real voices are honest, open, natural, uncontrived. Every identity that speaks has a voice. We know each other by how we sound. That goes for companies and markets as well as people. When a voice is full of shit, we all know it — whether the voice tells us “your call is important to us” or that a Buick is better than a Mercedes. 
 The real market leaders are people whose minds and hands are worn by the work they do.<br>
And it has been that way ever since our ancestors’ authority was expressed by surnames that labeled their occupations — names like Hunter, Weaver, Fisher and Smith. In modern parlance, the most knowledge and the best expertise is found at the “point of practice:” That’s where most of the work gets done. 
 Markets are made by real people.<br>
Not by surreal abstractions that insult customers by calling them “targets,” “seats,” “audiences,” “demographics” and “eyeballs” — all synonyms for&nbsp;consumers, which Jerry Michalski of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sociate.com/">Sociate</a>&nbsp;calls “brainless gullets who live only to gulp products and expel cash.” 
 Business is not a conveyor belt that runs from production to consumption.<br>
Our goods are more than “content” that we “package” and “move” by “loading” them into a “channel” and “address” for “delivery.” The business that matters most is about shopping, not shipping. And the people who run it are the customers and the people who talk to them. 
 Mass markets have the same intelligence as germ populations.<br>
Their virtues are appetite and reproduction. They grow by contagion. Which is why nobody wants to admit belonging to one. 
 There is no demand for messages.<br>
To get what this means, imagine what would happen if mute buttons on remote controls delivered “we don’t want to hear this” messages directly back to advertisers. 
 Most advertising is unaccountable.<br>
Or worse, it’s useless. An old advertising saying goes, “I know half my advertising is wasted. I just don’t know which half.” But even this is a lie. Nearly all advertising is wasted. Even the most accountable form of advertising — the junk mail we euphemistically call “direct marketing” —&nbsp;counts a 3% response rate as a success. No wonder most of us sort our mail over the trash can. Fairfax Cone, who co-founded Foote Cone &amp; Belding many decades ago, said “Advertising is what you do when you can’t go see somebody. That’s all it is.” With the Net you&nbsp;can&nbsp;go see somebody. More importantly, they can see you. More importantly than that, you can both talk to each other. And make real markets again.

<p>Today’s <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/new-fido-ux-guidelines-and-specification-enhancements/">FIDO Alliance announcement</a> describes the enhancements in the second version as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Enhancements to FIDO standards to accelerate passwordless in the enterprise</p>
<p>The FIDO Alliance has announced enhancements to its FIDO2 specifications, which include several new features that will be helpful for passwordless enterprise deployments and other complex security applications. Both FIDO2 specifications were recently updated by their governing bodies â€“ with the World Wide Web Consortium  (W3C) approving WebAuthn Level 2 and FIDO doing the same for CTAP 2.1.</p>
<p>Key to these enhancements is enterprise attestation, which provides enterprise IT with improved management of FIDO authenticators used by employees. Enterprise attestation enables better binding of an authenticator to an account, assists with usage tracking and other management functions including credential and pin management, and biometric enrollment required in the enterprise.</p>
<p>Other updates include support for cross-origin iFrames and Apple attestation, as well as improvements to resident credentials. More details on these and other FIDO specification enhancements are available <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2-enhancements/">here</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>2020年に、物理的な世界からサイバー世界への移行がかつてないスピードで進みました。COVID-19がその移行を課したのです。5年から10年分の変化が数ヶ月の間に行われたと言う人もいます。そこでは、ステイホーム・ポリシーにより物理的な世界でのコミュニケーション能力が大きく制限され、サイバー・コミュニケーションに大きく依存するようになりました。サイバー空間では、あらゆるコミュニケーションはDigital Being（サイバースペースにおける私たちのデジタル表現）を通じて行われます。しかし、Digital Beingが無形である以上、私たちの「安全な生活」に欠かせない、当たり前だと思っている物理的な存在の多くの特性がそこにはありません。このセッションでは、私たちのデジタルライフを安全で安心なものにするために必要な、Digital Beingの7つの原則を概観します。</p>The post <a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2021/06/4801/">Identiverse: 7 Principles of Digital Being</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.sakimura.org">@_Nat Zone</a>.

 Example Design of an Authorization System with Verifiable Credentials and the Tradeoffs 

 Problem summary 

<p>In this blog post, I’ll cover an example design that relies upon verifiable credentials where a CFO is delegating access to their assistant to authorize purchases made by the company. The primary focus of this blog post is to highlight the different problems that are likely to occur when going down the path of building an authorization system with verifiable credentials. I’ll be sure to keep things at a higher level so that anyone can understand these tradeoffs, but take you through the details that would be thought through by an architect designing the system. Enjoy, and feel free to leave comments or reach out to me for questions, suggested improvements, or other aspects I didn’t fully consider.</p>

 Use case description 

<p>In this use case, the issuer is an employer who wishes to provide an employee credential to their CFO. Now their CFO as a part of their job has a lot of capabilities afforded to them as a senior executive. Let’s say this CFO has two abilities. They can sign off on quarterly reports and they can authorize purchases. Now let’s say the employer issues them the following credential:</p>

   <code>{
 "@context": [
   "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
   {
    "@vocab": "https://example.com/employer/"
   }
  ],
  "id": "http://example.com/employer/credentials/123",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "EmployerCredential"],
  "issuer": "https://example.com/employer",
  "issuanceDate": "2010-01-01T19:73:24Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:cfo",
    "jobTitle": "Chief Financial Officer",
    "employeeNumber": 123,
  },
  "revocation": {
    "id": "http://example.gov/revocations/738",
    "type": "SimpleRevocationList2017"
  },
  "proof": {
      "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
      "created": "2019-12-11T03:50:55Z",
      "proofValue": "....",
      "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
      "verificationMethod": "https://example.com/employer/key1"
    }
}
</code>   

<p>All is good and well, now the CFO can do their job. Now let’s say the CFO has been bombarded with purchase authorization requests recently while trying to prepare the quarterly report and has asked their assistant to assist with the backlog of purchase requests as long as the requests are under $10,000. To do this, the CFO decides to delegate their employee credential to their assistant because the payment authorization system relies upon the jobTitle attribute to determine the capabilities.</p>

<p>So, the CFO delegates the following credential to their assistant and hands over their employee credential too:</p>

   <code>{
 "@context": [
   "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
   {
    "@vocab": "https://example.com/employer/"
   }
  ],
  "id": "http://example.com/employer/credentials/123",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "EmployerCredential"],
  "issuer": "did:example:cfo",
  "issuanceDate": "2010-01-01T19:73:24Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:assistant",
    "jobTitle": "Chief Financial Officer",
    "employeeNumber": 123,
  },
  "revocation": {
    "id": "http://example.gov/revocations/738",
    "type": "SimpleRevocationList2017"
  },
  "proof": {
      "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
      "created": "2019-12-11T03:50:55Z",
      "proofValue": "....",
      "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
      "verificationMethod": "did:example:cfo#key1"
    }
}
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>Side rhetorical consideration around the semantics of this VC as a standalone VC, why is the CFO declaring that their assistant has the jobTitle “Chief Financial Officer” now? This is what I mean when I say using verifiable credentials for authorization systems introduces bad semantics. To skirt around authorization systems we’re bending the semantics of the claims in the credentials in ways that don’t make sense. And that’s ignoring the second and third-order effects that are inherently going to be introduced!</p>

<p>Great, so now the assistant can generate the following delegated verifiable Presentation to authorize payments:</p>

<p>Sweet, now the assistant can authorize payments! Let’s review what the steps are for the payment authorization system now with this.</p>

<p>VP Request checks</p>

 
   Check that the verificationMethod is associated with the authentication proofPurpose for the assistant. 
   Check that the verificationMethod for the VP proof is associated with the delegation credential <code>credentialSubject.id</code> 
   Check that the proofValue is valid in the VP proof (the bottom one) based on the associated verificationMethod for the assistant 
   Check that the challenge matches the VP Request 
 

<p>Delegation Credential checks</p>

 
   Check that the verificationMethod is associated with the assertionMethod proofPurpose for the CFO in the delegation credential 
   Check that the verificationMethod in the delegation credential is associated with the issuer property of the delegation credential 
   Check that the proofValue is valid in the delegation credential proof (the middle one) based on the associated verificationMethod for the CFO 
   Check that the <code>credentialSubject.jobTitle</code> has “Chief Financial Officer” in the delegation credential 
   Check that the issuer property in the delegation credential matches the <code>credentialSubject.id</code> in the original credential 
 

<p>Original Credential checks</p>

 
   Check that the verificationMethod is associated with the assertionMethod proofPurpose for the employer in the original credential 
   Check that the verificationMethod in the original credential is associated with the issuer property of the original credential 
   Check that the proofValue is valid in the original credential proof (the top one) based on the associated verificationMethod for the CFO 
   Check that the <code>credentialSubject.jobTitle</code> has “Chief Financial Officer” in the original credential 
   Check that the original credential isn’t revoked 
 

<blockquote>
  <p>Note to consider: If the credentials in the verifiable presentation are ordered incorrectly that’s going to introduce some problems</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But wait how did the authorization system know that the assistant has been attenuated with limited permission to only authorize payments below $10,000? Well, we’ve got a few different ways we could do that, let’s take a look at the ways we can extend this simple delegation pattern.</p>

 Extension 1: CFO adds a <code>maximumAuthorizationLimit</code> property to the delegation credential 

<p>So in this scenario, the CFO adds <code>maximumAuthorizationLimit</code> property like so:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
        {
            "@vocab": "https://example.com/employer/"
        }
    ],
    "id": "http://example.com/employer/credentials/123",
    "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "EmployerCredential"],
    "issuer": "did:example:cfo",
    "issuanceDate": "2010-01-01T19:73:24Z",
    "credentialSubject": {
        "id": "did:example:assistant",
        "jobTitle": "Chief Financial Officer",
        "employeeNumber": 123,
        "maximumAuthorizationLimit": 10000
    },
    "proof": {
        "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
        "created": "2019-12-11T03:50:55Z",

        "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
        "verificationMethod": "did:example:cfo#key1"
    }
}
</code>   

<p>and the verifiable presentation would now look like this:</p>

   <code>{
  "@context": [

        "proofPurpose": "authentication",
        "verificationMethod": "did:example:assistant#key1"
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Awesome, so now we have a verifiable presentation that attenuates the delegated capabilities of making authorization payments and limits the payments to $10000 for the assistant. This new property introduces some new checks though in our business logic.</p>

 
   Check that the <code>credentialSubject.maximumAuthorizationLimit</code> in the delegation credential is below the limit afforded to the <code>credentialSubject.jobTitle</code> 
   Check that the payment hasn’t exceeded the <code>credentialSubject.maximumAuthorizationLimit</code> 
 

<p>But wait, when we delegated the ability for the assistant to authorize payments we also inadvertently allowed the assistant to sign off on the quarterly reports! Oh no! Now, we’ve got a legal liability issue on our hands.
We’ll need to build on top of option 1 to make sure that the assistant isn’t signing off on our quarterly reports too and so that we can adhere to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">principle of least authority</a>. We’ll cover that in option 2.</p>

 Extension 2: limiting the assistant’s abilities to only payment authorization capabilities 

<p>Since the CFO has two capabilities, we need to disable the one that would allow the assistant to also sign off on quarterly reports. We’re going to go ahead and do this via the introduction of the <code>canSignQuartlyReports</code> claim.</p>

<p>So now the delegation credential looks like this:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
        {
            "@vocab": "https://example.com/employer/"
        }

        "jobTitle": "Chief Financial Officer",
        "employeeNumber": 123,
        "maximumAuthorizationLimit": 10000,
        "canSignQuartlyReports": false
    },

        "verificationMethod": "did:example:cfo#key1"
    }
}

        "verificationMethod": "did:example:assistant#key1"
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Finally, we’ve got a properly attenuated delegation verifiable credential to address our use case! So what’s the issue with this? First off, we’re using only a toy example here where the CFO has only two capabilities.
Most businesses aren’t paying CFOs the big bucks to only handle those two things though (If they are let me know, I’m sure I can figure that job out 😊). This means that for every additional capability that we don’t want to be delegated we have to add a permission property. By doing this we’re effectively building a deny list with only one capability removed to enable a single capability. Why not build off of and allow list model instead? (Hint this is the approach ZCAP-LDs take)</p>

<p>So our delegation credential could end up looking something like this:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
        {
            "@vocab": "https://example.com/employer/"
        }
    ],
    "id": "http://example.com/employer/credentials/123",
    "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "EmployerCredential"],
    "issuer": "did:example:cfo",
    "issuanceDate": "2010-01-01T19:73:24Z",
    "credentialSubject": {
        "id": "did:example:assistant",
        "jobTitle": "Chief Financial Officer",
        "employeeNumber": 123,
        "maximumAuthorizationLimit": 10000,
        "canSignQuartlyReports": false,
        "canDoXCapability": false,
        "canDoYCapability": false,
        "canDoZCapability": false,
        ...
    },
    "proof": {
        "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
        "created": "2019-12-11T03:50:55Z",
        "proofValue": "....",
        "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
        "verificationMethod": "did:example:cfo#key1"
    }
}
</code>   

 Tradeoffs with this design 

<p>Furthermore, the semantics of the claims in this new credential is quite odd. We’ve effectively combined a claims token and a permission token into a single verifiable Credential here. By doing this we’re far more likely to be issuing and reissuing the same credential many times as access to the delegatee needs to be updated. This also has second-order effects on the maintainability and adaptability that are best described by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter">principle of least knowledge</a>.</p>

<p>It also just so happens, these types of deny lists are awesome things to get your hands on as well when you’re performing the reconnaissance phase of a penetration test to break into a system. Now our system design is helping the attackers assuming they get ahold of one of the credentials, but none of the keys. If they get the keys, problems that are better left out of scope for this writeup occur.</p>

<p>Additionally, the fact that we need to perform 16 checks just to achieve our goal means that it’s highly likely that one gets missed and an authorization bypass vulnerability is introduced. As is pointed out in the CCG mailing list though, this is mainly a byproduct of the fact we’re performing delegation rather than the usage of VCs themselves. However, delegation is only complicated when done correctly. After all, when people are sharing their Netflix passwords they too are delegating and that is a simple implementation for the verifier. So the takeaway here is that the more we can reduce the number of checks when building transparent delegation the more resilient and secure the authorization system is likely to be.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>In conclusion, I stand by the opinion that utilizing verifiable credentials to build authorization systems is possible, but more work than is necessary. Hopefully, this walk-through helps to understand why I’ve come to this conclusion. However, just because I’ve decided I’m probably not going to use VCs in this way doesn’t mean you shouldn’t. Just like any technology, some tradeoffs occur when deciding how you approach your system design. It may be the case that this is the simplest method to achieve your use case. If that’s true then by all means go for it. However, I suspect things can be simplified through the use of <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-ld/">ZCAP-LD</a>. ZCAP-LD is built on the concept of an object capabilities model which is well suited for authorization systems (but not for making claims about a subject). I’ll be writing up a follow-up blog on how the same use case described above could be designed with ZCAP-LD and show the differences between the two. Be on the lookout for that to come next!</p>

 Common Delegation Patterns in the Verifiable Credential Ecosystem 

<p>It’s commonly understood that verifiable credentials are a useful data model for expressing provenance and authority of data. In other words, they’re great for solving the “who says what” problem in a digital ecosystem. However, did you know that there are three ways in which you can utilize VCs and DIDs to enable delegation and attenuated delegation for more complex scenarios? In this blog post, I’ll cover the three patterns you can use with examples to help you figure out some of the more advanced capabilities of the VC data model. See below for more details!</p>

 Terminology 

<p>Since it’s quite common to see these terms within the IAM space, I figured it would be useful to first cover what each term means in simple term.</p>

<p>Delegation: This is the ability for someone to share their abilities with another user within the system. There’s multiple ways this can be done all with different forms of tradeoffs.</p>

 
   
    <p>A user who shares their password with another user is performing delegation, but not in a way that allows an authorization endpoint (often times called a “verifier”) to be able to uniquely differentiate between the two users. This inability to differentiate at the authorization endpoint often leads to concerns around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confused_deputy_problem">confused deputy problem</a>.</p>
   
   
    <p>This when the system has been designed to allow the user to share their abilities with another user. The most common way this shows up today is with google document links. When a user “allows anyone with this link to view/comment/edit” they’re granting abilites to other users in a delegated way. The difference being the system can identify these unique users, which is commonly seen via the further delegation based upon an email address or organization.</p>
   
 

<p>Attenuated delegation: This is when the user opts to share only a portion of the abilities that they have. So looking at our options from delegation, option 1 would not allow this because the user is sharing all the same abilities that they have when logging into an account. So if an admin shares their password, the person they share the password with has admin abilities as well. One of the more common examples I can think of when attenuated delegation that is in use today is when a valet key is given to a valet. This key gives the valet access to drive the vehicle, but doesn’t allow them to open a glovebox or trunk for example. In this case, the driver of the vehichle is able to share only a portion of their abilities (driving) without sharing all of their abilities (opening a glovebox or trunk). In almost every system I’ve seen, this has to be intentionally designed into the system.</p>

 Delegation without attenuation by using DID Documents 

<p>As an example, let’s say we have the two following DID Documents:</p>

<p>Alice’s DID Document:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
        "https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"
    ],
    "id": "did:example:alice",
    "verificationMethod": [
        {
            "id": "did:example:alice#aliceKey1",
            "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",
            "controller": "did:example:alice",
            "publicKeyMultibase": "zH3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
        },
        {
            "id": "did:example:bob#bobKey1",
            "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",
            "controller": "did:example:bob",
            "publicKeyMultibase": "z9hFgmPVfmBZwRvFEyniQDBkz9LmV7gDEqytWyGZLmDXE"
        }
    ],
    "assertionMethod": [
        "did:example:alice#aliceKey1",
        "did:example:bob#bobKey1"
    ]
}
</code>   

<p>Bob’s DID Document:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
        "https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"
    ],
    "id": "did:example:bob",
    "verificationMethod": [
        {
            "id": "did:example:bob#bobKey1",
            "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",
            "controller": "did:example:bob",
            "publicKeyMultibase": "z9hFgmPVfmBZwRvFEyniQDBkz9LmV7gDEqytWyGZLmDXE"
        }
    ],
    "assertionMethod": ["did:example:bob#bobKey1"]
}
</code>   

<p>In this example we can see that Alice has the capability to delegate to Bob the ability for him to assert on her behalf.
In the case of the following VC, bob could then create a valid verifiable presentation based on the following verifiable
credential that was delegated to him:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
        "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1"
    ],
    "id": "http://example.gov/credentials/3732",
    "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "UniversityDegreeCredential"],
    "issuer": {
        "id": "did:example:issuer"
    },
    "issuanceDate": "2020-03-10T04:24:12.164Z",
    "credentialSubject": {
        "id": "did:example:alice",
        "degree": {
            "type": "BachelorDegree",
            "name": "Bachelor of Science and Arts"
        }
    },
    "proof": {

    }
}
</code>   

<p>Where the verifiablePresentation looks like so:</p>

    }

</code>   

<p>This effectively is a method to allow Alice to add bob’s public key to her did document and giving him a copy of the verifiable credential to delegate him to act on her behalf. However, because this pattern relies on Alice granting Bob full authority to perform any action on her behalf, it lacks attenuation, but does have delegation.</p>

 Delegation by VCs 

<p>Additionally, there’s a well documented case to be able to establish delegation using just VCs without the ability to attenuate the data. See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#subject-passes-a-verifiable-credential-to-someone-else">Section Appendix C.5</a> for more details on this pattern.</p>

 Attenuated Delegation by VCs 

<p>Further, by combining the pattern described in <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#subject-passes-a-verifiable-credential-to-someone-else">Section Appendix C.5</a> and combining it with the usage of a selective disclosure scheme like BBS signatures, we can enable an attenuated delegation pattern.</p>

<p>This is done via modifying the type of proof used to sign the credential and then utilizing the selective disclosure to limit the data. Using the following original verifiable credential:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
        "https://w3id.org/citizenship/v1",
        "https://w3id.org/security/bbs/v1"
    ],
    "id": "https://issuer.oidp.uscis.gov/credentials/83627465",
    "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "PermanentResidentCard"],
    "issuer": "did:example:issuer",
    "identifier": "83627465",
    "name": "Permanent Resident Card",
    "description": "Government of Example Permanent Resident Card.",
    "issuanceDate": "2019-12-03T12:19:52Z",
    "expirationDate": "2029-12-03T12:19:52Z",
    "credentialSubject": {
        "id": "did:example:b34ca6cd37bbf23",
        "type": ["PermanentResident", "Person"],
        "givenName": "Alice",
        "familyName": "SMITH",
        "gender": "Female",
        "image": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgokJggg==",
        "residentSince": "2015-01-01",
        "lprCategory": "C09",
        "lprNumber": "999-999-999",
        "commuterClassification": "C1",
        "birthCountry": "Bahamas",
        "birthDate": "1958-07-17"
    },
    "proof": {
        "type": "BbsBlsSignature2020",
        "created": "2020-10-16T23:59:31Z",
        "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
        "proofValue": "kAkloZSlK79ARnlx54tPqmQyy6G7/36xU/LZgrdVmCqqI9M0muKLxkaHNsgVDBBvYp85VT3uouLFSXPMr7Stjgq62+OCunba7bNdGfhM/FUsx9zpfRtw7jeE182CN1cZakOoSVsQz61c16zQikXM3w==",
        "verificationMethod": "did:example:issuer#test"
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Then the following derived proof could be used to attenuate the data while also delegating the credential capabilities to a new holder:</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>So there’s a few different take aways from this that should be highlighted. First and foremost VCs and DIDs have some really interesting capabilities that enable delegation and attenuated delegation. However, it’s not always advantageous and requires thorough understanding of the use case that’s trying to be built with DIDs and VCs and whether or not delegation needs to be enabled or disabled. In some cases, it’s being left in when there’s an expectation that a credential is only able to be used by a single holder. Finally, it should be noted that while VCs are capable of being used for authorization systems, it’s generally not a good idea to do so. This is because the complexity (based on the number of checks) of the authorization system is quite high and the semantics have not been designed in a way that align well with most authorization systems meaning a vulnerability is more likely to be introduced. If you’re looking for these capabilities, I would recommend you look to the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-ld/">ZCAP-LD data model</a> which is designed especially for these concepts. And if you’re still confused and would like some help please reach out and I can see how I can help.</p>

  <p>Google has all  my e-mail. (And I don’t. They merely let me access it with a browser.)</p>
<p>Facebook has the list of all of my friends and what I said to them. (And I don’t.)</p>
<p>LinkedIn has all of my business contacts. (Repeat after me: and I don’t.)</p>
<p>Instagram has all my photos. Well, the Instagram department of Facebook does. (Chorus now: and I don’t.)</p>
<p>Amazon has the list of all my purchases, and knows what products I was
interested in but didn’t buy after all. (AND I DON’T.)</p>
<p>The list goes on.</p>
<p>Does this sound right to you? It sounds quite wrong to me.</p>
<p>But maybe it doesn’t matter. Things go well in this arrangement, don’t they?</p>
<p>Not so fast. Let’s start with losing access to my accounts. Maybe I forgot my
password and failed to reset it. Or maybe I managed to get a password reset
e-mail but my primary e-mail account was hacked, and now the attacker controls my
Facebook account and I don’t. Maybe Google decided to disable my account, and given
that there is no appeals process, that’s the end of me and my e-mail. The end
of a 20-year-long record of all important things I wrote to others and they wrote
to me. In the blink of an eye, because they have my data and I don’t.</p>
<p>But even if everything is fine, and I don’t forget my passwords and don’t get
hacked and won’t get locked out: it’s a bit like being a really unimportant guest
living in a fancy hotel on a short-term lease. They can kick me out any time, and
keep all my furniture and other possessions, no questions asked. Thank you, I
prefer my very own home, where nobody can kick me out, or at least renter
protection laws, which don’t exist online.</p>
<p>We got to get our data back.</p>

Illustration: Digital Identity&nbsp;Wallet<p>This article explains what a wallet is, how it works and how you can use it for managing your digital identity. While there are also wallets for institutions, this article only focuses on wallets for end users. The article also takes into consideration the revised eIDAS regulation including the ‘European Digital Identity&nbsp;Wallet’.</p> An Introduction <p>A digital wallet is a key management application, which provides a user with a graphical interface to store, manage and secure digital keys. These keys can be used to sign transactions, statements, credentials, documents or&nbsp;claims.</p><p>A digital identity wallet enables a user to establish relationships and interact with third parties in a trusted manner. While the wallet aspect is mainly dealing with key management, storage aspects and the graphical interface (UI = User Interface), the third party interactions are rather organised by your agent, which is a part of your wallet. Your agent handles third-party interactions in your name and acts in your interest. It is a piece of software, which helps you to stay in control of your messaging, security, health records, privacy, purchases etc.</p> A digital identity wallet based on self-sovereign identity (SSI) principles. <p>Not all wallets are the same! A wallet is a piece of technology, which can be implemented in different ways. While it can leverage decentralised identifiers (DIDs) and verified credentials, it doesn’t necessarily need to follow the principles of SSI. There are cloud wallets, which are hosted and provided by a third party. A good comparison is a wallet for cryptocurrencies — think of an exchange like Coinbase or Binance. These companies offer you a hosted wallet, which you don’t control. You might have the authentication means (password + second factor) to access your wallet, but it’s not yours. In this case, you are the owner, but not the possessor and you don’t have data sovereignty. This is in stark contrast to so-called self-custody wallets, which you install on your device. These wallets randomly create a private key, which only you know. The key point is that your wallet creates keys for you, which only you know and not a third&nbsp;party.</p><p>A digital identity wallet, which follows the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">principles of SSI </a>enables the user to have data sovereignty and complete control as well as data portability. It provides you with the necessary autonomy to be independent of a third party. It not only enables ownership but also possession. It enables transparency and explicit consent when sharing information. It’s also vendor-independent, meaning you can export your data and import it into another wallet of your choice since it is built on open standards, which are widely used. It also creates peer identifiers for every new contact or rather an interaction, instead of getting an identifier assigned to&nbsp;it.</p> The core functions of an SSI&nbsp;wallet <p>Please note that the described characteristics below are not universally valid for all (SSI) wallets. It’s rather a desired&nbsp;status.</p>Interactions in an SSI ecosystem, picture by Adrian Doerk from&nbsp;Lissi.<p>Establish trusted relationships with third parties:<br>The wallet can create an encrypted communication channel to exchange information between you and a (trusted) third party. This communication channel is based on a unique identifier, which you control. Hence it is not hosted by a third party. This in turn enables you the portability of communication channels. Meaning if you switch from one wallet to another you can use the communication channels, which you already created without the reliance on any third-party platform.</p><p>Store, organise and present verified data:<br>The user can store and manage (verified) credentials among other information within the wallet. Once in the wallet, credentials can be used to answer a proof request from every connection. The wallet creates a verifiable presentation, which the user can choose to send or instead decline the proof request. Users are also able to verify the identity of the other party, effectively establishing a trusted relationship, which can be leveraged to share and receive information within a defined trust framework such as the eIDAS regulation. This trust might be based on an electronic seal or similar trust mechanisms. However, this might not be the case for all contacts.</p><p>The information exchanged can be verified, but can also be self-attested or just proof a certain threshold without revealing the exact information like your age when proofing you are 18 or&nbsp;older.</p><p>A transparent history of shared data:<br>Since the wallet usually keeps a history of interactions, the user can track who shared what data and when. This leads to greater transparency for the user and helps to better exercise data protection rights. A framework for the integration of detailed consent forms is currently under development.</p> Self-custody: With great control comes great responsibility <p>These digital wallets run locally as an application on the device of the user. From a technical perspective, these wallets are similar to self-custody wallets for cryptocurrencies. Similar to these wallets the user has the responsibility to do a&nbsp;backup.</p><p>Identification, authentication and authorization:<br>Before diving deeper into the core functions of a digital wallet we need to understand the differences between the three words above. The questions are from the perspective of the verifier or&nbsp;issuer.</p><p>Identification answers the question: “Who is I’m talking to?”<br>Authentication answers the question: “Is it you (whom I’ve identified already) again?”<br>Authorization answers the question: “What rights do I want to grant&nbsp;you?”</p><p>The wallet can enable a variety of additional functions and thus serves as a central point for the user to manage and access services. For example, the wallet can be used to replace traditional authentication methods such as passwords with a single sign-on (SSO) functionality. Furthermore, existing standards such as the OpenID Connect protocol can also be connected to enable communication with existing infrastructure. Hence, once widespread adopted the wallet will completely replace passwords for you and enable you to identify and authenticate yourself, identity third-parties as well as authorise third-parties to use your data according to your permissions.</p> The European Digital Identity&nbsp;Wallet Illustration: European Digital Identity&nbsp;Wallet<p>The main regulation within the European Union, which addresses the topic of identification (among other topics) is the regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market better known as eIDAS regulation. The regulation just went through a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity">major revision and now includes several aspects regarding self-sovereign identities</a> in its draft version. It also includes the aspect of a European Digital Identity Wallet, which “is a product and service that allows the user to store identity data, credentials and attributes linked to her/his identity, to provide them to relying parties on request and to use them for authentication, online and offline, for a service in accordance with Article 6a; and to create qualified electronic signatures and&nbsp;seals”.</p><p>In the following, the European Digital Identity Wallet is referred to as “EU Wallet” for simplicity.</p> Functions of the EU&nbsp;Wallet: <p>It should technically enable the selective disclosure of attributes to relying parties. Member States should also reach an agreement on common elements of a business model and fee structure of the EU Wallets. The EU Wallet will furthermore enable citizens to create qualified electronic signatures that can facilitate political participation among other functions.</p> EU Wallets shall enable the user&nbsp;to:   securely request and obtain, store, select, combine and share, in a manner that is transparent to and traceable by the user, the necessary legal personal identification data and electronic attestation of attributes to authenticate online and offline to use online public and private services;  sign statements or contracts utilising qualified electronic signatures (QES)  have full control of the EU Wallet. The issuer of the EU Wallet shall not collect information about the use of the EU Wallet which are not necessary for the provision of the EU Wallet&nbsp;service.  use it free of charge (natural persons).  access the wallet for persons with disabilities.   The EU Wallets shall provide a common interface:   to qualified and non-qualified trust service providers issuing qualified and non-qualified electronic attestations of attributes.  for relying parties to request and validate personal identification data and electronic attestations of attributes.  for the presentation to relying parties of personal identification data, electronic attestation of attributes or other data such as credentials, in local mode not requiring internet access for the&nbsp;wallet.   Furthermore, the EU Wallets need&nbsp;to:   ensure that trust service providers of qualified attestations of attributes cannot receive any information about the use of these attributes.  meet the requirements in regards to assurance level “high”, in particular as applied to the requirements for identity proofing and verification, and electronic identification means management and authentication.  provide a mechanism to ensure that the relying party is able to authenticate the user and to receive electronic attestations of attributes;  ensure that the personal identification data uniquely and persistently represent the natural or legal person is associated with&nbsp;it.   An EU Wallet shall be&nbsp;issued: <p>(a) by a Member State;<br>(b) under a mandate from a Member State;<br>(c) independently but recognised by a Member&nbsp;State.</p><p>The draft regulation requires Member States to issue a EU Wallet under a notified eID scheme to common technical standards following a compulsory compliance assessment and voluntary certification within the European cybersecurity certification framework, as established by the Cybersecurity Act.</p><p>Service providers should communicate their intent to rely on the EU Wallets to the Member States. Relying on the level of assurance “high”, the EU Wallets should benefit from the potential offered by tamper-proof solutions such as secure elements.</p><p>The conformity of EU Wallets should be certified by accredited public or private sector bodies designated by Member States. Certification should in particular rely on the relevant European cybersecurity certifications schemes. The EU Wallet Trust Mark’ means an indication in a simple, recognisable and clear manner that a EU Wallet has been issued in accordance with this Regulation.</p><p>The Commission shall establish, publish and maintain a list of certified European Digital Identity&nbsp;Wallets.</p> Where are heading? A personal&nbsp;opinion:   A wallet acts as a central point to manage interactions in a digital world. It will be the standard for identity management and be ubiquitous in everyday&nbsp;life.  Technology is moving fast. While standardisation is taking quite a while, institutions and governments have recognised the need for innovation in this area to secure data sovereignty and not be dependent on a foreign oligopoly of companies with irresponsible business practices.  Dozens of use-cases from different industries are explored in parallel and will be available in the upcoming&nbsp;months.  Over time digital wallets for pure identity management and financial applications (e.g. cryptocurrencies or central bank digital currencies (CBDC)) are likely to&nbsp;merge.  The draft of the revised eIDAS regulation of the European Union is the most comprehensive and ambitious step towards SSI internationally.  While the exact implementation and technical specifications of the EU Wallets are still to be determined, their compulsory issuance for the EU Member States as well as the compulsory acceptance for big platform providers will have a tremendous international impact.  Key management is an issue, which still needs to be solved. This means, the user also has the responsibility of having a secure backup solution to restore the wallet in case of lost&nbsp;access.

 This past week, the Colorado legislature passed the “Colorado Privacy Act”,
which makes Colorado the 3rd US state with modern privacy legislation,
following the CCPA in California
and the CDPA in Virginia.
It will start going into effect about 24 months from now. 
 Its provisions are similar to California’s and Virginia’s, except for
this one, which goes substantially further:

<p>This past week, the Colorado legislature passed the “Colorado Privacy Act”,
which makes Colorado the 3rd US state with modern privacy legislation,
following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act">CCPA in California</a>
and the <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+sum+HB2307">CDPA in Virginia</a>.
It will start going into effect about 24 months from now.</p>
<p>Its provisions are similar to California’s and Virginia’s, except for
this one, which goes substantially further:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A CONTROLLER THAT PROCESSES PERSONAL DATA FOR PURPOSES OF TARGETED ADVERTISING
OR THE SALE OF PERSONAL DATA SHALL ALLOW CONSUMERS TO EXERCISE THE RIGHT TO OPT
OUT OF THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING THE CONSUMER FOR
PURPOSES OF TARGETED ADVERTISING OR THE SALE OF PERSONAL DATA …
BY CONTROLLERS THROUGH A USER-SELECTED UNIVERSAL OPT-OUT MECHANISM THAT
MEETS THE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS ESTABLISHED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">Do Not Track</a> – or
something very much like it – is back in Colorado, and ignoring the setting,
like companies did widely when Do Not Track was created, is not an option any more.
The technical details will need to be figured out between now and when this
provision goes into effect, which two and a half years away. So plenty of
time to get this right.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/">W3C VC-EDU</a> call on June 7, 2021 we discussed <a href="https://openbadges.org/">Open Badges</a> asserted as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs). This call began the public discussion of Open Badges as Native VCs (potentially as Open Badges 3.0) to inform the IMS Open Badges Working Group. Why are we discussing this? Why does it matter? How will it work? Feedback from folks in the community have suggested that it would be helpful to answer these questions first from a conceptual standpoint. In a later post, we can outline what the structural changes could look&nbsp;like.</p><p>Open Badges are digital credentials that can recognize learning, achievements, and even memberships. They look like an image, but inside the image are metadata properties (it works much like how digital photos have metadata properties that explain the data of the photo, location, etc. so that when the photo is uploaded, applications understand the data). The metadata describes why the badge was issued, when, the recipient (typically an email address), the description and criteria of the achievement, and, critically, how this digital credential can be verified.</p><p>The verification of an Open Badge is dependent on the Issuer of the badge. It can be done in one of two&nbsp;ways:</p>  <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html#HostedBadge">Hosted Verification</a> — One of the metadata properties of an Open Badges is the assertion id which is a URL that hosts the metadata in a&nbsp;.json file. If that URL can’t be found, then the badge is not verifiable  <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html#SignedBadge">Signed Verification</a> — An Issuer can digitally sign the metadata of a badge. This uses cryptography to ensure that the badge data has not changed and that the issuer was the entity that issued the badge. The public key used to sign the badge must be traceable back to the&nbsp;issuer.  <p>Primarily, Open Badges platforms are issuing hosted badges. This means the verifying party is dependent on the issuer to host the data. Also, the issuer has some ability to track when the badge data has been accessed and potentially by who (or at least by IP address).</p><p>For 99% of the badges that have been issued to date, this is fine. In fact, badges are often shared via web pages that attractively display the image and data (not by the&nbsp;.json files that contain the data or the baked image with the data inside). So while Open Badges are both human readable and machine readable, the human readable approach is what is used most often. Signed badges are closer to Verifiable Credentials because they also rely on cryptographic proof.</p><p>Neither of these approaches give learners control of their data and this is the overall conceptual shift between Open Badges 2.0 and Open Badges as Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials, like signed Open Badges, are signed by the issuer and verified cryptographically. Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) can be used to identify the issuer and recipient (using DIDs in Open Badges 2.0 has been prototyped). Also, Verifiable Credentials have a concept called “Presentations” which can be digitally signed by the recipient to prove that they are the recipient of the verifiable credential(s) being presented. All in all, this means that the issuer is verified and also the recipient.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials can be displayed, shared, and presented from wallet applications that are web, mobile, or desktop based (most are mobile right now). Recipients can present one or more of their credentials to verifying third-parties who can verify the credentials without depending on the issuers and consume the data. Not only can the participant manage which credentials are being verified, they can control what aspects of their data are being&nbsp;shared.</p><p>For example, a student’s digital wallet may contain a digital passport, an Open Badge representing a completed course, and an Open Badge representing a student ID (all as Verifiable Credentials). A relying third-party, such as a potential employer seeking to fill an internship role, may need to verify that a student is over 18, has completed a course on communication, and is a current student. The employer’s website application can ask the student to provide this discrete information using their wallet and the student can do this without revealing any of the other information in those credentials like their date of birth, address, photo, or even the name of the school they attend. And all of this information can be verified without contacting the issuers of those credentials. Open Badges 2.0 can’t do&nbsp;this.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials put learners in the center of a trust triangle with issuers and verifiers. They also add an additional layer of verification for the recipients. Open Badges can take advantage of this, be the first education-focused digital credential spec to promote personal protection of and access to data, and be part of the growing ecosystem that is exchanging Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>It’s worth noting that the human readable aspect of Open Badges would not change in a VC version. Issuers can still display web pages for the issued badges and allow recipients to share their badges online from those pages. The difference being that those web pages would not be reliant on for machine verification or consumption.</p><p>Join us for this continuing discussion in the next VC-EDU call this coming Monday June 14 (and most Mondays) at 8am PDT / 11am EDT / 4pm BST / 5pm CEST. This call is public and all are welcome to join. For this Monday’s call (6/17), the zoom info has&nbsp;changed:</p><p><a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/j/89426035740?pwd=dmQ0QS9wMUdFaGo0eFcwbkplV3RjUT09">https://us02web.zoom.us/j/89426035740?pwd=dmQ0QS9wMUdFaGo0eFcwbkplV3RjUT09</a></p>

<p>A simple technology invented by Bell Labs over 20 years ago (and widely used today) could have prevented the Colonial Pipeline attack.</p> <p></p> <p>In 1880, the French government awarded Alexander Graham Bell roughly the equivalent of $300K as a prize for inventing the telephone. He used the award to fund the research laboratory that became colloquially known as Bell Labs. If you’re not familiar with Bell Labs, you should be. In the 140+ years that followed, researchers at <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/">Bell Labs</a>invented radio astronomy, transistors, lasers, solar cells, information theory, and UNIX, just to name a few of the many accomplishments. Among the many prestigious <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/about/awards/">awards</a>granted to Bell Labs researchers are nine Nobel prizes and twenty-two IEEE Medals of Honor.</p> <p>In 1998, I joined <a href="https://about.att.com/sites/labs_research">AT&amp;T Labs</a>, which was a research group that the company retained when they spun out most of Bell Labs to Lucent Technologies in 1996. I was a Web Application developer; one of the least technical roles in the Labs. If I ever thought for a moment that I knew technology, I was quickly humbled when I built an app that tracked the Labs' actually importantprojects. The experience of working in the Labs stuck with me in the form of humility and curiosity. I accepted that I may never be the foremost expert in any given technology and I assumed the mindset of a forever student. Even today, I constantly question what I think I know because there are always holes in my knowledge or perspectives that I haven’t seen.</p> <p>1998 was the same year that researchers at AT&amp;T Labs were issued a patent (filed in 1995)  for what became known in our industry as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). As a Product Manager at a tech firm, I don’t review patents for legal reasons. But I recently saw an excerpt of the abstract for the AT&amp;T patent and there was one line that I found entertaining: “A preferred method of alerting the customer and receiving a confirmation to authorize the transaction back from the customer is illustratively afforded by conventional two-way pagers.” Not much has changed in 23 years. Pagers have been largely replaced by SMS but text messaging through the telecom provider’s network remains one of the most popular delivery mechanisms for MFA (despite some <a href="https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/questionsand-buzz-surrounding-draft-nist-special-publication-800-63-3">potential security flaws</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>I have no personal insight into AT&amp;T’s motivations at the time, but I read Kevin Mitnick’s book a few years ago (<a href="https://www.mitnicksecurity.com/ghost-in-the-wires">Ghost in the Wires</a>) and can’t help but wonder if AT&amp;T was at the forefront of developing security technologies because they were such a target of hackers for so many years. I also reached out to Steve Greenspan, one of the inventors named in the patent to get his thoughts on the project. He noted:<br></p><p>"Two-way pagers had just come out (1994-1995), and our cybersecurity  friends were debating whether quantum computing would undermine  password-based security. The goal was to explore business applications for  two-way pagers and to put humans in-the-loop for secure access." <br></p><p>Quantum computing is a a pretty interesting business driver for MFA, especially in the mid-1990's. The concern is even more relevant today as we inch closer to quantum compute becoming a practical reality. Today's authentication systems should store password data in non-reversible hashes (theoretically preventing the quantum threat), but it's clear that credentials are being stolen all the time (often via large databases that are just left unprotected) and MFA remains a top solution to mitigate the damage. Steve and team were clearly on the right track when they dreamed up out-of-band authentication and deserve some credit and recognition for the foresight.<br></p>You may be wondering how this relates to the pipeline attack that led to fuel shortages across the U.S. East Coast. Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-04/hackers-breached-colonial-pipeline-using-compromised-password">reported</a>that the Colonial Pipeline, which is the largest fuel pipeline in the country, was taken down by a single compromised password. That should never happen given the variety of tools available to limit and control access, starting with MFA – a relatively simple solution that would likely have prevented the attack. The entry point to the system was a Virtual Private Network (VPN) account. If you’re using a VPN and expose anything sensitive inside the VPN, you should implement strong authentication that includes at least two authentication factors (something you know, something you have, something you are). These are widely available technologies that are very effective against lost or stolen credentials.    <p>Of course, authentication isn’t the end of the story. Today’s widely distributed and highly dynamic environments require multiple layers of security. We all know how popular email and phishing attacks have become. It only takes one person inside a network to open an email, click a link, or logon to a phishing site to give an adversary a foothold in the network. We have to assume that will happen and build layers of strong security between any one user and the potential targets.</p>   <p>To illustrate the point, here’s a quick example:</p>   <p>Grocery stores who sell small, high-value items have traditionally struggled with theft. (Ask me over a beer sometime about how I helped take down a recurring thief when I worked at a grocery store.) If the only answer was to authenticate users (check ID) on the way into the store, it wouldn't be enough. Once inside, someone can still pocket items and walk out without paying. If you walk into a grocery store today, you’ll see cameras in the healthcare aisle where small, expensive medications line the shelves. But that’s not enough either. Each item is also locked in an anti-theft device that’s removed at the register. And some items are found in a locked cabinet that requires employee assistance. Theft still happens, but each layer reduces the risk. Our IT environments are much more complicated in terms of the various pathways to theft and our responses to reduce risk typically require more than a few layers of security.</p>   <p>Sensitive data should only be stored in a secure area of the network with access controls and Least Privilege enforcement. Access should be limited to specific hosts or networks. Data should be encrypted (inside the file when possible - so if the file is stolen, the data is still unusable). There should be strong authentication to get into the network and monitoring of all activity. There should be alerts on unusual behavior and Data Loss Prevention (DLP) to evaluate the sensitivity of data moving across the network. The environment should be scanned regularly for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. And on and on. Any one of these security mechanisms alone is not enough. This multi-layered approach to security is critical in developing a strong security posture that minimizes risk.</p>   <p>We could argue about where to start or which security controls are most important. But, it seems like a no-brainer to implement MFA for employees accessing corporate data and applications. Microsoft, who deals with 300 million fraudulent sign-in attempts daily <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/08/20/one-simple-action-you-can-take-to-prevent-99-9-percent-of-account-attacks/">concluded</a>that “MFA can block over 99.9 percent of account compromise attacks.”That sounds about right. While targeted attacks have increased in prevalence, most attacks are not targeted at specific companies or individuals. Most start with automated scripting or broad-scale phishing attacks that span across potentially thousands of companies and/or millions of people at the same time. When a foothold is found (a script finds a vulnerability or an open port, a user enters credentials into the phishing site, etc.), the attack begins. Implementing a few simple security technologies like automated vulnerability scanning and MFA can prevent most attacks before they begin. Even if a sophisticated phishing attack succeeds despite MFA, the credentials will not be very useful beyond the initial session (which should be limited in scope by other controls).</p>   <p>No single technology will solve all cybersecurity problems. But, implementing MFA is low-cost, easy-to-implement, and highly effective. It may even make life easier for end-users. Password requirements can be loosened because there’s less risk associated with cracked passwords. And there are numerous implementations of passwordless authentication that, while they may not always meet the strict definition of MFA, provide similar (sometimes higher) levels of security as MFA without requiring a password. Combined with context-aware adaptive security (that verifies device, network, location, time-of-day, etc.), these passwordless authentication options may provide the right level of balance between security and user experience. At this point, this isn’t scare tactics or FUD. Attacks on National infrastructure or other high-profile targets can impact the lives of millions with a single execute command. MFA is an easy layer to add to improve security and it’s commonly included with authentication solutions, so there’s really no excuse. It’s time to get it done.</p>

      <p>Whilst our ongoing agile iteration into information beings is never-ending, there are the first 100 days. But what to focus on? Well, that rose-tinted period of conflicting optimisation is what <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/">&lt;/Hello, CDO!&gt; </a>is all about. Maintaining sanity when all else has been lost to untested data assumptions is a different problem entirely.</p><p>On Day zero of being a #CDO, you have to be ready and prepared as a translator, interpreter and go-between. Yes, the essential “translation” of business needs into information requires identifying the appropriate data, the relevant analysis, and the correct interpretations, but that is not what I am talking about. There is a different translation to the appropriately modelled, described and analysed, data that offers the language to enable siloed departments in organisations to talk to each other.</p><p>The CDO must have translation skills to help other executives talk about what data means to them and that each party leaves with a common understanding. Exceptional executives can ensure that key concepts from one domain or department are appropriately translated into language and concepts in the other domain.</p><p>By example,</p>  Data in the language of the finance department has to do with how to position data revenue and costs in the activities in the finance team use. Getting the budget spent on data, algorithms and analysis into the proper R&amp;D tax claim, the capitalisation table and the correct allocation for depreciation take times. How and when should data revenue be recognised? How should the margin for data be calculated? It has nothing to do with what the data does. Understanding what KPI’s the CFO is tasked with and how you can help them be achieved makes for an excellent working relationship. If The CFO is tasked with improving the balance sheet, how you capitalise spending is critical.  Data in the language of the legal department is a focus on the contractual and regulatory obligations. Understanding what the General Council is responsible for is critical, as it has nothing to do with the value data creates for the organisation. If you want certain protections for data, data use and data sharing, working with the legal team to craft holistic on and offline terms that spread across all contracts is critical.  Data in the language of the marketing team can be about privacy persevering data sharing and trust, leading to additional brand value. Sitting down with the senior leadership team in marketing to understand their KPI and BSC can help you translate data into what they need to achieve their goals. It has nothing to do with the value of the data; how they use data is a different issue. However, the CDO must be on top of conflicts that arise with sales targets driven by incentives, KPI’s opt-in demands and contractual boundaries.  <p>Being the translator, interpreter and go-between form you like a bridge, but as already articulated, it means&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/day-0-as-the-cdo-you-are-now-the-new-corporate-punch-bag-1cddc7713c87">you are also the new corporate punchbag.</a></p>  Note to the CEO  <p>The CDO must have translation skill to help your executives speak with other disciplines about data and enable each party to leave with a common understanding. All CDOs will find the language to translate business context into data-enabled initiatives and ensure that key concepts from one domain or department are appropriately translated into language and concepts in the other domain.</p><p>We focus on the skills to “translate business needs” into data and information needs during interviews and the recruitment cycle. This additional translator, interpreter and go-between skill in this article are the built-in skills for exceptional CDO’s. However, if there is someone already in the team with this strength, it is not essential, but it does create a better working culture. Should you need these skills, they must be proven to you before you offer the job, it is not one to learn on the job.</p>

    I remain curious about how I can make better or wiser decisions.&nbsp; I am sharing this as part of my journey as I unpack my own boundaries and models that prevent me from making better decisions. &nbsp; <br> Context <p>I have personally, and will always, dislike and distrust “traditional” hierarchy, probably because I perceived that the “power” wielded on me would never be available to me. &nbsp; I was always on the outside; it is the joy of neuro-diversity that you become aware at an early age that to fit in the system and structure, you have to align to it, which for me, had no natural alignment.&nbsp; You either fight to fit in, fight the system or create your own.&nbsp; For many fitting in is natural, for me it never happened, and I stupidly opted for creating my own.&nbsp; I rebelled against the system and structures as I could only see hierarchy as a method of control to something I did not align to - telling me to do things that made no sense.&nbsp; Write with your right hand as a lefty.</p><p>I am not alone; from Machiavelli to Second lieutenant Boris Drubetskoy in Tolstoy's War and Peace, many have realised that there are two structures of power.&nbsp; There is an obvious hierarchy of control, reporting and subordination, and there is a second unsaid and unwritten one of lobby and access.&nbsp; The obvious one is easy to rebel.&nbsp; The lobby and access inner ring is where true power rests; it is the one to try and join. However, it is invitation-only, and many will sacrifice more than they realise in terms of ethics, morals and beliefs to be at the table and remain part of it. When thinking about data, bias and decision making, the incentive to join and incentives when in the club is a critically important driver. This unsaid shadowy hierarchy creates outcomes we did not plan for as some will jeopardise judgment and trust to be rewarded.&nbsp; I would not align to this one either, and it was self-evident that you can only become a partner in a big firm when you have a big mortgage, depending on a big salary. The significant debt and dependence on salary provide leverage.&nbsp; The humour in “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_Minister">Yes Minister</a>”, the 1980’s BBC&nbsp; political satire sitcom, exposed much of this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Why does this matter?&nbsp; We increasingly talk to the equality and diversity (race, gender and neuro) agendas at the board and in the senior leadership team, but it is increasingly evident that there is an inner circle, which means we are not making smarter or better decisions.&nbsp; The targets for transparency and equality are just that, a target.&nbsp; (says the white over 50 male!)</p><p>I appreciate that it is difficult to separate the two dependent and co-joined aspects of the hierarchy. One aspect represents power and control, which is realised in terms of budget, size, scope, authority, and political dominance. The second is how and where important decisions sit, but those who lobby may be outside of the insights that data now provides for complex decision making.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The separate but parallel structures have worked for a long time as the consequences of long term decisions and intergenerational outcomes were not rewarded or measured. ESG, climate and the brutality of our assault on our environment, coupled with data, means this is all changing, but those who gave everything to join the inner circle have an incentive to maintain the status quo for as long as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>What ghosts are in the system that means decisions we make, with the best intentions, do not create the outcomes we desire</p><p>Take a moment to reflect.&nbsp; Are there separate hierarchies in your experience, or are they the same thing? It matters today more than ever before as we now have to make long term decisions against the backdrop of our systems of short term incentives and rewards.&nbsp; The inner ring becomes blind to a structure that always gives the feel of power as their short term decisions are highly rewarded through immediate incentives, which means being in the club is valuable for the few.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This viewpoint is looking at these two hierarchies (formal and informal) but positioning where either can be in the shadow of the other. Why am I writing this because we appear to find short term incentive-driven decisions easy but struggle to make long term judgment?&nbsp; I do not doubt the integrity of leaders who want to make better long term decisions using data and be better ancestors but get frustrated that it does not work.&nbsp; There are likely ghosts from the old decision making and lobby hierarchy in our current heuristics that create outcomes that were not planned.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: The term “Shadow Hierarchy” is used in management textbooks to describe the difference between a formal published and public structure and the one that actually has power and decision making.&nbsp; Googling “The Shadow of Hierarchy” will lead you to the 2008 paper from Adrianne Heuritier and Dirk Lehmkuhl, which was part of an EU funded project looking at “<a href="http://www.eu-newgov.org/">new models of governance</a>.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br> Our past is not easy to face up to.&nbsp; <p>There appears to be a much longer story that starts when decisions, power and control were all united.&nbsp; Over the past 5000 years, we have become increasingly short term focused and separated the decision-making process for the long term from power and control based on the science of management incentive and short term goals. There is no doubt that the structure of economics, along with other biases, come to play.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; we have created data technology on top of complex relational dependencies that means signals that should become noise through the layers of analysis, in fact, become significant distracting “interruptions” at the board. Whilst in the old system, noise and signals were hidden by the informal lobby that prevented more thoughtful long term decision making based on data, today they (signals and noise) create paralysis at all levels in structures as everyone knows everything.</p><p>Should the head of a religious movement be leading planning for the next 100 years or focussing on if the budget is spent according to the plan this quarter?&nbsp; Should our political leaders face the daily news headlines and respond or ensure we are equipped to face a global pandemic? &nbsp; Should the head of state be allowed to focus on sustainability, climate and global concerns or defending their grandchildren’s choices? What makes noise and news dominate interruptions.&nbsp; In a joined power and decision hierarchy structure a long time ago, a few individuals could make those decisions and choices, and lobby worked.&nbsp; Today our hierarchies,&nbsp; analogous to decision making,&nbsp; have become paralysed, confused and ineffective as the volume of data and signals mixed with noise has risen to a level where our ability to know what is the right thing to do is broken. Currently, we have not transitioned to something that works. Indeed lobby has also failed as it has become increasingly linked to short term reward and incentives.</p><p>The figure below captures this concept on a two-axis chart of scale and impact.&nbsp; The bottom right being an idea, it has no scale and little impact.&nbsp; The top right is big government, global businesses, global NGO’s and charities, global religion and large scale movements. &nbsp; On the journey from the idea to scale, we either transition from our ability to make long term decisions to focus on a quarter by quarter reporting justifying the delta between actual and plan *or* hold onto inter-generational consequences. Risk, funding, capital and markets have a significant impact on the loss of that long term thinking, as the rewards for the players become aligned to short term incentives. Whilst the long term hierarchies become corrupted, the shadow hierarchy of lobby gives way to a different incentive and power game.&nbsp; Impact and scale create the same problems irrespective of the organisation; short-termism can be recognised and rewarded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Joseph, as in the Bible story and multicoloured dream coat fame aka the Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. It is one of the earlier written examples of man’s capability for longer-term planning.&nbsp; It was a 14-year cycle, so not long term; however, 7 years of abundance followed by 7 of famine. Grow, harvest, store and distribute later. 4,000 years on and a 14-year strategic planning cycle looks massive but still short compared to the famed 100 years plus China and Japanese plans. I may have rose-tinted glasses that we were once better at long-range forecasting, but this is a good piece from three world-leading experts “<a href="https://theconversation.com/is-humanity-doomed-because-we-cant-plan-for-the-long-term-three-experts-discuss-137943">is humanity, in fact, unable to successfully plan for the long-term future?</a>” &nbsp; In the context of our currently limiting systems - yes.&nbsp; We have to break the system. I smell revolution.</p> Complexity of relationships <p>No doubt, a small part of the issue with our inability to long-range plan is the management of the complexity in relationships.&nbsp; The web of collaborative relationships that we need to consider only ever gets more strained, detailed, involved, dependant, and unbalanced, as each party align to their incentives and rewards.&nbsp; Critically, the unbalanced nature of the relationship means it is increasingly difficult to predict outcomes and reactions. (search:&nbsp; emergent complex systems). Our commercial framing is explored in the figure below.</p><p></p><p>The shareholder has a dependency on the board to make a decision that supports their funding of the capital. In contrast, the directors are accountable and responsible for their decisions, including unlimited liability. Everyone now has a voice that can affect choices and actions.&nbsp; The Director/ regulator/ ecosystem axis is dominated by who has the accountability and responsibilities, which are different for each stakeholder in an ecosystem and are often driving in different directions because of Balanced ScoreCards (BSC), KPI’s, incentives and being in the club.&nbsp; OKR (objective and key results) are no better, and the difference between built vs operate is a false one for the long term.&nbsp; Building the wrong thing can be rewarded very well in OKR land.&nbsp;</p><p>Continuing around the model, there is a remarkably fluid relationship between the executive teams’ and the board, where the board depends on the exec team. Still, the exec team is accountable to the board.&nbsp; (The level of fluid varies by nation and company law.) The relationships between and with the customer are particularly misunderstood, but ultimately the law says the directors are held accountable. Each of the roles in the chain of relationships from shareholders to the executive team required individuals capable of dealing with complex judgement.&nbsp; However, this assumes that the first part of this viewpoint is null.&nbsp; Let’s expand.&nbsp;</p><p>We face three connected issues but not mutually exclusive because they are a team or part of an ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Some individuals in positions of influence and power are part of the club or want to be in the club and therefore have incentives to be in the club and stay in the club.&nbsp; Their judgement and actions are aligned with being in the club incentives.</p>  <p>Some individuals have reached influence and power but cannot grasp the new mental models and skills for complex judgment.&nbsp; Their judgement and actions are aligned with their experience.</p>  <p>Some individuals can understand the complexity and seek to explain and justify decisions and actions.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Taking this thinking and plotting this on skills/ ability vs decision environment.</p><p></p><p>The diagram above shows a decreasing number of skilled individuals who can cope with complexity. This is because the training system is about effectiveness and efficiency and not about determining if you are doing the right thing (efficacy).&nbsp; Many arrive at senior roles and find they have to shift their mindsets; some do, and some don’t, but they both now have decision capacity.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, we know that systems that create inequality, insecurity, and unsustainable practices are not easily transformed.&nbsp; Think of our government and economy. We have a system where 95% of the world live meal by meal, day by day, week by week or month by month.&nbsp; An additional 4.99% can survive for 6 to 8 months on the available cash and funds. Less than 0.01% (80 Million) of the world’s population can plan for more than a year.&nbsp; When you have those few in power and lobby, will they ever need to vote for change?&nbsp; Worth following and reading Umair Haque; I love this <a href="https://eand.co/our-societies-are-failing-because-their-economies-are-broken-72bb3d378351">essay</a> “How the Economy is Designed to Keep You Poor and Powerless.”&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://opengovernance.net/the-laws-of-1-how-far-before-you-reach-a-revolution-49bbace4049b">The laws of 1% explore outcomes if we change everything by + or - 1% and what it means to human behaviours.</a></p> What do “ghosts in the system” look like?&nbsp; <p>Imagine you are at the fairground, and there is one of the stalls where you get to throw something to win a prize.&nbsp; In the UK, we have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut_shy">Coconut Shy</a>. &nbsp; You pay to get three balls or bags, stand behind the line and throw them one at a time at your coconut of choice.&nbsp; Knock a coconut off, and you win it.&nbsp; A simple game of skill (apparently).&nbsp; However, when there is a ghost in the system, it is not so simple. You line up your ball on coconut number one (it is the biggest one) and throw it with all your skill.&nbsp; As the ball approaches, the coconut moves and your ball sails past. You line up ball 2, aiming again at the largest coconut (the biggest prize); this time, you miss, but coconut number 4 wobbles.&nbsp; Your last chance on this budget.&nbsp; Lining up coconut number one for the last time, you hit it, but it does not fall off, but coconut number 6 does, the smallest one. &nbsp; The ghosts win. &nbsp; Your decisions and outcome was coconut number 1; you got number 6.&nbsp; It was not your lack of skill; coconut number 1 is glued on. Different motivations and rewards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p> The ghosts make signals and noise.&nbsp; <p>This viewpoint started from hierarchy, and I want to return to thinking about the two hierarchies, one of decision and one of power and unpack the issues that the abundance of data has created for us.&nbsp; The diagram below sits with the idea that there is a natural order of decision making and power.&nbsp; The movement from the bottom to the peak is a move in the decision time horizon.&nbsp; Overlaid on this model is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility,_uncertainty,_complexity_and_ambiguity">VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous)</a> situations. VUCA came from preparing/ training the solder who would have to face a situation where they had to decide.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The hierarchy is worth a paragraph to unpack, as the context of VUCA is situational.&nbsp; Front line workers are trained to be reactive. They know how to act based not on scenario but based on the situation (police, army, emergency, fire, medical, call centre, customer-facing representatives).&nbsp; How they react is one of the rules, heuristics and repeated numerous times.&nbsp; As the NIKE brand says - “just do it”, which is what you can do when you have trained to do the same thing for 10,000 hours - you don’t have to think it is a reaction.&nbsp; Above this line is the management who ensure the environment the workers have has the lowest possible risk.&nbsp; Above them is management, who think about “how do we adapt to new situations and threats?” Above them is the strategy layer, which considers “what skills do we need for the next five years, where are the gaps, and how do we access the skills.” &nbsp; For most companies, this takes us to the CEO.&nbsp; However, in public operations, there are two more layers. The transformational one is thinking about the infrastructure for the next twenty years and, finally, the policymakers.&nbsp; The policy leadership should be thinking 50 years hence and considering what policy we will need to form and how. Even at this simple layering, we can see that global leaders from presidents, prime ministers, and heads of state struggle to plan for 5 years yet are tasked with 50.&nbsp; We are not 10 x better; we have created a system 10 times worse.&nbsp;</p><p>What we should be witnessing is that one layers signal is another layers noise.&nbsp; Each layer takes all the signal from below that becomes their noise but detects new signals that they work to.&nbsp; An upward flow - not downward instruction.&nbsp; As the figure below shows, each layer has to apply different skills to find the signals needed to do their role.&nbsp; Interestingly, the lowest layers have the most operations discretion as they are exposed to the highest operational risks.&nbsp; Most diversity is welcome, but not from those who cannot do the same thing every time.&nbsp; Innovation may not be your friend in the depths.&nbsp; The strategy layer has peak decision discretion. Innovation is critical, and so is all diversity is critical. At the pinnacle is policy discretion, where is the least personal risk and whilst diversity is essential but so is adherence to a north star and single vision - so less diversity might help.&nbsp; Diversity is about situational improvement in decision making for better outcomes.&nbsp; Ouch.</p><p></p><p>However, this is not what we are witnessing right now - the above is theoretical rubbish.&nbsp; What we are feeling is summed up in the diagram below.&nbsp; There is are signals from the bottom, creating signals at the top, every layer adding more signals and noise.&nbsp; VUCA has gone from situational layers to the entire organisation, where everyone is reacting to everything.&nbsp; The ghosts of old processes and previous decisions are no longer limited to a layer, but everyone owns everything and has to react and understand. To repeat a previous line.&nbsp; Today our hierarchies,&nbsp; analogous to decision making,&nbsp; have become paralysed, confused and ineffective as the volume of data and signals mixed with noise has risen to a level where our ability to know what is the right thing to do is broken. Currently, we have not transitioned to something that works.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The observation took time, but the question for us all is, do we believe it, and if so, what can we do?&nbsp; Do you believe it should be reflected on within the context of being in the club and how much you have already compromised on?&nbsp; Our Millenials are not in the club and will not compromise, ask them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Our stability has vanished, and our tools have broken. <p>Even to a casual observer, we live in turbulent times, which is seen through an increase in VUCA. The difficultly facing boards who carry responsibility for their decisions cannot be overstated.&nbsp; We have to deal with the ghosts of the past, the voice of the present and the spirits of the future.&nbsp; The diagram below brings out some of the tensions and conflicts being faced as we struggle to determine what we are optimising for.&nbsp; The two-axis are communication (said and unsaid) and status (know and unknown).&nbsp; The unsaid is that which is not written or spoken and assumed, often to avoid more conflict.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We have to deal with the ghosts of the past, the voice of the present and the spirits of the future.</p><p>Top right (said and known) This is the day to day operational aspects of the board and senior leadership team. There are two camps (supporter and action owner) at the board with 10 people involved in decision making. The focus is on management, KPI’s BSC and reporting.&nbsp; There are known status with data, and everyone is able and capable of engagement in the topics. We are married to this quadrant as it is easy and pays the remuneration, and we are incentivised to focus on it.&nbsp; This quadrant has traditionally depended on stability, but with VUCA disrupting that and the volume to signal and noise - we have to spend all our time here as that is all we have time for.</p><p></p><p>The bottom right is said and unknown.&nbsp; In this situation, everyone has a view about the unknown resulting in 10 camps (personal opinions and experience) with the 10 people.&nbsp; However, communication tends to be frank and honest. We go to this quadrant every now and again but quickly withdraw to safer grounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The known and unsaid, top left.&nbsp; The unsaid here are the assumptions that we all make about everyone else in the room and their viewpoints.&nbsp; This time there is are 100 camps as we all assume about what everyone else thinks about everyone as there is no communication.&nbsp; The principal reasons not to communicate is conflict, dominance and leadership style.&nbsp; We are trapped by the debt we have (mortgage, credit, school fees, lifestyle, divorce) and need the salary; therefore, there is a degree of control.&nbsp; We try to avoid this quadrant but every now and then, we end up there because of other stress, pressures and the need for a diversion or win a political game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The bottom left, the unknown and unsaid.&nbsp; The ecosystem has a voice, the partners of the directors have a voice, everyone has a voice, and many, due to previous flights and allegiances, are in several camps at the same time.&nbsp; The crux is that we are human and bring our differences, but it is very messy because it is unknown and unsaid. But this quadrant represents the volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity we are currently facing, and we don’t have the tools to deal with it. We have a preference based on skills, experience and incentives to focus on the top right.&nbsp;</p> Our processes and methods enable only certain decisions <p>One critical aspect of being in a leadership capacity is to question and determine how our processes and methods guide and frame certain decisions, which means we have to unpack legacy and find the ghosts in the system.</p><p>Legacy within this framing is threefold. Decisions. Decisions. Decisions. These are:</p>  <p>Previous incentives and power games created decisions that created processes, methods and rules; they are now ghosts in the systems. These decisions were taken so long ago that no one knows why, how or when it was decided. It is the way we do it; it is our IP, our brand.</p>  <p>Decisions that created “information and technology debt” included embedded and baked-in systems, hidden and no-longer supported code, and automation based on tools and data biased when created.</p>  <p>Decisions that created noise in the hierarchy to lose or filter signals that someone did not want to hear. It was the creation of layers, reports, practices, structural regulation and unchallenged assumptions.</p>  <p>Unpacking legacy questions will take time. It is worth asking questions about legacy when you are new to a company and then verifying them over time as we become blind to the tools that mould us.</p><p>I am focused on this because I want to determine how I can make smarter/ better decisions with data. For that, I need a data decision framework.&nbsp; Therefore I tend to ask what one thing do we as a leadership team want from our data? The response varies but include:</p>  <p>Evidence-based, actionable insights</p>  <p>What should we automate?</p>  <p>How do we know we are doing the right thing?</p>  <p>Where are there efficiencies to be gained?</p>  <p>What do customers really want?</p>  <p>How to manipulate customers to increase margin and revenues?</p>  <p>Where are risks that we cannot see?</p>  <p>What is being hidden that we cannot see?</p>  <p>If you look at this list in the context of what tools and decisions already frame the response, are these what we are looking for data to answer or are we looking to data to affirm/ justify what we have already decided. A different response that no one will say “to justify what we are already doing!”&nbsp; This fits into the know/ unsaid in the previous matrix. The top left, the one we avoid opening up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Data has bias because of previous decisions.&nbsp; Or we can write, “the ghost of previous decisions will guide our current decisions”.&nbsp; Importantly, our data, which we trust, is only the representation of the past, which means our tools fail.</p><p>Therefore, as a leadership team, we have to find non-data tools to check what decisions from the past are biasing the current data, processes and tools.

  <br> What happens when we decrease life support by 1% <br>Taking water down by 1% per day once you pass a threshold of low water intake and death is a certainty in the short term (blue line).  Taking food down by 1% per day, once you pass a threshold, death is a certainty, but it is slower to take you from life than reducing water (green line). Taking lifestyle or experience down by 1% per day gets more challenging and more complex, and you will likely die earlier, but death is not facing you (black line).  We all die, but lack of water means it happens now, lack of food means it happens soon, lack of lifestyle means life could have been longer (black line).

When reducing food by 1%, you reach a point slowly where revolution is worth it as there is less to lose. Still, if you go too far beyond the point when you have agency and capacity from sufficient food, you lose the ability to win the revolution. And you have just enough; why give it up?  Reducing lifestyle by 1% revolution may happen when sufficient have nothing left to lose, which may never come. <br><br>Taking away can lead to revolution. How to prevent revolution, improve by 1%<br><br>  What happens when we increase life support by 1% Increasing water by 1% per day, once you pass a threshold of high water intake, death is a certainty from drowning (blue line) but is very hard to enforce.  Increasing food by 1% per day, there is no threshold where death is a certainty because it is so slow. Increasing lifestyle or experience by 1% per day gets more straightforward, and you will die from something but death is not facing you (black line).  Whilst we all die, too much water, food or lifestyle puts death into the distance, and you have agency and choice. <br><br> <br> Making Stability look like 1% per year <br>When change happens at 1% per day, we notice, when does 1% looks like stability?  A week, month or year.  If I change water, food or lifestyle up or down by 1% per year, life will not change much. However, if down, you will reach a point in 20 years where you can smell revolution. If up, do we become comfortably numb and depend on hope that rather than change. <br><br>Is growth just a mask for the prevention of a power change?  How much will you have to lose before a revolution?<br><br> If the climate changes up by 1% per year - how long will it take?  If the climate changes down by 1% - how long will it take?

<p>I used a Lisp variant in my first programming job, so I have some appreciation for the “code as data” power of that language. Nowadays I’m building an analytics system that combines Postgres and two of its procedural languages, pl/pgsql and pl/python, with a sense-making tool called <a href="https://metabase.com">Metabase</a> that’s written in a Lisp variant called <a href="https://clojure.org">Clojure</a>.</p>
<p>In Postgres I’m able to wrap SQL queries in functions; they compose with other functions that do things like cache results in materialized views and aggregate subgroups. It all feels very dynamic and functional, which are two of Clojure’s main calling cards, so this makes me wonder about Clojure as another Postgres procedural language.</p>
<p>For the pl/python functions in my system, “code as data” looks like building SQL statements that swap variables into SQL templates and combine them. This string-building approach is an anti-pattern for Clojure folk. They don’t want to work with fragments of SQL text, they want to work with Clojure maps. Here’s an example from <a href="https://github.com/musab/honeysql">Honey SQL</a>, the library that Metabase uses to build SQL texts from structured data.</p>
<p><code>(def sqlmap {:select [:a :b :c]<br>
:from   [:foo]<br>
:where  [:= :f.a "baz"]})<br>
</code></p>
<p>This seems like an important power to be able to wield in the hybrid programming environment that Postgres provides. I can imagine making very good use of it.</p>
<p>But I know very little yet about Clojure. Is this really an idea worth exploring? How else would it differ from what I’m now able to do in Python? To learn more about Clojure I’ve been watching talks by its creator, Rich Hickey. Most are tech-heavy but one of them isn’t like the others. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc">Hammock-driven development</a> he lays out a process for creative problem solving that coordinates the waking mind (at the computer doing critical thinking and analysis) with the background mind (on the hammock doing abstraction, analogy, and synthesis). The coordination is explicit: You use the waking mind to feed work to the background mind which is “the solver of most non-trivial problems”; you weight your inputs to the background mind in order to influence their priority in its thinking.</p>
<p>I guess I’ve done that kind of thing implicitly from time to time, but never in such an intentional way. So, is Clojure-in-Postgres worth exploring? Perhaps by writing this I’ll prime my background mind and will receive more clarity in the morning.</p>

   <p><a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/">Peak Paradox</a> is a framework to help you reclaim clarity and control as we believe that if you cannot see the paradox, you have been framed and are in a model where someone else is in control.&nbsp; When you can see the paradox in the data, information, recommendation or decision, you will have improved your clarity.&nbsp; This is a guide <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/explaining-the-model">on how to apply the framework to unlock business models, concepts and complexity</a>.</p><p>Most aspects of everyday business and life can be questioned within the boundaries of the Peak Paradox Framework.&nbsp; I have been exploring that we tend to go out of bounds for a while but find it is too hard to stay there for long. Movement outside of the boundary tends to be a transitional state.&nbsp; The thick red line illustrates the usual boundaries in the figure below.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/plotting-how-to-make-better-decisions">This post explored how to make better decisions using the framework</a> and laid down the idea that some decisions can occur off-piste, outside of the normal boundaries. It presented the reason why we need to minimise shared decision making, find followers and create shared passion if we want to make a difference.&nbsp; Indeed it is no longer about enemies in the camp but about identifying those who share the belief. We must have diversity and not about diversification away from the shared belief.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>I explored the concept that we are <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-occurs-when-physical-beings-transition-to-information-beings-146ea9dcbca3">transitioning from Physical beings to Information beings</a>.&nbsp; The article proposed that our existing models for oversight and governance are breaking and that we need to think about addressing this emerging gap.&nbsp; In an earlier post, I explained that many <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/hello-world">models take us to the boundaries</a> in the Peak Paradox framework, such as cults, politics, beliefs and religion.&nbsp; This post presents the thinking that the economic model of monopoly and political activity of war are outside the framework and a transitional state.&nbsp;</p> As physical beings&nbsp; <p>In the figure below, war and monopoly are outside the boundary between Peak Individual Purpose and Peak Work Purpose.&nbsp; War is nasty, inhumane, and complex, but it serves as a tool to acquire more land with a historical lens. Control of land gave you access to resources, people and materials.&nbsp; The more land and more resources you had access to, in straightforward terms, enabled a few to realise their Peak Individual Purpose (become more sovereign) and for others to realise Peak Work Purpose through growth.&nbsp;</p><p>A more modern version of war is the economics of monopoly, duopoly, or cartel, where a few seek to control resources for their personal gain, enabling them to achieve Peak Individual Purpose through their companies having control.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Both war and monopoly have become increasingly regulated over time. We have created, as humans, complex rules of engagement, governance and oversight.&nbsp; In part to ensure control and power does not fall to one person in a democracy, to protect the vulnerable and to respect life.&nbsp; If they work or not is another story.&nbsp;</p><p></p> As information beings <p>It is not that physical has or will vanish; we will co-exist as both physical and informational. Our physical being is still very much here, but we live in an emergent digital/ data augmented world.&nbsp; War has become cyberwarfare and monopoly of land, and people have become the monopoly of data that indirectly controls people and land, often through an instrument such as debt.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The question being asked is, “have we changed more than just the nature of war and monopoly as we expand from physical beings to information beings?”&nbsp; Our rules, methods, insights and policy work for us as physical beings, but do the same systems and structures work in an information age.&nbsp; Is the paradox that we have to deal with the same outcomes from war and monopolies (control and power), but there is a shift.&nbsp; What is this shift? &nbsp; Yes, some cybercrime and cyber warfare is a replication of the historical war framing, insomuch that an individual, cause or nation wants to use data/ digital as a method of control.&nbsp; But this is just the natural advancement of physical beings adapting to new technology. Gunpowder is another example.&nbsp; However, information being cyberwar is a fight or rage against the machine trying to bring about a better life for everyone and expose injustice - this is different. Past freedom fighters against oppression look similar.&nbsp; A monopoly of data is different to a monopoly of physical resources because <a href="https://opengovernance.net/data-is-data-90ba0b803178">data is data</a>.&nbsp; Data is, by its nature, non-rivalrous and non-excludable. This simple fact is that you cannot declare ownership of data (though many people try); you cannot control it; you lose nothing when you copy it. It is why data is data. &nbsp; Data can bring about better health care; data can bring about better education; data can bring transparency, and data can bring equality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-occurs-when-physical-beings-transition-to-information-beings-146ea9dcbca3">An AI can make better decisions,</a> if we knew what this is, without the bias of human politics. However, it is far too easy to keep our physical being lens on everything as we like it, we are used to it, our systems are aligned to it, and we can ignore or rubbish the emergence and augmentation of data in our decision methodology.&nbsp; A critical point beginning that what we had as oversight and controls for war and monopoly worked for physical beings. The same systems break as informational beings because there is a shift in purpose and even outcomes. What is hard to comprehend is that this is not a transition; it is the emergence of information beings and that both will co-exist. We need to keep adapting our physical rules but need new thinking for informational beings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What does the Peak Paradox framework highlight about this situation? There is an assumption that we are aligned (what type of being are we or both) and how we understand if there is alignment in the team.&nbsp; Because this is hard and subtle, we prefer to assume and make jumps because curiosity and questioning expose ghosts in our thinking and the system;&nbsp; like conflict, tension and power. We don't like facing up to these as they are hard and reflective. The Peak Paradox framework will surface the ghosts and determine if there is an alignment or a delta in the team, project, mission or purpose.&nbsp; If we are only physical beings in our views, we will ignore digital and data and the coming information being. &nbsp; If we are information beings, we see that the controls don’t work, and we are free to exploit an emergent space.&nbsp; The current data monopoly holders don’t look like monopolies through the lens of physical beings.</p><p>The current data monopoly holders don’t look like monopolies through the lens of physical beings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>War and monopoly exist in both the physical and data/ digital/ information world. Still, we cannot apply the same system of the physical world controls developed over generations to the digital/ data/ information world - it is not they break it is they don’t work. &nbsp; The system of control fails because the purpose for which war and monopoly exist is the same and has created a new space.&nbsp; We use the exact same words, but the meaning has changed.&nbsp; Why is monopoly different in a data/ digital information world? Because it looks competitive, data is movable, and users have a choice.&nbsp; Why is war in a data/ digital information world different - because the outcome is not about control.&nbsp; However, the physical still exists, which can confuse and create paradoxes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <br>

<p>The OpenID Connect Federation specification has been updated to add Security Considerations text.  As discussed in the recent OpenID Connect working group calls, we are currently reviewing the specification in preparation for it becoming the third and possibly last Implementerâ€s Draft.</p>
<p>Working group members (and others!) are encouraged to provide feedback on the draft soon before we start the foundation-wide review.  We will probably decide next week to progress the draft to foundation-wide review.  In particular, thereâ€s been interest recently in both Entity Statements and Automatic Registration among those working on Self-Issued OpenID Provider extensions.  Reviews of those features would be particularly welcome.</p>
<p>The updated specification is published at:</p>

     <br><p>Day zero of being a #CDO is probably not the best day to ask difficult questions; however, sometimes, there is no better day.&nbsp; The first question to ask the executive leadership team as you walk around being introduced might be: “What is the one thing that we, as a team and organisation, want our data to drive, deliver or provide?”</p><p>You might want to wait to ask this question and first determine what tools are being used. This will frame what outcomes and decisions are being supported.&nbsp; The question and answers allow you to determine if there is an alignment or gap between “What is the one thing that we, as a team and organisation what our data to drive, deliver or provide?”&nbsp; and what will happen anyway because of tools, processes and legacy.&nbsp; One critical aspect of being a #CDO is determining how our processes and methods only enable certain decisions to be made, but we have to unpack legacy.</p><p>Legacy within this framing is threefold. Decisions. Decisions. Decisions. These are:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Decisions that created processes, methods and rules which were created by previous incentives and power games; and are now ghosts in the systems. These decisions were taken so long ago that no one knows why, how or when it was decided.&nbsp; It is the way we do it; it is our IP, our brand.</p>  <p>Decisions that created “information and technology debt” included embedded and baked-in systems, hidden, and no-longer supported code, and automation based on tools and data biased when created.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Decisions that created noise in the hierarchy to lose or filter signals that someone did not want to hear.&nbsp; It was the creation of layers, reports, practices, structural regulation and unchallenged assumptions.</p>  <p>Unpacking legacy questions will take time, and you will not be ready on Day-0. Therefore any responses you get have to be framed within such understanding when it arrives.&nbsp; It is worth asking the question and then verifying before becoming blind to the tools that mould you.&nbsp;</p><p>“What is the one thing that we, as a team and organisation what our data to drive, deliver or provide? &nbsp;Well, it could be:</p>  <p>Evidence-based, actionable insights</p>  <p>What should we automate?</p>  <p>How do we know we are doing the right thing?</p>  <p>Where are there efficiencies to be gained?</p>  <p>What do customers really want?</p>  <p>How to manipulate customers to increase margin and revenues?</p>  <p>Where are risks that we cannot see?</p>  <p>What is being hidden that we cannot see?</p>  <p>If you look at this list in the context of what tools and decisions already frame the response, are these what we are looking for data to answer or are we looking to data to affirm/ justify what we have already decided.&nbsp; A different response that no one will say “to justify what we are already doing!”</p><p>Data has bias because of previous decisions. Therefore, a #CDO has to find non-data tools to check what decisions from the past are biasing the current data, processes and tools. We cannot usefully answer the question we have set ourselves “What is the one thing that we, as a team and organisation what our data to drive, deliver or provide? without understanding the situation.</p><p>The CTO knows that they have to build a new platform when the bug list, new feature development and maintenance costs are bigger and will take more time than developing a new platform - this is the technology debt question.&nbsp; As the #CDO, you have to understand what is your information debt. The CTO will struggle as there is no clear path from policy to code. Similarly, the CDO, we struggle with no clear path from policy (what one thing) to better data for the decisions we require.&nbsp; You inherit and are now accountable for previous decisions, which constrain what is now possible as the biased tool has created what we have. The costs of collecting, labelling, holding, sorting and creating training data continually increase, creating a more significant gap and misalignment in values and expectations from data.</p><p>“We become what we behold. We shape our tools, and then our tools shape us”&nbsp; is often mistakenly attributed to Marshall McLuhan (as in the image above) and called McLuhan Law. The quote was actually written by Father John Culkin, SJ, a Professor of Communication at Fordham University in New York and friend of McLuhan. Such is the problem with data.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps the opening question is the wrong one? Perhaps we should reflect on these questions as a leadership team.</p>  <p>What do we want to become, and what tools and data will help us?</p>  <p>What tools do we use, and what will they enable us to become?&nbsp;</p>  <p>What is the minimum viable data set required to give the best value?&nbsp;</p>  <p>Do our tools and data trap us?</p>  <br>

<p>ZmartZone has implemented OAuth 2.0 Resource Server functionality in Apache/NGINX modules so these components can be used as a reverse proxy in front of APIs or other backends. In such a setup the backend does not have to deal with security but outsources it to a proxy sitting in front of it in a similar way that TLS termination is often offloaded to a load-balancer.</p>



<p>Most of the OAuth 2.0 deployments today use so-called bearer access tokens that are easy to deploy and use. This type of access token is not bound to the Client presenting the token which means that an attacker intercepting an access token can just use that token to get access to the resources/APIs/services as if it were the Client. So called Proof-of-Possession semantics for access tokens prevent that type of attack and present a more secure setup but such a system is typically harder to implement, deploy and maintain. </p>



<p>A relative simple variant of Proof-of-Possession for access tokens is specified in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8705">RFC 8705 OAuth 2.0 Mutual-TLS Client Authentication and Certificate-Bound Access Tokens</a>. This  specification leverages a (possibly self-signed) certificate held by the Client to bind an access token cryptographically to the private key associated with that certificate.</p>



<p>This specification is implemented in <a href="https://github.com/zmartzone/liboauth2/releases/tag/v1.4.1">liboauth2 1.4.1</a> which is used in the Apache module <a href="https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_oauth2/releases/tag/v3.2.1">mod_oauth2 3.2.1</a>. This means that you can now require and verify OAuth 2.0 certificate bound access tokens for your API in a very simple way that is easy to deploy. All it takes is an Apache server in front of your API, configured with something like:</p>



<p><code>AuthType oauth2<br>OAuth2TokenVerify jwk "{\"kty\":\"RSA\",\"kid\":\"one\",\"use\":\"sig\",\"n\":\"...\",\"e\":\"AQAB\" }" type=mtls&amp;mtls.policy=optional<br>SSLVerifyClient optional_no_ca</code></p>

     <br><p>You are standing in front of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_characters#Deep_Thought">Deep Thought</a>, as in the AI in HitchHicker Guide to the Galaxy.&nbsp; You are tasked with asking the famous question.&nbsp; “What is the answer to the world, the universe and everything?”&nbsp; In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams">Douglas Adams</a> original work, Deep Thought responds by saying, “it will take some time”; before coming back sometime later with the answer “42.”&nbsp; However, this is when data was a statistic, and we were “physical beings” who had not considered what experience would emerge as data became dynamic and we transitioned to “information beings.”</p><p>In our new context as informational beings, Deep Thought would not just take our question, go off to think about it but would respond.&nbsp; Deep Thought would do what we do and ask for clarification and to check the understanding of the question. I can imagine Deep Thought asking, “I just wanta check what you mean by ‘the answer to the world the universe and everything’ and do you want a brave answer, comfortable, or courageous answer?&nbsp; I can do a kind, generous or safe one too? What type of answer do you want?”</p><p>This is the problem we are facing.&nbsp; The questions that we have learnt for governance and oversight over millennia were fabulous to determine who decides, and who decides who decides in a physical world. It was where a human was held responsible and accountable.&nbsp; The issue of oversight becomes very differnt when we have automation and machines/ AI make decisions for us, how do we know who decides?&nbsp; Our questions will not cut it. &nbsp;</p><p>When we apply our old governance, old oversight, old accountable models and old frameworks to new problems, it feels like there is a disconnect and there is a level of dysfunctionality as the old model was not designed for the new problems.&nbsp; There is a forward capability; insomuch that old problems can be addressed better on the new systems, but the old systems cannot help solve or answer new questions.&nbsp; There is a backwards capability issue (not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility">backwards compatibility</a>), just like you cannot run the latest software on the early computers.&nbsp;</p><p>We appear to be right now lost (which the media portrays as division or civilisation collapse creating divides to gain clicks and generate revenue). In reality, we are transitioning from "Physical"&nbsp; to "Information" beings.&nbsp; I take comfort that the best minds at MIT cannot decide either:&nbsp; Atoms to Bits OR&nbsp; Bits to Atoms. We know if MIT is wrestling, then we are in a transition.</p><p>The transition to information beings is reaching a chasm or hurdle, as the old model, which we depended on for governance and oversight, is at the edge of its limits.&nbsp; Data can perfectly tell us how effective and efficient everything is, including the deviance to plan, but data could not tell us if the plan was right or if we are doing the right thing, efficacy.&nbsp; We depended on the oversight model of humans for this.&nbsp; The former, efficiency, is easy, the latter being really quite tricky as it is so contextual to the moment in time and values/ principles we currently hold.&nbsp; Data can tell us from where we came, our models based on said data can suggest where we will go, but as yet, we cannot determine if we should. As an adventurer, I tend to do it anyway, ignoring should, because it is there, and my scars are evidence that it does not always work out well.&nbsp;</p><p>The data, models, algorithms, ML and AI we have now created are capable of informing us if it is the right thing to do, but how do we know?</p><p>Writing things down, TV, Radio, Social media, books, screens, and printing created threats to established power structures that the old system of control adapted to embrace the new technology over time. However, I believe that the current oversight, governance, compliance and regulatory controls, which are based on the last 5000 years of adaption as physical beings, which are not bad in truth, CANNOT adapt to the next evolution from physical to information. Indeed our infrastructure gave rise to data, which is creating us as information beings.&nbsp; Our current models of helping us determine if we are doing the right thing fall apart as we evolve to become information beings because of a shift in power and control. Our current oversight was not designed for autonomous decision-making by a non-human, and whilst the old methods have adopted too many situations, this move to information beings appears, right now, to break the capabilities of current governance.&nbsp;</p><p>We feel the gap when we read the news but don’t as yet have the language or words to describe it. &nbsp; We deny and hide from this reality by focussing on back to normal growth and trying to create new models.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Governance follows change; it does not lead to a change. Governance and oversight help set up stability when we arrive at a new place. It is a flywheel for path dependency until someone breaks the axel. We are lucky to be alive now, seeing and witnessing this transition and can apply our minds to support this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>as physical beings over generations, we learn that&nbsp;</p>  <p>power and control matter</p>  <p>monopoly and scale in a vertical matter</p>  <p>accountable and responsible limited to the very narrow works, and we can ignore any wider consequences&nbsp;</p>  <p>relationships have limited context</p>  <p>values and principles change slowly, allowing for rules to create an impression of stability</p>  <p>governance and oversight work to determine if we are doing the right thing by slowing decision time, filtering noise and hierarchy to create signals</p>  <br><p>as informational beings, we have not quite worked out the new game, however;</p>  <p>information and data must have attestation and rights as they matter</p>  <p>real-time learning models with computational power really matters</p>  <p>dependent and inter-dependence ecosystems ensure consequences matter</p>  <p>commons and the quality of the human experience on earth matter</p>  <p>collective and individual accountability and responsibility enable oversight in real-time</p>  <br><p>I believe we feel lost and vulnerable as we are starting to see that our lack of diversity, biased education, retention of power and control mechanisms, along with oversight and governance, worked for some of us some of the time as physical beings.&nbsp; However, they are not suitable when we arrive at "information beings," wanting everything to work for most people most of the time. Utopia is still a dream.&nbsp; We are at the start of a journey, and right now, we lack language, words, stories, rhetoric, meaning, models, structures, frameworks and a north star.&nbsp;</p><p>We know that growth fuels increasing salaries which is a mechanism for control by creating more debt, as you can borrow more.&nbsp; Growth hides and maintains the lie about change for longer. It is the flywheel. Increasing lifestyles create more people who have to remain aligned,&nbsp; the balance of sufficient salary to have enough debt that you remain conformist and will do as needed.&nbsp; Data means we can now pick up signals from employees about who is a conformist because of debt/ trapped.&nbsp; They are the easiest to corrupt, will be the weak link in the security chain, allows someone to control or exert undue influence - keep the model and the belief.&nbsp; The wheels are coming off, and the axels are breaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What happens when AI (who is not paid) and is not aligned to the power plays makes decisions for the best outcome.&nbsp; How will you control the AI, like we use salary for humans?</p><p>Such interesting times</p> <br>

   <p></p><p>Source:&nbsp; worth observing that this <a href="https://dilbert.com/strip/1993-02-11">Dilbert was 1993 !!!!&nbsp;</a></p><p>Radar and sonar are incredible inventions as they allow us to perceive what cannot be actually seen with the naked eye.&nbsp; As technology has advance and big data analysis has emerged we have gone from a simple echo to high-quality resolution.&nbsp; However, the peak value for Radar is that it informs you something is there which requires low resolution and very little data.&nbsp; As Radar resolution has improved we can get direction and speed which requires a little more time. This new information definitely adds value to any required reactive decision. The identification of what the actual object is through increased resolution has an incremental value but not as much as knowing it is there and what direction at what speed but such information can lead to a better decision but suddenly there is an economics of cost compared to the incremental improvement in outcome.&nbsp; Knowing what type of bird by species or what plane by manufacturer, does add cost and size of data set but it does not add any value in terms of the decision requirement.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, current data scientists, enthusiasts and idealists are asking you to store vast quantities of data from your customer and eco-system in the hope that at some point the algorithms and AI technology will give you new rich and deep insights, such as the equivalent resolution of what rivet types are used in construction for the inbound missile for Radar. We have to question when even though technically possible,&nbsp; does the resolution stop adding value?</p><p>The more data you collect the better the decisions you will be able to make in the future is a lie that is driving boards to take on the cost for data and data risk that is beyond their scope of any calculatable return.&nbsp; “Collect all the data and store it as you don’t know what we might discover” is hope and choice, it is not a rational business decision. The hope is wrapped up in a power pitch that our competitive advantage will be the discovery and ability to perform magical acts of mind manipulation which will supercharge sales through the control of customers. Or is it fear that everyone else will have this and we will have no future, FOMO of the big data promise.&nbsp;</p><p>Investing in the future is a fantastic idea when collecting moon or martian dust and storing it until we improve our science tools and instruments but for a company right now this is a lie. &nbsp; We are collecting and storing data in the hope that an algorithm will be able to mine more value than the cost of collecting, storing and algorithm development.&nbsp; Right now there is little evidence from all the work done that using data to change behaviour works at scale.&nbsp; This is a real cost today for “hope,” which the CFO has not found an ethical way to put on a balance sheet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We have been sold a vision the more data we have the better decisions and insights we will have. Any data scientist or statistician will confirm that resolution of a decision or insight will not substantially improve beyond a certain data set size.&nbsp; You are not keeping and storing data for better decision making and insight today, just in the hope for new insights tomorrow. But the COO, CIO, CDO or CTO who is empire-building and determine that size equates to power within your culture are dependent on fear, uncertainty and doubt and insufficiently skilled directors to be able to challenge this. The tech looks like magic and every consulting company sees this as a revenue stream and write reports to support this view.</p><p>As a sceptic of the big data story, this article nicely aligns with your affinity and belief.&nbsp; You see that your next action is the stop the ever-increasing data spend and focus on traditional business.&nbsp; Whilst difficult to understand data is the right answer to business problems.&nbsp; The takeaway should be to question: Where is the diminishing return for data for your organisation?&nbsp; How do you know the data is good? How do you know the analysis is good. How do you know if what you are doing is the right thing to do? How do you incentive the right actions?</p><p>Data is not the problem, too much data will not create the return we hope for based on the cost we have, but we have to remain focussed that data is essential.

<p>My mother Betty passed away Friday night and her service is Saturday at 2pm at the Kingwood Funeral Home.  This is one of my favorite pictures of her with her mother and my brother David in downtown San Francisco.</p>

<p>Growing up, I always remember that there was a set of golf clubs in the garage but it seemed like they were never used.  Luckily, this week, I listened to a Christmas audio message from 1971 that my parents had sent to my grandparents.  My mom said that the day before, Baxter had taken her to the golf course at Heather Farm and they golfed nine holes.  She said on the first hole, she amused several bystanders trying to get out of the sand trap and they decided to quit keeping score from there.  She said she learned golf was not her sport and would find something else.  She did find tennis.  I was glad to play that sport with her and the family.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> continues to be a central nucleus for thoughtful discussion and development of all things related to digital identity. The most recent workshop, which was held in mid-April, was no exception. Despite the lack of in-person interaction due to the ongoing global pandemic, this IIW was as lively as ever, bringing together a diverse set of stakeholders from across the globe to share experiences, swap perspectives, and engage in healthy&nbsp;debates.</p><p>One common theme this year was the continued development and adoption of BBS+ signatures, a type of multi-message cryptographic digital signature that enables selective disclosure of verifiable credentials. We first <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ZKPs_for_JSON-LD">introduced</a> this technology at IIW30 in April 2020, and have been inspired and delighted by the community’s embrace and contribution to this effort across the board. In the year since, progress has been made in a variety of areas, from standards-level support to independent implementations and advanced feature&nbsp;support.</p><p>We thought we’d take a moment to round up some of the significant developments surrounding BBS+ signatures and highlight a few of the top items to pay attention to going&nbsp;forward.</p><p>Over the past few months, the linked data proofs <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">reference implementation</a> of BBS+ published a new release that introduces a variety of improvements in efficiency and security, including formal alignment to the W3C CCG <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/security-vocab/">Security Vocab</a> v3 definitions. In addition, support for JSON-LD BBS+ signatures was added to the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/">VC HTTP API</a>, making it possible to test this functionality in an interoperable way with other vendors participating in an open environment.</p><p>An important element in enabling BBS+ signatures is using what’s known as a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-09">pairing-friendly curve</a>; for our purposes we use <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-02#section-2.4">BLS12–381</a>. We have seen some promising signs of adoption for this key pair, with multiple Decentralized Identifier (DID) methods — both <a href="https://hackmd.io/@icZC4epNSnqBbYE0hJYseA/S1eUS2BQw">did:indy</a> from <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger</a> and <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion">did:ion</a> from <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a> — indicating they intend to add or already have support for these keys, allowing BBS+ signatures to be issued across a variety of decentralized networks and ecosystems. This development is possible due to the fact that BBS+ signatures is a ledger-independent approach to selective disclosure, effectively no custom logic or bespoke infrastructure is needed for these digital signatures to be created, used and understood.</p><p>In addition, the Hyperledger Aries project has been hard at work developing interoperable and ledger-agnostic capabilities in open source. The method used to track interop targets within the cohort and ultimately measure conformance against Aries standards is what’s known as an <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile">Aries Interop Profile (AIP)</a>. A major upcoming update to AIP will add support for additional DID methods, key types and credential formats, as well as introducing Aries support for JSON-LD BBS+ signatures as part of <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/579">AIP 2.0</a>. This will allow Aries-driven credential issuance and presentation protocols to work natively with BBS+ credentials, making that functionality broadly available for those in the Aries community and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>There have also been a number of exciting developments when it comes to independent implementations of BBS+ signatures. <a href="https://animo.id/">Animo Solutions</a> has recently implemented JSON-LD BBS+ signatures support into the popular open-source codebase <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python">Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python</a> (ACA-Py). In another independent effort, <a href="https://trinsic.id/">Trinsic</a> has contributed an <a href="https://github.com/trinsic-id/ld-proofs-dotnet">implementation</a> of JSON-LD BBS+ credentials which they have demonstrated to be working in tandem with <a href="https://github.com/trinsic-id/didcomm-v2">DIDComm v2</a>, a secure messaging protocol based on DIDs. Implementations such as these help to demonstrate that open standards are transparent, can be understood and verified independently, and can be implemented with separate languages and tech stacks. They also set the groundwork for demonstrating real testing-driven interoperability via mechanisms such as the VC HTTP API and AIP 2.0. We are continuously looking to improve the documentation of these specs and standards so that their implications and nuances can be more broadly understood by builders and developers looking to engage with the technology.</p><p>On the cryptographic side of things, progress is also being made in hardening the existing BBS+ specification as well as expanding BBS+ to support more advanced privacy-preserving features. A significant development in this area is the work of cryptographer Michael Lodder who has been actively conducting research on an enhanced credential revocation mechanism using <a href="https://github.com/mikelodder7/accumulator-rs">cryptographic accumulators</a> with BBS+. This approach presents a promising alternative to existing solutions that allow authoritative issuers to update the status of issued credentials without compromising the privacy of the credential holder or subject who may be presenting the credential. We see this as another application of BBS+ signatures in the context of verifiable credentials that carries a lot of potential in pushing this technology to an even more robust&nbsp;state.</p><p>There was also initial discussion and tacit agreement to create a new cryptography-focused working group at Decentralized Identity Foundation. As the new WG drafts its charter, the first work item of this group will be the <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/bbs-signatures-spec/">BBS+ Signatures</a> spec which defines the cryptographic scheme known as BBS+ agnostic of its application in areas such as linked data signatures or verifiable credentials. In the future, this WG will likely evolve to include other crypto-related work items from the community.</p><p>This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the momentum and development building around this technology in the community. We couldn’t be more excited about the future of BBS+ signatures, especially as we gear up to tackle the next set of hard problems in this area including privacy-preserving subject authentication and revocation using cryptographic accumulators. If you’re interested we encourage you to get involved, either by contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/ldp-bbs2020">Linked Data Proofs specification</a>, checking out our <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/bbs-signatures">reference</a> <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">implementations</a>, or participating in the new WG at DIF, to name but a few of the many ways to engage with this work. We look forward to doing this retrospective at many IIWs to come, documenting the ever-growing community that continues to champion this technology in dynamic and interesting ways.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/iiw32-bbs-and-beyond-1a41634c15b0">IIW32: BBS+ and beyond</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>There’s a <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures-04.html">new draft in the HTTP working group</a> that deals with signing HTTP messages of all types. Why is it here, and what does that give&nbsp;us?</p><p>HTTP is irrefutably a fundamental building block of most of today’s software systems. Yet security and identity need to be layered alongside HTTP. The most common of these is simply running the HTTP protocol over an encrypted socket using TLS, resulting in HTTPS. While this is a powerful and important security component, TLS works only my protecting the stream of bits in transit. It does not allow for message-level and application-level security operations. But what if we could sign the messages themselves?</p><p>While it is possible to wrap the body of a request in a cryptographic envelope like <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/jose/charter/">JOSE</a> or <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core2/">XML DSig</a>, such approaches force developers to ignore most of the power and flexibility of HTTP, reducing it to a dumb transport layer. In order to sign a message but keep using HTTP as it stands, with all the verbs and headers and content types that it gives us, we will need a scheme that allows us to add a detached signature to the HTTP message. The cryptographic elements to the message can then be generated and validated separately from the request itself, providing a layered approach.</p><p>There have been numerous attempts at creating detached signature methods for HTTP over the years, one of the most famous being the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures">Cavage draft</a> which itself started as a community-facing version of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Amazon’s SIGv4</a> method used within AWS. There were several other efforts, and all of them incompatible with each other in one way or another. To address this, the HTTP Working Group in the IETF stepped up and took on the effort of creating an RFC-track standard for HTTP message signatures that could be used across the variety of use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>As of the writing of this post, <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures-04.html">the specification is at version 04</a>. While it’s not finished yet, it’s recently become a bit more stable and so it’s worth looking at it in greater&nbsp;depth.</p> Normalizing HTTP <p>As it turns out, the hardest part of signing HTTP messages isn’t the signing, it’s the HTTP. HTTP is a messy set of specifications, with pieces that have been built up by many authors over many years in ways that aren’t always that consistent. A recent move towards consistency has been the adoption of <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8941.html">Structured Field Values</a> for HTTP. In short, structured fields allow HTTP headers to house simple, non-recursive data structures with unambiguous parsing and deterministic serialization. These aspects made it perfect for use within the HTTP message signatures specification.</p><p>Previous efforts at HTTP message signing concentrated on creating a signature around HTTP headers, and the current draft is no exception in allowing that. On top of that, the current draft also allows for the definition of specialty fields that contain other pieces of constructed information not found in the headers themselves. These covered components are identified and combined with each other into a signature input string. To this string is added a field that includes all of the input parameters to this signature. For example, let’s say we want to sign parts of this HTTP&nbsp;request:</p> POST /foo?param=value&amp;pet=dog HTTP/1.1<br>Host: example.com<br>Date: Tue, 20 Apr 2021 02:07:55 GMT<br>Content-Type: application/json<br>Digest: SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=<br>Content-Length: 18<br><br>{"hello": "world"} <p>We choose the components we want to sign, including the target of the request and a subset of the available headers, and create the following signature input&nbsp;string:</p> @request-target": post /foo?param=value&amp;pet=dog<br>"host": example.com<br>"date": Tue, 20 Apr 2021 02:07:55 GMT<br>"content-type": application/json<br>"digest": SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=<br>"content-length": 18<br>"@signature-params": ("@request-target" "host" "date" "content-type"  "digest" "content-length");created=1618884475;keyid="test-key-rsa-pss" <p>With a given HTTP message and a set of input parameters determining which parts of the message are covered with a signature, any party can re-generate this string with a reasonable level of success. Unsigned headers can be added to the message by intermediaries without invalidating the signature, and it’s even possible for an intermediary to add its own signature to the message on the way through — but we’ll get more into that advanced use case in a future post. The result of this is that the signer and verifier will re-create this signature input string independently of each&nbsp;other.</p><p>Now that we have a normalized string to sign, how do we actually sign&nbsp;it?</p> Signing and Verifying Content <p>Once we have the string, it’s a relatively straightforward matter of applying a key and signature function to the string. Any signature method that takes in and bunch of bytes and spits out a different set of bytes is technically feasible&nbsp;here.</p><p>How do the signer and verifier know which algorithm to use on a given method? It turns out that different deployments have drastically different needs in this regard. As a consequence, this is an aspect that is application specific by the specification, with several common methods called&nbsp;out:</p>  The signer and verifier can both be configured to expect only a specific algorithm, or have that algorithm identified by some aspect external to the protocol.  The signer and verifier can identify the key used to do the signing and figure out the signature algorithm based on that. If an application’s using JSON Web Keys, the alg field of the key provides an easy way to identify a signing mechanism.  If the signer and verifier need to signal the algorithm dynamically at runtime, there is an alg field in the signature parameter set itself that points to a new registry.  And if two or more of these methods are applicable to a given message, the answers all have to match, otherwise something fishy is going on and the signature is invalidated.  <p>Given the above signature input string and an RSA-PSS signing method, we end up with the following Base64-encoded bytes as the signature output:</p> NtIKWuXjr4SBEXj97gbick4O95ff378I0CZOa2VnIeEXZ1itzAdqTpSvG91XYrq5CfxCmk8zz1Zg7ZGYD+ngJyVn805r73rh2eFCPO+ZXDs45Is/Ex8srzGC9sfVZfqeEfApRFFe5yXDmANVUwzFWCEnGM6+SJVmWl1/jyEn45qA6Hw+ZDHbrbp6qvD4N0S92jlPyVVEh/SmCwnkeNiBgnbt+E0K5wCFNHPbo4X1Tj406W+bTtnKzaoKxBWKW8aIQ7rg92zqE1oqBRjqtRi5/Q6P5ZYYGGINKzNyV3UjZtxeZNnNJ+MAnWS0mofFqcZHVgSU/1wUzP7MhzOKLca1Yg== <p>This gives us a signed object, and now we need to put that into our HTTP&nbsp;message.</p> Sending Signatures in&nbsp;Messages <p>The HTTP message signature specification defines two new headers to carry the signature, Signature and Signature-Input. Both of these use the Dictionary construct from the HTTP Structured Field Values standard to carry a named signature.</p><p>But first, why two headers? This construct allows us to easily separate the metadata about the signature — how it was made — from the signature value itself. This separation makes parsing simpler and also allows the HTTP message signatures specification to support multiple independent signatures on a given&nbsp;message.</p><p>The Signature-Input header contains all the parameters that went into the creation of the signature, including the list of covered content, identifiers for the key and algorithm, and items like timestamps or other application-specific flags. In fact, this is the same value used as the last line of the signature input string, and so its values are always covered by the signature. The Signature header contains the value of the signature itself as a byte array, encoded in Base64. The signer chooses a name for the signature object and adds both items to the headers. The name has no semantic impact, it just needs to be unique within a given&nbsp;request.</p><p>Let’s say this signature is named sig1. The signer adds both headers to the request above, resulting in the following signed&nbsp;request.</p> POST /foo?param=value&amp;pet=dog HTTP/1.1<br>Host: example.com<br>Date: Tue, 20 Apr 2021 02:07:55 GMT<br>Content-Type: application/json<br>Digest: SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=<br>Content-Length: 18<br>Signature-Input: sig1=("host" "date" "content-type");created=1618884475;keyid="test-key-rsa-pss"<br>Signature: sig1=:NtIKWuXjr4SBEXj97gbick4O95ff378I0CZOa2VnIeEXZ1itzAdqTpSvG91XYrq5CfxCmk8zz1Zg7ZGYD+ngJyVn805r73rh2eFCPO+ZXDs45Is/Ex8srzGC9sfVZfqeEfApRFFe5yXDmANVUwzFWCEnGM6+SJVmWl1/jyEn45qA6Hw+ZDHbrbp6qvD4N0S92jlPyVVEh/SmCwnkeNiBgnbt+E0K5wCFNHPbo4X1Tj406W+bTtnKzaoKxBWKW8aIQ7rg92zqE1oqBRjqtRi5/Q6P5ZYYGGINKzNyV3UjZtxeZNnNJ+MAnWS0mofFqcZHVgSU/1wUzP7MhzOKLca1Yg==:  {"hello": "world"} <p>Note that none of the other headers or aspects of the message are modified by the signature process.</p><p>The verifier parses both headers, re-creates the signature input string from the request, and verifies the signature value using the identified key and algorithm. But how does the verifier know that this signature is sufficient for this request, and how does the signer know what to sign in the first&nbsp;place?</p> Applying the Message Signature Specification <p>As discussed above, the signer and verifier need to have a way of figuring out which algorithm and keys are appropriate for a given signed message. In many deployments, this information can be gleaned through context and configuration. For example, a key derivation algorithm based on the tenant identifier in the URL can be used to dereference the key needed for a given call. Or an application identifier passed in the body could point to a record giving both the expected algorithm and allowable key material.</p><p>In addition to defining a predictable way to determine this, an application of the HTTP message signatures specification also needs to define which parts of the message need to be signed. For example, and API might have very different behaviors based on a Content-Type header but not really care about the Content-Encoding. A security protocol like OAuth or GNAP would require signing the Authorization header that contains the access token as well as the @request-target specialty field.</p><p>The HTTP protocol is also designed to allow interception and proxy of requests and responses, with intermediaries fully allowed to alter the message in certain ways. Applications that need to account for such intermediaries can be picky about which headers and components are signed, allowing the signature to survive expected message modifications but protecting against unanticipated changes in&nbsp;transit.</p><p>This fundamentally means that no signature method will ever be perfect for all messages — but that’s ok. The HTTP message signature draft instead leans on flexibility, allowing applications to define how best to apply the signature methods to achieve the security&nbsp;needed.</p> Building the&nbsp;Standard <p>The HTTP message signatures specification is still a long way from being done. It’s taken in a number of different inputs and many years of collective community experience, and that initially resulted in some major churn in the specification’s syntax and structure. <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures-04.html">As of version 04</a> though, the major surgery seems to be behind us. While there will inevitably be some changes to the parameters, names, and possibly even structures, the core of this is pretty solid. It’s time to start implementing it and testing it out with applications of all stripes, and I invite all of you to join me in doing just&nbsp;that.</p>
