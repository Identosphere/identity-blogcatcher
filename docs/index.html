 The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas, by Ursula K. LeGuin:   They all know it is there, all the people of Omelas. Some of them have come to see it, others are content merely to know it is there. They all know that it has to be there.

LeGuin</a>:</p><blockquote><p>They all know it is there, all the people of Omelas. Some of them have come to see it, others are content merely to know it is there. They all know that it has to be there. Some of them understand why, and some do not, but they all understand that their happiness, the beauty of their city, the tenderness of their friendships, the health of their children, the wisdom of their scholars, the skill of their makers, even the abundance of their harvest and the kindly weathers of their skies, depend wholly on this child’s abominable misery.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-ones-who-stay-and-fight/">The Ones Who Stay and Fight, by N.K. Jemisin</a>:</p><blockquote><p>But this is no awkward dystopia, where all are forced to conform. Adults who refuse to give up their childhood joys wear wings, too, though theirs tend to be more abstractly constructed. (Some are invisible.) And those who follow faiths which forbid the emulation of beasts, or those who simply do not want wings, need not wear them. They are all honored for this choice, as much as the soarers and flutterers themselves—for without contrasts, how does one appreciate the different forms that joy can take?</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/kim_02_24/">Why Don’t We Just Kill the Kid in the Omelas Hole, by Isabel J. Kim</a>:</p><blockquote><p>So they broke into the hole in the ground, and they killed the kid, and all the lights went out in Omelas: click, click, click. And the pipes burst and there was a sewage leak and the newscasters said there was a typhoon on the way, so they (a different “they,” these were the “they” in charge, the “they” who lived in the nice houses in Omelas [okay, every house in Omelas was a nice house, but these were Nice Houses]) got another kid and put it in the hole.</p></blockquote>

<p>During Meta's earnings call, Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook and Instagram data is used to train the company's AI models.</p>

<p>“On Facebook and Instagram, there are hundreds of billions of publicly shared images and tens of billions of public videos, which we estimate is greater than the Common Crawl dataset and people share large numbers of public text posts in comments across our services as well.”</p>

<p>He's playing to win: one unstated competitive advantage is that Meta actually has the legal right to use training data generated on its own services. It's probably not something most users are aware of, but by posting content there, they grant the company rights to use it. If OpenAI falls afoul of copyright law, Meta's tech has a path forward.</p>

<p>It's a jarring thought, though. I'm certainly not keen on a generative model being trained on my son's face, for example. I'm curious how many users will feel the same way.  <a href="https://werd.io/tag/AI">#AI</a></p>

<p></p><p>This post is part of February’s&nbsp;<a href="https://indieweb.org/indieweb-carnival">IndieWeb Carnival</a>, in which <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/indieweb-carnival-digital-relationships">Manuel Moreale prompts us to think about the various facets of digital relationships</a>.</p><p>Our relationship to digital technology has been through a few different phases.</p><p>One: the census</p><p>In the first, computers were the realm of government and big business: vast databases that might be about us, but that we could never own or interrogate ourselves. Companies like IBM manufactured room-sized (and then cabinet-sized) machines that took a team of specialized technicians to operate. They were rare and a symbol of top-down power.</p><p>Punch cards were invented in the 1880s, and were machine-sortable even then, although not by anything we would recognize as a computer today. In the 1930s, a company called Dehomag, which was a 90%-owned subsidiary of IBM, used its punch card census technology to help the <a href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ibm-and-quot-death-s-calculator-quot-2">German Nazi party ethnically identify and sort the population</a>. (Thomas Watson, IBM’s CEO at the time, even came to Germany to oversee the operation.)</p><p>The first general-purpose digital computer, ENIAC, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC">was first put to use to determine the feasibility of the H bomb</a>. Other mainframe computers were used by the US Navy for codebreaking, and by the US census bureau. By the sixties and seventies, though, they were commonplace in larger corporate offices and in universities for non-military, non-governmental applications.</p><p>Two: the desk</p><p>Personal computers decentralized computing power and put it in everybody’s hands. There was no overarching, always-on communications network for them to connect to, so every computer had its own copy of software that ran locally on it. There was no phoning home; no surveillance of our data; there were no ad-supported models. If you were lucky enough to have the not-insignificant sum of money needed to buy a computer, you could have one in your home. If you were lucky enough to have money left over for software, you could even do things with it.</p><p>The government and large institutions didn’t have a monopoly on computing power; theoretically, anyone could have it. Anyone could write a program, too, and (if you had yet more money to buy a modem) distribute it on bulletin board systems and online services. Your hardware was yours; your software was yours; once you’d paid your money, your relationship with the vendor was over.</p><p>For a while, you had a few options to connect with other people:</p>  Prodigy, an online service operated as a joint venture between CBS, IBM, and Sears 
 CompuServe, which was owned and run by H&amp;R Block 
 America Online, which was originally a way for Atari 2600 owners to download new games and store high scores 
 Independent bulletin boards, which were usually a single computer connected to a handful of direct phone lines for modems to connect to, run by an enthusiast 
 <p>(My first after-school job was as a BBS system operator for <a href="https://dailyinfo.co.uk">Daily Information</a>, a local information and classifieds sheet in my hometown.)</p><p>In 1992, in addition to bulletin board systems and online services, the internet was made commercially available. Whereas BBSes, AOL, etc were distinct walled gardens, any service that was connected to the internet could reach any other service. It changed everything. (In 1995, my BBS job expanded to running what became one of the first classifieds websites.)</p><p>But for a while, the decentralized, private nature of personal computing remained. For most private individuals, connecting to the internet was like visiting a PO box: you’d dial in, would upload and download any email you had pending, browse any websites you needed to, and then log off again. There was no way to constantly monitor people because internet users spent 23 hours of the day disconnected from the network.</p><p>Three: the cloud</p><p>Broadband, the iPhone, and wifi changed everything. Before the advent of broadband, most people needed to dial in to go online using their phone line. Before the iPhone, cell connections weren’t metered for data, and there was very little bandwidth to go around. Before wifi, a computer needed to physically be connected with a cable to go online.</p><p>With broadband and wifi, computers could be connected to the internet 24/7. With the iPhone, everyone had a computer in their pocket, that was permanently connected and could be constantly sending data back to online services — including your location and who was in your address book.</p><p>It was incredibly convenient and changed the world in hundreds of ways. The web in particular is a modern marvel; the iPhone is a feat of design and engineering. But what we lost was the decentralized self-ownership of our digital worlds. More than that, we lost an ability to be private that we’d had since the beginning of human civilization. It used to be that nobody needed to know where you were or what you were thinking about; that fundamental truth has gone the way of the dinosaur.</p><p>Almost immediately, our relationship to software changed in a few key ways:</p>  We could access all of our data from anywhere, on any device. 
 Instead of buying a software package once, we were asked to subscribe to it. 
 Instead of downloading or installing software, the main bulk of it could be run in a server farm somewhere. 
 Every facet of our data was stored in one of these server farms. 
 More data was produced about us as we used our devices — or even as we walked through our cities, shopped at stores, and met with other people — than we created intentionally ourselves. 
 <p>While computing became infinitely easier to use and the internet became a force that changed global society in ways that I still believe are a net positive, surveilling us also became infinitely easier. Companies wanted to know exactly what we were likely to buy; politicians wanted to know how we might vote; law enforcement wanted to know if we were dangerous. All paid online services to build profiles about us that could be used to sell advertising, could be mined by the right buyer, and could even be used to influence elections.</p><p>Four: the farm</p><p>Our relationship is now changing again.</p><p>Whereas in the cloud era we were surveilled in order to profile us, our data is now being gathered for another set of reasons. We’re used to online services ingesting our words and actions in order to predict our behaviors and influence us in certain directions. We’re used to Target, for example, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/">wanting to know if we’re pregnant so they can be the first to sell us baby gear</a>. We’re not used to those services ingesting our words and actions in order to learn how to be us.</p><p>In our new relationship, software isn’t just set up to surveil us to report on us; it’s also set up to be able to do our work. GitHub Copilot learns from software we write so that it can write software automatically. Midjourney builds stunning illustrations and near-photorealistic images. Facebook is learning from the text and photos we upload so it can create its own text and realistic imagery (unlike many models, from data it actually has the license to). Far more than us being profiled, our modes of human expression are now being farmed for the benefit of people who hope to no longer have to hire us for our unique skills.</p><p>In the first era, technology was here to catalogue us.</p><p>In the second, it was here to empower us.</p><p>In the third, it was here to observe us.</p><p>In the fourth, it is here to replace us.</p><p>We had a very brief window, somewhere between the inception of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club">the homebrew computer club</a> and the introduction of the iPhone, where digital technology heralded distributed empowerment. Even then, empowerment was hardly evenly distributed, and any return to decentralization must be far more equitable than it ever was. But we find ourselves in a world where our true relationship is with power.</p><p>Of course, it’s a matter of degrees, and everything is a spectrum: there are plenty of services that don’tuse your data to train generative AI models, and there are plenty that don’t surveil you at all. There are also lots of applications and organizations that are actively designed to protect us from being watched and subjugated. New regulations are being proposed all the time that would guarantee our right to privacy and our right to not be included in training data.</p><p>Those might seem like technical decisions, but they’re really about preserving our ownership and autonomy, and returning those things to us when they’ve already been lost. They’re human, democratic decisions that seek to enforce a relationship where we’re in charge. They’re becoming more and more important every day.</p>

’Cube’ By 'Leonardo'


 This is published - but let me emphasize, most definitely a WIP. Hoping to get feedback from a few select people, not to say that I too am noodling more. I will return. 
<p>🚧</p>

<p>Out in the wild - and really - these days what else would you call ‘LinkedIN’, I <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7158374495550861312">🔗 read a post</a> by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rookzero/">🔗 Tim Parsons</a> that had garnered a few comments. It was touching on a pet peeve of mine, despite TL;DR being a technique I use from time to time.</p>
<p>This was the essence;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes it just can’t be any shorter and still be useful. Some lynchpin bit of data or context would have to be sacrificed, a risk go unnamed, a requirement remain unidentified.<br>
Sometimes information exchange has to include all the information AND the meta data it needs to build a bridge from you to me.  <br>
Sometimes “Too Long; Didn’t Read” is a terrible risk/reward proposition, and you have to go all the way to “Very Long; Must Read.”  <br>
When everything extra has been distilled out, but there’s still a lot there, that’s a sign of something complex enough to be fascinating, or at least full of critical, decision-influencing intel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He ended his post with a reference back to the source.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I remember <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAARXyT8Br1cGAVYk87j7y7HVK9nR_MhJXfg">🔗 Marjorie Anderson</a> activating that thought in my head weeks ago, and now it won’t leave.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This resonated ….</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes TL;DR simply must yield to VL;MR</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which got me to thinking.</p>
<p>You know how I am with that word … ‘content’.</p>
<p>To remind from one of many posts on the topic - just on this blog ….</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As  long as ‘we the creators’ keep using low cost, homogenous, non-descript words like ‘content’ to describe our work, our soul, our passion, our beliefs then our work will continue to be viewed as ‘free - to - cheap - to - low - cost’, ‘homogenized, non differentiated, interchangeable fodder’ (which coincidentally is what silos have always been used for), then, we only have ourselves to blame as the resultant payment for our art, our thinking and our ideas, will continue to race to the bottom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And whilst on the topic of silos ….</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You should never … ever … trust a Silo. It’s theirs. The stuff you put there is theirs. Even our' handle is actually ‘theirs’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All this and more can be found in an earlier post here : <a href="https://john.philpin.com/2019/07/27/friends-dont-let.html">🖇️ Friends Don’t Let Friends Write Content</a></p>
<p>And it is not just me …</p>
<p>Just today</p>
<p></p>
<p>and last year .. <a href="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2529/2023/3a177920ca.mov">Dana Carvey and Will Arnett brought it up</a> (listen it’s a one minute snipped) on the <a href="https://john.philpin.com/2023/02/09/you-might-have.html">Smartless podcast</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, with that all said …  ‘set up’ done … ✅</p>
 So What? 
<p>It struck me that ‘TL;DR | VL;MR’ is the second axis I have been looking for in my one man war on ‘content’. So I drew the picture.</p>
<p>‘content | material ' on the x axis and ‘TL;DR | VL;MR’ on the y axis - and I was left with ‘Yeah .. so what?</p>
<p>The ‘so what’ was because I realized that it was missing the third axis …‘Entertainment | Understanding’</p>
<p>The fact is that so much that is running around the ‘interwebs’  is ‘Entertainment’. Nothing wrong with that, but VL;MR is really about Understanding.</p>
<p>Moreover, the front facing 4 quadrants are all about ‘Entertainment | Understanding’ and TL;DR | VL;MR - not ‘Content | Material’</p>
<p>So I drew it again.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The coloration isn’t  quite right for all occasions, but in this particular context</p>
 
 on the entertainment side - it doesn’t really matter which end of the TL;DR | VL;MR spectrum you are - a 240 character tweet can be as entertaining as a 3 hour movie or a 1,000 page book, BUT on the understanding side .. sure sometimes a pithy one liner can shed light on an issue that a three volume encyclopedia will never do. It’s also true that a very short mathematical equation is very powerful when it comes to ‘explaining’ - IF you understand the language of math(s) (I like to accommodate both sides of the Atlantic if I can), which most people do not. 
 
<p>But generally that is not the case, because what triggered me is that context and history and space and time and .. is needed to really bottom out ‘Understanding’</p>
<p>So far so good?</p>
<p>I added the third dimension.</p>

<p></p>

<p>And we are there … nearly.</p>
<p>The dimensions are right - but the colors remain at odds with my thinking. I have the image in my head plus the colors need to be fading from one color to the next - depending on the context. I am not a graphic artist … and I could draw what I am thinking … eventually … and maybe I will return to complete / correct this.</p>
<p>But before I do that. Make sense? See where I am coming from?</p>
<p></p>

<p>Winnie and I both worked at Medium at different times, and yet both have a very strong own-your-own-domain philosophy. Her blogging story is really similar to mine, even if the content of her blog is very much her own.</p>

<p>Just a complete pleasure to read.  <a href="https://werd.io/tag/Culture">#Culture</a></p>

<p>As I started digging into the <a href="https://gist.github.com/theory/898c8802937ad8361ccbcc313054c29d" title="Extension Ecosystem: Jobs and Tools">jobs and tools</a> for the Postgres extension
ecosystem as part of my <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/01/tembonaut/" title="I'm a Postgres Extensions Tembonaut">new gig</a>, I realized that most people have little
knowledge of the <a href="https://pgxn.org" title="PGXN — PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a> architecture. I learned a lot designing PGXN and its
services, and am quite pleased with where it ended up, warts and all. So I
thought it worthwhile to put together a brief presentation on the fundamental
design principals (static REST file API), inter-related services (<a href="https://master.pgxn.org/" title="PGXN Root Mirror">root mirror</a>,
<a href="https://manager.pgxn.org/howto" title="PGXN How To">manager</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/pgxn-api/wiki" title="PGXN API">API</a>, <a href="https://pgxn.org" title="PGXN — PostgreSQL Extension Network">site</a>) and tools (<a href="https://pgxn.github.io/pgxnclient/" title="PGXN Client documentation">CLI</a>, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/pgxn/pgxn-tools" title="pgxn/pgxn-tools Docker image">CI/CD</a>).</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Tembo blog <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/pgxn-architecture" title="Presentation: Introduction to the PGXN Architecture">published the presentation</a>, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjZPA3HA_q8" title="YouTube Tembo Channel: “David Wheeler - The Architecture of PGXN”">the video</a>
and slides, along with a high-level architecture diagram. I hope it’s a useful
point of reference for the Postgres community as we look to better distribute
extensions in the future.</p>

<p>CEO Matt Mullenweg is taking advantage of this for the first time, and here shares an Ignite talk in which he talks about the way the benefit encourages the company to plan for 5% of the company to be unavailable at any one time, helping avoid any single employee becoming a bottleneck.</p>

   ChunkViz 
 Handy tool by Greg Kamradt to help understand how different text chunking mechanisms work by visualizing them. Chunking is an important part of preparing text to be embedded for semantic search, and thanks to this tool I've finally got a solid mental model of what recursive character text splitting does.

 Thoughts 
<p>Numbers 1, 2 and 3 are respectively  the 2nd, 3rd and 4th posts in the series, so not surprised.</p>
<p>I am surprised at the 26th post coming as high as 4th, after all, It only had 5 days to get there.</p>
<p>By the time you get down to Number 5 - well, it’s a topic that resonates, and had a full half month to ‘move on up’, so once again, no real surprise.</p>
<p>I will run the numbers again next month, for February - and again for January - and will also provide a ‘year to date’. Be interesting to see the comparisons. (BTW, I am specifically running the data between specific dates - in this case for example Jan 1 to Jan 31 - not just ‘last month’.)</p>
<p>I am also interested to see if this posts gives a jump on these particular posts, so I will check the data in 7 days.</p>
<p>That’s all for now - except to say, my many thanks to <a href="https://vincentritter.com">🔗 Vincent</a> who wrote and maintains the <a href="https://tinylytics.app">🔗 tinylytics app</a> that in turn produces the data I need to write this email. Couldn’t do without it.</p>

 TL;DR 
<p>As I think through the future of the Postgres extension ecosystem as a key part
of the <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/01/tembonaut/" title="I'm a Postgres Extensions Tembonaut">new job</a>, I wanted to understand how <a href="https://go.dev/doc/modules/developing#decentralized" title="go.dev: Developing and publishing modules">Go decentralized publishing</a>
works. In this post I work it out, and think through how we might do something
similar for Postgres extension publishing. It covers the
<a>Go architecture</a>, <a>namespacing challenges</a>,
and <a>PGXS abuse</a>; then experiments with
<a>URL-based namespacing</a> and ponders
<a>reorganizing installed extension files</a>;
and closes with a <a>high-level design</a> for
making it work now and in the future.</p>
<p>It is, admittedly, a lot, mainly written for my own edification and for the
information of my fellow extension-releasing travelers.</p>
<p>I find it fascinating and learned a ton. Maybe you will too! But feel free to
skip this post if you’re less interested in the details of the journey and want
to wait for more decisive posts once I’ve reached the destination.</p>
 Introduction 
<p>Most language registries require developers to take some step to make releases.
Many automate the process in CI/CD pipelines, but it requires some amount of
effort on the developer’s part:</p>
 
 Register for an account 
 Learn how to format things to publish a release 
 Remember to publish again for every new version 
 Create a pipeline to automate publishing (e.g., a GitHub workflow) 
 
 Decentralized Publishing 
<p><a href="https://go.dev/doc/modules/developing#decentralized" title="go.dev: Developing and publishing modules">Go decentralized publishing</a> has revised this pattern: it does not require user
registration or authentication to to publish a module to <a href="https://pkg.go.dev">pkg.go.dev</a>. Rather,
Go developers simply tag the source repository, and the first time someone
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/about#adding-a-package" title="pkg.go.dev: Adding a package">refers to the tag in Go tools</a>, the <a href="https://index.golang.org">Go module index</a> will include it.</p>
<p>For example, publishing <code>v1.2.1</code> of a module in the <code>github.com/golang/example</code>
repository takes just three commands:</p>
  <code>git tag v1.2.1 -sm 'Tag v1.2.1'
git push --tags
go list -m github.com/golang/example@v1.2.1
</code>  <p>After a few minutes, the module will show up in <a href="https://index.golang.org/index" title="Go module index feed">the index</a> and then on
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev">pkg.go.dev</a>. Anyone can run <code>go get -u github.com/golang/example</code> to get the
latest version. Go developers rest easy in the knowledge that they’re getting
the exact module they need thanks to the <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#checksum-database" title="Go Modules Reference: Checksum database">global checksum database</a>, which Go
uses “in many situations to detect misbehavior by proxies or origin servers”.</p>
<p>This design requires <code>go get</code> to understand multiple source code management
systems: it supports Git, Subversion, Mercurial, Bazaar, and Fossil.<a>1</a>
It also needs the <code>go.mod</code> metadata file to live in the project defining the
package.</p>
<p>But that’s really it. From the developer’s perspective it could not be easier to
publish a module, because it’s a natural extension of the module development
tooling and workflow of committing, tagging, and fetching code.</p>
 Decentralized Extension Publishing 
<p>Could we publish Postgres extensions in such a decentralized pattern? It might
look something like this:</p>
 
 The developer places a metadata file in the proper location (<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-extensions.html#EXTEND-EXTENSIONS-FILES" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Extension Files">control file</a>,
<code>META.json</code>, <code>Cargo.toml</code>, whatever — standard TBD) 
 To publish a release, the developer tags the repository and calls some sort
of indexing service hook (perhaps from a tag-triggered release workflow) 
 The indexing service validates the extension and adds it to the index 
 
<p>Note that there is no registration required. It simply trusts the source code
repository. It also avoids name collision: <code>github.com/bob/hash</code>
is distinct from <code>github.com/carol/hash</code>.</p>
<p>This design does raise challenges for clients, whether they’re compiling
extensions on a production system or building binary packages for distribution:
they have to support various version control systems to pull the code (though
starting with Git is a decent 90% solution).</p>
 Namespacing 
<p>Then there’s name conflicts. Perhaps <code>github.com/bob/hash</code> and
<code>github.com/carol/hash</code> both create an extension named <code>hash</code>. By the current
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-extensions.html#EXTEND-EXTENSIONS-FILES" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Extension Files">control file</a> format, the script directory and module path can use any name,
but in all likelihood the use these defaults:</p>
  <code>directory = 'extension'
module_pathname = '$libdir/hash'
</code>  <p>Meaning <code>.sql</code> files will be installed in the Postgres <code>share/extension</code>
subdirectory — along with all the other installed extensions — and library
files will be installed in the library directory along with all other libraries.
Something like this:</p>
 <code>pgsql
├── lib
│   └── hash.so
└── share
    └── extension
    │   └── hash.control
    │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── hash--1.0.0.sql
    └── doc
        └── hash.md
</code> <p>If both projects include, say, <code>hash.control</code>, <code>hash--1.0.0.sql</code>, and <code>hash.so</code>,
the files from one will stomp all over the files of the other.</p>
 Installer Abuse 
<p>Go avoids this issue by using the domain and path from each package’s repository
in its directory structure. For example, here’s a list of modules from
<code>google.golang.org</code> repositories:</p>
  <code>$ ls -1 ~/go/pkg/mod/google.golang.org
api@v0.134.0
api@v0.152.0
appengine@v1.6.7
genproto
genproto@v0.0.0-20230731193218-e0aa005b6bdf
grpc@v1.57.0
grpc@v1.59.0
protobuf@v1.30.0
protobuf@v1.31.0
protobuf@v1.32.0
</code>  <p>The <code>~/go/pkg/mod</code> directory has subdirectories for each VCS host name, and each
then subdirectories for package paths. For the <code>github.com/bob/hash</code> example,
the files would all live in <code>~/go/pkg/mod/github.com/bob/hash</code>.</p>
<p>Could a Postgres extension build tool follow a similar distributed pattern by
renaming the control file and installation files and directories to something
specific for each, say <code>github.com+bob+hash</code> and <code>github.com+carol+hash</code>? That
is, using the repository host name and path, but replacing the slashes in the
path with some other character that wouldn’t create subdirectories — because
PostgreSQL won’t find control files in subdirectories. The control file entries
for <code>github.com/carol/hash</code> would look like this:</p>
  <code>directory = 'github.com+carol+hash'
module_pathname = '$libdir/github.com+carol+hash'
</code>  <p>Since PostgreSQL expects the control file to have the same name as the
extension, and for SQL scripts to start with that name, the files would have to
be named like so:</p>
 <code>hash
├── Makefile
├── github.com+carol+hash.control
└── sql
    └── github.com+carol+hash--1.0.0.sql
</code> <p>And the <code>Makefile</code> contents:</p>
  <code>EXTENSION  = github.com+carol+hash
MODULEDIR  = $(EXTENSION)
DATA       = sql/$(EXTENSION)--1.0.0.sql
PG_CONFIG ?= pg_config

PGXS := $(shell $(PG_CONFIG) --pgxs)
include $(PGXS)
</code>  <p>In other words, the extension name is the full repository host name and path and
the Makefile <code>MODULEDIR</code> variable tells <code>pg_config</code> to put all the SQL and
documentation files into a directories named <code>github.com+carol+hash</code> —
preventing them from conflicting with any other extension.</p>
<p>Finally, the <code>github.com+carol+hash.control</code> file — so named becaus it must
have the same name as the extension — contains:</p>
  <code>default_version = '1.0.0'
relocatable = true
directory = 'github.com+carol+hash'
module_pathname = '$libdir/github.com+carol+hash'
</code>  <p>Note the <code>directory</code> parameter, which must match <code>MODULEDIR</code> from the
<code>Makefile</code>, so that <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> can find the SQL files. Meanwhile,
<code>module_pathname</code> ensures that the library file has a unique name — the same
as the long extension name — again to avoid conflicts with other projects.</p>
<p>That unsightly naming extends to SQL: using the URL format could get to be a
mouthful:</p>
  <code>CREATE EXTENSION "github.com+carol+hash";
</code>  <p>Which is do-able, but some new SQL syntax might be useful, perhaps something
like:</p>
  <code>CREATE EXTENSION hash FROM "github.com+carol+hash";
</code>  <p>Or, if we’re gonna really go for it, use slashes after all!</p>
  <code>CREATE EXTENSION hash FROM "github.com/carol/hash";
</code>  <p>Want to use both extensions but they have conflicting objects (e.g., both create
a “hash” data type)? Put them into separatre schemas (assuming
<code>relocatable = true</code> in the control file):</p>
  <code>CREATE EXTENSION hash FROM "github.com/carol/hash" WITH SCHEMA carol;
CREATE EXTENSION hash FROM "github.com/bob/hash" WITH SCHEMA bob;
CREATE TABLE try (
    h1 carol.hash,
    h2 bob.hash
);
</code>  <p>Of course it would be nice if PostgreSQL added support for something like
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/LNPLS/packages.htm" title="Oracle Docs: PL/SQL Packages">Oracle packages</a>, but using schemas in the meantime may be sufficient.</p>
<p>Clearly we’re getting into changes to the PostgreSQL core, so put that aside and
we can just use long names for creating, modifying, and dropping extensions, but
not necessarily otherwise:</p>
  <code>CREATE EXTENSION "github.com+carol+hash" WITH SCHEMA carol;
CREATE EXTENSION "github.com+bob+hash" WITH SCHEMA bob;
CREATE EXTENSION "gitlab.com+barack+kicker_type";
CREATE TABLE try (
    h1 carol.hash,
    h2 bob.hash
    kt kicker
);
</code>   Namespacing Experiment 
<p>To confirm that this approach might work, I committed <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver/commit/24134fd" title="pg-semver@24134fd: Use domain-qualified name for extension">24134fd</a> and pushed it in
the <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver/tree/namespace-experiment" title="pg_semver@namespace-experiment: Experimental branch to try naming an extension with a source code repository URL similar to Go packages">namespace-experiment</a> branch of <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver">the semver extension</a>. This commit changes
the extension name from <code>semver</code> to <code>github.com+theory+pg-semver</code>, and follows
the above steps to ensure that its files are installed with that name.</p>
<p>Abusing the Postgres extension installation infrastructure like this does
work, but suffers from a number of drawbacks, including:</p>
 
 The extension name is super long, as before, but now so too are the files in
the repository (as opposed to the installer renaming them on install). The
shared library file has to have the long name, so therefore does the <code>.c</code>
source file. The SQL files must all start with
<code>github.com+theory+pg-semver</code>, although I skipped that bit in this commit;
instead the <code>Makefile</code> generates just one from <code>sql/semver.sql</code>. 
 Any previous installation of the <code>semver</code> type would remain unchanged, with
no upgrade path. Changing an extension’s name isn’t a great idea. 
 
<p>I could probably script renaming and modifying file contents like this and make
it part of the build process, but it starts to get complicated. We could also
modify installers to make the changes, but there are a bunch of moving parts
they would have to compensate for, and given how dynamic this can be (e.g., the
semver <code>Makefile</code> reads the extension name from <code>META.json</code>), we would rapidly
enter the territory of edge case <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole" title="Wikipedia: “Whac-A-Mole”">whac-a-mole</a>. I suspect it’s simply too
error-prone.</p>
 Proposal: Update Postgres Extension Packaging 
<p>Perhaps the Go directory pattern could inspire a similar model in Postgres,
eliminating the namespace issue by teaching the Postgres extension
infrastructure to include all but one of the files for an extension in a
single directory. In other words, rather than files distributed like so for
semver:</p>
 <code>pgsql
├── lib
│   └── semver.so
└── share
    └── extension
    │   └── semver.control
    │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── semver--0.32.1.sql
    │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── semver--0.32.0--0.32.1.sql
    └── doc
        └── semver.md
</code> <p>Make it more like this:</p>
 <code>pgsql
└── share
    └── extension
        └── github.com
            └── theory
                └── pg-semver
                    └── extension.control
                    └── lib
                    │   └── semver.so
                    └── sql
                    │   └── semver--0.32.1.sql
                    │   └── semver--0.32.0--0.32.1.sql
                    └── doc
                        └── semver.md
</code> <p>Or perhaps:</p>
 <code>pgsql
└── share
    └── extension
        └── github.com
            └── theory
                └── pg-semver
                    └── extension.control
                    └── semver.so
                    └── semver--0.32.1.sql
                    └── semver--0.32.0--0.32.1.sql
                    └── semver.md
</code> <p>The idea is to copy the files exactly as they’re stored in or compiled in the
repository. Meanwhile, the new <code>semver.name</code> file — the only relevant file
stored outside the extension module directory — simply points to that path:</p>
  <code>github.com/theory/pg-semver
</code>  <p>Then for <code>CREATE EXTENSION semver</code>, Postgres reads <code>semver.name</code> and knows where
to find all the files to load the extension.</p>
<p>This configuration would require updates to the control file, now named
<code>extension.control</code>, to record the full package name and appropriate locations.
Add:</p>
  <code>name = 'semver'
package = 'github.com/theory/pg-semver'
</code>  <p>This pattern could also allow aliasing. Say we try to install a different
<code>semver</code> extension from <code>github.com/example/semver</code>. This is in its
<code>extension.control</code> file:</p>
  <code>name = 'semver'
package = 'github.com/example/pg-semver'
</code>  <p>The installer detects that <code>semver.name</code> already exists for a different package
and raises an error. The user could then give it a different name by running
something like:</p>
  <code>make install ALIAS_EXTENSION_NAME=semver2
</code>  <p>This would add <code>semver2.name</code> right next to <code>semver.name</code>, and its contents
would contain <code>github.com/example/semver</code>, where all of its files are installed.
This would allow <code>CREATE EXTENSION semver2</code> to load the it without issue
(assuming no object conflicts, hopefully resolved by relocate-ability).</p>
<p>I realize a lot of extensions with libraries could wreak some havoc on the
library resolver having to search so many library directories, but perhaps
there’s some way around that as well? Curious what techniques experienced C
developers might have adopted.</p>
 Back to Decentralized Publishing 
<p>An updated installed extension file structure would be nice, and is surely worth
a discussion, but even if it shipped in Postgres 20, we need an updated
extension ecosystem today, to work well with all supported versions of Postgres.
So let’s return to the idea of decentralized publishing without such changes.</p>
<p>I can think of two pieces that’d be required to get Go-style decentralized
extension publishing to work with the current infrastructure.</p>
 Module Uniqueness 
<p>The first is to specify a new metadata field to be unique for the entire index,
and which would contain the repository path. Call it <code>module</code>, after Go (a
single Git repository can have multiple modules). In <a href="https://pgxn.org/spec/" title="PGXN Meta Spec - The PGXN distribution metadata specification">PGXN Meta Spec</a>-style JSON
it’d look something like this:</p>
  <code>{
    "module": "github.com/theory/pg-semver",
    "version": "0.32.1",
    "provides": {
      "semver": {
         "abstract": "A semantic version data type",
      }
    }
}
</code>  <p>Switch from the PGXN-style uniqueness on the distribution name (usually the name
of the extension) and let the module be globally unique. This would allow
another party to release an extension with the same name. Even a fork where only
the <code>module</code> is changed:</p>
  <code>{
    "module": "github.com/example/pg-semver",
    "version": "0.32.1",
    "provides": {
      "semver": {
         "abstract": "A semantic version data type",
      }
    }
}
</code>  <p>Both would be indexed and appear under the module name, and both would be
find-able by the provided extension name, <code>semver</code>.</p>
<p>Where that name must still be unique is in a given install. In other words,
while <code>github.com/theory/pg-semver</code> and <code>github.com/example/pg-semver</code> both
exist in the index, the <code>semver</code> extension can be installed from only one of
them in a given Postgres system, where the extension name <code>semver</code> defines its
uniqueness.</p>
<p>This pattern would allow for much more duplication of ideas while preserving the
existing per-cluster namespacing. It also allows for a future Postgres release
that supports something like the flexible per-cluster packaging as described
above.<a>2</a></p>
 Extension Toolchain App 
<p>The second piece is an extension management application that understands all
this stuff and makes it possible. It would empower both extension development
workflows — including testing, metadata management, and releasing — and
extension user workflows — finding, downloading, building, and installing.</p>
<p>Stealing from Go, imagine a developer making a release with something like this:</p>
  <code>git tag v1.2.1 -sm 'Tag v1.2.1'
git push --tags
pgmod list -m github.com/theory/pg-semver@v1.2.1
</code>  <p>The creatively named <code>pgmod</code> tells the registry to index the new version
directly from its Git repository. Thereafter anyone can find it and install it
with:</p>
 
 <code>pgmod get github.com/theory/pg-semver@v1.2.1</code> — installs the specified version 
 <code>pgmod get github.com/theory/pg-semver</code> — installs the latest version 
 <code>pgmod get semver</code> — installs the latest version or shows a list of
matching modules to select from 
 
<p>Any of these would fail if the cluster already has an extension named <code>semver</code>
with a different module name. But with something like the updated extension
installation locations in a future version of Postgres, that limitation could be
loosened.</p>
 Challenges 
<p>Every new idea comes with challenges, and this little thought experiment is no
exception. Some that immediately occur to me:</p>
 
 Not every extension can be installed directly from its repository. Perhaps
the metadata could include a download link for a tarball with the results of
any pre-release execution? 
 Adoption of a new CLI could be tricky. It would be useful to include the
functionality in existing tools people already use, like <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx" title="pgrx is a framework for developing PostgreSQL extensions in Rust and strives to be as idiomatic and safe as possible">pgrx</a>. 
 Updating the uniqueness constraint in existing systems like <a href="https://pgxn.org" title="PGXN — PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a> might be
a challenge. Most record the repository info in the <a href="https://pgxn.org/spec/#resources">resources META.json
object</a>, so it would be do-able to adapt into a new META format, either
on <a href="https://pgxn.org" title="PGXN — PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a> itself or in a new registry, should we choose to build one. 
 Getting everyone to standardize on standardized versioning tags might take
some effort. Go had the benefit of controlling its entire toolchain, while
Postgres extension versioning and release management has been all over the
place. However <a href="https://pgxn.org" title="PGXN — PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a> long ago standardized on <a href="https://semver.org" title="Semantic Versioning 2.0.0">semantic versioning</a> and
those who have released extensions on PGXN have had few issues (one can
still use other version formats in the control file, for better or worse). 
 Some PGXN distributions have shipped different versions of extensions in a
single release, or the same version as in other releases. The release
version of the overall package (repository, really) would have to become
canonical. 
 
<p>I’m sure there are more, I just thought of these offhand. What have you thought
of? Post ’em if you got ’em   in the <a href="https://postgresteam.slack.com/archives/C056ZA93H1A" title="Postgres Slack/#extensions: Extensions and extension-related accessories">#extensions</a> channel on the <a href="https://pgtreats.info/slack-invite" title="Join the Postgres Slack">Postgres
Slack</a>, or give me a holler <a href="https://xoxo.zone/@theory" title="@theory@xoxo.zone">on Mastodon</a> or via email.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Or does it? Yes, it does. Although the Go CLI downloads most
public modules from a <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#goproxy-protocol" title="Go Modules Reference: GOPROXY protocol">module proxy server</a> like <code>proxy.golang.org</code>, it
still must know how to <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#vcs" title="Go Modules Reference: Version control systems">download modules from a version control system</a> when
a proxy is not available.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>
 
 
<p>Assuming, of course, that if and when the Postgres core
adopts more bundled packaging that they’d use the same naming convention as
we have in the broader ecosystem. Not a perfectly safe assumption, but given
the Go precedent and wide adoption of host/path-based projects, it seems
sound.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

<p>"It should be obvious that any technology prone to making up facts is a bad fit for journalism, but the Associated Press, the American Journalism Project, and Axel Springer have all inked partnerships with OpenAI."</p>

<p>The conversation about AI at the Online News Association conference last year was so jarring to me that I was angry about it for a month. As Tyler Fisher says here, it presents existential risk to the news industry - and beyond that, following a FOMO-driven hype cycle rather than building things based on what your community actually needs is a recipe for failure.</p>

<p>As Tyler says: "Instead of trying to compete, journalism must reject the scale-driven paradigm in favor of deeper connection and community." This is the only real path forward for journalism. Honestly, it's the only real path forward for the web, and for a great many industries that live on it.  <a href="https://werd.io/tag/AI">#AI</a></p>

<p>Transport for London have redesigned the Tube map in concentric circles as part of a promotional partnership with a phone company. Just one of the many, many ways public transit is desperately grasping for funds all over the world.</p>

<p>Here in Philly, SEPTA is working to rename stations based on corporate sponsorships. The Tube actually did this once before already, renaming Bond Street to Burberry Street for London fashion week. That (as well as these new maps, presumably) was temporary; these are permanent.</p>

<p>I don't blame transit authorities for trying to make up for budget shortfalls however they can. But it's also sad. Public transit is an important public good; it's a real shame that we can't seem to fully fund it from the public purse. The point is not for transit to be profitable, it's to provide real infrastructure that lifts everybody up.  <a href="https://werd.io/tag/Society">#Society</a></p>

<p>Over on the <a href="https://blog.pgxn.org/">PGXN Blog</a> I’ve <a href="https://blog.pgxn.org/post/741049567045468160/pgxn-tools-v4" title="PGXN Blog: “PGXN Tools Docker Image Updated”">posted a brief update</a> on recent bug fixes and
improvements to the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn-tools Docker image</a>, which is used fairly widely these
days to test, bundle, and release Postgres extensions to <a href="https://pgxn.org" title="PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a>. This fix is
especially important for Git repositories:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>v1.4.1 fixes an issue where <code>git archive</code> was never actually used to build a
release zip archive. This changed at some point without noticing due to the
introduction of the <code>safe.directory</code> configuration in recent versions of Git.
Inside the container the directory was never trusted, and the <code>pgxn-bundle</code>
command caught the error, decided it wasn’t working with a Git repository, and
used the <code>zip</code> command, instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also posted a <a href="https://gist.github.com/theory/93c93571200aad02e93170c6d2c93cbe" title="PGXN distributions that contain a .git directory">gist listing PGXN distributions with a <code>.git</code> directory</a>.</p>

<p>Der EU-Innenausschuss hat heute grünes Licht für eine Verlängerung der umstrittenen Chatkontrolle durch US-Internetkonzerne bis 2025 gegeben. Ein <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/LIBE-AM-758191_DE.pdf">Ablehnungsantrag</a> (S. 3) wurde nur von Piraten, Grünen, Linke und FDP unterstützt, insgesamt jedoch mit den Stimmen von CDU, SPD und AfD <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/280531/Vote%20results_31%20January%202024.pdf">zurückgewiesen</a> (S. 2). Gibt das EU-Parlament insgesamt in einer Plenarabstimmung nächste Woche grünes Licht, will das Parlament sich mit dem Rat noch im Februar einig werden.</p>
 
 





<p>Morgen wird vor dem Landgericht Kiel die Klage des profiliertesten Kritikers der Chatkontrolle, des Europaabgeordneten Dr. Patrick Breyer von der Piratenpartei verhandelt. Breyer verklagt Meta als Mutterkonzern von Facebook und Instagram, der für 80% der ausgeleiteten Chats und Privatfotos verantwortlich ist, auf Unterlassung. Meta hat vor Gericht versprochen, die Chatkontrolle in Direktnachrichten auf Facebook und Instagram einzustellen und sichere Ende-zu-Ende-Verschlüsselung einzuführen, jedoch ist dieses Versprechen bis heute nicht eingelöst.</p>



<p>Kläger Patrick Breyer kommentiert:</p>



<p>„Es macht mich wütend, dass sich US-Konzerne mithilfe fehleranfälliger Verdächtigungsmaschinen zum Privatkontrolleur unserer persönlichen Nachrichten aufschwingen wollen. Diese Anmaßung lässt jeden Respekt vor dem digitalen Briefgeheimnis vermissen. Unsere ohnehin überlasteten Ermittler mit vielfach falschen Maschinendenunziationen zu überfluten, hat mit Effizienz nichts zu tun. Folge ist vor allem die Kriminalisierung Jugendlicher wegen unbedachter Chatnachrichten – so wird das Gegenteil von Kinderschutz erreicht.</p>



<p>Selbst intimste Nacktfotos und Sex-Chats können plötzlich bei zweifelhaftem und unterbezahltem Unternehmenspersonal oder der Polizei landen. Nach meinen Informationen war der Anteil der aus den USA geleakten Chatnachrichten und Privatfotos, die vom BKA als strafrechtlich völlig irrelevant eingestuft wurden, im letzten Jahr so hoch wie noch nie. Wer das digitale Briefgeheimnis zerstört, zerstört Vertrauen. Auf Sicherheit und Vertraulichkeit privater Kommunikation sind wir alle angewiesen: Menschen in Not, Missbrauchsopfer, Kinder, die Wirtschaft und auch Staatsbehörden.</p>



<p>Organisierte Kinderporno-Ringe benutzen keine E-Mails oder Messengerdienste, sondern abgeschottete selbst betriebene Foren. Dass Strafverfolger sich weigern, bekanntes Ausbeutungsmaterial löschen zu lassen, ist ein Skandal. Was wir brauchen, ist Löschen statt Schnüffeln!</p>



<p>Als Piratenabgeordneter werde ich nicht nur nächste Woche eine Plenarabstimmung über die heutige Fehlentscheidung des EU-Parlamentsausschusses erwirken, ich will die illegale Chatkontrolle vor Gericht stoppen lassen!“</p>



<p>Das Landgericht Kiel verhandelt Breyers Klage morgen in öffentlicher Sitzung ab 09:30 Uhr (Az. 13 O 40/23).</p>



<p><a href="http://www.chatkontrolle.de">Breyers Informationsportal zur Chatkontrolle</a></p>



<p>Ergänzung vom 01.02.2024: Vor dem Landgericht Kiel wurde Breyers Klage heute verhandelt. Meta weigerte sich, sich zu verpflichten, die Chatkontrolle auch künftig zu unterlassen. Das Gericht will zunächst die Zulässigkeit der Klage klären. Es hat für den 27. März eine Entscheidung angekündigt.</p>

<p>I woke up with piles of boxes filling one end of my living room. They’d been there since last weekend when I hauled them up from the basement and down from the third floor. Given our recent investigations into fascia, the psyche, and computation, perhaps the physicality of my cardboard wrangling was a subconscious tactic to help me process the loss. Contained within an assemblage of Playmobil, YA fantasy novels, vintage ephemera, and yellowed diplomas were the remaining belongings of two-thirds of my tiny nuclear family. At 8:30am movers were scheduled to arrive to whisk everything to storage, so I made sure to be up and out of the house early. Everything was organized and labelled with notes for my husband on what was to go, and which items were to be relocated in the house. It’s what moms do, right?</p>
<p></p>
<p>The night before I tucked away “Piggy,” my child’s beloved stuff animal companion, threadbare again after one flesh-colored terry cloth “chest” transplant. I gave him one last big hug and placed him gently next to “Brown Wolf,” both of them atop a quilt of wild 70s prints made by my grandmother in the summer camp trunk covered with Dolly’s Dairy Bar stickers, a Brevard, NC staple. It is the end of an era. I wept softly and alone in the chill of the sewing room.</p>
<p>After I had a few years of parenting under my belt, I would proffer parents of infants this insight – no matter how terrible or how wonderful life is at any given moment, the one constant is change. Cherish the sweet moments and know that the miserable ones will pass eventually. It may seem like forever, but it isn’t. I still think it’s solid advice, though bittersweet all the same. I’ve come to accept the situation and scrabble for scraps of grace to get through another day until the house sells and I can start to start over. We are still human, right? Feeling all of the big feelings is part of the job description, and yes, I’m here for it.</p>
<p>While packing up some lovely textiles woven by my husband’s late mother, I came across a few concert t-shirts from back in the day when he wore army jackets and his hair longish and was a DJ for late night hardcore shows that aired on college radio stations. Me? I was pretty square, naive, knew very little of the world. We met during a study abroad semester in Venice. On foggy fall nights we would walk holding hands to the tip of Dorsoduro, past the Salute plague church, to “the point,” Punta Della Dogana – young love. There we would sit watching the lights edging St. Mark’s Square where the Canale Grande met La Giudecca, the deep channel.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Back then I had no conception of water memory, Neptune, &nbsp;psi, or waves of consciousness. Unseen from street level, Atlas and Fortuna kept watch over the point, the latter holding a rudder aloft showing the direction of the wind, and our fate. I can look back and see my course was set when I was just a callow child off on a big adventure that would eventually sweep me to the City of Brotherly Love nestled between the Delaware and the Schuylkill, and then on, apparently, to the very different burbling 4,000-year-old waters of the Ozarks.</p>
<p>A few years back, my friend Dru shared with me the Chinese parable of the man who lost his horse. The gist was that when something happens in our lives that is apparently good or apparently bad, it is best to keep a neutral outlook, because the good might lead to the bad, or the bad to the good. Life cycles up and down. That our lives together started out under the globe of the heavens held by two atlas figures topped by a seventeenth century statue of Fortune charting human weather, commerce, navigation, bureaucratic systems…it’s quite a perfect summation of the tapestry I’ve been weaving without quite being aware of it until now.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Good? Bad? I guess I shall stay the course and see what comes next and try to hold onto my sense of wonder and playfulness as the trickster energy bubbles up around me.</p>
<p>I texted my soon-to-be-ex-husband a picture of “Misfits: Legacy of Brutality,” saying it seems the tables have turned. Now he’s an institutional administrator while I’ve gradually slid over into the outlier spot. Earlier in the process of letting go I spent a few days sifting through drawers of old cards and letters and report cards and crayon drawings, the fleeting realms of moms. Back then I was still a beloved wife and mother and daughter. The cards said so, at least. Now, I am an out-of-tune, dissonant dissident in a world rushing obliviously forward. Only a handful of people seem to be able to see and comprehend the layers of logic protocols and invisible sensors bathing us in invisible harmonic frequencies and smart cybernetic governance to tap into our soulful connection to the divine.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is the world my child will navigate. Capably, I have no doubt. </p>
<p>And me? I will watch the phase shift coalesce from the sidelines. If I’m lucky I will view the etheric confluence barefoot peeking over a bed of glorious rainbow zinnias with a tomato sandwich in hand, juice running down my forearm, and when the sandwich is done, I will put a kayak on my aging Subaru and point it towards the crystal clear waters of Lake Ouachita.</p>
<p>I have a memory of being in a circle of families. Our children were part of a semester school in the Pisgah Forest south of Asheville. We were about to entrust our precious ones to four months of expeditionary learning, which in retrospect wasn’t my best parenting choice but you do the best with the information you have at the time. One of the teachers read Khalil Gibran’s poem “On Children.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, Speak to us of Children.</p>
<p>And he said:</p>
<p>Your children are not your children.</p>
<p>They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself.</p>
<p>They come through you but not from you,</p>
<p>And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.</p>
<p>You may give them your love but not your thoughts,</p>
<p>For they have their own thoughts.</p>
<p>You may house their bodies but not their souls,</p>
<p>For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.</p>
<p>You may strive to be like them but seek not to make them like you.</p>
<p>For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.</p>
<p>You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.</p>
<p>The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with</p>
<p>His might that His arrows may go swift and far.</p>
<p>Let your bending in the archer’s hand be for gladness.</p>
<p>For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember being nonplussed and unsettled. I wasn’t ready, but we never are. I understand more about information fields and the divine creation and energy than I did then. My child did come through me, and settled so far, so far away, launched from breast milk, home cooked dinners from our CSA farm box, hand sewn Halloween costumes, art classes, bedtime stories, family trips, walks to the library, and kisses on the brow, even after adopting the habit of pushing me away in annoyance.</p>
<p>With everything in order, I headed out to get a leisurely breakfast at a restaurant that was about a twenty-minute walk from home just off the Ben Franklin Parkway, Mr. Electric himself. There was a steady rain washing away last week’s snow leaving craggy miniature mountains of ice chips languishing on the soggy drifts of leaves that didn’t manage to get bagged up during the fall – crystalline phase shift. It was a mild, drizzly rain, the kind that has a hint of the spring that is to come. There wasn’t much wind, and the misty droplets coated all the edges, plants and buildings with sparkly beads of water – billions of miniscule lenses abstracting and expanding the limits of the ordinary material world. It was magical.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Ironically the umbrella I’d grabbed wasn’t my regular rainbow one, or even the boring black one, but another that was emblazoned with the UPenn Arts and Sciences logo on it. The past week or so I’ve spent some time learning about Mark Johnson, a philosopher from the University of Oregon who spent his career talking about the ways we use our body to make meaning in the world. You see, our intelligence isn’t just in our brains and the nervous system that keeps it jumping, it’s also in our body and the liquid crystal fascia is an amazing part of that system. Art, culture, creativity, sports, dance are all gifts we toss back and forth with the quantum field of our collective consciousness.</p>
<p>These goofballs really want to meld all of that with natural philosophy, STEM we call it now, to create a unified computational system. This goal of melding social and natural sciences extends back at least to Leibniz who sought to create a universal computer where the grace of the human soul might be leveraged to shine a light on the secrets of the cosmos. I don’t think it’s likely to work, at least not how they think, but I chuckled all the same that the umbrella I’d unthinkingly grabbed on the way out the door had a special message for me. I was walking away from the life represented by that UPenn logo and soon heading south into the unknown, and the water was there as my witness.</p>
<p>In his “Stalking the Wild Pendulum” Itzhak Bentov wrote of our lives as embodied information organizers, pattern seekers, and meaning makers. Bentov felt that as we make sense of the material world through our experiences, our epiphanies, heartbreaks, and joy, there are invisible tapestries woven on the warp and weft of psyche and biology. These complex works of art, infinitely varied, are gradually gifted to the universal mind upon the passing of our bodies. That vision really resonates with me, particularly in combination with Johnson’s theories about non-linguistic communication and the importance of art and culture and the movement of the body in carrying out that important work on both and individual and social level.</p>
<p>Stephers shared with me a fascinating paper about social systems and how we use artefacts to leave traces of ourselves on our environments and those traces then influence the behaviors of others. Our use of cultural artefacts to imprint our consciousness on the energetic fields of the universe that vibrates around us is similar to the concept of pheromones that coordinate the collective efforts of eusocial creatures like ants or termites. My sense is that Web3 hopes to make cultural artefacts calculable at scale, converting them into universal coordinating signals to coax digital harmonies from the remaining wild corners that are slowly being overtaken by silicon. I <a href="https://embed.kumu.io/dc9b79f81e2bb35bc4fce22d59dde62b#untitled-map?s=bm9kZS1iU0kxa29DZA%3D%3D">mapped out some notes</a> on this in my Dallas Mythos map below.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What follows are images from my walk to breakfast and back, with a slight extension of the route to the former GlaxoSmithKline US headquarters that has since been turned into a String Theory charter school. This embodied meaning making exhorts us to go out into the world, the real world and see what’s out there to be seen! For me, since everything turned upside down, I’ve felt inclined to stay close to home and disconnect. Maybe it’s not a healthy way to be, but for right now cocooning feels right. Still, when I go out with intention and my eyes open, the universe tells me stories and leaves me clues. No, not like I’m “hearing” things or “getting downloads,” more like I’m just aligned with the symbolic language of the universe and open to exploring in a wondering, wandering way.</p>
<p>First, I encountered&nbsp; a large puddle at an intersection. I paused for a few minutes watch the ripples of the raindrops and all of the rings that danced across the surface of the water. Bentov’s book spoke of information being stored in interference patterns. He described a three-pebble experiment where the ripples where flash frozen into a holographic information storage system in the water. In my case there weren’t pebbles, but dancing drops that captivated me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And then just a half block down I had to stop again and take a picture of this surprising gift – a fish ornamented with spirals swimming through a colorful mosaic sea, as if to remind me that we don’t get to choose our river. We can, however, pay attention and find the best way to work with the flow.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And after I finished my mushroom toast, all the better to get in touch with the mycelial elements, I came out of the restaurant and saw that in the chainlink fence surrounding the empty lot across the street someone had created an impromptu party cup installation, mashing the plastic into the gaps to spell out the word “HOPE” in crude, but very legible letters. I smiled.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At this point I decided to go a bit further afield rather than head straight back to the house. I passed the Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which stands about a block and a half from the Catholic Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>And between the two on a sidewalk above the I-676 crosstown highway was a pretty lame art installation of Ben Franklin with his lightening bolts and keys, all electrical potential and trusted cryptography and Metaverse portals. It’s all right there if you have the eyes to see it. In the background is the former GlaxoSmithKline building.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I knew I wanted to take a photo of the Zenos Frudakis 2000 bronze sculpture “Freedom.” Zenos is the name of an Old Testament prophet featured in the Book of Mormon, which is interesting since you can see the temple from the piece. The composition was inspired by Rodin’s “Gates of Hell,” in turn inspired by Dante, which can be found a few blocks further along the Parkway.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I’d seen the piece a few times before in passing, but I’d never stopped to look at it very closely. I was kind of shocked.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The image conveys a person escaping the confines of the background block. For me, however, knowing the multiverse phase shift that is underway this “freedom,” especially one sponsored by a company working with Google Alphabet’s Verily on electroceutical development, feels a bit off.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Could it be the animal skull at the base?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Or the smirking cat staring out?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Or an incongruous jester, which is totally out of keeping wit the rest of the piece?</p>
<p></p>
<p>The texture of the figures spoke to me of fascia – movement, communication through embodiment, fractal tissues, today glistening with water.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Bodies at different scales embedded in their environment, a miniature twin tucked in one corner.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I felt drawn to reach out and put my hand on the outstretched hand. It reminded me of my dad, whose hands were so big and the way his fingers would curl down over mine and give them a firm squeeze. I miss that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As I headed west to go home there was a colorfully odd sticker on a metal plate. A ghost with rainbow balloons – the souls are with us in all of their photonic playfulness.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Tucked up next to the retaining was of the highway was a clutch of pine trees with an abundance of small cones scattered on the pavers below, which I took as a sign that I should fill my pockets and proceed to Sister Cities Park.</p>
<p>It’s an uptight pocket park, managed within an inch of its life in that Disneyesque, public-private partnership, “don’t walk on the grass”, “we have the rights to all pictures taken of you here,” and “yes, you need a permit authorization to do anything fun,” neutered nature tamed and contained vibe.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Oh, and this is the first time I noticed a wayside elucidating the fact that the site was formerly a pauper’s burial ground and execution site. Not sure how our Sister Cities, Tel Aviv among them, would feel if they knew. St. Peter in his alcove with his keys overlooks the <a href="https://crystalfountains.com/our-story/">crystal fountain</a> (based in Toronto). At the corner where the park met the sidewalk was Robert Indiana’s Latin take on his iconic Love statue. “Amor” commissioned in 2015 for the papal visit and World Meeting of Families.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Of course I wanted to leave a heart on the LED light fountain. Today’s kids don’t get swimming pools, just interactive splash pads. Who knows how that’s going to fit into stigmergic social computational artefacts once we’re all hydrosapiens. As I was laying down the pine cones the security guard hustled over. Now, it’s January and raining and no one but me is in the park, so she must have been inside watching me on some closed circuit cameras. She asked what I was doing and I replied what does it look like I’m doing? She said are those acorns? I said they were pine cones and just kept doing what I was doing. She turned and left saying I had to “clean it up.” I encircled the heart with needles from a few pine branches than had dropped in the storm and set an intention. Then I crossed over to the Cathedral. As soon as I stepped away she swooped in with a broom and dustpan to rid the park of my dissonant heart. But she didn’t pick up the actual litter under the bench even after I pointed it out. Then she and the other guard went and hid inside the closed cafe.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>So I decided to make another heart. This one at the base of the Shakepeare statue outside the library – all the world’s a stage. I used rock salt left over on the sidewalks for the outline and filled it in with small magnolia pods and a few springs of yarrow that were unbelievably still a very cheery yarrow. I guess I should cut the security guard some slack. It is a spectacle after all, and she was simply playing her assigned archetypal role.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I went inside the library thinking that I would take a photo of the computer terminals in the children’s department that annoyed me so much when we made visits when my child was so little. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the beeping, jarring computer game terminals for toddlers were gone. Yay. I did see a display in the lobby that the public transit division wanted your daydreams, which is pretty creepy. I also had a long and rewarding conversation with the social worker who was manning the services desk in the lobby. I explained to her about social impact bonds and pay for success and blockchaining unhoused people (MyPass in Austin) and offered my theory that it was about biohybrid computing. She looked up Michael Levin on her phone and seemed genuinely interested, which gave some meaning to a morning that would otherwise have been rather bleak.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Three is such a nice number, so I decided to make a final heart on the fountain outside the Barnes Foundation – talk about the power of curated artifacts! I remember back to the lockdown days when a few of us did an esoteric tour of the Parkway and left some lovely crystals in the water. The water was turned off for the season, but there was a bit in one corner from the rain. This one was simple – not too much material around – twigs, sycamore ball fluff, an auburn oak leaf, and a smidge of pine.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The rest of the way home was pretty uneventful. I stopped to dip my hand in the water of the PeCO electrical manhole cover – liquid portal.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I saw an acupuncture&nbsp;storefront with the sign for Still Waters.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And a window with artwork that looked like a black and white concept game – the Niantic Pokemon Go version of digital “Playful Cities” in abstracted, quantifiable reality.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And as I got to my house I saw my tree, that I will miss very much. In the city you only have room for at most one tree in the front. Ours was a thornless honey locust and we put it in when we bought our house in 1998. The past year or so the bark started peeling back and I noticed some larvae under it and I was worried for it. We had an injection put into the roots to stop the sucking bugs. A big hunk of bark fell off last year and I was very upset. But now six months later it’s healing up with new bark. You can still see the scarred place, but I want to believe it will bounce back, even in spite of all the incessant geoengineering.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am a Sagitarrius and we are rather mercurial, but as spring arrives I will try to remember the parable of the man who lost his horse. Good-bad, bad-good – we just need to practice swimming in the flow in which we’ve found ourselves. I hope you’ve enjoyed coming with me on this damp stroll through the city that I loved and that I’m leaving. I’m sure I will find new stories in new places to share.</p>

 Set "runs-on: macos-14" to run a GitHub Actions workflow on a 7GB of RAM ARM M1 runner. I have been looking forward to this for ages: it should make it much easier to build releases of both Electron apps and Python binary wheels for Apple Silicon.

<p>"Zero-downtime, reversible, schema migrations for Postgres"</p>

<p>I love this kind of thing. This one is has a really interesting design: you define your schema modifications (adding/dropping columns, creating tables etc) using a JSON DSL, then apply them using a Go binary.</p>

<p>When you apply a migration the tool first creates a brand new PostgreSQL schema (effectively a whole new database) which imitates your new schema design using PostgreSQL views. You can then point your applications that have been upgraded to the new schema at it, using the PostgreSQL search_path setting.</p>

<p>Old applications can continue talking to the previous schema design, giving you an opportunity to roll out a zero-downtime deployment of the new code.</p>

<p>Once your application has upgraded and the physical rows in the database have been transformed to the new schema you can run a --continue command to make the final destructive changes and drop the mechanism that simulates both schema designs at once.</p>

<blockquote><p>
Ideally, tools like GeoGebra and Metabase provide interfaces so intuitive that you rarely need to read the docs, and you can learn the software just by poking around in it. In reality, of course, we need those docs — and they still need to be excellent. But now, we’ll extract a new benefit from them. When we can partner with machines that have read the docs, and can look over our shoulders as we try to do the things described in the docs, we’ll turbocharge our ability to dive into unfamiliar software tools and quickly learn how to use them.

<p>Thoughts on Self-Sovereign Identity: A Systematic Review, Mapping and&nbsp;Taxonomy</p><p>I ran across a paper named <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/15/5641">Self-Sovereign Identity: A Systematic Review, Mapping and Taxonomy</a>. It was published mid-2022 so it is not the most up to date for the topic but it is very interesting and still of high value. It’s a meta-study of four research questions about self-sovereign identity.</p>  RQ-1: What Practical Problems Have Been Introduced and&nbsp;Solved?  RQ-2: What Properties, Formal Definitions and Cryptographic Tools Have Been&nbsp;Used?  RQ-3: What Conceptual Ideas Have Been Introduced or&nbsp;Refuted?  RQ-4: When, Where, and by Whom Were SSI Studies Published?  <p>It spends a lot of text before the research questions on how it built the study objectively, criteria for the data, and criteria for the inclusion of the other research papers. Though interesting, it was not what compelled me in the paper. As you might imagine, it was the red meat of the paper, the research questions, that I really found most interesting.</p><p>You’ll find in the research question sections that it does a nice inventory of various papers and a description of what they cover. I found RQ-1 to be the most interesting as it covers a lot of verifiable credentials and verifiable presentation topics.</p><p>Of RQ-1 I found section 6.2 to be of special interest. It&nbsp;covers:</p> The operational facet is divided into two facets: VC and VP.<br>They are a collection of concepts related to the functional aspects<br>of verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations. <p>And includes:</p>  Revocation  Decentralized Identifiers  Issuer Authorization  Delegation  Backup and&nbsp;Recovery  <p>RQ-3 is a short section and starts with an interesting statement that is probably less true today than when written but still holds a lot of&nbsp;truth.</p> ...that there is currently no agreement on a definition of SSI... <br>Our third research question is answered by an examination of <br>the literature’s debates on the SSI definition. <p>Though I appreciate RQ-4 and it makes sense in the context of the paper, I found the least value in its presentation. It did remind me of a relationship graph I created a number of years back except that my graph was on the relationship of the specifications at the time. The header image of this post is a small rendering of that graph. You can find the useful version at <a href="https://www.kumu.io/michaelruminer/vc-spec-map">Verifiable Credentials Specification Map</a>. Reader beware that the specification map I list was last updated late May of 2021 so it is not an accurate source of the state of specifications for today though many of the relationships it does show are likely valid. This is really a topic for a different day.</p><p>All in all, despite the relative age of the paper, the other papers it refers to are often still valid today in their intent and basic questions, agreements, and refutations. I think it is well worth your time to look at the research questions portions if interested in self-sovereign identity (a phrase that seems to be moving more so out of popular use) and verifiable credentials.</p>

<p></p><p>I tried&nbsp;<a href="https://arc.net/blog/arc-search">Arc Search</a>, the new mobile app from <a href="https://thebrowser.company/">the Browser Company</a>. Its central insight is that almost every mobile browsing session starts with a web search; rather than giving you the usual list of results, it prioritizes building a web page for you that contains all the information you asked for. That way, the theory goes, you can see the information you need and be on your way faster. (You can still fall back to a Google search, although given that Google is going down the same path, that might not be as differentiated an experience — <a href="https://gizmodo.com/google-search-ai-answers-slavery-benefits-1850758631">or as correct</a> — as you might think.)</p><p>Obviously, I searched for myself. (Admit it, you would too.) Here’s what it gave me:</p><p></p><p>I have a few notes:</p>  This is a photo of my friend <a href="https://tantek.com">Tantek Çelik</a>. I have a lot of respect for Tantek, and I think he’s done a lot to consistently work for the open web in a way that most of the rest of us haven’t always been able to. I also miss hanging out with him. But I am not him. 
 I am not the Chief Technology Officer at <a href="https://19thnews.org">The 19th</a>. I was, but I haven’t been there for almost a year. <a href="https://19thnews.org/2023/09/tyler-fisher-new-19th-chief-technology-officer/">Tyler Fisher is the CTO at The 19th</a>, where he’s doing an excellent job. 
 It’s not in the screenshot, but it also claims that I’m a contributor to The 19th. I wish I was a journalist of that calibre, but let’s be clear, I’m a web developer who blogs. 
 <p>If this was an ordinary web search, you could easily see that pages that describe me as the CTO at The 19th are old, and that the photo is of Tantek. But it’s not an ordinary search at all, and Arc Search has presented the information as factual, without context or attribution, as a very simple website. There are three representative links presented further down the page, but in a way that is disconnected from the facts themselves.</p><p>I’m flattered by the comparison to Tantek, and while I’m not that keen on having my job position misrepresented, it’s not catastrophic. In other words, it could be worse. But consider if you weren’t just doing a vanity search, and instead were looking for something that actually mattered.</p><p>I’m also troubled by the role of training models themselves. When you remove attribution and display facts in this way, you give the appearance of objectivity without the requirement to actually be objective. It all comes down to which sources it checks and how the model is trained to report back — in other words, the biases of the developers.</p><p>If I search for “who should I follow in AI?” I get the usual AI influencers, with no mention of <a href="https://www.dair-institute.org/team/">Timnit Gebru</a> or <a href="https://www.poetofcode.com/">Joy Buolamwini</a> (who would be my first choices). If I ask who to follow in tech, I get Elon Musk. It undoubtedly has a lens through which it sees the world. That’s fine in itself — everyone does — but by removing context, you remove the clues that help you figure out what it is.</p><p>Finally, obviously, the sources themselves are automatically browsed by the app but don’t see the benefit of a human visitor. Real people sometimes pay to access content, or donate to support a nonprofit publisher, or watch an ad. Those things can be annoying but pay for the content to be produced in the first place. If we strip them away, there’s no writing, information, or expression for the app to summarize. A world where everyone uses an app like this is a death spiral to an information desert.</p><p>I guess what I’m saying is: thanks, I hate it. Give me context; give me nuance; give me the ability to think for myself. We built the world’s most incredible communication and knowledge-sharing medium, rich with diverse perspectives and alternative ideas; let’s not sanitize it through a banal filter that is designed to strip it of its humanity.</p>

<p>Die Europäische Piratenpartei (PPEU) nominierte auf ihrer Generalversammlung am Wochenende in Luxemburg Marcel Kolaja von der Tschechischen Piratenpartei und Anja Hirschel von der Piratenpartei Deutschland offiziell als Spitzenkandidaten für die bevorstehenden Europawahl im Juni 2024.</p>



<p>Marcel Kolaja, eine einflussreiche Stimme in der tschechischen Piratenpartei, setzt sich leidenschaftlich für digitale Rechte und Innovation ein. Als Verfechter einer transparenten und bürgernahen Digitalpolitik bringt Kolaja eine frische Perspektive in die europäische Politik ein. Er ist von seiner Partei, die in Tschechien mitregiert, als möglicher nächster tschechischer EU-Kommissar nominiert worden.</p>



<p>Marcel Kolaja, Spitzenkandidat der Tschechischen Piratenpartei für die Europawahlen 2024 und Mitglied sowie Quästor des Europäischen Parlaments, kommentiert:</p>



<p>“Europa sah sich in den letzten Jahren einer Vielzahl von Herausforderungen gegenüber: der COVID-19-Pandemie, Krieg, einer Energiekrise und einer sich verschärfenden Klimakrise. Daher erleben wir heute einen Anstieg des Populismus und der Unterstützung für rechtsextreme Parteien. Die Piraten bieten eine Alternative – eine Politik, die auf Fakten, funktionsfähigen Lösungen und Ehrlichkeit basiert. Deshalb muss die Stimme der Piraten in den höchsten Rängen der europäischen Politik klar vernehmbar sein. Ich schätze das Vertrauen, das die europäischen Piraten durch meine Nominierung zum Spitzenkandidaten in mich setzen, sehr und werde alles in meiner Macht Stehende tun, um es nicht zu enttäuschen.“</p>



  
<p>Nach ihrem Beitritt zu den Piraten im Jahr 2011 begann Anja Hirschel ihren politischen Weg im Jahr 2019 mit ihrer Vereidigung als Stadträtin in Ulm. In dieser Funktion hat sie aktiv zur Gestaltung neuer ökosozialer Schwerpunkte beigetragen und die digitale Entwicklung der Stadt vorangetrieben.</p>



<p>Anja Hirschel, Spitzenkandidatin der Piratenpartei Deutschland für die Europawahl 2024, kommentiert:</p>
  



<p>“Als Spitzenkandidatin der Europäischen Piratenpartei möchte ich unsere Werte repräsentieren und eine neue Perspektive für die digitale und vernetzte Zukunft der EU bieten. Mit meinem Hintergrund als zertifizierte Datenschutzbeauftragte möchte ich meine Expertise in den Bereichen Digitalisierung, Datenschutz, Urheberrecht und Umweltfragen in die europäische Politik einbringen. Ich fühle mich sehr geehrt, als Spitzenkandidatin nominiert worden zu sein, und freue mich darauf, die Vision der Piratenpartei für eine Europäische Union zu vertreten, die den digitalen Fortschritt begrüßt und gleichzeitig die Rechte und Werte ihrer Bürger schützt.“</p>



<p>Patrick Breyer, Europaageordneter der Piratenpartei Deutschland, kommentiert die Nominierung von Anja Hirschel:</p>



<p>„Wie beim Staffellauf habe ich auf meiner parlamentarischen Wegstrecke alles gegeben und möchte den Staffelstab jetzt mit Unterstützung der Wählerinnen und Wähler weiter reichen. Digitalexpertin, Informatikerin, Datenschutzbeauftragte, Stadträtin, ehemalige Mitarbeiterin in meinem Abgeordnetenbüro – Anja Hirschel ist die Idealbesetzung, um meinen digitalen Freiheitskampf in Brüssel mit demselben Mitarbeiterteam fortzusetzen, als unsere Stimme der Privatsphäre und des freien Internets in Europa, als parlamentarischer Arm der Netzgemeinde. Nach der Europawahl brauchen wir sie am Verhandlungstisch, um für unser digitales Briefgeheimnis und sichere Verschlüsselung zu kämpfen, wenn der angekündigte #EUGoingDark-Plan für Vorratsdatenspeicherung und gegen Ende-zuEnde-Verschlüsselung auf den Tisch kommt oder gar die entscheidenden Trilogverhandlungen über die Chatkontrolle beginnen.“</p>



<p>Die PPEU ist eine politische Partei, die sich für bürgerliche Freiheiten, Transparenz und direkte Demokratie in Europa einsetzt. Die PPEU ist Mitglied der Piratenpartei International (PPI) und hat 18 Mitglieder in 17 europäischen Ländern. Gewählte Vertreter auf nationaler Ebene gibt es in drei Ländern (Tschechische Republik, Luxemburg und Island) sowie auf europäischer Ebene in Deutschland und der Tschechischen Republik.</p>

<p>
I’ve happily used MS Paint as my basic bitmap editor since Windows 3, almost 25 years ago. Mostly I’ve used it to create images from screenshots, but that has suddenly become way harder. Formerly, when I’d cut a region, the now-empty region would display using the default white background. Now it displays a checkered background like so.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Here is the procedure to refill the white background: </p>
 
 Switch the foreground color to white
  Use the Fill tool to fill the checkered region
  Then switch the foreground back to black.
  
<p>
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?</p>
<p>
Nope. It’s evidently an unintended consequence of a pair of new feature: layers and transparency.</p>
<blockquote><p>
To get started, click on the new Layers button in the toolbar, which will open a panel on the side of the canvas.”</p>
<p>
Microsoft also revealed today that an upcoming Paint feature is support for image transparency, which will add the ability to open and save transparent PNG files.</p>
<p>
During editing, users will notice a prominent checkerboard pattern displayed on the canvas, serving as a visual indicator and highlighting the transparent regions within the image.</p>
<p>
This ensures that when content is erased from the canvas, it is completely removed, eliminating the need to cover unwanted regions of an image with white fill.  </p>
<p> – <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-paint-finally-gets-support-for-layers-and-transparency">bleepingcomputer.com</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I never asked for these “long-awaited” new features, Paint is (or was) useful to me precisely because it only does the kind of basic bitmap editing I need when compositing screenshots. But I can opt out, right?</p>
<p>
Nope. </p>
<p>
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?</p>
<p>
Nope. </p>
<blockquote><p>
This feature (layers and image transparency) seems to be introduced in September 2023 and doesn’t actually allow to be turned off.</p>
<p>
Doing what vengy proposes for each and every image being edited is a natural madness and will drive even the most sane person crazy.</p>
<p>
What worked for me was to uninstall Paint and replace it with a classic version:</p>
 
 Uninstalling can be done by simply right-clicking Paint icon in Start Menu and selecting Uninstall from context menu.
  
Classic Paint can be get from here or here.<p></p>
  
Download and install it.<p></p>
  
Go to Settings → Apps → Apps &amp; Features → More settings → App execution aliases.<p></p>
  
Toggle the switch to Off for mspaint.exe and pbrush.exe items.
  
<p>– <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1813858/microsoft-paint-selection-delete-gives-checkered-background">superuser.com</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Evidently people are willing to hack their systems in order to revert to a now-unsupported version that they prefer. As insane as it would be, I’m considering whether to become one of those people. Sigh. I guess 25 years was a pretty good run. </p>

<p>Last week, I informally shared <a href="https://gist.github.com/theory/898c8802937ad8361ccbcc313054c29d">Extension Ecosystem: Jobs and Tools</a> with
colleagues in the <a href="https://postgresteam.slack.com/archives/C056ZA93H1A" title="Postgres Slack/#extensions: Extensions and extension-related accessories">#extensions</a> channel on the <a href="https://pgtreats.info/slack-invite" title="Join the Postgres Slack">Postgres Slack</a>. The document
surveys the <a href="https://strategyn.com/jobs-to-be-done/jobs-to-be-done-theory/">jobs to be done</a> by the ideal Postgres extension ecosystem and the
suggests the tools and services required to do those jobs — without reference
to existing extension registries and packaging systems.</p>
<p>The last section enumerates some questions we need to ponder and answer. The
first one on the list is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What will <a href="https://pgxn.org" title="The postgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a>’s role be in this ideal extension ecosystem?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The PostgreSQL Extension Network, or <a href="https://pgxn.org" title="The postgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a>, is the original extension
distribution system, created 2010–11. It has been a moderate success, but as we
in the Postgres community imagine the ideal extension distribution future, it’s
worthwhile to also critically examine existing tools like PGXN, both to inform
the project and to realistically determine their roles in that future.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I here jot down some thoughts on the challenges with PGXN.</p>
 PGXN Challenges 
<p>PGXN sets a lot of precedents, particularly in its decoupling of the registry
from the APIs and services that depend on it. It’s not an all-in-one thing, and
designed for maximum distributed dissemination via rsync and static JSON files.</p>
<p>But there are a number of challenges with PGXN as it currently stands; a
sampling:</p>
 
 
<p>PGXN has not comprehensively indexed all public PostgreSQL extensions. While
it indexes more extensions than any other registry, it falls far short of
all <a href="https://gist.github.com/joelonsql/e5aa27f8cc9bd22b8999b7de8aee9d47" title="GitHub Gist: 🗺🐘 1000+ PostgreSQL EXTENSIONs">known extensions</a>. To be a truly canonical registry, we need to make it
as simple as possible for developers to register their extensions. (More
thoughts on that topic in a forthcoming post.)</p>
 
 
<p>In that vein, releasing extensions is largely a manual process. The
<a href="https://github.com/pgxn/docker-pgxn-tools" title="pgxn/docker-pgxn-tools: Test image for PostgreSQL &amp; PGXN extensions">pgxn-tools</a> Docker image has improved the situation, allowing developers to
create relatively simple GitHub workflows to automatically <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml" title="kv-pair extension CI workflow">test</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml" title="kv-pair extension release workflow">release</a> extensions. Still, it requires intention and work by extension
developers. The more seamless we can make publishing extensions the better.
(More thoughts on that topic in a forthcoming post.)</p>
 
 
<p>It’s written in <a href="https://www.perl.org" title="Perl is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over 36 years of development.">Perl</a>, and therefore doesn’t feel modern or easily
accessible to other developers. It’s also a challenge to build and
distribute the Perl services, though Docker images could mitigate this
issue. Adopting a modern compiled language like <a href="https://go.dev" title="Build simple, secure, scalable systems with Go">Go</a> or <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org" title="A language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software">Rust</a> might
increase community credibility and attract more contributions.</p>
 
 
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://pgxn.github.io/pgxnclient/" title="PGXN Client’s documentation">pgxnclient</a> is written in <a href="https://www.python.org" title="Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively">Python</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/guedes/pgxn-utils" title="PGXN extension development and release utilities">pgxn-utils</a>
developer tools in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/" title="A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity.">Ruby</a>, increasing the universe of knowledge and skill
required for developers to maintain all the tools. They’re also more
difficult to distribute than compiled tools would be. Modern
cross-compilable languages like <a href="https://go.dev" title="Build simple, secure, scalable systems with Go">Go</a> and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org" title="A language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software">Rust</a> once again simplify
distribution and are well-suited to building both web services and CLIs (but
not, perhaps native UX applications —  but then neither are dynamic
languages like Ruby and Python).</p>
 
 
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/pgxn-api/wiki/search-api">PGXN Search API</a> uses the <a href="https://lucy.apache.org" title="A “loose C” port of the Apache Lucene™ search engine library for Java.">Apache Lucy</a> search engine library, a
project that <a href="https://attic.apache.org/projects/lucy.html" title="Apache Lucy moved into the Attic in June 2018">retired</a> in 2018. Moreover, the feature never worked very
well, thanks to the decision to expose separate search indexes for different
objects — and requiring the user to select which to search. People often
can’t find what they need because the selected index doesn’t contain it.
Worse, the default index on <a href="https://pgxn.org" title="The postgreSQL Extension Network">the site</a> is “Documentation”, on the
surface a good choice. But most extensions include no documentation other
than the README, which appears in the “Distribution” index, not
“Documentation”. Fundamentally the search API and UX needs to be completely
re-architected and -implemented.</p>
 
 
<p>PGXN uses its own very simple identity management and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication" title="Wikipedia: “Basic access authentication”">basic
authentication</a>. It would be better to have tighter community identity,
perhaps through the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/account/" title="Your PostgreSQL community account">PostgreSQL community account</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Given these issues, should we continue building on PGXN, rewrite some or all of
its components, or abandon it for new services. The answer may come as a natural
result of designing the overall extension ecosystem architecture or from the
motivations of community consensus. But perhaps not. In the end, we’ll need a
clear answer to the question.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts? Hit us up in the <a href="https://postgresteam.slack.com/archives/C056ZA93H1A" title="Postgres Slack/#extensions: Extensions and extension-related accessories">#extensions</a> channel on the <a href="https://pgtreats.info/slack-invite" title="Join the Postgres Slack">Postgres
Slack</a>, or give me a holler <a href="https://xoxo.zone/@theory" title="@theory@xoxo.zone">on Mastodon</a> or via email. We expect to start
building in earnest in February, so now’s the time!</p>

A PageXray of that story finds 360 adserver requests, 259 tracking requests, and 131 other requests, which it visualizes <a href="https://pagexray.fouanalytics.com/q/arstechnica.com%2Ftech-policy%2F2024%2F01%2Fpatreon-attacks-law-that-keeps-platforms-from-sharing-your-video-views%2F?f=">with this</a>:</p>

<p>And that’s just one small part of it.</p>
<p>Will any reporter grab the third rail of their employer’s participation in the tracking-based advertising business, or visit that business’s responsibility for what was already <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2015/09/28/beyond-ad-blocking-the-biggest-boycott-in-human-history/">the biggest boycott in human history</a> way back in 2015? I’ve only seen it happen once: when Farhad Manjoo <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/23/opinion/data-internet-privacy-tracking.html">exposed</a> The New York Times‘ (his employer’s) own participation, back in 2019. <a href="https://pagexray.fouanalytics.com/q/www.nytimes.com%2Finteractive%2F2019%2F08%2F23%2Fopinion%2Fdata-internet-privacy-tracking.html?f=">Here’s a PageXray of tracking via that piece today</a>:</p>

<p>Better, but not ideal.</p>
<p>Five years ago this month, I wrote <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/if-your-privacy-hands-others-alone-you-dont-have-any">a column in Linux Journal with the title above</a>. With just a few minor edits, here it is again. Amazing how little things have changed since then—and how much worse they have become. But I do see hope. Read on.</p>
 
<p>If you think regulations are going to protect your privacy, you’re wrong. In fact, they can make things worse, especially if they start with the assumption that your privacy is provided only by other parties, most of whom are incentivized to violate it.</p>
<p>Exhibit A&nbsp;for how much worse things can get is the EU’s&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)</a>. As soon as the GDPR went into full effect in May 2018, damn near every corporate entity on the Web put up a “cookie notice” requiring acceptance of terms and privacy policies that allow them to continue violating your privacy by harvesting, sharing, auctioning off and otherwise using your data, and data about you.</p>
<p>For websites and services in that harvesting business (a population that rounds to the whole commercial web), these notices provide a one-click way to adhere to the letter of the GDPR while violating its spirit.</p>
<p>There’s also big business in the friction that it produces. To see how big, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gdpr+compliance">look up&nbsp;GDPR+compliance&nbsp;on Google</a>. You’ll get 232 million results (give or take a few dozen million).</p>
<p>None of those results are for you, even though&nbsp;you are who the GDPR is supposed to protect. See, to the GDPR, you are a mere “data subject” and not an independent and fully functional participant in the technical, social, and economic ecosystem the Internet supports by design. All privacy protections around your data are the burden of other parties.</p>
<p>Or at least that’s the interpretation that nearly every lawmaker, regulatory bureaucrat, lawyer, and service provider goes by. (One exception is <a href="https://hackylawyer.com/">Elizabeth Renieris</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/hackylawyer">@hackylawyer</a>. Her&nbsp;<a href="https://hackylawyer.com/writing">collection of postings</a> is required reading on the GDPR and much else.) The same goes for those selling GDPR compliance services, comprising most of those 190 million GDPR+compliance search results.</p>
<p>The clients of those services include nearly every website and service on Earth that harvests personal data. These entities have no economic incentive to stop harvesting, sharing, and selling personal data the usual ways, beyond fear that the GDPR might actually be enforced, which so far (with <a href="https://martechseries.com/mts-insights/guest-authors/gdpr-six-months-and-counting/">few</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=57355d0d-5d3a-40aa-8665-8366dcc9bd5a">exceptions</a>), it hasn’t been. (See&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2018/07/03/without-enforcement-the-gdpr-is-a-fail/">Without enforcement, the GDPR is a fail</a>.)</p>
<p>Worse, the tools for “managing” your exposure to data harvesters are provided entirely by the&nbsp;websites you visit and the services you engage. The “choices” they provide (if they provide any at all)&nbsp;are between 1) acquiescence to them doing what they please and 2) a maze of menus full of checkboxes and toggle switches “controlling” your exposure to unknown threats from parties you’ve never heard of, with no way to record your choices or monitor effects.</p>
<p>So let’s explore just one site’s presentation, and then get down to what it means and why it matters.</p>
<p>Our example is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/">https://www.mirror.co.uk</a>. If you haven’t clicked on that site already, you’ll see a cookie notice that says,</p>
<blockquote><p>We use cookies to help our site work, to understand how it is used, and to tailor the adverts presented on our site. By clicking “Accept” below, you agree to us doing so. You can read more in our cookie notice. Or, if you do not agree, you can click Manage below to access other choices.</p></blockquote>
<p>They don’t mention that “tailor the adverts” really means something like this:</p>
<p>We open your browser to infestation by tracking beacons from countless parties in the online advertising business, plus who-knows-what-else that might be working with those parties (there is no way to tell, and if there was we wouldn’t provide it), so those parties and their “partners”&nbsp;can use those beacons to follow you like a marked animal everywhere you go&nbsp;and report your activities back to a vast marketplace where personal data about you is shared, bought and sold, much of it in real time, supposedly so your eyeballs can be hit with “relevant”&nbsp;or “interest-based”&nbsp;advertising as you travel from site to site and service to service. While&nbsp;we are sure there are bad collateral effects (fraud and malware, for example), we don’t care about those because it’s our business to get paid just just for clicks or “impressions,”&nbsp;whether you’re impressed or not—and the odds that you won’t be impressed average to certain.</p>
<p>Okay, so now click on the “Manage” button.</p>
<p>Up will pop a rectangle where it says “Here you can control cookies, including those for advertising, using the buttons below. Even if you turn off the advertising-related cookies, you will still see adverts on our site, because they help us to fund it. However, those adverts will simply be less relevant to you. You can learn more about cookies in our Cookie Notice on the site.”</p>
<p>Under that text, in the left column, are six “Purposes of data collection”, all defaulted with little check marks to ON (though only five of them show, giving the impression that there are only those five). The right column is called “Our partners”, and it shows the first five of what turn out to be 259 companies, nearly all of which are not brands known to the world&nbsp;or to anybody outside the business (and probably not known widely&nbsp;within&nbsp;the business as well). All are marked ON by that little check mark. Here’s that list, just through the letter A:</p>

<p>I’m a somewhat technical guy, and at least half of that stuff means nothing to me.</p>
<p>As for “managing” those,&nbsp; my only choice on that page is to “Remove All”. Does that mean Remove everything on that page alone or Remove all cookies everywhere? And how can I remember what I’ve had removed?</p>
<p>Obviously, there is no way for anybody to “manage” this, in any meaningful sense of the word.</p>
<p>We also can’t fix it on the sites and&nbsp;services side, no matter how much those sites and services care (which most don’t) about the “customer journey”, the “customer experience” or any of the other bullshit they’re buying from marketers this week.</p>
<p>Even within the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer-relationship_management">CRM (customer relationship management)</a>&nbsp;world, the B2B customers of CRM companies use one cloud and one set of tools to create as many different “experiences” for users and customers as there are companies deploying those tools to manage customer relationships from their side.&nbsp; There are no corresponding tools on our side.&nbsp;(Though there is work going on.&nbsp;See&nbsp;<a href="http://projectvrm.org/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>So the digital world remains one where we have no common or standard way to scale our privacy and data usage tools, choices, or experiences across all sites and services. And that’s what we’ll need if we want real privacy online.</p>
<p>The simple place where we need to start is this:&nbsp;p<a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/2018/11/privacy-is-personal/">rivacy is personal</a>, meaning something we create for ourselves (which in the natural world we do with clothing and shelter, both of which lack equivalents in the digital world).</p>
<p>And we need to be clear that privacy is not a grace of privacy policies and terms of service that differ with every company&nbsp;and over which none of us have true control—especially when there is an entire industry devoted to making those companies untrustworthy, even if they are in full compliance with privacy laws.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/">Devon Loffreto</a>&nbsp;(who coined the term&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22self-sovereign+identity">self-sovereign identity</a>&nbsp;and whose good work we’ll be visiting in an upcoming issue of&nbsp;Linux Journal)&nbsp;puts the issue in simple geek terms:&nbsp;we need&nbsp;root authority&nbsp;over our lives. Hashtag:&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OwnRoot">#OwnRoot</a>.</p>
<p>It is only by owning root that we can crank up agency on the individual’s side. We have a perfect base for that in the standards and protocols that gave us the Internet, the Web, email, and too little else. And we need it here too. Soon.</p>
<p>We (a few colleagues and I) created&nbsp;<a href="http://customercommons.org/">Customer Commons</a>&nbsp;as a place for&nbsp;<a href="http://customercommons.org/home/tools/terms/">terms</a>&nbsp;that individuals can proffer as first parties, just by pointing at them, much as licenses at&nbsp;<a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Common</a>s can be pointed at. Sites and services can agree to&nbsp;those terms, and both can keep records and follow audit trails.</p>
<p>And there are some good signs that this will happen. For example, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ieee.org/">IEEE</a> approached Customer Commons last year with the suggestion that we stand up a working group for machine-readable personal privacy terms. It’s called&nbsp;<a href="https://standards.ieee.org/project/7012.html">P7012</a>. If you’d like to join, please do.</p>
<p>Unless we #OwnRoot for our own lives online, privacy will remain an empty promise by a legion of violators.</p>
<p>One more thing. We&nbsp;can&nbsp;put the GDPR to our use if we like.&nbsp;That’s because&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj/eng">Article 4 of the GDPR</a>&nbsp;defines a data controller as “the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data…” This means&nbsp;each of us can be our own data controller. Most lawyers dealing with the GDPR don’t agree with that. They think the individual data subject will always need a fiduciary or an intermediary of some kind: an agent of the individual, but not an individual with agency.&nbsp;Yet the simple fact is that we should have root authority over&nbsp;our lives online, and that means we should have&nbsp;some degree of control over our data exposures, and how our data, and data about us, is used—much as we do over how we control or moderate our privacy in the physical world.&nbsp;More about all that in upcoming posts.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/2018/12/if-your-privacy-is-the-hands-of-others-alone-you-dont-have-any/">original version of this post</a>&nbsp;was published on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/">Private Internet Access blog</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/">Private Internet Access</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;Linux Journal&nbsp;are both holdings of&nbsp;<a href="https://londontrustmedia.com/">London Trust Media</a>. Also check out the&nbsp;<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Privacy_Manifesto">Privacy Manifesto</a>&nbsp;at the&nbsp;<a href="http://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/">ProjectVRM wiki</a>. I maintain it and welcome bug fixes. It’s also new, so be gentle. </p>
<p>†This is an example of what <a href="https://pluralistic.net/">Cory Doctorow</a> calls “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a>” and Wikipedia (at that link) more politely calls “platform decay.” It’s a big trade-away of goodwill by Patreon. Says to me they must be making an enshitload of money in the adtech fecosystem.</p>

Despite the fact that the merchant has never met me before and has no knowledge of my bank, she blithely allows me to walk out of the store with hundreds of dollars of merchandise, confident that she will receive payment. I emphasized the word confident in the last sentence because it's core to understanding what's happened. In the past, these kinds of transactions required that the merchant trust me or my bank. But in the modern world, trust has been replaced by confidence.</p><p>We often mix these concepts up and I'm as guilty as anyone. But trust always involves an element of risk, whereas confidence does not. These are not binary, but rather represent a spectrum. In the scenario I paint above, the merchant is still taking some risk, but it's very small. Technology, processes, and legal agreements have come together to squeeze out risk. The result is a financial system where the risk is so small that banks, merchants, and consumers alike have confidence that they will not be cheated. There's a name in the financial services industry for the network that reduces risk so that trust can be replaced with confidence: an acceptance network.</p> Acceptance Networks <p>An acceptance network is the network of merchants or service providers that accept a particular form of payment, usually credit or debit cards, from a particular issuer or payment network. The term refers to a broad ecosystem that facilitates these transactions, including point-of-sale terminals, online payment gateways, and other infrastructure. Each component of the acceptance network plays a crucial role in ensuring that transactions are processed efficiently, securely, and accurately. This drives out risk and increases confidence. Acceptance networks are foundational components of modern payment ecosystems and are essential to the seamless functioning of digital financial transactions. Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover are all examples of acceptance networks.</p><p>Before the advent of acceptance networks, credit was a spotty thing with each large merchant issuing it's own proprietary credit card—good only at that merchant. My mom and dad had wallets full of cards for JC Penney, Sears, Chevron, Texaco, and so on. Sears trusted its card. Chevron trusted its card. But it was impossible to use a Chevron card at Sears. They had limited means to verify if it was real and no way to clear the funds so that Chevron could pay Sears for the transaction.</p><p>That scenario is similar to the state of digital identity today. We have identity providers (IdPs) like Google and Apple who control a closed ecosystem of relying parties (with a lot of overlap). These relying parties trust these large IdPs to authenticate the people who use their services. They limit their risk by only using IdPs they're familiar with and only accepting the (usually) self-asserted attributes from the IdP that don't involve much risk. Beyond that they must verify everything themselves.</p><p>Fixing this requires the equivalent of an acceptance network for digital identity. When we <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2017/01/a_universal_trust_framework.shtml">launched Sovrin Foundation and the Sovrin network</a>1 in 2016, we were building an acceptance network for digital identity, even though we didn't use that term to describe it. Our goal was to create a system of protocols, processes, technology and governance that would reduce the risk of self-sovereign identity and increase confidence in an identity system that let the subjects present verifiable credentials that carried reliable attributes from many sources.</p><p>I've written previously about <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/08/life-like_identity_why_the_internet_needs_an_identity_metasystem.shtml">identity metasystems</a> that provide a framework for how identity transactions happen. Individual identity systems are built according to the architecture and protocols of the metasystem. Acceptance networks are an instantiation of the metasystem for a particular set of users and types of transactions. A metasystem for self-sovereign identity might have several acceptance networks operating in it to facilitate the operation of specific identity systems.</p> Problems an Acceptance Network Can Solve <p>To understand why an acceptance network is necessary to reduce risk and increase confidence in identity transactions, let's explore the gaps that exist without it. The following diagram shows the now familiar triangle of verifiable credential exchange. In this figure, issuers issue credentials to holders who may or may not be the subject of the credentials. The holder presents cryptographic proofs that assert the value of relevant attributes using one of more of the credentials that they hold. The verifier verifies the proof and uses the attributes.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d6a862b-3ed7-49da-872a-2d0bd818faab.heic">    </a>Verifiable Credential Exchange <p>Let's explore what it means for the verifier to verify the proof. The verifier wants to know a number of things about the credential presentation:</p>  <p>Were the credentials issued to the entity making the presentation?</p>  <p>Have any of the credentials been tampered with?</p>  <p>Have any of the credentials been revoked?</p>  <p>What are the schema for the credentials (to understand the data in them)?</p>  <p>Who issued the credentials in the proof?</p>  <p>The first four of these can be done cryptographically to provide confidence in the attestation. The technology behind the credential presentation is all that's necessary. They can be automated as part of the exchange. For example, the proof can contain pointers (e.g., DIDs) to the credential definitions. These could contain public keys for the credential and references to schema.</p><p>The last one—who issued the credential—is not a technical matter. To see why, imagine that Alice (as holder and subject) has been issued a credential from her university (the issuer) giving information about her educational experiences there. She's applying for a job and wants to present the credential to a prospective employer (the verifier). How does the employer know that Alice didn't just make the credential herself or buy it from a diploma mill?</p><p>Knowing who issued the credential is not something that can be done solely with technology (although it can help). The employer in this scenario wants more than an identifier for the issuer. And they want to know that the public key really does belong to the university. In short, the employer wants to resolve the identifier to other information that tells them something about the university and the credential. There are lots of ways to do that—people have been doing this sort of thing for centuries: states keep registries of businesses (universities are businesses), accreditation organizations keep registries of schools they've accredited, the Department of Education has registries of various institutions of higher education in the US, and so on.</p><p>The employer could make use of these by building its own database of university identifiers it trusts. And every time a new one shows up, they could investigate and add it to their registry (or not)2. But going back to the magic of the credit card scenario that I opened this article with, if every merchant had to keep their own registry of banks, the experience wouldn't be magical for me or the merchant. The financial acceptance network makes it easy for the merchant to have confidence that they'll be paid because they have not only technology, but processes, protocols, governance, and legal agreements that make the verification process automatable.</p> Acceptance Networks for Digital Identity <p>For some use cases, keeping your own registry of the issuers you trust works. But for many, it's just too much work and makes it difficult to make use of a variety of credentials. This kind of "localized trust" is unwieldy in an identity system that might involve millions of issuers and identifiers and credentials for billions or even trillions of subjects. I've written <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/metasystem">extensively about identity metasystems</a> and what they provide to help bridge the gap. This one, on <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/08/life-like_identity_why_the_internet_needs_an_identity_metasystem.shtml">how metasystems help provide life-like identity for digital systems</a> is perhaps the most comprehensive. Acceptance networks implement metasystems.</p><p>An acceptance network for digital identity must have a number of important properties, including the following:</p>  <p>Credentials are decentralized and contextual—There is no central authority for all credentials. Every party can be an issuer, a holder (identity owner), or a verifier. Verifiable credentials can be adapted to any country, any industry, any community, or any set of trust relationships.</p>  <p>Credential issuers decide on what data is contained in their credentials—Anyone can create a credential schema for their use case. Anyone can create a credential definition based on any of these schemas.</p>  <p>Verifiers make their own trust decisions about which credentials to accept—There's no central authority who determines what credentials are important or which are used for what purpose. The acceptance network supplies the technical underpinnings for credential exchange and support protocols for automating the verification of credential issuers.</p>  <p>Credential verifiers don't need to have any specific technical, contractual, or commercial relationship with credential issuers—Verifiers do not need to contact issuers to perform verification.</p>  <p>Credential holders are free to choose which credentials to carry and what information to disclose—People and organizations are in control of the credentials they hold (just as they are with physical credentials) and determine what to share with whom.</p>  <p>You may be thinking "but these are mostly about decentralized decision making." While it would be easier to imagine the acceptance network as a big directory, that solution can't possible support all the different ways people and organizations might want to use credentials. That doesn't mean an acceptance network couldn't be run by a single organization, like some financial services networks. Just that it has to support a variety of credential ecosystems running common protocols. I also think that there will be more than one and most issuers and verifiers will be part of several (again, like in financial services).</p> Structure of an Acceptance Network <p>One of the things we can take away from the architecture of financial services acceptance networks is that they are built in layers. No one has thought more about how this can work than Drummond Reed and the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Evolution-of-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-14.pdf">Trust Over IP Foundation</a> (ToIP).3 This figure, from ToIP, shows how such a stack works.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a05ffdb-511c-468a-a73a-edf99d54299c.heic">    </a>Trust Over IP Stack <p>The layers build on each other to provide something the lower level didn't. Layer 1 is the foundational functionality, like DID methods. Layer 2 builds on that to support creating digital relationships with anyone. Layer 3 uses those relationships to effect credential exchange. Layer 4 is the ecosystems that say things about the issuers for different use cases. The dual stack emphasizes the need for governance at every layer.</p><p>The acceptance network specifies the accepted protocols and technologies. The acceptance network also supports ecosystems, providing governance models and technology. The acceptance network is involved at each layer. Here are some examples of things an acceptance network might do at each layer:</p>  <p>Layer 1—limit the allowed DID methods and certify them.</p>  <p>Layer 2—require that wallets and agents using the network support specific versions of the DIDComm protocol. Provide a certification framework for wallet and agent vendors for security and interoperability.</p>  <p>Layer 3—require specific versions of the exchange protocols. Participate in protocol development. Provide a certification framework for specific implementations to aid with security and interoperability.</p>  <p>Layer 4—support the formation, certification, and discovery of credential ecosystem providers. Govern what is required to be a certified ecosystem provider and provide models for acceptable ecosystem governance.</p>  <p>As part of it's overall governance of the ecosystem, the acceptance network also provides model legal agreements for and between the various participants, trust mark rights (think of the Visa logo), and drives a uniform user experience.</p><p>The following diagram shows the credential exchange from the preceding figure with an acceptance network providing support to the verifier so that it can have confidence in the data the issuer has supplied through the holder.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f2b61c7-1e3c-4194-8354-49e5b9f84587.heic">    </a>Acceptance Network in Operation <p>Credential issuers who know their credential might be widely used would join one or more acceptance networks. They agree to follow the rules and regulations in the governance framework of the acceptance network. The acceptance network issues a credential to them that they can use to prove they are a member.4 The acceptance network maintains a registry—likely a registry of registries—that verifiers can use to discover information about the issuer of a credential that has been presented to them.</p> Using an Acceptance Network <p>Returning to our previous scenario, Alice holds a credential issued by her university. She presents it to a prospective employer who wants to know that the credential is from an accredited university. Alice's university has been accredited by an accreditation organization5. They have followed their process for accrediting Alice's university and issued it a credential. They have also added the university to their registry. The university and the accrediting organization are members of an acceptance network. The employer's systems know to automatically query the acceptance network when it received a credential proof from a issuer it does not know. Doing so provides the assurance that the issuer is legitimate. It could also provide information about the accreditation status of the university. This information reduces the risk that the employer would otherwise bear.</p><p>In this scenario, the employer is trusting the processes and structure of the acceptance network. The employer must decide which acceptance networks to use. This is much more scalable than having to make these determinations for every credential issuer. The acceptance network has allowed the verification process to scale and made the overall use of verifiable credentials easier and less risky.</p> A Note on Implementation <p>This discussion of acceptance networks has undoubtedly brought images to your mind about how it is structured or how to build one. The comparison to financial services acceptance networks points to a network run by an organization. And the term registrybrings to mind a database of some kind. Why these are certainly possibilities, I think it's also possible to imagine more decentralized solutions. For example, the registry could be a distributed ledger or blockchain. The governance is likely most easily done by an organization, but there are other options like a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The scenario I described above illustrates a federated system where certifying authorities for specific ecosystems determine their own methods, processes, and requirements, but link their registry to that of the acceptance network.</p> Conclusion <p>As I mentioned above, we've been solving the problem of how to know which institutions to trust for centuries. We have ways of knowing whether a university is accredited, whether a bank is real, whether a company is actually registered and what its reputation is. What is missing is an easy way to make use of this information digitally so that processes for reducing risk can be automated. Acceptance networks rationalize the process and provide the needed tooling to automate these checks. They reduce the many-to-many problem that exists when each verifier has to determine whether to trust each issuer with a more scalable many-to-several system. Acceptance networks allow credential presentation to scale by providing the needed infrastructure for giving verifiers confidence in the facts that holders present to them.</p>    Notes   <p>You can see in the linked post how we used trust to describe what we were building, even as we were reducing risk and inspiring confidence.</p>  <p>Note that this investigation could make use of technology. Knowing the universities name, they could look up a <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8615">well known location</a> on the universities web site to find the identifier. They could use PKI (digital certificates) to be sure they're talking to the right place. They could look up the university in an online registry of accredited universities.</p>  <p>Trust over IP isn't the only one working on this. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/demystifying-decentralized-identity-marie-wallace/?trackingId=dmcHrAqMST2EC8g%2F8F177w%3D%3D">Marie Wallace of Accenture</a> and <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/DVP/">Stephen Wilson of Lockstep Partners</a> have been writing about this idea.</p>  <p>Note that there could be different levels or types of members who perform different roles in the ecosystem and make different agreements.</p>  <p>An example is the <a href="https://nwccu.org/">Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities</a>.</p>  <p>Photo Credit: Data flowing over networks from DALL-e</p>

They gathered at IndieWebCamps in Portland, and at Homebrew Website Camp in San Francisco.</p><p>One could look at the movement as kind of a throwback to the very early web, which was a tapestry of wildly different sites and ideas, at a time when everybody’s online communications were templated through web services owned by a handful of billion dollar corporations. I’d prefer to think of it as a manifesto for diversity of communications, the freedom to share your knowledge and lived experiences on your own terms, and maintaining the independence of freedom of expression from business interests.</p><p>A decade and change later and the web landscape looks very different. It’s now clear to just about everyone that it’s harmful for all of our information to be filtered through a handful of services. From <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files">the Cambridge Analytica scandal</a> through <a href="https://time.com/6217730/myanmar-meta-rohingya-facebook/">Facebook’s culpability in the genocide against the Rohingya people in Myanmar</a>, it’s clear that allowing private businesses to own and control most of the ways we learn about the world around us is dangerous. And the examples keep piling up, story after story after story.</p><p>While these events have highlighted the dangers, the indieweb community has been highlighting the possibilities.&nbsp;The movement itself has grown from strength to strength: IndieWebCamps and Homebrew Website Clubs are now held all over the world. I’ve never made it to one of the European events – to my shame, it’s been years since I’ve even been able to make it to a US event – but the community is thriving and the outcomes have been productive.</p><p>Even before the advent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">the fediverse</a>, the indieweb community had built tools to allow websites to connect to each other as a kind of independent, decentralized social web. <a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention">Webmention</a>, in conjunction with <a href="https://indieweb.org/microformats">lightweight microformats that extended HTML to provide semantic hints about the purpose of content on a website</a>, allowed anyone to reply to any website article using a post on their own site – not just that, but they could RSVP to events, send a “like”, reshare it, or use verbs that don’t have analogies in the traditional social networks. The community also created <a href="https://indieweb.org/Micropub">micropub</a>, a simple API that makes it easy to build tools to help people publish to their websites, and a handful of other technologies that are becoming more and more commonplace.</p><p>In the wake of the decline of Twitter, <a href="https://werd.io/2024/we-need-your-email-address">Google’s turn towards an AI-driven erosion of the web</a>, and a splintering of social media, many publishers have realized that they need to build stronger, more direct relationships with their communities, and that they can’t trust social media companies to be the center of gravity of their brands and networks. For them, owning their own website has regained its importance, together with building unique experiences that help differentiate them, and allow them to publish stories on their own terms. These are truly indieweb principles, and serve as validation (if validation were needed) of the indieweb movement’s foundational assumptions.</p><p>But ultimately it’s not about business, or technology, or any one technique or facet of website-building. As Tantek says, it’s about building a social internet of people: a human network of gloriously diverse lived experiences, creative modes of expression, community affinities, and personalities. The internet has always been made of people, but it has not always been people-first. The indieweb reminds us that humanity is the most important thing, and that nobody should own our ability to connect, form relationships, express ourselves, be creative, learn from each other, and embrace our differences and similarities.</p><p>I’m deeply glad it exists.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://news.indieweb.org/en"> Also posted on IndieNews </a></p>

<p>"In order to combat the fracturing of social media platforms, a Google discoverability crisis fueled by AI generated spam and AI-fueled SEO, and a media business environment that is in utter freefall, we need to be able to reach our readers directly using a platform that we own and control."</p>

<p>For every publisher right now, email seems to be the only option. This is the first time I've seen this argument about AI scraping: usually the need to own your own relationship comes down to avoiding the thrash of different social media business models, which I've written about plenty of times before.</p>

<p>This idea that putting your content out there for free will only lead to it being rewritten by AI and repurposed by spam blogs could be the death of the open web. This is particularly true in light of Google's apparent refusal to downgrade machine-written content.</p>

<p>The idea is simple and awful: these spam sites rewrite human-written articles in an effort to capture search engine clicks themselves, instead of the people they stole from. They run ads against this spam. Because it's all machine-written, they can do it at scale.</p>

<p>Even if you don't agree that the web needs to be intrinsically protected (hi, we're enemies now), it seems obvious to me that incentives should be aligned towards publishing unique, useful information rather than superficially grabbing clicks through AI-driven SEO spam. I don't know what's going on inside the search engine businesses, but they need to consider what's going to be good for their businesses in the long term. This isn't it.  <a href="https://werd.io/tag/AI">#AI</a></p>

<p>I am sharing the following exchange by text upon the request of the other party involved. This is someone I became acquainted with on education issues and over the past year around how their state fits into the topics I research. I did a livestream following this exchange, relating aspects of my experience to recent findings from Michael Levin’s lab around group information fields and communication blocking.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure what human weather is and how linguistic concepts manipulate it, check out this short link:</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you’d like to check out the clips from the Levin lab on embryology and information fields I have a playlist of clips <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnNSjVGWqTO4Ho9XMq9W_-84JW4C4hVQJ">here</a>. Each one is super important.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnNSjVGWqTO4Ho9XMq9W_-84JW4C4hVQJ"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnNSjVGWqTO4Ho9XMq9W_-84JW4C4hVQJ"></a></p>
<p>Now in case you haven’t been following me for awhile, and you imagine I am excited about the prospect of using electrically engineered trachea cells to build swishy buildings in outer space, I’m not. In fact, I don’t support any of the work coming out of Levin’s lab or other biotechnology labs. My position at this time is that I seek to understand the concepts that are shaping the world around us, and the future, and demand that we have open, candid public conversations about the ethics of all of these things and how we should or should not proceed. Fair enough?</p>
<p>I don’t think I have to spend paragraphs or many minutes dramatizing my anger / fear / frustration over where we have landed as a culture. As far as I’m concerned, for me at least, that is a waste of valuable time. That said, if you feel directing your energy to that end is helpful, but all means don’t let me stop you. You do you, and I will do me, and if you are not into me or the insights I offer by all means move along to some other content creator. There’s something for everyone out there.</p>
<p>Below is a stream I did this week reflecting on our fraught exchange. At the time, I chose not to share the person’s name or the contents of our private exchange, because that wouldn’t have been proper. However, this person seems to believe that I misrepresented the conversation and requested I share the text exchange. So, in the spirit of openness I am honoring that request. Cheers to human weather, but I could use a little less turbulence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These were two comments left on my livestream. I want to point out that I do not expect this person will share my perspective. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>That said, I was also within my rights to remove myself from that emotional, energetic whirlwind. The commentary was very personally directed at me, and it was unkind. </p>
<p>My inclination, having researched the mechanics of the system, is that the words above are an example of how our inner worlds can be shaped by collective thought forms, Levin’s information fields. This is not to discount in any way the trauma we have all been through, the profound losses in all their myriad permutations. It is my opinion, that for me, staying in a negative energy state only serves the system’s goals. Therefore I am choosing for myself to continue with my research in a calm, level-headed way. If there are people out there who want to imagine that by stepping back from the outrage machine I am somehow agreeing to the plan, there’s nothing I can do about that. I am not about to transform myself to fit someone else’s idea of who they think I should be or what I should be doing. I will work hard not to try and force others to be who I might imagine they should be. Fair is fair.</p>
<p>We each have our own ways of being in the world. May we work towards fulfillment in ways that do not drag other people down. I have done that in the past myself. I recognize it, and I am trying to do better. We are all human. We are all learning. We all stumble. We all have grace. </p>
<p>Human weather can get ugly. Let us enjoy the clear, calm days when we have them.</p>
<p>In the exchange below, my comments are on the blue background. The other person’s comments are on the light gray background.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Substack shared above can be read <a href="https://devanneykathleen.substack.com/p/the-essential-you?utm_source=profile&amp;utm_medium=reader2">here</a>.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I will pause here and note I have NEVER said “some new medical paradigm will be better than the old.” NEVER. This is attributing opinions to me that are not mine, but something imagined in the head of the person texting. This is human weather.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It was a check-in when I was discussing piezoelectricity and radium and the Curies’ ties to the Society for Psychical Research.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Ok, so the above statement to me implied that the work I am doing is a luxury – “quite a few people don’t have the luxury to worry about metaphysical research.” In my mind I do this work knowing that people in precarity are likely unable to do it and that since I am able, I have a responsibility to do it and put the conversation out into the public sphere for discussion.</p>

  <p>I just released <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-13">LLM 0.13</a>, the latest version of my LLM command-line tool for working with Large Language Models - both via APIs and running models locally <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins/directory.html">using plugins</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/annotatedreleasenotes/">annotated release notes</a> for the new version.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Added support for new OpenAI embedding models: <code>3-small</code> and <code>3-large</code> and three variants of those with different dimension sizes, <code>3-small-512</code>, <code>3-large-256</code> and <code>3-large-1024</code>. See <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/openai-models.html#openai-models-embedding">OpenAI embedding models</a> for details. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/394">#394</a>
 
 
</blockquote>
<p>The original inspiration for shipping a new release was OpenAI's announcement of new models yesterday: <a href="https://openai.com/blog/new-embedding-models-and-api-updates">New embedding models and API updates</a>.</p>
<p>I wrote a guide to embeddings in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Oct/23/embeddings/">Embeddings: What they are and why they matter</a>. Until recently the only available OpenAI embedding model was <code>ada-002</code> - released in December 2022 and now feeling a little bit old in the tooth.</p>
<p>The new <code>3-small</code> model is similar to <code>ada-002</code> but massively less expensive (a fifth of the price) and with higher benchmark scores.</p>
<p><code>3-large</code> has even higher benchmark, but also produces much bigger vectors. Where <code>ada-002</code> and <code>3-small</code> produce 1536-dimensional vectors, <code>3-large</code> produces 3072 dimensions!</p>
<p>Each dimension corresponds to a floating point number in the array of numbers produced when you embed a piece of content. The more numbers, the more storage space needed for those vectors and the longer any cosine-similarity calculations will take against them.</p>
<p>Here's where things get really interesting though: since people often want to trade quality for smaller vector size, OpenAI now support a way of having their models return much smaller vectors.</p>
<p>LLM doesn't yet have a mechanism for passing options to embedding models (unlike language models which can take <code>-o setting value</code> options), but I still wanted to make the new smaller sizes available.</p>
<p>That's why I included <code>3-small-512</code>, <code>3-large-256</code> and <code>3-large-1024</code>: those are variants of the core models hard-coded to the specified vector size.</p>
<p>In the future I'd like to support options for embedding models, but this is a useful stop-gap.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 The default <code>gpt-4-turbo</code> model alias now points to <code>gpt-4-turbo-preview</code>, which uses the most recent OpenAI GPT-4 turbo model (currently <code>gpt-4-0125-preview</code>). <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/396">#396</a>
 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Also announced yesterday - <code>gpt-4-0125-preview</code> is the latest version of the GPT-4 model which, according to OpenAI, "completes tasks like code generation more thoroughly than the previous preview model and is intended to reduce cases of “laziness” where the model doesn’t complete a task".</p>
<p>This is technically a breaking change - the <code>gpt-4-turbo</code> LLM alias used to point to the older model, but now points to OpenAI's <code>gpt-4-turbo-preview</code> alias which in turn points to the latest model.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 New OpenAI model aliases <code>gpt-4-1106-preview</code> and <code>gpt-4-0125-preview</code>. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>These aliases let you call those models explicitly:</p>
  llm -m gpt-4-0125-preview 'Write a lot of code without being lazy'  
<blockquote>
 
 OpenAI models now support a <code>-o json_object 1</code> option which will cause their output to be returned as a valid JSON object. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/373">#373</a>
 
 
</blockquote>
<p>This is a fun feature, which uses an OpenAI option that claims to guarantee valid JSON output.</p>
<p>Weirdly you have to include the word "json" in your prompt when using this or OpenAI will return an error!</p>
  llm -m gpt-4-turbo \
  '3 names and short bios for pet pelicans in JSON' \
  -o json_object 1  
<p>That returned the following for me just now:</p>
  {
  "pelicans": [
    {
      "name": "Gus",
      "bio": "Gus is a curious young pelican with an insatiable appetite for adventure. He's known amongst the dockworkers for playfully snatching sunglasses. Gus spends his days exploring the marina and is particularly fond of performing aerial tricks for treats."
    },
    {
      "name": "Sophie",
      "bio": "Sophie is a graceful pelican with a gentle demeanor. She's become somewhat of a local celebrity at the beach, often seen meticulously preening her feathers or posing patiently for tourists' photos. Sophie has a special spot where she likes to watch the sunset each evening."
    },
    {
      "name": "Captain Beaky",
      "bio": "Captain Beaky is the unofficial overseer of the bay, with a stern yet endearing presence. As a seasoned veteran of the coastal skies, he enjoys leading his flock on fishing expeditions and is always the first to spot the fishing boats returning to the harbor. He's respected by both his pelican peers and the fishermen alike."
    }
  ]
}

<p>A neat suggestion from Christopher Bare.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Documented <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/setup.html#homebrew-warning">a pattern</a> for installing plugins that depend on PyTorch using the Homebrew version of LLM, despite Homebrew using Python 3.12 when PyTorch have not yet released a stable package for that Python version. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/397">#397</a>
 
 
</blockquote>
<p>LLM is packaged <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/llm">for Homebrew</a>. The Homebrew package upgraded to Python 3.12 a while ago, which caused surprising problems because it turned out <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> - a dependency of some LLM plugins - <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/110436">doesn't have a stable build out for 3.12 yet</a>.</p>
<p>Christian Bush <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/315#issuecomment-1879741434">shared a workaround</a> in an LLM issue thread, which I've now added to the documentation.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Underlying OpenAI Python library has been upgraded to <code>&gt;1.0</code>. It is possible this could cause compatibility issues with LLM plugins that also depend on that library. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/325">#325</a>
 
 
</blockquote>
<p>This was the bulk of the work. OpenAI released their 1.0 Python library <a href="https://github.com/openai/openai-python/discussions/742">a couple of months ago</a> and it had a large number of breaking changes compared to the previous release.</p>
<p>At the time I pinned LLM to the previous version to paper over the breaks, but this meant you could not install LLM in the same environment as some other library that needed the more recent OpenAI version.</p>
<p>There were a lot of changes! You can find a blow by blow account of the upgrade in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/pull/400">my pull request</a> that bundled the work.</p>

<p>The recipe for doing this is so weird:</p>
 import readline
readline.parse_and_bind("\\e[D: backward-char")
readline.parse_and_bind("\\e[C: forward-char") 
<p>I <a href="https://fedi.simonwillison.net/@simon/111824341410250812">asked on Mastodon</a> if anyone knows of a less obscure solution, but it looks like that might be the best we can do!</p>
<blockquote>
 
 
<code>LLM_OPENAI_SHOW_RESPONSES=1</code> environment variable now outputs much more detailed information about the HTTP request and response made to OpenAI (and OpenAI-compatible) APIs. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/404">#404</a>
 
 
</blockquote>
<p>This feature worked prior to the OpenAI &gt;1.0 upgrade by tapping in to some <code>requests</code> internals. OpenAI dropped <code>requests</code> for <code>httpx</code> so I had to rebuild this feature from scratch.</p>
<p>I ended up getting a TIL out of it: <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/httpx/openai-log-requests-responses">Logging OpenAI API requests and responses using HTTPX</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Dropped support for Python 3.7. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>I wanted to stop seeing <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/378">a pkg_resources related warning</a>, which meant switching to Python 3.8's <code>importlib.medata</code>. Python 3.7 hit end-of-life for support <a href="https://devguide.python.org/versions/">back in June 2023</a> so I think this is an OK change to make.</p>

Gen. Timothy Haugh. In a similar disclosure in 2021, Wyden revealed that the Defense Intelligence Agency had purchased commercially available smartphone location data without a warrant.</p></blockquote><p>A few different tools are available to highlight software that tracks you across the websites you visit. The Markup’s <a href="https://themarkup.org/blacklight">Blacklight</a> tests any individual website; the EFF’s <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/privacy-badger">Privacy Badger</a> claims to protect your browser as you visit websites; <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> has built-in privacy as standard. For the average user, however, the advantages might not be so obvious: so what if some firm I’ve never heard of sets a cookie in my browser? What does it matter that Google can see me? After all, they already have my search history.</p><p>While we can make tracking software visible, it’s harder to understand who the customers of this tracking data actually are. And that matters a lot, because that’s how your data is actually getting used. The companies that run the trackers are middlemen trying to make a profit; they’re interested in tracking you as well as possible. The real question is why you’re being tracked. Who has a use case for your information?</p><p>Some of those use cases are relatively benign: box stores trying to understand what they should advertise to you, for example. But those customers also include law enforcement and the security services, who have found that they can discover information that would ordinarily necessitate obtaining a warrant <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/552105-putting-a-price-on-privacy-ending-police-data-purchases/">simply by paying a data broker for it</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59756">H.R. 4639, the Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act</a>, which would ban this practice, was introduced in Congress last year. That’s a start, but it wasn’t voted on, let alone passed. There’s a long legislative road ahead before we see rules barring warrantless surveillance through data brokers.</p><p>Even if you feel like you’ve got nothing to hide, consider that this puts you in a privileged group. I like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36ru89/comment/crglgh2/">Edward Snowden’s comment on the right to privacy</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say. A free press benefits more than just those who read the paper.</p></blockquote><p>For example, consider a pregnant person who is trying to find information about finding an abortion. Those searches — or carrying a cellphone with location services enabled that contains apps which report location in the background while visiting a reproductive health clinic — create a trail of internet traffic that could potentially be obtained by law enforcement in a state that disallows abortions. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/16/google-keeps-location-history-data-abortion-clinics-despite-delete-pledge">That information exists, despite claims by Google and others that it would be deleted to avoid this situation</a>:</p><blockquote><p>A year and a half has passed since Google first pledged to delete all location data on users’ visits to abortion clinics with minimal progress. The move would have made it harder for law enforcement to use that information to investigate or prosecute people seeking abortions in states where the procedure has been banned or otherwise limited. Now, a new study shows Google still retains location history data in 50% of cases.</p></blockquote><p>A few years ago, it emerged that <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqm5x/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x">a branch of the military was buying data from Muslim prayer apps</a>. Back then, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqm5x/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x">developers admitted that they had no idea who was buying the data</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Some app developers Motherboard spoke to were not aware who their users' location data ends up with, and even if a user examines an app's privacy policy, they may not ultimately realize how many different industries, companies, or government agencies are buying some of their most sensitive data.</p></blockquote><p>While blocking trackers is absolutely a way to protect user privacy, I believe these events point to a need for privacy policies to identify the people and organizations who actively purchase data (both directly and at the data broker level). That means data brokers need to be far more transparent with the websites and software developers they partner with, so that they, in turn, can be more transparent with their users.</p><p>It’s clearly not something that would happen without legislation: given the optics and public sentiment around surveillance, who would want to be seen to be purchasing peoples’ private information? But adding sunlight to a mix of privacy protections that also include purchasing restrictions on government and technical restrictions on trackers can only be helpful.</p><p>While we certainly should care about how our activity is tracked, we all really care about who has access to our private information. We should have the right to find out.</p>

<p>"In 2018, the indie women’s website The Hairpin stopped publishing, along with its sister site The Awl. This year, The Hairpin has been Frankensteined back into existence and stuffed with slapdash AI-generated articles designed to attract search engine traffic."</p>

<p>This is one of the worst kinds of AI-generated spam: a real, much-missed website has been purchased and spun into an LLM fever dream. It's now just a part of a Serbian DJ's thousands-deep portfolio of spam sites.</p>

<p>But the point made in the article about succession planning is really important. Media properties should be thoughtful about what happens to their domains once they've outlived their usefulness - even if the owner has shuttered completely. Otherwise anyone can scoop up the domain and abuse the goodwill built by its former owner for any purpose they like.</p>

<p>This is particularly true for journalism publishers. I recommend that they never let their domains expire for this reason, even if they've fully fallen out of use. You never know who might pick them up and abuse the trust of their community.  <a href="https://werd.io/tag/AI">#AI</a></p>

   Did an AI write that hour-long “George Carlin” special? I’m not convinced. 
 Two weeks ago "Dudesy", a comedy podcast which claims to be controlled and written by an AI, released an extremely poor taste hour long YouTube video called "George Carlin: I’m Glad I’m Dead".

<p>Two weeks ago "Dudesy", a comedy podcast which claims to be controlled and written by an AI, released an extremely poor taste hour long YouTube video called "George Carlin: I’m Glad I’m Dead". They used voice cloning to produce a stand-up comedy set featuring the late George Carlin, claiming to also use AI to write all of the content after training it on everything in the Carlin back catalog.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly this has resulted in a massive amount of angry coverage, including from Carlin's own daughter (the Carlin estate have filed a lawsuit). Resurrecting people without their permission is clearly abhorrent.</p>

<p>But... did AI even write this? The author of this piece, Kyle Orland, started digging in.</p>

<p>It turns out the Dudesy podcast has been running with this premise since it launched in early 2022 - long before any LLM was capable of producing a well-crafted joke. The structure of the Carlin set goes way beyond anything I've seen from even GPT-4. And in a follow-up podcast episode, Dudesy co-star Chad Kultgen gave an O. J. Simpson-style "if I did it" semi-confession that described a much more likely authorship process.</p>

<p>I think this is a case of a human-pretending-to-be-an-AI - an interesting twist, given that the story started out being about an-AI-imitating-a-human.</p>

<p>I consulted with Kyle on this piece, and got a couple of neat quotes in there:</p>

<p>"Either they have genuinely trained a custom model that can generate jokes better than any model produced by any other AI researcher in the world... or they're still doing the same bit they started back in 2022"</p>

<p>"The real story here is… everyone is ready to believe that AI can do things, even if it can't. In this case, it's pretty clear what's going on if you look at the wider context of the show in question. But anyone without that context, [a viewer] is much more likely to believe that the whole thing was AI-generated… thanks to the massive ramp up in the quality of AI output we have seen in the past 12 months."</p>

<p>Update 27th January 2024: The NY Times confirmed via a spokesperson for the podcast that the entire special had been written by Chad Kultgen, not by an AI.</p>

Looking into the windows of a living room in an Amsterdam houseboat floating on a canal.
<p>Eight years ago I was <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-societal-justification-for-privacy">asked on Quora</a> to answer the question “What is the social justification for privacy?” <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-societal-justification-for-privacy/answer/Doc-Searls">This was my answer</a>.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Society is comprised of individuals, thick with practices and customs that respect individual needs. Privacy is one of those. Only people who live naked outdoors without clothing and shelter can do without privacy. The rest of us all have ways of expressing and guarding spaces we call “private” — and that others respect as well.</p>
<p>Private spaces are virtual as well as physical. Society would not exist without well-established norms for expressing and respecting each other’s boundaries. “Good fences make good neighbors,” says Robert Frost.</p>
<p>One would hardly ask to justify the need for privacy before the Internet came along; but it is a question now because the virtual world, like nature in the physical one, doesn’t come with privacy. By nature, we are naked in both. The difference is that we’ve had many millennia to work out privacy in the physical world, and approximately two decades to do the same in the virtual one. That’s not enough time.</p>
<p>In the physical world, we get privacy from clothing and shelter, plus respect for each others’ boundaries, which are established by mutual understandings of what’s private and what’s not. All of these are both complex and subtle. Clothing, for example, customarily covers what we (in English vernacular at least) call our “privates,” but also allows us selectively to expose parts of our bodies, in various ways and degrees, depending on social setting, weather and other conditions. Privacy in our sheltered spaces is also modulated by windows, doors, shutters, locks, blinds, and curtains. How these signal intentions differ by culture and setting, but within each the signals are well understood, and boundaries are respected. Some of these are expressed in law as well as custom. In sum, they comprise civilized life.</p>
<p>Yet life online is not yet civilized. We still lack sufficient means for expressing and guarding private spaces, for putting up boundaries, for signaling intentions to each other, and for signaling back respect for those signals. In the absence of those we also lack sufficient custom and law. Worse, laws created in the physical world do not all comprehend a virtual one in which all of us, everywhere in the world, are by design zero distance apart — and at costs that yearn toward zero as well. This is still very new to human experience.</p>
<p>In the absence of restricting customs and laws it is easy for those with the power to&nbsp;penetrate our private spaces (such as our browsers and email clients) to do so. This is why our private spaces online today are infected with tracking files that report our activities back to others we have never met and don’t know. These practices would never be sanctioned in the physical world, but in the uncivilized virtual world they are easy to rationalize: Hey, it’s easy to do, everybody does it, it’s normative now, transparency is a Good Thing, it helps fund “free” sites and services, nobody is really harmed, and so on.</p>
<p>But it’s not okay. Just because something can be done doesn’t mean it should be done, or that it’s the right thing to do. Nor is it right because it is, for now, normative, or because everybody seems to put up with it.&nbsp;The only reason people continue to put up with it is because they have little choice — so far.</p>
<p>Study after study shows that people are highly concerned about their privacy online, and vexed by their limited ability to do anything about its absence. For example —</p>
 
 <a title="www.pewinternet.org" href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/05/20/americans-attitudes-about-privacy-security-and-surveillance/">Pew reports</a>&nbsp;that “93% of adults say that being in control of&nbsp;who&nbsp;can get information about them is important,” that “90% say that controlling&nbsp;what&nbsp;information is collected about them is important,” that 93% “also value having the ability to share confidential matters with another trusted person,” that “88% say it is important that they not have someone watch or listen to them without their permission,” and that 63% “feel it is important to be able to “go around in public without always being identified.” 
 <a title="www.truste.com" href="https://www.truste.com/resources/privacy-research/us-consumer-confidence-index-2015/">Ipsos, on behalf of TRUSTe, reports</a>&nbsp;that “92% of U.S. Internet users worry about their privacy online,” that “91% of U.S. Internet users say they avoid companies that do not protect their privacy,” “22% don’t trust anyone to protect their online privacy,” that “45% think online privacy is more important than national security,” that 91% “avoid doing business with companies who I do not believe protect my privacy online,” that “77% have moderated their online activity in the last year due to privacy concerns,” and that, in sum, “Consumers want transparency, notice and choice in exchange for trust.” 
 <a title="customercommons.org" href="http://customercommons.org/2013/05/08/lying-and-hiding-in-the-name-of-privacy/">Customer Commons reports</a>&nbsp;that “A large percentage of&nbsp;individuals&nbsp;employ artful dodges to&nbsp;avoid giving&nbsp;out&nbsp;requested&nbsp;personal information&nbsp;online&nbsp;when they believe at least some of that information is not&nbsp;required.” Specifically, “Only&nbsp;8.45% of respondents reported that they always accurately disclose&nbsp;personal&nbsp;information that is requested of them.&nbsp;The remaining 91.55%&nbsp;reported that they&nbsp;are&nbsp;less than fully disclosing.” 
 <a title="www.asc.upenn.edu" href="https://www.asc.upenn.edu/news-events/news/americans-resigned-giving-their-data-new-asc-findings-suggest">The Annenberg School for Communications at the University of Pennsylvania reports</a>&nbsp;that “a majority of Americans are resigned to giving up their data—and that is why many appear to be engaging in tradeoffs.” Specifically, “91% disagree (77% of them strongly) that ‘If companies give me a&nbsp;discount, it is a fair exchange for&nbsp;them to collect information about me without my knowing.'” And “71% disagree (53% of them strongly)&nbsp;that ‘It’s fair for an online or&nbsp;physical store to monitor what I’m&nbsp;doing online when I’m there, in exchange for letting me use the store’s wireless internet, or Wi-Fi,&nbsp;without charge.'” 
 
<p>There are both policy and market responses to these findings. On the policy side, Europe has laws protecting personal data that go back to the&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Directive">Data Protection Directive</a>&nbsp;of 1995. Australia has&nbsp;<a title="www.comlaw.gov.au" href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/F2013L02126">similar</a>&nbsp;laws going&nbsp;<a title="www.oaic.gov.au" href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy-law/privacy-act/">back to 1988</a>.&nbsp;On the market side, Apple now has a strong pro-privacy stance, posted&nbsp;<a title="www.apple.com" href="http://www.apple.com/privacy/">Privacy – Apple</a>, taking the form of an open letter to the world from CEO Tim Cook. One excerpt:</p>
<p>“Our business model is very straightforward: We sell great products. We don’t build a profile based on your email content or web browsing habits to sell to advertisers. We don’t ‘monetize’ the information you store on your iPhone or in iCloud. And we don’t read your email or your messages to get information to market to you. Our software and services are designed to make our devices better. Plain and simple.”</p>
<p>But we also need tools that serve us as personally as do our own clothes. And we’ll get them. The collection of&nbsp;<a title="cyber.law.harvard.edu" href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/projectvrm/VRM_Development_Work">developers listed here</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a title="projectvrm.org" href="http://projectvrm.org/">ProjectVRM</a>&nbsp;are all working on tools that give individuals ways of operating privately in the networked world. The most successful of those today are the ad and tracking blockers&nbsp;<a title="cyber.law.harvard.edu" href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/projectvrm/VRM_Development_Work#Privacy_Protection">listed under Privacy Protection</a>. According to&nbsp;<a title="blog.pagefair.com" href="https://blog.pagefair.com/2015/ad-blocking-report/">the latest PageFair/Adobe study</a>, the population of persons blocking ads online passed 200 million in June of 2015, with a 42% annual increase in the U.S. and an 82% rate in the U.K. alone.</p>
<p>These tools create and guard private spaces in our online lives by&nbsp;<a title="www.technologyreview.com" href="http://www.technologyreview.com/review/544371/the-end-of-internet-advertising-as-weve-known-it/">giving us ways to set boundaries and exclude unwanted intrusions</a>. These are primitive systems, so far, but they do work and are sure to evolve. As they do, expect the online world to become as civilized as the offline one — eventually.</p>

<p>Heute hat <a href="https://www.ftm.eu/articles/ashton-kutcher-s-anti-childabuse-software-below-par?share=o414YtV7sCD9hIzoI0Z%2Bm%2FqWx7Zfzf9sFphkdNxHwFErU4Wb%2FlIGzD4oikcCUTM%3D">“Follow the money” Lobbydokumente des Chatkontrolle-Dienstleisters Thorn veröffentlicht, welche die EU-Kommission teilweise vor der Öffentlichkeit geheim zu halten versucht hatte.</a> Die durchgesickerten Dokumente lassen Zweifel an öffentlichen Behauptungen zur Begründung des Gesetzentwurfs zur Chatkontrolle aufkommen. Dr. Patrick Breyer, Mitglied des Europäischen Parlaments für die Piratenpartei und prominentester Gegner der Chatkontrolle, kommentiert:</p>



<p>“Im Zuge des Chatcontrolgate wurde aufgedeckt, dass hinter dem Angriff der von der Leyen-Kommission auf Briefgeheimnis und sichere Verschlüsselung ein internationaler überwachungsbehördlich-industrieller Komplex steckt. Bis heute behindert die Kommission die Rekonstruktion der Wahrheit über diesen Skandal, indem sie Beweisdokumente zurückhält. Aus den heutigen Enthüllungen geht hervor, dass die Lobbydokumente von Thorn entgegen den Verschleierungsversuchen der Kommission mitnichten Geschäftsgeheimnisse enthalten, sondern wegen ihres für die Überwachungspläne der Kommission unbequemen Inhalts vertuscht werden sollten. Ich weiß von weiteren, bis heute zurückgehaltenen Dokumenten. Der LIBE-Ausschuss fordert gerade auf unsere Initiative Einsicht.</p>



<p>Es ist völlig unrealistisch, die Chatkontrolle-KI auf eine Genauigkeit von 99,9 % einzustellen, wie Thorn der Politik einzuflüstern versucht. Erst im Dezember hat <a href="https://video.consilium.europa.eu/event/en/27239">Innenkommissarin Johansson öffentlich eingeräumt, dass nur jedes vierte durch die Chatkontrolle geleakte intime Foto und Video polizeilich relevant ist.</a> Wir beobachten also in der Praxis zu 75 % falsch-positive Ergebnisse, nicht zu 0,1%. Auch der Gesetzentwurf der EU-Kommission zur Chatkontrolle verlangt in keiner Weise eine Zuverlässigkeit der Überwachungsalgorithmen von 99,9 %. Der Industrie stünde es frei, die derzeitigen Algorithmen zu verwenden, die unsere Polizei mit meist legalen intimen Fotos überschwemmen.</p>



<p>Wir wissen jetzt, dass <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24361448-false-positive-mitigation-se?responsive=1&amp;title=1">Thorn Lobbyarbeit gegen demokratische Auflagen an seine unzuverlässige Überwachungstechnologie lobbyiert und sie als “übermäßig präskriptiv” diskreditiert.</a> Im Europäischen Parlament setzen wir uns dafür ein, dass unabhängige und öffentlich zugängliche Audits für jede verwendete Technologie vorgeschrieben werden. Klar ist aber: Keine Technologie kann zuverlässig zwischen einvernehmlichem Sexting und dem Austausch strafrechtlich relevanten Materials unterscheiden, was zu einer massiven Kriminalisierung von Teenagern durch die Chatkontrolle führt.</p>



<p> Thorn lobbyiert ebenso wie die EU-Kommission für ein Aushebeln sicherer Ende-zu-Ende-Verschlüsselung privater Nachrichten mithilfe von Überwachungsalgorithmen auf jedem Smartphone (client-side scanning). Das widerspricht den Feststellungen der eigenen Experten der EU-Kommission, die <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=SWD:2022:0209:FIN:EN:PDF">in der Folgenabschätzung zum Gesetzentwurf</a> (S. 296) wie folgt zitiert werden: Die Experten stufen den Datenschutz der empfohlenen Methode “geräteinternes Hashing mit serverseitigem Abgleich” als “mittelmäßig bis gering” ein und warnen, dass die Methode “Schwachstellen einführen könnte, die den Datenschutz der Kommunikation beeinträchtigen könnten”. Auch die Sicherheit dieses Ansatzes wird als “mittelmäßig bis gering” eingestuft, wobei davor gewarnt wird, dass technisch versierte Straftäter wie die organisierten Kriminellen, die Missbrauchsmaterial produzieren und Missbrauch begehen, einfach zu einem anderen Messenger wechseln könnten.</p>



<p>Die Öffentlichkeit wird entsetzt sein zu erfahren, dass Thorn vorschlägt, Anti-Verschlüsselungsgesetze über den sexuellen Missbrauch von Kindern hinaus anzuwenden, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24361450-encryption-se?responsive=1&amp;title=1">da der Zweck des Scannens verschlüsselter Nachrichten “viel breiter als ein einziges Verbrechen” sein könnte.</a> Dafür setzt sich auch Europol ein – zwei ehemalige Europol-Beamte haben sich Thorn nicht ohne Grund angeschlossen. Wenn es dem internationalen überwachungsbehördlich-industriellen Komplex einmal gelingt, sichere Verschlüsselung auszuhebeln, werden sie unsere persönlichen Nachrichten schon bald auch nach Terrorismus, Filesharing und politischen Inhalten scannen wollen. Diese Enthüllung gibt unserem Kampf um das digitale Briefgeheimnis und sichere Verschlüsselung neuen Auftrieb.”</p>



<p>Aktuell <a href="https://ccianet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Joint-call-on-policymakers-to-swiftly-adopt-the-Interim-Regulation-on-ePrivacy-derogation.pdf">fordert</a> das überwachungsbehördlich-industrielle Netzwerk einschließlich der Dachorganisation WeProtect, in der auch Thorn Mitglied ist, die Verlängerung der verdachtslosen Chatkontrolle auf freiwilliger Basis durch US-Internetkonzerne, die eigentlich Mitte des Jahres auslaufen sollte. Der LIBE-Innenausschuss des Europäischen Parlaments soll nächsten Montag darüber abstimmen.</p>

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72177720314295263/"></a>No, an AI did not paint this. It’s the West Baden Springs Hotel, which I shot with a camera while gawking at it for the first time.
<p>In the summer of ’22 we were still new to Indiana and in an exploring mood. Out of nowhere one afternoon my wife said, “Let’s go check out French Lick.” She just liked the name of the town, plus the idea of taking a half-day road trip under a sweet blue sky and big puffy clouds. I said “Sure,” because I’m a basketball fan and supposed there would be a Larry Bird museum or something like it in his hometown. (Turns out there isn’t, but never mind that.)</p>
<p>Southern Indiana would be part of Kentucky if the Ohio River didn’t inconvenience that option. It’s hilly, and the natives have Southern accents. They say CEment and INsurance. (You know, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/0Za_6octDdI">like Larry Bird</a>.) About halfway down the roads from Bloomington to French Lick, Google took us off the highway onto a twisty hypotenuse through deep woods and lumpy farmland, away from the hard right angle the boring main route would take at the city of Paoli (home of <a href="https://www.paolipeaks.com/">Indiana’s only ski slopes</a>). This shortcut ended where the going got flat and we turned right onto a highway called 150. Then, in a short distance, we drove under a serious-looking <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/b7TqUWeXaCws7Ut59">arch that announced WEST BADEN SPRINGS</a>. It might also have said ALMOST FRENCH LICK, because that’s what Google Maps told us. We were less than a mile away. After the arch, the edge of a town appeared straight ahead, but that scene was totally upstaged by the one on the right.</p>
<p>My wife and I both gasped. I said, “What the fuck is THAT?” My wife said “Wow!”</p>
<p>Suddenly we were … where? Spain? France? Croatia? There, under that perfect sky sat a beautiful giant resort-like structure that was obviously old, grand, well-maintained, and set among smaller structures just as old and nearly as grand, on a wide expanse of green.</p>
<p>A few hundred feet farther came this entrance on the right:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The only Carlsbads we knew were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlsbad,_California">the town</a> in California and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlsbad_Caverns_National_Park">the caverns</a> in Arizona New Mexico. And all we knew about West Baden Springs was what that arch had just told us.</p>
<p>Of course, we couldn’t wait to get inside this thing, whatever it was. Here’s what we saw:</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Wow” doesn’t cover it. Nor do the many views of what turns out to have been—and still is—the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Baden_Springs_Hotel">West Baden Springs Hotel</a>, which I’ve put in <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72177720314295263/with/53482712062">this album here</a>.

<p>Nachdem die EU-Pläne zur verpflichtenden Durchleuchtung privater Kommunikation und Aufhebung sicherer Verschlüsselung (Chatkontrolle 2.0) mangels Mehrheit im EU-Rat vorerst auf Eis liegen, wurde letzte Woche bekannt, <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/spd-will-freiwillige-chatkontrolle-durch-big-tech-konzerne-verlaengern/">dass die Parlamentsberichterstatterin Birgit Sippel (SPD) einer Verlängerung der bestehenden freiwilligen verdachtslosen Chatkontrolle mit kleineren Änderungen zustimmen will.</a> Der Europaabgeordnete und profilierteste Gegner der Chatkontrolle Dr. Patrick Breyer (Piratenpartei), zugleich Verhandlungsführer seiner Fraktion, <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/COM20230777_22-01-2024_15.20.58.pdf">hat gestern abend Änderungsanträge eingereicht. Danach soll die freiwillige Chatkontrolle enden, da diese verfassungswidrig ist. </a>Dies wird von mehreren Rechtsgutachten, u. a. in der alternativen Folgenabschätzung des EPRS, des Juristischen Dienstes des Rates und in einer Studie der ehemaligen EuGH-Richterin Ninon Colneric bestätigt.</p>



<p>Bisher ist die von US-Konzernen wie Meta, Google und Microsoft eigenmächtig praktizierte Chatkontrolle privater Nachrichten über Instagram Messenger, Facebook Messenger, GMail und XBox bis zum 3. August 2024 befristet. Breyer kommentiert:<br>  „Statt den neuen Vorschlag des EU-Parlaments zu einem wirksameren und gerichtsfesten Kinderschutz ohne Chatkontrolle aufzugreifen, beharrt EU-Kommissarin ‚Big Sister‘ Johansson unverbesserlich auf einer Zerstörung des digitalen Briefgeheimnisses, spielt auf Zeit und hofft kritische EU-Staaten mit infamen Kampagnen und Falschinformationen zur Zustimmung zu manipulieren. Diesen Machenschaften sollten wir eine klare Absage erteilen und auf den vom Parlament vorgeschlagenen Lösungen ohne Massenüberwachung bestehen.“</p>



<p>Breyer kritisiert das Instrument der freiwilligen Chatkontrolle scharf: „Die freiwillige Massenüberwachung unserer persönlichen Nachrichten und Fotos durch US-Dienste wie Meta, Google oder Microsoft leistet keinen signifikanten Beitrag zur Rettung missbrauchter Kinder oder Überführung von Missbrauchtätern, sondern kriminalisiert umgekehrt tausende Minderjähriger, überlastet Strafverfolger und öffnet einer willkürlichen Privatjustiz der Internetkonzerne Tür und Tor. Wenn nach Johanssons eigenen Angaben nur jede vierte Meldung überhaupt für die Polizei relevant ist, bedeutet das für Deutschland Jahr für Jahr 75.000 ausgeleitete intime Strandfotos und Nacktbilder, die bei unbekannten Moderatoren im Ausland nicht sicher sind und in deren Händen nichts zu suchen haben.“</p>



<p>„Die Verordnung zur freiwilligen Chatkontrolle ist sowohl unnötig als auch grundrechtswidrig: Die sozialen Netzwerke als Hostingdienste brauchen zur Überprüfung öffentlicher Posts keine Verordnung. Dasselbe gilt für Verdachtsmeldungen durch Nutzer. Und die fehleranfälligen automatisierten Meldungen aus der Durchleuchtung privater Kommunikation durch Zuckerbergs Meta-Konzern, die 80% der Chatmeldungen ausmachen, werden durch die angekündigte Einführung von Ende-zu-Ende-Verschlüsselung ohnehin entfallen. Das <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Legal-Opinion-Screening-for-child-pornography-2021-03-04_incl_Logos.pdf">Rechtsgutachten einer ehemaligen EuGH-Richterin belegt</a>, dass die freiwillige Chatkontrolle als verdachtslose und flächendeckende Überwachungsmaßnahme grundrechtswidrig ist. Ein <a href="https://freiheitsrechte.org/themen/freiheit-im-digitalen/chatkontrolle_facebook">Missbrauchsbetroffener</a> und i<a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/facebook-verteidigt-flaechendeckende-nachrichten-und-chatkontrolle-vor-gericht/">ch</a> klagen dagegen. Und das Digitalministerium hat bestätigt, <a href="https://nextcloud.pp-eu.eu/index.php/s/55j8LrGR4qGEfJs">dass die Ausnahmeverordnung eine freiwillige Chatkontrolle in Deutschland überhaupt nicht möglich macht.“</a></p>



<p> Der Innenausschuss (LIBE) soll die Fortsetzung der freiwilligen Chatkontrolle bereits am 29. Januar billigen. Mit dem Rat will sich das Parlament in der zweiten Februarwoche einig werden, und abgesegnet werden soll die Verlängerung kurz danach.</p>



<p>Unterdessen sollen die EU-Innenminister nach der Planung der belgischen Ratspräsidentschaft im März erneut über die Einführung der für alle Anbieter verpflichtende Chatkontrolle 2.0 abstimmen.</p>

  Near year, new job. I accepted a new position at Tembo to work on improving
the PostgreSQL extension ecosystem full time.

<p>New year, new job.</p>
<p>I’m pleased to announce that I started a new job on January 2 at <a href="https://tembo.io/" title="Tembo: Goodbye Database Sprawl, Hello Postgres">Tembo</a>, a
fully-managed <a href="https://www.postgresql.org" title="PostgreSQL: The world's most advanced open source database">PostgreSQL</a> developer platform. Tembo <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/welcoming-david-wheeler" title="PGXN Creator David Wheeler Joins Tembo to Strengthen the Postgres Extension Ecosystem">blogged the news</a>, too.</p>
<p>I first heard from Tembo CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samay-sharma-b6465122" title="Samay Sharma - Chief Technology Officer - Tembo | LinkedIn">Samay Sharma</a> last summer, when he inquired about
the status of <a href="https://pgxn.org/" title="The PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a>, the PostgreSQL Extension Network, which I built in
2010–11. Tembo bundles extensions into Postgres <a href="https://tembo.io/docs/category/tembo-stacks/" title="Tembo Docs: Tembo Stacks">stacks</a>, which let developers
quickly spin up Postgres clusters with tools and features optimized for specific
use cases and workloads. The company therefore needs to provide a wide variety
of easy-to-install and well-documented extensions to power those use cases.
Could PGXN play a role?</p>
<p>I’ve tended to PGXN’s maintenance for the last fourteen years, and thanks in no
small part to hosting provided by <a href="https://www.depesz.com" title="select * from depesz;">depesz</a>. As of today’s <a href="https://pgxn.org/about/" title="About PGXN">stats</a> it distributes
376 extensions on behalf of 419 developers. PGXN has been a moderate success,
but Samay asked how we could collaborate to build on its precedent to improve
the extensions ecosystem overall.</p>
<p>It quickly became apparent that we share a vision for what that ecosystem could
become, including:</p>
 
 Establishing the canonical Postgres community index of extensions, something
PGXN has yet to achieve 
 Improving metadata standards to enable new patterns, such as automated binary
packaging 
 Working with the Postgres community to establish documentation standards
that encourage developers to provide comprehensive extension docs 
 Designing and building developer tools that empower more developers to
build, test, distribute, and maintain extensions 
 
<p>Over the the past decade I’ve have many ideas and discussion on these topics,
but seldom had the bandwidth to work on them. In the last couple years I’ve
<a href="https://blog.pgxn.org/post/651216661677064192/a-few-belated-pgxn-updates" title="PGXN Blog: “A Few Belated PGXN Updates”">enabled TLS and improved the site display</a>, <a href="https://blog.pgxn.org/post/655912318549606400/password-storage-update" title="PGXN Blog: “Password Storage Update”">increased password security</a>, and
<a href="https://blog.pgxn.org/post/709635160523620352/hello-mastodon" title="PGXN Blog: “Hello Mastodon 🐘”">added a notification queue</a> with hooks that post to both Twitter (RIP <a href="https://twitter.com/pgxn/" title="PGXN on Twitter">@pgxn</a>)
and Mastodon (<a href="https://botsin.space/@pgxn" title="PGXN on Mastodon">@pgxn@botsin.space</a>). Otherwise, aside from keeping the site
going, periodically improving new accounts, and eyeing the latest releases, I’ve
had little bandwidth for PGXN or the broader extension ecosystem.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to the vision and strategy of Samay and Tembo CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rywalker" title="Ry Walker - Tembo, Inc. |
    LinkedIn">Ry Walker</a>, I
will focus on these projects full time. The Tembo team have already helped me
enumerate the extension ecosystem <a href="https://strategyn.com/jobs-to-be-done/jobs-to-be-done-theory/" title="Fundamentals of Jobs-to-be-Done Theory">jobs to be done</a> and the tools required to do
them. This week I’ll submit it to collaborators from across the Postgres
community<a>1</a> to fill in the missing parts, make adjustments and
improvements, and work up a project plan.</p>
<p>The work also entails determining the degree to which PGXN and other extension
registries (e.g., <a href="https://database.dev" title="The Database Package Manager">dbdev</a>, <a href="https://pgt.dev" title="Trunk — A Postgres Extension Registry">trunk</a>, <a href="https://pgxman.com/" title="npm for PostgreSQL">pgxman</a>, <a href="http://www.postgres.pm">pgpm</a> (WIP), etc.) will play a
role or provide inspiration, what bits should be adopted, rewritten, or
discarded.<a>2</a> Our goal is to build the foundations for a community-owned
extensions ecosystem that people care about and will happily adopt and
contribute to.</p>
<p>I’m thrilled to return to this problem space, re-up my participation in the
PostgreSQL community, and work with great people to build out the extensions
ecosystem for future.</p>

<p>Tembo was not the only company whose representatives have reached
out in the past year to talk about PGXN and improving extensions. I’ve also
had conversations with <a href="https://supabase.com" title="Supabase | The Open Source Firebase Alternative">Supabase</a>, <a href="https://omnigres.com" title="Omnigres: Postgres as a Platform">Omnigres</a>, <a href="https://www.hydra.so" title="Hydra - Fast Postgres Analytics ++">Hydra</a>, and others.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

<p>We held the first of <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2468">three planned tenth anniversary celebrations</a> for the completion of <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> at the <a href="https://www.openid.or.jp/summit/2024/en/">OpenID Summit Tokyo 2024</a>.  The four panelists were <a href="https://twitter.com/nov">Nov Matake</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ritou">Ryo Ito</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/_nat">Nat Sakimura</a>, and myself.  We shared our perspectives on what led to OpenID Connect, why it succeeded, and what lessons we learned along the way.</p>
<p>The most common refrain throughout our descriptions was the design philosophy to “Keep simple things simple”.  I believe that three of the four of us cited it.</p>
<p>I recounted that we even had a thought experiment used to make the “Keep simple things simple” principle actionable in real time: the “Nov Matake Test”.  As we considered new features, we’d ask ourselves “Would Nov want to add it to his implementation?”  And “Is it simple enough that he could build it in a few hours?”</p>
<p>The other common thread was the criticality of interop testing and certification.  We held five rounds of interop testing before finishing the specifications, with the specs being refined after each round based on the feedback received.  The early developer feedback was priceless – much of it from Japan!</p>
<p>Our OpenID Connect 10th anniversary presentations were:</p>

<p>Thanks to those of you who elected me to a two-year term on the OpenID Foundation board of directors.  This is an incredibly exciting time for the OpenID Foundation and for digital identity, and I’m thrilled to be able to contribute via the OpenID board.  Thanks for placing your trust in me!</p>
<p>I’d like to also take this opportunity to congratulate my fellow board members who were also elected:  George Fletcher, Atul Tulshibagwale, and Mark Verstege.  See the <a href="https://openid.net/2024-board-election-results/">OpenID Foundation’s announcement of the 2024 election results</a>.</p>
<p>My candidate statement was:</p>
 
<p>I am on a mission to build the Internet’s missing identity layer. OpenID specifications and initiatives are key to realizing that vision.</p>
<p>Widespread deployment of OpenID specifications has the potential to make people’s online interactions more seamless, secure, and valuable. I have been actively working since 2007 to make that an everyday reality.</p>
<p>2024 has huge potential for advances in digital identity. People are starting to have identity wallets holding digital credentials that they control. National and international federations are being established. Open Banking and Open Finance deployments are ongoing. Adoption of OpenID Connect (which we created a decade ago!) continues going strong. We’re on track to have OpenID Connect be published as ISO standards. OpenID specifications and programs are essential to all these outcomes.</p>
<p>While many of you know me and my work, here’s a few highlights of my contributions to the digital identity space and the OpenID community:</p>
<p>– I was primary editor of OpenID Connect, primary editor of the OAuth 2.0 bearer token specification [RFC 6750], and primary editor of the JSON Web Token (JWT) specification [RFC 7519] and the JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) specifications [RFCs 7515-7518], which are used by OpenID Connect. I was an editor of the Security Event Token specification [RFC 8417], which is used by Shared Signals and OpenID Connect. I’m an editor of the SIOPv2 specification and a contributor to the other OpenID for Verifiable Credentials specifications. I’m an editor of the OpenID Federation specification. The OAuth DPoP specification [RFC 9449] was my latest RFC. I’m an author of 32 RFCs and 17 final OpenID specifications, with more of each in the pipeline.</p>
<p>– I spearheaded creation of the successful OpenID Connect certification program and continue actively contributing to its success. Over 2,800 certifications have been performed and the pace keeps increasing! Certification furthers the Foundation’s goals of promoting interoperation and increasing the quality of implementations. It’s also become an important revenue stream for the Foundation.</p>
<p>– My contributions to the Foundation have included serving on the board since 2008, serving as board secretary during most of my tenure. I’ve helped organize numerous OpenID summits and working group meetings and regularly present there. I chaired the election committee that developed the Foundation’s election procedures and software. I co-chaired the local chapters committee that developed the policies governing the relationships with local OpenID chapters around the world. I serve on the liaison committee, facilitating our cooperation with other organizations. And way back in 2007, I worked with the community to create the legal framework for the OpenID Foundation, enabling both individuals and corporations to be full participants in developing OpenID specifications and ensuring that they can be freely used by all.</p>
<p>I’d like to continue serving on the OpenID board, because while the OpenID community is having notable successes, our work is far from done. Taking it to the next level will involve both additional specifications work and strategic initiatives by the Foundation. We need to continue building a broad base of supporters and deployers of OpenID specifications around the world. We need to continue fostering close working relationships with partner organizations. And we need to continue safeguarding OpenID’s intellectual property and trademarks, so they remain freely available for all to use.</p>
<p>I have a demonstrated track record of energetically serving the OpenID community and producing results that people actually use. I plan to continue taking an active role in making open identity solutions even more successful and ubiquitous. That’s why I’m running for a community board seat in 2024.</p>

  <p>Lenin supposedly said:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It’s the same in technology.</p>
<p>I came to Silicon Valley in the mid-90’s, just in time to see the dot-com boom unfold.
Lots happened very quickly in that time. There were a few more such periods of rapid
change since, like when centralized social media got going, and when phones turned into
real computers. But for many years now, not much has happened: we got used to the idea
that there’s a very small number of ever-larger tech giants, which largely release
incremental products and that’s just that. Nothing much happens.</p>
<p>But over the last year or so, suddenly things are happening again. I think not only are
the spaces for innovation and entrepreneurship now more open than they have been for at
least a decade or more; it’s possible they have never been as open as they are now.</p>
<p>Consider:</p>
 
 
<p>Everybody’s favorite subject: machine learning and AI. I don’t believe in much of
what most people seem to believe about AI these days. I’m not part of the hype train.
However, I do believe that machine learning is a fundamental innovation that allows us
to program computers in a radically different way than we have in the past 50 and more
years: instead of telling the computer what to do, we let it observe how it’s done and
have it copy what it saw. Most of what today’s AI companies use machine learning for,
in my view, is likely not going to stand the test of time. However, I do believe that
this fundamentally different way of programming a computer is going to find absolutely
astounding and beneficial applications at some point. It could be today: the space for
invention, innovation and entrepreneurship is wide open.</p>
 
 
<p>The end of ever-larger economies of scale and network effects in tech. The
dominant tech companies are very close to having pretty much all humans on the planet as
customers. The number of their users is not going to double again. So the cost structure
of their businesses is not going to get reduced any more simply by selling the same
product to more customers, nor is the benefit of their product going to grow through
growing network effects as much as in the past. It’s like they are running into a physical
limit to the size of many things they can do. This opens space for innovation and successful
competition.</p>
<p>Most interesting, it allows the creation of bespoke products again; products that are
optimized for particular markets, customer groups and use cases. Ever noticed that
Facebook is the same product for everybody, whether you are rich or poor, whether you
have lots of time, or none, whether you are CEO or a kid, whether you like in one place
or another, whether you are interested in sports or not and so forth? It’s the same
for products of the other big platform vendors. That is a side effect of the focus on
economies of scale. All of a sudden, increased utility for the user will need to
come from serving their specific needs, not insisting that all cars need to be black.
For targeted products, large platforms have no competitive advantages over small
organizations; in fact, they may be at a real disadvantage. Entrepreneurs, what are
you waiting for?</p>
 
 
<p>The regulators suddenly have found their spine and aren’t kidding around, starting
with the EU.</p>
 
 
<p>The Apple App Store got in the way of your business? They are about to force the App
Store open and allow side loading and alternate app stores (although Apple is trying
hard to impede this as much as possible; a fight is brewing; my money is on the
regulators).</p>
 
 
<p>The big platforms hold all your data hostage? Well, in many jurisdictions around the
world you now have the right to get all copy of all your data. Even better, the
“continuous, real-time access” provision of the EU’s Digital Markets Act is about to
come into force.</p>
 
 
<p>The platforms don’t let you interoperate or connect? Well, in the EU, a legal
requirement for interoperability of messaging apps is already on the books, and more
are probably coming. Meta’s embrace of ActivityPub as part of Threads is a sign of it.</p>
 
 
<p>Imagine what you can do, as an entrepreneur, if you can distribute outside of app stores,
use the same data on the customer that the platforms have, and you can interoperate with
them? The mind boggles … many product categories that previous were impossible to
compete with suddenly are in play again.</p>
 
 
<p>Social networking is becoming an open network through the embrace of ActivityPub
by Meta’s Threads. While nobody outside of Meta completely understands why they are
doing this, they undoubtedly are progressing towards interoperability with the Fediverse.
Whatever the reasons, chances are that they also apply to other social media products,
by Meta and others. All of a sudden competing with compelling social media application
is possible again because you have a fully built-out network with its network effects
from day one.</p>
 
 
<p>Consumers know tech has a problem. They are more willing to listen to alternatives
to what they know than they have in a long time.</p>
 
 
<p>And finally, 3D / Spatial Computing a la Apple. (I’m not listing Meta here because
clearly, they don’t have a compelling vision for it. Tens of billions spent and I still
don’t know what they are trying to do.)</p>
<p>Apple is creating an an entirely new interaction model for how humans can interact with
technology. It used to be punch cards and line printers. Then we got interactive
green-screen terminals. And then graphics displays, and mice. That was in the
1980’s. Over the next 40 years, basically nothing happened (except adding voice for some
very narrow applications). By using the space around us as a canvas, Apple is making it
possible to interact with computing in a radically different way. Admittedly, nobody
knows so far how to really take advantage of the new medium, but once somebody does, I
am certain amazing things will happen.</p>
<p>Again, an opportunity ripe for the taking. If it works, it will have the same effects
on established vendors as the arrival of the web had on established vendors: some
managed to migrate, or the arrival graphical user interfaces on the vendors of
software for character terminals; most failed to make the switch. So this is another
ideal entrepreneurial territory.</p>
 
 
<p>But here’s the kicker: what if you combined all of the above? What can you build if your
primary interaction model is 3D overlayed over the real world, with bespoke experiences
for your specific needs, assisted by (some) intelligence that goes beyond what computers
typically do today, accomplished by some form of machine learning, all fed by personal
data collected by the platforms, and distributed outside of the straightjacket and business
strategies of app stores?</p>
<p>We have not seen as much opportunity as this in a long time; maybe ever.</p>

<p>Am heutigen Donnerstag, 18. Januar, <a href="https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2024/kw03-de-sexueller-missbrauch-983232">geplant ab 17.50 Uhr</a>, debattiert der Deutsche Bundestag einen Antrag der CDU/CSU-Fraktion aus dem September 2022 zur Einführung einer sechsmonatigen Speicherpflicht für Internet-Verbindungsdaten (IP-Adressen und Portnummern) aller Bürgerinnen und Bürger. Der Rechtsausschusses empfiehlt den Antrag abzulehnen.</p>



<p>Der Europaabgeordnete und digitale Freiheitskämpfer (Piratenpartei) Dr. Patrick Breyer klärt auf seiner <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/vorratsdatenspeicherung/">Webseite über Vorratsdatenspeicherung</a> auf, hat beim ZDF-Fernsehrat eine <a href="https://digitalcourage.social/@echo_pbreyer/111732701326530882">Beschwerde gegen einen einseitigen Beitrag</a> zu diesem Thema eingereicht und veröffentlicht heute ein <a href="https://peertube.european-pirates.eu/w/gsoHdn3NKZffYjqPcbnUF5">Gespräch mit Daniel Moßbrucker</a>, NDR-Journalist und spezialisiert auf Recherchen zu Pädokriminalität im Darknet. In seinem Buch „Direkt vor unseren Augen“ erklärt Mossbrucker, wie sich Kriminelle etwa der Speicherung von IP-Adressen entziehen und wie pädokriminelle Onlineforen stattdessen gestört werden könnten.</p>



<p>Breyer mahnt:</p>



<p>„Der Respekt vor Kindern und Missbrauchsopfern verbietet es, Scheinlösungen vorzugaukeln, nur weil sie billig und simpel sind. Laut Bundesregierung gingen 2021 78.600 Hinweise von NCMEC ein, nur 2.150 Fälle (3%) konnten mangels gespeicherter IP-Adresse oder anderer Anhaltspunkte nicht weiter verfolgt werden [<a href="https://dserver.bundestag.de/btd/20/005/2000534.pdf]">PDF</a>]. Insgesamt wird bei Kinderpornografie im Netz laut Kriminalstatistik seit Jahren eine Aufklärungsquote von fast 90% erreicht. Die Aufklärungsquote war 2009 mit sechsmonatiger Vorratsdatenspeicherung nicht höher und ist es auch im Ausland nicht, wo Internet-Vorratsdatenspeicherung praktiziert wird. Dasselbe gilt für Internetkriminalität im allgemeinen. Das Gefaesere von einer angeblich zu kurzen Speicherpraxis der Unternehmen tritt den Koalitionsvertrag mit Füßen und entbehrt jeder statistischen Signifikanz.</p>



<p>IP-Vorratsdatenspeicherung ist, wie wenn jede:r Bürger:in ein sichtbares Kennzeichen um den Hals gehängt bekäme und dieses auf Schritt und Tritt notiert würde. Niemand würde sich eine solche Totalerfassung des täglichen Lebens gefallen lassen. IP-Vorratsdatenspeicherung würde jeden Internetnutzer unter Generalverdacht stellen und die Internetnutzung der gesamten Bevölkerung, die unsere intimsten Vorlieben und Schwächen abbildet, nachvollziehbar machen. Eine so totale Erfassung würde Kriminalitätsvorbeugung durch anonyme Beratung und Seelsorge, Opferhilfe durch anonyme Selbsthilfeforen und auch die freie Presse gefährden, die auf anonyme Informanten angewiesen ist. 99,99 Prozent dieser Daten wären völlig nutzlos, da sie Bürger:innen betreffen, die nie auch nur in den Verdacht einer Straftat kommen.</p>



<p>Die Wiederholungsschleife der Debatte um die Vorratsdatenspeicherung verhindert in Wahrheit echte Lösungen zum Kinderschutz. Für besseren Kinderschutz benötigen wir keinen Internet-Generalverdacht gegen alle Bürger:innen, sondern ein Quick-Freeze-Verfahren, die Login-Falle, verpflichtende Schutzkonzepten an Schulen, in Sportvereinen und Kirchgemeinden sowie kostenfreie, anonyme Beratungsangebote. Strafverfolger, die sich bisher für unzuständig erklären, müssen zur unverzüglichen Löschung ihnen bekannten illegalen Materials verpflichtet werden. Das ungenutzte Potenzial für echten Kinderschutz ist riesig. Massenüberwachung ist einfach und billig, hat mit echter Kinderschutzarbeit aber nichts zu tun.“</p>

<p>Nachdem die EU-Pläne zur verpflichtenden Durchleuchtung privater Kommunikation und Aufhebung sicherer Verschlüsselung (Chatkontrolle 2.0) mangels Mehrheit im EU-Rat vorerst auf Eis liegen, will nun die Parlamentsberichterstatterin <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1294235EN_FINAL.pdf">Birgit Sippel (SPD) dem Kommissionsvorschlag zur Verlängerung der bestehenden freiwilligen verdachtslosen Chatkontrolle mit kleineren Änderungen zustimmen.</a> Bisher ist die von US-Konzernen wie Meta, Google und Microsoft eigenmächtig praktizierte Chatkontrolle privater Nachrichten über Instagram Messenger, Facebook Messenger, GMail und XBox bis zum 3. August 2024 befristet. Der Europaabgeordnete und profilierteste Gegner der Chatkontrolle Dr. Patrick Breyer (Piratenpartei), zugleich Verhandlungsführer seiner Fraktion, kommentiert: </p>



<p>„Statt den neuen Vorschlag des EU-Parlaments zu einem wirksameren und gerichtsfesten Kinderschutz ohne Chatkontrolle aufzugreifen, beharrt EU-Kommissarin ‚Big Sister‘ Johansson unverbesserlich auf einer Zerstörung des digitalen Briefgeheimnisses, spielt auf Zeit und hofft kritische EU-Staaten mit infamen Kampagnen und Falschinformationen zur Zustimmung zu manipulieren. Diesen Machenschaften sollten wir eine klare Absage erteilen und auf den vom Parlament vorgeschlagenen Lösungen ohne Massenüberwachung bestehen.“</p>



<p>Ausweislich ihres Berichtsentwurfs will Sippel die freiwillige Chatkontrolle um ein Jahr statt wie von der Kommission vorgeschlagen um zwei Jahre oder wie vom Rat gefordert um drei Jahre verlängern. Die automatisierte Durchleuchtung von Chattexten nach Grooming-relevanten Schlüsselworten will sie auslaufen lassen – allerdings wird diese im Vergleich zur Durchleuchtung privater Bilder und Videos ohnehin kaum angewandt und macht nur 0,2% der Meldungen aus.</p>



<p>Breyer kritisiert das Instrument der freiwilligen Chatkontrolle scharf: „Die freiwillige Massenüberwachung unserer persönlichen Nachrichten und Fotos durch US-Dienste wie Meta, Google oder Microsoft leistet keinen signifikanten Beitrag zur Rettung missbrauchter Kinder oder Überführung von Missbrauchtätern, sondern kriminalisiert umgekehrt tausende Minderjähriger, überlastet Strafverfolger und öffnet einer willkürlichen Privatjustiz der Internetkonzerne Tür und Tor. Wenn nach Johanssons eigenen Angaben nur jede vierte Meldung überhaupt für die Polizei relevant ist, bedeutet das für Deutschland Jahr für Jahr 75.000 ausgeleitete intime Strandfotos und Nacktbilder, die bei unbekannten Moderatoren im Ausland nicht sicher sind und in deren Händen nichts zu suchen haben.</p>



<p>„Die Verordnung zur freiwilligen Chatkontrolle ist sowohl unnötig als auch grundrechtswidrig: Die sozialen Netzwerke als Hostingdienste brauchen zur Überprüfung öffentlicher Posts keine Verordnung. Dasselbe gilt für Verdachtsmeldungen durch Nutzer. Und die fehleranfälligen automatisierten Meldungen aus der Durchleuchtung privater Kommunikation durch Zuckerbergs Meta-Konzern, die 80% der Chatmeldungen ausmachen, werden durch die angekündigte Einführung von Ende-zu-Ende-Verschlüsselung ohnehin entfallen. <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Legal-Opinion-Screening-for-child-pornography-2021-03-04_incl_Logos.pdf">Das Rechtsgutachten einer ehemaligen EuGH-Richterin belegt</a>, dass die freiwillige Chatkontrolle als verdachtslose und flächendeckende Überwachungsmaßnahme grundrechtswidrig ist. Ein <a href="https://freiheitsrechte.org/themen/freiheit-im-digitalen/chatkontrolle_facebook">Missbrauchsbetroffener</a> und <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/facebook-verteidigt-flaechendeckende-nachrichten-und-chatkontrolle-vor-gericht/">ich</a> klagen dagegen. Und <a href="https://nextcloud.pp-eu.eu/index.php/s/55j8LrGR4qGEfJs">das Digitalministerium hat bestätigt, dass die Ausnahmeverordnung eine freiwillige Chatkontrolle in Deutschland überhaupt nicht möglich macht.“</a>   </p>



<p>Der Innenausschuss (LIBE) soll die Fortsetzung der freiwilligen Chatkontrolle bereits am 29. Januar billigen. Mit dem Rat will sich das Parlament in der zweiten Februarwoche einig werden, und abgesegnet werden soll die Verlängerung kurz danach.</p>



<p>Unterdessen sollen die EU-Innenminister nach der Planung der belgischen Ratspräsidentschaft im März erneut über die Einführung der für alle Anbieter verpflichtende Chatkontrolle 2.0 abstimmen.</p>

<p>Im Endstadium der Verhandlungen über das KI-Gesetz der EU ist bekannt geworden, dass <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20231206IPR15699/artificial-intelligence-act-deal-on-comprehensive-rules-for-trustworthy-ai">zwischenzeitig sogar die öffentlich verkündete Beschränkung</a> der umstrittenen <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LEAK-Document-Artificial-Intelligence-Act.pdf">Gesichtserkennung auf die Verfolgung schwerer Straftaten gestrichen worden ist. </a>Der digitale Freiheitskämpfer und Europaabgeordnete Dr. Patrick Breyer (Piratenpartei) warnt davor, dass das Gesetz den Weg für die Einführung biometrischer Massenüberwachung in Europa freimacht, wo sich EU-Regierungen dafür entscheiden.</p>



<p>„Mit diesem KI-Gesetz will die EU China offenbar nicht nur technologisch sondern auch innenpolitisch nacheifern. Dass fehleranfällige Gesichtserkennung in Videoüberwachungsmaterial jetzt schon bei Bagatellstraftaten zum Einsatz kommen soll, fällt hinter die eigene Pressemitteilung des EU-Parlaments zurück. So wird es Städten möglich, unter dem Schlagwort ‚Hausfriedensbruch‘ Obdachlose zu verdrängen, wie im italienischen Como geschehen, oder Sprayer wegen ‚Sachbeschädigung‘ zu verfolgen. Auch die hochumstrittene Gesichtserkennung unter Demonstrierenden wie nach dem G20-Gipfel in Hamburg wird mit keinem Wort verhindert. Mit diesen Regeln droht die Gesichtserkennung, die in den USA immer wieder zu falschen Festnahmen führt, zu einem Standardinstrument auch in Europa zu werden.</p>



<p>Sogar einer permanenten Gesichtsüberwachung in Echtzeit wird Tür und Tor geöffnet: Wegen der im ‚AI Act‘ genannten Delikte sucht die Justiz per Europäischem Haftbefehl nach über 6.000 Menschen. Mit der Begründung ‚Personenfahndung‘ kann der öffentliche Raum in Europa also flächendeckend und permanent unter biometrische Massenüberwachung gestellt werden. Dieses Gesetz legitimiert und normalisiert eine Kultur des Misstrauens. Es führt Europa in eine dystopische Zukunft eines misstrauischen High-Tech-Überwachungsstaats nach chinesischem Vorbild.“</p>

<p>This article shows how to migrate a Blazor server application to a Blazor Web application. The migration used the ASP.NET Core migration <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/70-80#convert-a-blazor-server-app-into-a-blazor-web-app">documentation</a>, but this was not complete and a few extra steps were required. The starting point was a Blazor Server application secured using OpenID Connect for authentication. The target system is a Blazor Web application using the “InteractiveServer” rendermode.</p>



 Note 



<p>The result of this project is not ready to use in production as it was not possible to migrate the security headers fully and I am not sure if the state management works correctly. I would hold off migrating Blazor Server to Blazor Web until this is solved. Updating an existing application should not result in weaker security. You could migrate from CSP nonces to CSP hashes. Blazor Server can use CSP nonces, Blazor Web cannot.</p>



<p>Code:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/damienbod/BlazorServerOidc">https://github.com/damienbod/BlazorServerOidc</a></p>







<p></p>



 Migration 



<p>The following Blazor Server application was used as a starting point:</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/damienbod/BlazorServerOidc/tree/main/BlazorServerOidc">https://github.com/damienbod/BlazorServerOidc/tree/main/BlazorServerOidc</a></p>



<p>This is a simple application using .NET 8 and OpenID Connect to implement the authentication flow. Security headers are applied and the user can login or logout using OpenIddict as the identity provider.</p>



<p>As in the migration guide, steps 1-3, the Routes.razor was created and the imports were extended.  Migrating the contents of the Pages/_Host.cshtml to the App.razor was more complicated. I have a Layout in the original application and this needed migration into the App file as well.  </p>



<p>This completed Blazor Web App.razor file looked like this:</p>


  @inject IHostEnvironment Env

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /&gt;
    &lt;base href="/" /&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/bootstrap/bootstrap.min.css" /&gt;
    &lt;link href="css/site.css" rel="stylesheet" /&gt;
    &lt;link href="BlazorWebFromBlazorServerOidc.styles.css" rel="stylesheet" /&gt;
    &lt;HeadOutlet @rendermode="InteractiveServer" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;Routes @rendermode="InteractiveServer" /&gt;

    &lt;script src="_framework/blazor.web.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

  


<p></p>



<p>The App.razor uses the routes component. Inside the routes component, the CascadingAuthenticationState is used and a new component for the layout called the MainLayout.</p>


  @inject NavigationManager NavigationManager

&lt;CascadingAuthenticationState&gt;
    &lt;Router AppAssembly="@typeof(Program).Assembly"&gt;
        &lt;Found Context="routeData"&gt;
            &lt;AuthorizeRouteView RouteData="@routeData" DefaultLayout="@typeof(Layout.MainLayout)"&gt;
                &lt;NotAuthorized&gt;
                    @{
                        var returnUrl = NavigationManager.ToBaseRelativePath(NavigationManager.Uri);
                        NavigationManager.NavigateTo($"api/account/login?redirectUri={returnUrl}", forceLoad: true);
                    }
                &lt;/NotAuthorized&gt;
                &lt;Authorizing&gt;
                    Wait...
                &lt;/Authorizing&gt;
            &lt;/AuthorizeRouteView&gt;
        &lt;/Found&gt;
        &lt;NotFound&gt;
            &lt;LayoutView Layout="@typeof(Layout.MainLayout)"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Sorry, there's nothing at this address.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/LayoutView&gt;
        &lt;/NotFound&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
&lt;/CascadingAuthenticationState&gt;
  


<p></p>



<p>The MainLayout component uses two more new razor components, one for the nav menu and one for the login, logout component.</p>


  @inherits LayoutComponentBase

&lt;div class="page"&gt;
    &lt;div class="sidebar"&gt;
        &lt;NavMenu /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;main&gt;
        &lt;div class="top-row px-4"&gt;
            &lt;LogInOrOut /&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;article class="content px-4"&gt;
            @Body
        &lt;/article&gt;
    &lt;/main&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="blazor-error-ui"&gt;
    An unhandled error has occurred.
    &lt;a href="" class="reload"&gt;Reload&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a class="dismiss"&gt;🗙&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  


<p></p>



<p>The login, logout component uses the original account controller and improved the logout.</p>


  @inject NavigationManager NavigationManager

&lt;AuthorizeView&gt;
    &lt;Authorized&gt;
        &lt;div class="nav-item"&gt;
            &lt;span&gt;@context.User.Identity?.Name&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="nav-item"&gt;
            &lt;form action="api/account/logout" method="post"&gt;
                &lt;AntiforgeryToken /&gt;
                &lt;button type="submit" class="nav-link btn btn-link text-dark"&gt;
                    Logout
                &lt;/button&gt;
            &lt;/form&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/Authorized&gt;
    &lt;NotAuthorized&gt;
        &lt;div class="nav-item"&gt;
            &lt;a href="api/account/login?redirectUri=/"&gt;Log in&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;          
    &lt;/NotAuthorized&gt;
&lt;/AuthorizeView&gt;
  


<p></p>



<p>The program file was updated like in the migration docs. Blazor Web does not support reading the HTTP headers from inside a Blazor component and so the security headers were weakened which is a very bad idea. CSP nonces are not supported and so a super web security feature is lost if updating to Blazor Web. I believe moving forward, the application should be improved.</p>

            .AddInteractiveServerRenderMode().RequireAuthorization();

        app.Run();
    }
}
  


<p></p>



<p>With the weakened security headers the application works and the authentication flow works.</p>







<p></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Blazor Web is starting to look good, but it still cannot be implemented using the recommended security standards required for the majority of my production applications or professional solutions. The authentication has problems with the different render modes and persisting the authentication state. I am confident this will be solved and documented. It is also not possible to implement strong session protection like Blazor Server. Blazor Web can use CSP hashes, this would mean generating a hash for every script and adding this to the CSP. I would not recommend migrating to Blazor Web from Blazor server until Blazor security supports CSP nonces, or you migrate to CSP hashes. For now, I use the following Blazor type of applications</p>

<p>Getting immersed in a new subject is a great experience. ISO SC 37 wrapped up a week-long series of meetings yesterday in Okayama Japan. Here are some things I learned along the way:</p>



<p>SC 37 is smaller than the other ISO committees I’m in – about 60 in-person plus about 20 online this week across 6 work groups. It makes for a tight-knit group and provides lots of time to build relationships. It also means that the workload is sane – on other committees I have to ignore all but the 2 or 3 projects I’m directly involved in.</p>



<p>The main work of the committee is extensible data exchange formats, APIs, evaluation of biometric technologies, performance testing and societal aspects. </p>



<p>SC 37 was started in the early 2000s to meet the needs of ICAO to add biometric information to passports – face, finger and iris formats were the first. Since then, work has been done to cover other biometric modalities such as voice, skeletal structure, vein pattern and others. </p>



<p>Participants are primarily from Government border control, immigration, public safety, law enforcement departments. I’m one of a very small number focused on consumer-provided sensors and devices for use in commercial scenarios. </p>



<p>Biometrics is all about statistical analysis – I never really thought much about it – using the lazy term “probabilistic” – but it really is about estimation and weighting of data samples. So I might have to break open a textbook or two to relearn by sum-overs, means, medians, and standard deviations – not looking forward that that part!</p>



<p>“Convoluted Neural Networks” appear to be broadly used to look for patterns and help to draw conclusions. Another area I must learn about quickly.</p>



<p>There is a significant desire to apply biometric binding of people to data records – for example during ID Proofing and Verification. But it was clear that SC 37 is not the best place to do that work. SC 17 for mDoc credentials or SC 27/WG 5 for identity management seem better suited for this work.</p>



<p>I realized by the end of the week that being an “identity management” guy in the “biometrics” world is a very good thing – the latter can be applied to operations of the former and I get to work on both sides.</p>



<p>So I’m looking forward to working with the committee members and digging deep into the material. Hopefully I can bring useful opinions from the consumer world to drive discussions and improve the body of work.</p>

<p>Montag werden sich die Verhandlungsteams im <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/LIBE-AM-757302_EN.pdf">LIBE-Ausschuss des Europäischen Parlaments zum ersten Mal mit Änderungsanträgen </a> beschäftigen. Der Abgeordnete der Piratenpartei Dr. Patrick Breyer, Verhandlungsführer seiner Fraktion im LIBE-Ausschuss, beantragt fundamentale Änderungen des Vorschlags:</p>



<p>„Damit der digitale Euro seinen Namen verdient und einen Sinn und Mehrwert im Vergleich zu Kreditkarten und Kryptowährungen hat, muss digitales Bargeld so anonym und frei nutzbar sein wie Scheine und Münzen – nicht nur bei physischer Anwesenheit beider Seiten. Die Einführung digitalen Bargelds ist in der heutigen Lebensrealität des Informationszeitalters überfällig.</p>



<p>Da man unbegrenzt Bargeld besitzen und weitergeben darf, darf auch die Menge an Digitalen Euro in unserer Hand nicht limitiert werden. Und so wie mit Bargeld auch vertrauliche Zahlungen und kontroverse Spenden anonym und ohne Furcht vor Bekanntwerden möglich sind, dürfen auch spurenlose Zahlungen in digitalem Euro nicht unmöglich gemacht oder auf eine unbekannte und wechselnde Höhe begrenzt werden, wie es die EU-Kommission vorschlägt. Die Begründung Geldwäsche und Terrorismus bekämpfen zu wollen ist nur ein Vorwand, um immer mehr Kontrolle über unsere privaten Geschäfte zu erlangen. Wo jede Zahlung erfasst und für immer gespeichert wird, drohen Hackerangriffe, unberechtigte Ermittlungen und eine abschreckende Staatsaufsicht über jeden Kauf und jede Spende.</p>



<p>Bargeld ist finanzielle Freiheit ohne Rechtfertigungsdruck. Welche Medikamente oder welches Sexspielzeug ich einkaufe, geht niemanden etwas an. Seit Tausenden von Jahren haben Gesellschaften auf der ganzen Welt mit Bargeld, das die Privatsphäre schützt, gelebt. Diese finanzielle Freiheit muss auch im Informationszeitalter garantiert werden. Wir müssen Wege finden, die besten Eigenschaften von Bargeld in unsere digitale Zukunft mitzunehmen.“</p>



<p>Konkret fordert Breyer, dezentrale Offlinezahlungen unmittelbar zwischen Endgeräten nicht nur in physischer Anwesenheit der Zahlenden zuzulassen (Änderungsantrag 76) und sie im Vergleich zu Bargeld keiner Benachteiligung wie durch Höchstgrenzen zu unterwerfen (Änderungsanträge 203-205, 207).</p>

<div class='wrap'>

  <p>I moved my account from <a href="https://mastodon.social/@herestomwiththeweather">@herestomwiththeweather@mastodon.social</a> to <a href="https://otisburg.social/actor/tom@herestomwiththeweather.com">@tom@herestomwiththeweather.com</a> on January 2nd.  In the spirit of learning from <a href="https://github.com/danluu/post-mortems/">post-mortems</a>, I am documenting a few mistakes I made.</p>

<p>One of the main motivations for the move was that <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/herestomwiththeweather.github.io/commit/16a5882581d2bfb044a6537a629033698adc80a7">over a year ago</a>, I had configured webfinger on this site to point to the account I had on <a href="https://mastodon.social/">mastodon.social</a>. But once someone has found me on mastodon, I would from then on be known by my mastodon identifier rather than the identifier with my personal domain.  If I lost access to that particular mastodon account for whatever reason, I would be unreachable by that mastodon identifier.  However, as I described in <a href="https://herestomwiththeweather.com/2023/09/22/webfinger-expectations/">Webfinger Expectations</a>, if my webfinger configuration points me to a server that will allow me to participate on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">fediverse</a> with my own personal identifier using my own domain, then in theory, if I lose access to the account on that server, I can swap it out with another similar server and be reachable again with my personal identifier.  So, last week <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/">I moved</a> to <a href="https://otisburg.social">Otisburg.social</a> which is running what I consider a minimum viable activitypub server called <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/irwin">Irwin</a>.  As it is experimental, I am the only user on the server.</p>

<p>So what did I screw up?  I didn’t plan for two things.  Both are related to the diversity of software and configurations on the Fediverse.</p>

<p>First, although I was vaguely aware of the optional <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/config/#authorized_fetch">Authorized Fetch</a> mastodon feature, I didn’t anticipate that it would prevent me from re-following some of my followers.  Prior to the migration, I assumed this feature would not be enabled on any of the servers the people I followed were using.  I quickly realized that I could not re-follow people on 3 servers which had this feature enabled.  So, I lost contact with the people on those servers for a few days until I <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/irwin/commit/ba5bd101a5870c50fef8c0312118ae792e85f20e">fixed it</a> by also signing GET requests in addition to POST requests.</p>

<p>Second, I didn’t adequately prepare for the possibility that some of my followers would not automatically move to the new server.  Of 96 followers, I had about 15 that did not successfully re-follow.  It seems that some of these failed because they were not on a Mastodon server and their server did not adequately handle the <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/spec/activitypub/#Move">Move</a> activity sent by mastodon.social.  Unfortunately, although mastodon allowed me to download a csv file of the people I followed, it did not provide a link to download a file of followers so I don’t know everyone I lost during the move.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the move went well and it is a great feature and I’m glad to see <a href="https://w3c.github.io/activitypub/data-portability-report.html">an effort underway to standardize it</a>.</p>

<p>One unresolved issue is that when someone visits my profile on a mastodon site, selecting “open original page” will fetch https://otisburg.social/actor/tom@herestomwiththeweather.com and the user would expect to see my status updates or toots or whatever you call them.  However, currently that url redirects to this website and activitypub status updates are not available here.</p>

<p>Back when I was on the board of my regional Red Cross chapter (<a href="https://www.redcross.org/local/california/northern-california-coastal.html">this one</a>), I learned four lessons about fund raising:</p>
 
 People are glad to pay value for value. 
 People are most willing to pay when they perceive and appreciate the value they get from a product or service. 
 People are most willing to pay full value when the need or opportunity to pay is immediate, and the amount they pay is up to them. 
 People are willing to pay more when they have a relationship with the other party (seller, service provider, philanthropy, cause, whatever) 
 
<p>Here’s something I wrote in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cluetrain-Manifesto-10th-Anniversary/dp/0465024092">The Cluetrain Manifesto (10th anniversary edition)</a>&nbsp;about all four lessons at work:</p>
<blockquote><p>Not long after Cluetrain came out in early 2000, I found myself on a cross-country flight, sitting beside a Nigerian pastor named Sayo Ajiboye. After we began to talk, it became clear to me that Sayo (pronounced “Shaiyo”) was a deeply wise man. Among his accomplishments was translating the highly annotated Thompson Bible into his native Yoruba language: a project that took eight of his thirty-nine years.</p>
<p>I told him that I had been involved in a far more modest book project—The Cluetrain Manifesto—and was traveling the speaking circuit, promoting it. When Sayo asked me what the book was about, I explained how “markets are conversations” was the first of our ninety-five theses, and how we had unpacked it in a chapter by that title. Sayo listened thoughtfully, then came back with the same response I had heard from other readers in what back then was still called the Third World: “Markets are conversations” is a pretty smart thing for well-off guys from the First World to be talking about. But it doesn’t go far enough.</p>
<p>When I asked him why, he told me to imagine we were in a “natural” marketplace—a real one in, say, an African village where one’s “brand” was a matter personal reputation, and where nobody ruled customer choices with a pricing gun. Then he picked up one of those blue airline pillows and told me to imagine it was a garment, such as a coat, and that I was interested in buying it. “What’s the first thing you would say to the seller?” he asked.</p>
<p>“What does it cost?”</p>
<p>“Yes, you would say that,” he replied, meaning that this was typical of a First World shopper for whom price is the primary concern. Then he asked me to imagine that a conversation follows between the seller and me—that the two of us get to know each other a bit and learn from each other. “Now,” he asked, “What happens to the price?”<br>
I said maybe now I’m willing to pay more while the seller is willing to charge less.</p>
<p>“Why?” Sayo asked.</p>
<p>I didn’t have an answer.</p>
<p>“Because you now have a relationship,” he said.</p>
<p>As we continued talking, it became clear to me that everything that happens in a marketplace falls into just three categories: transaction, conversation, and relationship. In our First World business culture, transaction matters most, conversation less, and relationship least. Worse, we conceive and justify everything in transactional terms. Nothing matters more than price and “the bottom line.” By looking at markets through the prism of transaction or even conversation, we miss the importance of relationship. We also don’t see how relationship has a value all its own: one that transcends, even as it improves, the other two.</p>
<p>Consider your relationship with friends and family, Sayo said. The value system there is based on caring and generosity, not on price. Balance and reciprocity may play in a relationship, but are not the basis of it. One does not make deals for love. There are other words for that.</p>
<p>Back in the industrialized world, few of our market relationships run so deep, nor should they. By necessity much of our relating is shallow and temporary. We don’t want to get personal with an ATM machine or even with real bank tellers. Friendly is nice, but in most business situations that’s about as far as we want to go.</p>
<p>But relationship is a broad category: broad enough to contain all forms of relating—the shallow as well as the deep, the temporary as well as the enduring. In the business culture of the industrialized world, Sayo said, we barely understand relationship’s full meaning or potential. And we should. Doing so would be good for business.</p>
<p>So he told me our next assignment was to unpack and study another thesis: Markets are relationships.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is why, six years after the first edition of Cluetrain came out, I started <a href="https://projectvrm.org">ProjectVRM</a> (the R means Relationship) at the <a href="http://cyber.harvard.edu">Berkman Klein Center,</a> wrote <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527">The Intention Economy: When Customers Take Charge</a>, (Harvard Business Review Press, 2012), co-founded <a href="http://customercommons.org">Customer Commons</a> (in 2013), and am now a visiting scholar with the <a href="https://ostromworkshop.indiana.edu/">Ostrom Workshop</a> at Indiana University, thinking out loud about how a <a href="https://doc.searls.com/news-commons/">news commons</a> might thrive as a market of relationships—starting here in Bloomington, IU’s home town.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/01/04/the-news-business/">The News Business</a> (which precedes this post), I said the three current business models for local news were advertising, subscription, and philanthropy, and promised a fourth. This is it: emancipayments.</p>
<p>We* came up with this idea in 2009. Here is how the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/EmanciPay">EmanciPay page</a> on the ProjectVRM wiki puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
 Overview 
<p>Simply put, Emancipay makes it easy for anybody to pay (or offer to pay) —</p>
 
 as much as they like 
 however they like 
 for whatever they like 
 on their own terms 
 
<p>— or at least to start with that full set of options, and to work out differences with sellers easily and with minimal friction.</p>
<p>Emancipay turns consumers (aka users) into customers by giving them a pricing gun (something which in the past only sellers used) and their own means to make offers, to pay outright, and to escrow the intention to pay when price and other requirements are met. And to be able to do this at scale across all sellers, much as cash, browsers, credit cards and email clients do the same. Payments themselves can also be escrowed.</p>
<p>In slightly more technical terms, EmanciPay is a payment framework for customers operating with full agency in the open marketplace, and at scale. It operates on open protocols and standards, so it can be used by any buyer, seller or intermediary.</p>
<p>It was conceived as a way to pay for music, journalism, or what any artist brings into the world. But it can apply to anything. For example, [<a href="https://customercommons.org/solving-subscriptions/">subscriptions</a>], which have become by 2021 a giant fecosystem in which every seller has separate and non-substitutable scale across all subscribers, while subscribers have zero scale across all sellers, with the highly conditional exceptions of silo’d commercial intermediaries. As [<a href="http://customercommons.org/">Customer Commons</a>] puts it,</p>
<p>There’s also not much help coming from the subscription management services we have on our side: Truebill, Bobby, Money Dashboard, Mint, Subscript Me, BillTracker Pro, Trim, Subby, Card Due, Sift, SubMan, and Subscript Me. Nor from the subscription management systems offered by Paypal, Amazon, Apple or Google (e.g. with Google Sheets and Google Doc templates). All of them are too narrow, too closed and exclusive, too exposed to the surveillance imperatives of corporate giants, and too vested in the status quo.</p>
<p>That status quo sucks (see&nbsp;<a href="https://enewspaper.latimes.com/infinity/article_share.aspx?guid=b8db8d9f-5e61-4da2-b112-e5e1cf71df57">here</a>, or just look up&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=subscription+hell">“subscription hell”</a>), and it’s way past time to unscrew it.) But how?</p>
<p>The better question is&nbsp;where?</p>
<p>The answer to that is&nbsp;on our side: the customer’s side.</p>
<p>While EmanciPay was first conceived by ProjectVRM as a way to make live payments to nonprofits and to provide&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/vrm/2009/05/28/emancipay-a-content-monetization-plan-for-newspapers/">a new monetization method for publishers</a>. it also works as a counterpart to sellers’ subscription systems in what&nbsp;<a href="http://www.zuora.com/">Zuora</a>&nbsp;(a supplier of subscription management systems to the publishing industry, including&nbsp;The Guardian&nbsp;and&nbsp;Financial Times) calls the “<a href="http://www.zuora.com/subscription-economy/">subscription economy</a>“, which it says “is built on ever changing relationships with your customers”. Since relationships are two-way by nature, EmanciPay is one way that customers can manage their end, while publisher-side systems such as Zuora’s manage the other.</p>
 EmanciPay economic case 
<p>EmanciPay provides a new form of economic signaling not available to individuals, either on the Net or before the Net became available as a communications medium. EmanciPay will use open standards and be comprised of open source code. While any commercial [Fourth party] can use EmanciPay (or its principles, or any parts of it they like), EmanciPay’s open and standard framework will support fourth parties by making them substitutable, much as the open standards of email (smtp, pop3, imap) make email systems substitutable. (Each has what&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.joeandrieu.com/2009/04/26/introducing-user-driven-services/">Joe Andrieu calls</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.joeandrieu.com/2009/05/07/user-driven-services-5-service-endpoint-portability/">service endpoint portability</a>.)</p>
<p>EmanciPay is an instrument of customer independence from all of the billion (or so) commercial entities on the Net, each with its own arcane and silo’d systems for engaging and managing customer relations, as well as receipt, acknowledgement and accounting for payments from customers.</p>
 Use Case Background 
<p>EmanciPay was conceived originally as a way to provide a customers with the means to signal interest and ability to pay for media and creative works (most of which are freely available on the Web, if not always free of charge). Through EmanciPay, demand and supply can relate, converse and transact business on mutually beneficial terms, rather than only on terms provided by the countless different silo’d systems we have today, each serving to hold the customer captive, and causing much inconvenience and friction in the process.</p>
<p>Media goods were chosen for five reasons:</p>
 
 because most are available for free, even if they cost money, or are behind paywalls 
 paywalls, which are cookie-based, cannot relate to individuals as anything other than submissive and dependent parties (and each browser a users employs carries a different set of cookies) 
 both media companies and non-profits are constantly looking for new sources of revenue 
 the subscription model, while it creates steady income and other conveniences for sellers, is often a bad deal for customers, and is now so overused (see <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2022/07/15/subscriptification/">Subscriptification</a>) that the world is approaching a peak subscription crisis, and&nbsp;<a href="https://reality2.substack.com/p/unscrewing-subscriptions">unscrewing it can only happen from the customer’s side (because the business is incapable of unscrewing the problem itself</a> 
 all methods of intermediating payment choices are either silo’d by the seller or silo’d by intermediators, discouraging participation by individuals. 
 
<p>What the marketplace requires are new business and social contracts that ease payment and stigmatize non-payment for creative goods. The friction involved in voluntary payment is still high, even on the Web, where one must go through complex ceremonies even to make simple payments.&nbsp; There is no common and easy way either to keep track of what media (free or otherwise) we use (see <a title="Media Logging" href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Media_Logging">Media Logging</a>), to determine what it might be worth, and to pay for it easily and in standard ways &amp;#151; to many different suppliers. (Again, each supplier has its own system for accepting payments.)</p>
<p>EmanciPay differs from other payment models (subscriptions, newsstand, tip jars) by providing customers with the ability to choose what they wish to pay and how they’ll pay it, with minimum friction — and with full choice about what they disclose about themselves.</p>
<p>EmanciPay will also support credit for referrals, requests for service, feedback and other relationship support mechanisms, all at the control of the user. For example, EmanciPay can provide quick and easy ways for listeners to pay for public radio broadcasts or podcasts, for readers to pay for otherwise “free” papers or blogs, for listeners to pay to hear music and support artists, for users to issue promises of payment for for stories or programs — all without requiring the individual to disclose unnecessary private information, or to become a “member” — although these options are kept open.</p>
<p>This will scaffold genuine relationships between buyers and sellers in the media marketplace. It will also give deeper meaning to “membership” in non-profits. (Under the current system, “membership” generally means putting one’s name on a pitch list for future contributions, and not much more than that.)</p>
<p>EmanciPay will also connect the sellers’ CRM (Customer Relationship Management) systems with customers’ VRM (Vendor Relationship Management) systems, supporting rich and participatory two-way relationships. In fact, EmanciPay will by definition be a VRM system.</p>
 Micro-accounting and Macro-distribution 
<p>The idea of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropayment">“micro-payments”</a>&nbsp;for goods on the Net has been around for a long time, and is often brought up as a potential business model for journalism. For example in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1877191,00.html">this article by Walter Isaacson</a>&nbsp;in Time Magazine. It hasn’t happened, at least not globally, because it’s too complicated, and in prototype only works inside private silos.</p>
<p>What ProjectVRM&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2009/02/11/emancipay/">suggests instead</a>&nbsp;is something we don’t yet have, but very much need:</p>
 
 micro-accounting&nbsp;for actual uses. Think of this simply as “keeping track of” the news, podcasts, newsletters, or music we consume. 
 macro-distribution&nbsp;of payments for accumulated use (that’s no longer “micro”). 
 
<p>Much — maybe most — of the digital goods we consume are both free for the taking and worth more than $zero. How much more? We need to be able to say. In economic terms, demand needs to have a much wider range of signals it can give to supply. And give to each other, to better gauge what we should be willing to pay for free stuff that has real value but not a hard price.</p>
<p>As currently planned, EmanciPay would –</p>
 
 Provide a single and easy way for consumers of “content” to become customers of it. In the current system — which isn’t one — every artist, every musical group, and every public radio and TV station has his, her or its own way of taking in contributions from those who appreciate the work. This can be arduous and time-consuming for everybody involved. (Imagine trying to pay separately every musical artist you like, for all your enjoyment of each artist’s work.) What EmanciPay proposes, however, is not a replacement for existing systems, but a new system that can supplement existing fund-raising systems — one that can soak up much of today’s MLOTT: Money Left On The Table. 
 Provide ways for individuals to look back through their media usage histories, inform themselves about what they have been enjoying, and determine how much it is worth to them. The Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel (CARP), and later the Copyright Royalty Board (CRB), both came up with “rates and terms that would have been negotiated in the marketplace between a willing buyer and a willing seller.” This almost absurd language first appeared in the 1995 Digital Performance Royalty Act (DPRA) and was tweaked in 1998 by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), under which both the CARP and the CRB operated. The rates they came up with peaked at $.0001 per “performance” (a song or recording), per listener.&nbsp;EmanciPay creates the “willing buyer” that the DPRA thought wouldn’t exist. 
 Stigmatize non-payment for worthwhile media goods. This is where “social” will finally come to be something more than yet another tech buzzmodifier. 
 
<p>All these require micro-accounting, not micro-payments. Micro-accounting can inform ordinary payments that can be made in clever new ways that should satisfy everybody with an interest in seeing artists compensated fairly for their work. An individual listener, for example, can say “I want to pay 1¢ for every song I hear,” and “I’ll send&nbsp;<a href="http://www.soundexchange.com/">SoundExchange</a>&nbsp;a lump sum of all the pennies wish to pay for songs I have heard over a year, along with an accounting of what artists and songs I’ve listened to” — and leave dispersal of those totaled pennies up to the kind of agency that likes, and can be trusted, to do that kind of thing. That’s the macro-distribution part of the system.</p>
<p>Similar systems can also be put in place for readers of newspapers, blogs, and other journals. What’s important is that the control is in the hands of the individual and that the accounting and dispersal systems work the same way for everybody.</p></blockquote>
<p>I visited EmanciPay use cases twice in Linux Journal:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/easy-way-pay-journalism-music-and-everything-else-we">An Easy Way to Pay for Journalism, Music and Everything Else We Like</a> (May 2015) 
 <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/immodest-proposal-music-industry">An Immodest Proposal for the Music Industry</a> (November 2018) 
 
<p>There are two differences in the world today that should make it easier to code up something like EmanciPay:</p>
 
 Smartphones and apps on them have become extensions of ourselves. 
 AI. 
 
<p>For the latter, I am not talking about the kind of centralized AI we get from Amazon, Microsoft/OpenAI, Adobe, and the rest. I’m talking about AI that’s as personal as our own underwear and gives us what Sam Altman calls “<a href="https://projectvrm.org/2023/11/11/individual-empowerment-and-agency-on-a-scale-weve-never-seen-before/">individual empowerment and agency on a scale we’ve never seen before</a>.” That quote became the title of the post I wrote at that link. I will unpack it further in an upcoming News Commons post.</p>
<p>But first I’ll dig deeper into what we need to develop EmanciPay, and how we can use it to scaffold up the kind of markets first imagined by <a href="http://cluetrain.com">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a>, a quarter century ago.</p>

 <p><br></p><p></p><p>Hierarchy appears to be the only option to pull a large group of individuals together toward a common goal. Many insects did it well before humans, but over the last 10,0000 years, humans have moved from decentralised clans into centralised nation-states consisting of hundreds of millions of people.&nbsp; From the pharaohs to Max Weber’s 20th bureaucratic management structure, we can now exist only in such a system because as a society or organisation grows beyond a few dozen people, the hierarchical pyramid is seen as the only option for the organisation.&nbsp; The justification is that it is nature and natural.&nbsp;</p><p>The “ideal organisation” was defined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Weber">Max Weber</a> as a clear and strong hierarchy underpinned by the division of tasks based on specialisation. A fundamental assumption was that each unit takes care of one piece of the chain and the division of tasks within the unit is clearly defined, work can be executed much more efficiently. Weber envisioned this as a “superior structure” because it focused on rationality and equal treatment of all - assuming everyone was happy with their 1984 dystopian jobs and oversight. By formalising processes within organisations, but especially in government, favouritism and abuse of power could be prevented - as he assumed that those in charge and specialised workers remained. A really poor underlying assumption was that people act rationally, efficiently, and professionally.&nbsp; He also ignored the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder_primacy">shareholder primacy</a> that would emerge.&nbsp; However, so strong is the argument that it remains the leading business philosophy today, and we still teach that hierarchy, administration and bureaucracy driven by efficiency and effective thinking underpinned by a better division of tasks and responsibilities to drive organisational performance measurable objective is still best practice. The justification is that it represents nature and is natural.&nbsp;</p><p>Different models emerged from the internet, web, and digital thinking allowing us to ponder if something better is possible. Small iterations, such as matrix management, never really changed the fundamentals and whilst embracing all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_theory">stakeholders </a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_social,_and_corporate_governance">ESG</a> has added complexity to the decisions and models - hierarchy remains. However, it is possible to sense in the noise signals that “Data” is finally about to disrupt and dislodge a love/ hate affair with hierarchy, power, and control.&nbsp;</p><p>Counter to this and according to both scientists, individuals, including leaders, do not make their decisions after a thorough analysis, but first decide, unconsciously and intuitively, and then rationalise their decision. We have become experts in seeking out framed and biased data to justify and provide a rational argument for a decision we have already made.</p><p>-----</p><p>Endless inches have been written about structure, who and how to lead and what a digital organisation looks like. However, right now, we are likely to be in the death phase for a pure CDO (chief data/ digital officer) role as it becomes clear that the CTO, CIO and CDO roles have very similar mandates and are now actually competing for power, resources and a clear value to the organisation. The ridged ideals of separation and specialism models driving structures, management, incentives, KPI’s and hierarchy cannot work with the emergence of highly complex interdependency in a digital age - are we witnessing that the division of labour falls apart at scale because of complexity and speed?&nbsp;</p><p>For a complicated task, the separation of that task into modules, and components to create the scale of efficiency and effectiveness works, and it works really well. For any task where the output directly and immediately, because of close feedback loops, changes the inputs for the next unit of creation and consumption - the hierarchy fails.&nbsp; The ridged division of labour into separate tasks, modules, parts or components does not work - because it fundamentally needs repeatability.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When operating at speed and scale - but there is a high level of repeatability, hierarchy delivers, and we know its problems.&nbsp; However, data is enabling us to operate at speed, scale and uniqueness (non-repeatability) - this is different.&nbsp;</p><p>However, data is enabling us to operate at speed, scale and uniqueness (non-repeatability) - this is different.&nbsp;</p><p>---</p><p>We have recognised for a while that leadership/ chief roles are actually a representation of the ontology of an organisation (structure), the question has never been if you need a CEO, CFO, CMO, CTO as these were clearly delineated roles and specialisms.&nbsp; We understand the roles, mandates, powers and delegated authority the experts and leaders bring and have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In a digital business, we have created four roles CTO, CIO, CDO and CISO. But the reality is that the CMO and CDO need the CFO’s data. The CFO wants the COO and CMO’s data. The CIO has lots of data but no direct path to showing value. The CISO needs other data from outside the organisation and the CTO needs data the CMO has not yet imagined. Organisations opted to create new roles such as Chief Data or Digital Officer to address the emerging complexity and to avoid too much power being vested in the CTO.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Breaking the axis of old - the CEO/ CFO</p><p>The CEO/CFO axis has this framing; we’ll do more things that are cheaper in the short term and less of those that are more expensive in the long term as our incentive and remuneration guide us.&nbsp; In a company with unified incentives, there is a uniciation of framing which means it is difficult for new ideas to emerge.&nbsp; This incentive friction or incentive dependency means we always face the same decisions in the same way.</p><p>Many leaders are realising that data is forging changes, and this change is not about tech, data or analysis, but it is about whether we, the leadership, exec or board, are making the right decisions.&nbsp; Decisions of the past were framed by the ideal hierarchy underpinned by efficiency and effectiveness at scale driven by the demands for specialisation. However, to know we are making the right decision going forward, we need to understand we have the right choices today, which means we need all “data” and our data can no longer be about isolation, separation or specialisation.&nbsp;</p><p>I expect that we are about to see a new axis of power arrive with the emergence of a new chief role as we realise, we need a new power dynamic structure.&nbsp; A two-way axis (CEO/CFO) becomes a three-way stool.&nbsp; The emergence of the CEO/ CFO/ CxO. The CEO/ CFO will maintain the remits of controlling and understanding the speed and scale at which the hierarchy operates,&nbsp; with the new role focussing on uniqueness - how data breaks the old hierarchy. &nbsp; It does not matter what you call the X, the point is what is their mandate.&nbsp; They have to own:&nbsp;</p>  <p>the data philosophy</p>  <p>all data emerging from the company and its ecosystem&nbsp;</p>  <p>data governance and security</p>  <p>direct the current and future platform's abilities, functionality and performance</p>  <p>The point here is that this role is not about the analysis of the data but about ensuring the quality, attestation, providence, provenance, function, form, taxonomy, ontology and pedagogy of the data needed for decision and that we will continue to access to and enjoy the data we need to make better decisions.</p><p>The critical point is that once the CEO/CFO could know if they were making the right decisions as the framing they needed was about efficiency and effectiveness within a specialism model, however going forward, this axis is not only insufficient, it is damaging. This new third member is needed to provide modern-day stabilisation and governance to ensure that as an expanded team, “we know we are making the right decisions”, as we must regularly ask efficacy questions that were not needed under the old repeatability model, as the mission was sufficient as the guide.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The first victim will be the CDO, as it exists in a specialisation-driven hierarchy that has no choice but to change - not its structure and how it thinks.&nbsp;</p><br><br><br><br>

 It doesn’t know what to make of the Internet. 
 It’s obsolete in the extreme. 
 
<p>For most of the prior century, the news business was big. In tech parlance, it scaled. Here in the U.S. and Canada, every town had a newspaper, and in some cases several. Many towns—and all cities—had radio stations. Every name-brand city had a TV station, or two, or more. The great newsweeklies, Time and Newsweek, had millions of subscribers and made lots of money. So did TV network news operations. Newsstands were everywhere.</p>
<p>All of that has collapsed. Some print and broadcast news operations still exist, but most are shells of their former selves, and many put news icing on a cake of partisan talk shows. Exceptions to collapse are the surviving news giants (New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal), and resourceful public broadcasters. (<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/fact-sheet/public-broadcasting/">Pew Research shows</a> NPR’s audience has long topped 20 million people, though it is slowly declining.)</p>
<p>People today get most of their news through phones, tablets, and laptops. These are packed with apps that maximize optionality. People now hardly listen, watch, or read on schedules set by publishers, stations, or networks. Everyone with a smartphone had a limitless variety of news sources. Or sources within sources such as Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and old-fashioned social media such as Facebook and X.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/11/15/more-americans-are-getting-news-on-tiktok-bucking-the-trend-seen-on-most-other-social-media-sites/">According to Pew</a>, the top news sources for young people today are TikTok and social media. In other words, from each other. The threshold of news creation and production is also low. This is why, <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/number-of-podcasts#number-of-podcasts">according to Exploding Topics</a>, there are now over three million podcasts worldwide.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Galloway_(professor)">Scott Galloway</a> put it in a recent <a href="https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/pivot">Pivot</a> podcast (which I can’t find right now), news is a shitty business—at least if you want to scale up something huge. It’s not even a great small business. But hell, neither is running a restaurant, a nail salon, a clothing shop, or a small farm. But those are real businesses.</p>
<p>As Jeff Jarvis makes clear in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gutenberg-Parenthesis-Print-Lessons-Internet/dp/1501394827">The Gutenberg Parenthesis: The Age of Print and Its Lessons for the Age of the Internet</a> (which I highly recommend), we are at the end of one long era and the start of another one.</p>
<p>In these early years of The Internet Age, the most substantive news and news businesses are the local kind. True, not everybody cares about local news. But everybody lives somewhere, and it does matter what goes on where people live. <a href="https://buzzmachine.com/2024/01/03/a-journalism-of-belief-and-belonging/">Belonging</a> somewhere in the virtual world is optional, but it is mandatory in the physical one. And, as with running a restaurant, a store, or a farm, reporting local news is a labor of talent and love. It’s what we still call “a living.”</p>
<p>Right now there are three models for the local news business: advertising, subscription, and philanthropy. In my <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/01/05/the-new-news-business/">next post</a>, the eighth in <a href="https://doc.searls.com/news-commons/">this series</a>, I’ll lay out the case for a fourth one.</p>
 
<p>*I didn’t try Midjourney, DALL-E 3, or Stable Diffusion because they all require subscriptions, and I don’t feel like paying for those yet. DALL-E 2 yielded blah results.</p>

<p>This article shows how to secure a Blazor Server application. The application implements an OpenID Connect confidential client with PKCE using .NET 8 and configures the security headers as best possible for the Blazor Server application. OpenIddict is used to implement the identity provider and the OpenID Connect server.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/BlazorServerOidc">https://github.com/damienbod/BlazorServerOidc</a></p>







<p></p>



 OpenID Connect flow 



<p>In the first step, the authentication can be solved using OpenID Connect. With this, the process of user authentication is removed from the client application and delegated to an identity provider. In this demo, <a href="https://github.com/openiddict/openiddict-core">OpenIddict </a>is used. The <a href="https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/">OpenID Connect</a> code flow with PKCE is used and the application uses a client secret to authenticate. This can be further improved by using a certificate and client assertions when using the  code from the OpenID Connect flow to request the tokens. The flow can also be improved to use OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9126">PAR</a>, if the identity provider supports this. </p>



<p>In ASP.NET Core or Blazor, this can be implemented using the Microsoft ASP.NET Core OpenIdConnect package.</p>



 
 Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect 
 



<p>The authentication flow requires some service setup as well as middleware changes in the pipelines. The solution uses the OpenID Connect scheme to take care of the user authentication and saves this in a cookie. The name claim is set to use the “name” claim. This is different with every identity provider and also depending how the ASP.NET Core application maps this. All razor page requests must be authenticated unless otherwise specified.</p>


  builder.Services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
{
  options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
  options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddCookie()
.AddOpenIdConnect(options =&gt;
{
  builder.Configuration.GetSection("OpenIDConnectSettings").Bind(options);

  options.SignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
  options.ResponseType = OpenIdConnectResponseType.Code;

  options.SaveTokens = true;
  options.GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint = true;
  options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
  {
	  NameClaimType = "name"
  };
});

builder.Services.AddRazorPages().AddMvcOptions(options =&gt;
{
  var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
	  .RequireAuthenticatedUser()
	  .Build();
  options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
});

builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews(options =&gt;
    options.Filters.Add(new AutoValidateAntiforgeryTokenAttribute()));
  


<p>The application pipeline is setup after the services are built. ASP.NET Core adds some automatic claim mapping and renames some claims per default. This can be reset to use the exact claims sent back from the identity provider. </p>


  var app = builder.Build();

JsonWebTokenHandler.DefaultInboundClaimTypeMap.Clear();

if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
    app.UseHsts();
}

app.UseSecurityHeaders(
    SecurityHeadersDefinitions.GetHeaderPolicyCollection(
        app.Environment.IsDevelopment(),
        app.Configuration["OpenIDConnectSettings:Authority"]));

app.UseHttpsRedirection();

app.UseStaticFiles();

app.UseRouting();

app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();

app.MapRazorPages();
app.MapControllers();

app.MapBlazorHub().RequireAuthorization();
app.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");

app.Run();
  


 CascadingAuthenticationState 



<p>The CascadingAuthenticationState is used to force and share the authentication requirements in the UI and the Blazor Server components. If the application and the user are not authenticated and authorized, the user is redirected to the identity provider.</p>


  @inject NavigationManager NavigationManager

&lt;CascadingAuthenticationState&gt;
    &lt;Router AppAssembly="@typeof(App).Assembly"&gt;
        &lt;Found Context="routeData"&gt;
            &lt;AuthorizeRouteView RouteData="@routeData" DefaultLayout="@typeof(MainLayout)"&gt;
                &lt;NotAuthorized&gt;
                    @{
                        var returnUrl = NavigationManager.ToBaseRelativePath(NavigationManager.Uri);
                        NavigationManager.NavigateTo($"api/account/login?redirectUri={returnUrl}", forceLoad: true);
                    }
                &lt;/NotAuthorized&gt;
                &lt;Authorizing&gt;
                    Wait...
                &lt;/Authorizing&gt;
            &lt;/AuthorizeRouteView&gt;
        &lt;/Found&gt;
        &lt;NotFound&gt;
            &lt;LayoutView Layout="@typeof(MainLayout)"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Sorry, there's nothing at this address.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/LayoutView&gt;
        &lt;/NotFound&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
&lt;/CascadingAuthenticationState&gt;
  


<p></p>



 Authentication flow UI Pages 



<p>The menu needs to display the login or the logout buttons depends on the state of the application. Blazor provides an AuthorizeView component for this. This can be used in the UI to hide or show elements depending on the authenticate state.</p>


  &lt;AuthorizeView&gt;
    &lt;Authorized&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;@context.User.Identity?.Name&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;form action="api/account/logout" method="post"&gt;
            &lt;button type="submit" class="nav-link btn btn-link text-dark"&gt;
                 Logout 
            &lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;/Authorized&gt;
    &lt;NotAuthorized&gt;
        &lt;a href="api/account/login?redirectUri=/"&gt;Log in&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/NotAuthorized&gt;
&lt;/AuthorizeView&gt;
  


<p>I added a log in, log out in an account controller and signed out Razor page to handle the authentication requests from the UI. The application automatically authenticates so the login is only used in the signed out page. The login removes the authenticated user from both schemes; the cookie and the OpenID Connect scheme. To remove the authenticated user from the identity provider, the application needs to redirect. This cannot be implemented in an ajax request.</p>


  [IgnoreAntiforgeryToken] // need to apply this to the form post request
[Authorize]
[HttpPost("Logout")]
public IActionResult Logout()
{
    return SignOut(
        new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = "/SignedOut" },
        CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
        OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
}
  


<p>The SignedOut is the only unauthorized page, component in the application. The AllowAnonymous is used for this. </p>


  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages;

namespace BlazorServerOidc.Pages;

[AllowAnonymous]
public class SignedOutModel : PageModel
{
    public void OnGet() { }
}
  


<p></p>



 Security headers 



<p>The user is authenticated. The application need to protect the session as well. I use NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders for this. </p>



 
 NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders 



 NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders.TagHelpers 
 



<p>Blazor Server is a severed rendered application with UI components. The application can implement nonce based CSP. All the typical security headers are added as best possible for this technology.</p>


  namespace BlazorServerOidc;

public static class SecurityHeadersDefinitions
{
    public static HeaderPolicyCollection GetHeaderPolicyCollection(bool isDev, string? idpHost)
    {
        ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(idpHost);

        var policy = new HeaderPolicyCollection()
            .AddFrameOptionsDeny()
            .AddContentTypeOptionsNoSniff()
            .AddReferrerPolicyStrictOriginWhenCrossOrigin()
            .AddCrossOriginOpenerPolicy(builder =&gt; builder.SameOrigin())
            .AddCrossOriginResourcePolicy(builder =&gt; builder.SameOrigin())
            .AddCrossOriginEmbedderPolicy(builder =&gt; builder.RequireCorp()) // remove for dev if using hot reload
            .AddContentSecurityPolicy(builder =&gt;
            {
                builder.AddObjectSrc().None();
                builder.AddBlockAllMixedContent();
                builder.AddImgSrc().Self().From("data:");
                builder.AddFormAction().Self().From(idpHost);
                builder.AddFontSrc().Self();        
                builder.AddBaseUri().Self();
                builder.AddFrameAncestors().None();

                builder.AddStyleSrc()
                    .UnsafeInline() 
                    .Self();

                builder.AddScriptSrc()
                    .WithNonce()
                    .UnsafeInline(); // only a fallback for older browsers when the nonce is used

                // disable script and style CSP protection if using Blazor hot reload
                // if using hot reload, DO NOT deploy with an insecure CSP
            })
            .RemoveServerHeader()
            .AddPermissionsPolicy(builder =&gt;
            {
                builder.AddAccelerometer().None();
                builder.AddAutoplay().None();
                builder.AddCamera().None();
                builder.AddEncryptedMedia().None();
                builder.AddFullscreen().All();
                builder.AddGeolocation().None();
                builder.AddGyroscope().None();
                builder.AddMagnetometer().None();
                builder.AddMicrophone().None();
                builder.AddMidi().None();
                builder.AddPayment().None();
                builder.AddPictureInPicture().None();
                builder.AddSyncXHR().None();
                builder.AddUsb().None();
            });

        if (!isDev)
        {
            // maxage = one year in seconds
            policy.AddStrictTransportSecurityMaxAgeIncludeSubDomains();
        }

        policy.ApplyDocumentHeadersToAllResponses();

        return policy;
    }
}
  


<p>The CSP nonces are added to all scripts in the UI.</p>

<p>Getting started in an ISO committee involves applying for accreditation as a national standards body expert in the domain; connecting up to the wikis and email lists; attaching to the document management system; and locating the ‘active coal face’<a>1</a> – the precise status of each interesting project. Not trivial. It’s the same pattern for every standards body – getting caught up takes effort.</p>



<p>There are six work groups within SC 37. I’ll be spending most of my time in WG 5 (Biometric Testing and Reporting) and WG 4 (Technical Implementation of Biometric Systems). WG 1 (Harmonized Biometric Vocabulary), WG 2 (Biometric Technical Interfaces), WG 3 (Biometric Data Interchange Formats) and WG 6 (Cross-Jurisdictional and Societal Aspects of Biometrics) will receive attention as and when needed.</p>



<p>Here are some of the projects that look immediately interesting to me. My opinion will certainly change as I get into the work </p>



 
 ISO/IEC 30107-3 — Biometric presentation attack detection — Part 3: Testing and reporting 



 ISO/IEC 30107-4:2020 — Information technology — Biometric presentation attack detection — Part 4: Profile for testing of mobile devices 



 ISO/IEC TS 19795-9:2019 — Information technology — Biometric performance testing and reporting — Part 9: Testing on mobile devices 



 ISO/IEC 20059 — Vulnerability of Biometric Recognition Systems with Respect to Morphing Attacks 



 ISO/IEC 9868 — Remote biometric identification systems — Design, development, and audit 



 ISO/IEC 29794-5 — Face image quality assessment 



 ISO/IEC TR 22116:2021 — A study of the differential impact of demographic factors in biometric recognition system performance 



 ISO/IEC 19795-10 — Quantifying biometric system performance variation across demographic groups 



 ISO/IEC 39794-5:2019 — Information technology — Extensible biometric data interchange formats — Part 5: Face image data 
 



<p>One observation that I must confirm: SC 37 appears to be oriented to controlled-environment biometric systems: where the operator of the system controls the sensors, hardware and software. </p>



<p>I believe, for now, that there are additional design requirements for the exponential-growth bring-your-own biometric sensor (on your mobile device). And this aspect is very interesting to me. My company’s product does remote ID Proofing and Verification using biometric evaluation for linking, and biometric re-verification (aka “returning user authentication”). We construct 3D face models for proof of liveness and matching. We are concerned with proven liveness and end to end device/sensor security (for mobile devices cameras and webcams). </p>



<p>Performance testing, presentation attack detection/performance, mobile-first and face-first topics are hot now.</p>



<p>I’m about to find out the level of international interest and state of standardization in these areas during the SC 37 plenary at Okayama in January 2024 – wish me luck!. </p>



 


  Realizing that ‘active coal face’ is a dying idiom — but what is the climate-friendly replacement? Maybe the ‘code repo pull requests page’? I invite you to respond! <a>︎</a>

My last four boxes of Trader Joe’s High Fiber Cereal
<p>A while back, my gastroenterologist insisted that I get accustomed to eating high-fiber cereal in the morning. And so I have. It does work.</p>
<p>He recommended Fiber One. I didn’t like it, but I put up with it until I found Trader Joe’s version, which tasted much better. Since Bloomington is more than an hour from a Trader Joe’s in Indianapolis (there are two on the north side, while we are way down to the south), I stock up when we’re up that way.</p>
<p>Or I used to.</p>
<p>In Palm Desert for Thanksgiving, I went to a Trader Joe’s there to find High Fiber Cereal missing from the shelves. When I asked a crew member (they’re called that) if they had any in the back, she came back out with the manager to tell me that High Fiber Cereal had, regrettably, been discontinued.</p>
<p>I did not take it well.</p>
<p>I then told them that I also lament earlier discontinuations of the house-brand Ancient Grains granola and its thick, labneh-like strained Greek yogurt. As I reported in the chapter about Trader Joe’s in The Intention Economy, the company takes customer requests to heart.</p>
<p>I also <a href="https://www.cozymeal.com/magazine/fiber-one-shortage">see here</a> that Fiber One is not getting out to store shelves, thanks to what General Mills calls “supply issues.” Since most of Trader Joe’s branded goods are made by other companies (including, presumably, General Mills), perhaps High Fiber Cereal will be re-continued.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, here’s to a good digestive 2024.</p>

<p>December 22, 2023 was my last day at <a href="https://nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a>. My tenure was just
under two and a half years.</p>
<p>My first 19 months at the company were pretty much everything <a href="https://justatheory.com/2021/08/sign-o-the-times/" title="Sign O' The Times">I had hoped</a>, as
I collaborated with Design and Product to design a distributed platform and
conceived, designed, and implemented <a href="https://justatheory.com/2023/10/cipherdoc/" title="CipherDoc: A Searchable, Encrypted JSON Document Service on Postgres">CipherDoc</a>, a service for encrypted data
management. I’m incredibly proud of that work!</p>
<p>But alas, plans change. After the company mothballed the project, I refocused my
time on <a href="https://noidea.dog/glue" title="Tanya Reilly: “Being Glue”">glue work</a>: re-platforming services, upgrading runtimes and
dependencies, improving logging and observability, and documenting code,
architectures, and playbooks. It felt good to reduce the onboarding,
maintenance, and on-call overhead for my teams; I hope it helps them to be more
productive and fulfilled in their work.</p>
<p>I treasure the terrific people I met at The Times, just super thoughtful,
empathetic, and creative co-workers, partners, and colleagues. It’s no wonder
they had the energy to form a union, <a href="https://nytimesguild.org/tech/">The Times Tech Guild</a>, for which I’m
gratified to have helped organize and steward members. The Guild connected me
with a far broader range of talented and committed people than I would have
otherwise. I will miss them all, and continue to cheer for and support the
movement from the outside.</p>
<p>And now, as 2023 winds down, I’ve decided to try something new. More news
in the new year!</p>

  In 2019, I transitioned from independent consulting to IDEMIA, contributing to the ISO subcommittee for Mobile Driving License.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>In 2019 I decided to leave independent consulting and join a large corporation – IDEMIA – you might notice their logos at airport security stations. My job was to be embedded in the ISO subcommittee for Mobile Driving License, a.k.a. the ISO 18013-5 mDL standard and to support IDEMIA’s mobile eID/mDL product team. This was a great extension of my existing work on digital credentials in other ISO subcommittees and W3C groups. Being tied to a product team was a new experience for me!</p>



<p>In 2021 I moved to Ping Identity to support the product team for PingOne Neo – ID Verify and Digital Credentials. My focus remained on government-issued digital credentials via ISO mDL and to establish implementations of inter-company digital credentials . I had the privilege of working beside incredibly experienced and generous standards experts who continue to be deeply embedded in OpenID Foundation, IETF, FIDO, Open Wallet Foundation core work. The novelty of Ping was to see how a new product can be engineered to fit into an overarching suite of enterprise products. The interplay of product and corporate priorities on the one hand and the long time scale of standardization on the other led to some “interesting” discussions over my time at Ping.</p>



<p>One constant throughout has been my involvement with <a href="http://KantaraInitiative.org">Kantara Initiative</a>. This non-profit corporation continues to be a bright light in the world of trustworthy use identity and personal information. I’m currently Chair of the Identity Assurance Work Group and since 2023, Chair of the Board of Directors. Kantara has had great fortune in our Executive Directors over the years – from Joni Brennan to Colin Wallis and now Kay Chopard. The Board is working hard to strengthen our program offerings (as a conformance body for NIST 800-63 and the UK DIATF), expand into new geographies, and sustain innovation in our community work groups – while fiscally prudent and in line with our fiduciary duty to the organization and its members.</p>



<p>At the end of 2023, I have decided to pivot my attention to a big missing piece in the digital credentials story – how to ensure that the recipient of a digital credential is a real human (and the intended one), and that the presenter of a digital credential is in fact authorized to do so. I have joined <a href="http://www.facetec.com">Facetec</a> to dive deep into the world of liveness-proven biometric verification. Their tech is impressive. The SDK uses the mobile device camera to construct a 3D face model of the person from which it determines whether there’s a real living human present, whether the session is a spoof attempt (using physical artifacts or video playbacks), and whether images are being injected bypassing the camera subsystem. The server SDK completes the liveness analysis and performs highly-accurate matching against a known-good reference. My job? Same-same. Working with international standards bodies (such as ISO SC 37) and testing labs to develop or extend standards for performance evaluation of this new 3D face biometric mode. I’m ingesting big stacks of documents and trying to work out where standardization of user-supplied biometric-enabled devices stands today – in comparison with the well-established border security/public safety modes of operation. This is exciting new ground and appears to be mostly greenfield – and it all ties back to the IDM and digital credentials industry. </p>

Prompt: ” hardscrabble farms next to a suburb full of volvo station wagons”
<p>Several thousand years ago, when I was on leave from journalism and working as a marketing dweeb, my small North Carolina firm learned about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claritas_Prizm">PRIZM (Potential Rating Index for Zip Markets)</a>, a techy new service that told me that my rural zip code was “Hardscrabble,” while the next one over was a suburb PRIZM called “Volvo Wagons” or something.</p>
<p>My current zip, in Bloomington, Indiana, features five out of PRIZM’s 68 numbered types:</p>
 
 48 Generation Web—Low Income Younger Family Mix 
 47 Striving Selfies—Lower Midscale Middle Age Mostly w/o Kids 
 15 New Homesteaders—Wealthy Middle Age Mostly w/ Kids 
 51 Campers &amp; Camo—Lower Midscale Middle Age Family Mix 
 66 New Beginnings—Low Income Younger Family Mix 
 
<p>None of which describes me or my wife.</p>
<p>Sort of close is 05 – Country Squires: “Members of this segment fled the city life for the charms of small-town living. Many have executive jobs and live in recently built homes.” Except we didn’t flee and our home was built in&nbsp; 1899 or 1915. (Sources differ.) But we are building a house, so maybe that counts.</p>
<p>A bit closer is 20 – Empty Nests: “Most residents are over 65 years old, but they show no interest in a rest-home retirement. With their grown-up children out of the house they pursue active, and activist, lifestyles.”</p>
<p>But all of that stuff is just name-calling against typified populations—a form of -ism not much different than racism, sexism, or ageism. That’s why, on the receiving end, we tend not to like it, even if it brings us ‘relevant’ messages from sellers. (This happens far less than sellers think, and typically at the cost of privacy lost to surveillance.)</p>
<p>All of us are as different as our faces and voices. Being different than everybody—even ourselves five minutes ago—is among our most human qualities. We all grow and change constantly, whether we want to or not.</p>
<p>Marketing didn’t get that when PRIZM was invented in 1980, and it doesn’t get it today, for the simple reason that marketing was not built for talking to people. It was built for typifying people.</p>
<p><a href="https://doc.searls.com/2021/12/21/rage-in-peace/">Chris Locke</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Weinberger">David Weinberger</a>, Rick Levine, and I all thought there was hope for marketing when we wrote <a href="http://cluetrain.com">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a> in 1999, because we saw the Internet as a radically new way to connect the demand and supply sides of markets directly, and personally.</p>
<p>But marketing instead saw the Internet as a great way to spy on people and to typify them more than ever.&nbsp; PRIZM persists, entrenched as ever. And conversations among customers and marketers happen in two very different and disconnected echo chambers, mostly using giant corporate platforms.</p>
<p>For a sense of how thoroughly disconnected those chambers are, see any of Tom Fishburne’s <a href="https://marketoonist.com/">Marketoons</a>. They’re brilliant and spot-on.</p>
<p>They also make clear—at least to me—that Cluetrain won’t prove right until marketing gets out of the way.</p>
<p>Which it won’t on its own. Our side—the customers’ side—needs to obsolesce it.</p>
 
<p>The image above was generated by the prompt in the caption under it, using what currently calls itself <a href="https://www.bing.com/images/create/">Microsoft Bing Image Creator from Designer</a>, which persists Microsoft’s long tradition of aversive and unmemorable names for products.</p>

<p>
I’m lucky to have two hands, let’s be clear, and the minor struggles I’ve had with them over the years don’t qualify as any kind of real hardship. Yet there have been a lot of small injuries — an ongoing annoyance made worse by being mostly my fault.</p>
<p>
Consider the most recent incident. To relieve strain on my left hand, I switched a few months ago from a steel-string to a nylon-string guitar. I knew I wanted the lesser force required to press nylon strings, and the vacation from steel strings has really helped. The wider spacing between the strings is also better for my hands, I realized as I settled in. I’d started on a classical guitar, then hadn’t owned one in decades, it feels good to have one again and I’ve been playing it a lot.</p>
<p>
Being the guy who wrote a blog post about an early warning system for RSI <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/07/23/is-there-an-early-warning-system-for-rsi/">not even six months</a> ago, I see the absurdity of my situation. Back in July I was rehabbing an overextended little finger. Now I’m rehabbing a thumb and related muscles insulted by my failure to properly adapt to the new instrument. </p>
<p>
You can wrap your thumb around the narrower neck of a steel-string guitar in order to grab the lowest string. You can do that with the wider neck of classical guitar too. But as I probably learned the first time and then forgot, you really shouldn’t. A D major chord with F# in the bass is too much of a stretch for the thumb, at least for my thumb, on a classical guitar. You won’t see classical guitarists do that. Instead they’ll make a tripod with the index, middle, and ring fingers. </p>
<p>
So once again I get to rewire my hand posture. Which, again, is a minor hardship, not remotely comparable to the guy I mentioned last time who had to switch sides and learn to fret with his right hand. As I also mentioned there, he found an upside. Now he’s a switch-hitter who can use both halves of his brain directly. In my case, I’m trying to embrace the rewiring as a way to break a habit and form new neural pathways. It’d be nice, though, if that weren’t always a response to self-inflicted injury!</p>
<p>
But like I said, it’s a minor hardship. My hands could have been mangled in my dad’s car engine that one time, or in the anchor chain of Ben Smith’s boat that other time: two escapes from disaster that still provoke the occasional nightmare. I’m lucky to have these two hands, and again vow to take better care of them.</p>
<p>
Why is it so hard (for me, at least) to detect and avoid injurious hand postures? I guess it’s because whatever you’re projecting — when you write sentences or lines of code, or play notes and chords — has to flow through your hands with minimal conscious attention to your hands. Note to self: pay more attention.</p>

The use of the phrase “critical mass” in this NYTimes story about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/24/opinion/goodreads-books-reviews.html">the enshittification of Goodreads</a> stopped me in my tracks.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Give all of Goodreads’s issues, it might seem easy enough to encourage writers and readers simply to flock to another forum. Sites like The Storygraph and Italic Type have sprung up as promising alternatives, but they’re still far from reaching a critical mass of users.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Nuclear physicists know they are dancing with the devil when they bring fissile material to criticality. They also know that the reaction can be controlled, that it must be, and that the means of control obey well-understood principles. </p>
<p>
Social sites typically push toward supercriticality with no such understanding. If Goodreads enshittifies at 125 million users, why would another service expect a different outcome at similar scale? </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
We can learn from a natural experiment. Not mentioned in the story is a long-running service, <a href="https://librarything.com">LibraryThing</a>, that’s been going strong since 2005. I interviewed its founder and lead developer, Tim Spalding, back in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729204047id_/http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3595.html">2008</a>. Listening to that interview again today reminded me that everything I loved about LibraryThing remains important and matters even more now. </p>
<p>
LibraryThing was, and remains, a place where you make and share lists of books in order to connect with other people and with books — not primarily via friend relationships but rather book relationships. It’s a small business that’s kept Tim and his crew happily engaged in serving a few million bibliophiles, some of whom pay a membership fee to be super-cataloguers. </p>
<p>
I’m not in LibraryThing’s core demographic. Books aren’t as central to my life as they are to members of the service who carefully curate their own lists, tag books and authors, contribute to a <a href="https://www.librarything.com/commonknowledge/">common knowledge wiki</a>, and write reviews. But I appreciate their work when I visit the site.</p>
<p>
Today I added Ed Yong’s remarkable <a href="https://www.librarything.com/catalog/Jon.Udell&amp;bookid=254714845">An Immense World</a> to my list. Among the book’s dozens of reviews on the site, I found a <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/27607715/reviews/219586107">2000-word essay</a> that usefully highlights many of the strange (to humans) powers of animal perception that Yong describes. </p>
<p>
I guess LibraryThing isn’t on the Times’ radar because it hasn’t reached a critical mass of … what, exactly? Tens of millions of people? Hundreds of millions? I’m glad it hasn’t! That’s a recipe for meltdown. LibraryThing has been going strong, for almost two decades, in the Goldilocks zone: neither too little activity nor too much, just the right amount for meaningful experiences at human scale. </p>
<p>
I feel the same way about Mastodon. Conventional wisdom says it’s dead in the water: “nobody” goes there, no Mastodon apps <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/12/app_store_rankings_as_a_proxy_for_social_network_momentum">rank highly</a> in the app stores. But if critical mass means operating at the scale of Twitter or Facebook, then who wants that? Who benefits from the inevitable enshittification? Not me, and probably not you.</p>
<p>
LibraryThing shows that a controlled reaction, at smaller scale, is sustainable over time. Mastodon so far has been successful in the same way, and I see no reason why that can’t continue. Although Mastodon is young, my connections there date back to social networking’s roots in the early blogosphere. It feels like the right amount of critical mass. For me, a billion people on Mastodon is an anti-goal. I would much rather see hundreds or maybe thousands of healthy communities emerge, each operating in its own Goldilocks zone. Many small and safe critical masses, instead of a few huge and dangerous ones, powering small businesses whose proprietors are — like Tim Spalding and his crew — able to maintain real relationships with their customers. </p>
<p>
That global conversation we thought we were having on Twitter? We don’t know how to control that reaction and I’m not sure it makes sense to try. </p>

<p>As I have come to see it, the world consists of mounds of information, much of it digital. Our days are spent encountering, reacting, and sifting through it. Our conscious genius pulls together threads from which are crafted uplifting, foreboding, humorous, and tragic stories. We live inside these stories alone or with like-minded people. Most of the time our minds simply tweak and update unfolding dramas of consensus reality or a particular flavor of alternate reality; it’s an efficient, largely automatic process.</p>
<p>Rarely do we toss out whole plot lines and start from scratch. Why? Well, there would be so many subplots left hanging and so many question marks around our relational identities that the uncertainty of getting everything sorted out means it’s generally easier to keep on the established path. Jettisoning a comfortably broken-in outlook is a very messy business; and how often, really, do we feel the need to, or empowered to, rip apart the boxes we inhabit?</p>
<p>Each of us has the ability to craft amazing stories out of fascinating facts and extend invitations to loved ones and complete strangers to come inside and look around, sit a spell, and make themselves at home. There is, however, no way to compel another person to hang out in the story you made. You can’t even force them to cross your threshold. Exhort and cajole all you want, the stories we inhabit remain a personal choice, as they should be. Just as you wouldn’t want to have to live inside someone else’s ill-fitting story, the same goes for everyone else. It’s a hard truth. It can hurt.</p>
<p>Our acceptance of the primacy of the digital world has meant that the velocity and intensity of social physics has changed. My experience of these changes have been dramatic and potentially catastrophic, at least in the short run. The web3 protocol layer system seems intent on launching us all into a digital-twin simulation cloudmind whether we’ve elected to participate or not. Left in the wake of this century-long noetic campaign is the wreckage of once deeply-held relationships, relationships with those who are (or were) close to us in heart – actual physical hearts, not emojis, up-votes, and clicks.</p>
<p>There are too many digital stories, too many doors, too much unease with the masses either searching for answers or working really hard to avoid seeing the holes being torn in the fabric of what we once understood as “reality.” Our story rooms may now be filled with people from far flung corners of the globe. These are people whose heart fields we’ll probably never have the opportunity to feel directly – no mingled auras from warm embraces, conversations over cups of tea, shared meals, card games, porch sitting, bonfires, jam sessions.</p>
<p>In some cases, those whose heart fields we shared in the actual world have wandered off to the digital rooms of sirens, forsaking old connections for greener pastures. The transformation, turbo-charged by the lockdowns, happened with ferocious speed and offered little chance for redress, remedy, or reconciliation. We didn’t know what hit us. Then it was over, and everything had changed.</p>
<p>This is the first Christmas I’ve ever spent alone, totally alone. I was cancelled for breaking out of my box, looking around, asking questions, and imploring people to start having conversations about emerging technology and cybernetics and finance and consciousness and gaming before we go the way of the Lotus Eaters. Maybe I was cancelled for my intensity. I don’t know, the only thing I was told is that it was about “my research.” </p>
<p>I’ve made it through a tearful week. Lots of tears shed during my Christmas Eve read aloud finishing “Momo.” I apologize for the five-month gap, but I know in my heart I was supposed to read it last night. I keep saying time is not what we think it is. In the end of Ende’s story, the hour-lily wielding Momo and the tortoise Cassiopeia save the day and defeat the time bankers. The children return to the amphitheater for free play, grown-ups shelve their Taylorist tendencies, the town’s humanity is restored, and Momo doesn’t have to be alone anymore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The “Momo” read-aloud playlist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnNSjVGWqTO459LMtWwG0z4jKbv92moN5">here</a>.</p>
<p>I feel we are on Earth, sparks of God’s divine creation, to experience, falter, learn, and feel in the depths of our souls. The holidays are a season of big feelings – even more so when you’ve lost a loved one to the great beyond and other loved ones to the pit-traps of sinister social physics. The afternoon was mild here in Philadelphia, and I took the opportunity to fill my basket with gatherings and head out to the Kelpius Cave in the Wissahickon- alchemy of the soul. What better balm could there be than to lay out a heart-felt intention to close a rocky year?</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I thought that I was going to decamp to Seattle in the summer I took all of my precious nature materials with a friend to Valley Forge and created a magnificent spiral between Mount Misery and Mount Joy. Since I returned, I’ve accumulated a few more items – feathers and quartz from Arkansas, acorns from Laurel Hill cemetery, dried flowers from birthday carnations I bought myself, and gifts from friends across the country. I took them with a candle to the park and lit up the darkness and asked God for guidance to do the next right thing. </p>
<p>Once you’ve ripped up the boxes you really need a divine compass.</p>
<p>The coming year should bring new opportunities in Hot Springs, Arkansas after we sell the family home in the spring – fingers crossed someone wants to pay a good price for a well-loved 1880s row house with many original features. I’m hoping 2024 will be gentler than the clear-the-decks tsunami of the past six months. I met my husband when I was twenty. We grew up together. This divorce is my first break-up. I know that sounds ridiculous, and yet it’s true. I am my own person, and I know my own mind. That said, I’m going to have to craft my own new traditions and ways of doing things as a single person and doing that feels overwhelming right now. Will I ever celebrate Christmas again? It’s hard to say. It’s also been two years since my child has spoken to me. Prayers for reconciliation would be welcome. I still love my family. I am fine with them living in the story of their choice. I think we could create a shared space that bridges our separate boxes.</p>
<p>Despite the waves of difficultly I’ve been navigating since 2019, I know I would die a dysfunctional person had I elected to live the rest of my life inside stories I knew to be fundamentally flawed in their incompleteness and injurious to my spirit. So, I’m just going to put one foot in front of the other and try not to be afraid of a future with a lone heart-field. </p>
<p>I’m Jerry Hawver’s daughter, and Hawvers “git er done.”</p>
<p>Merry Christmas everyone. Thanks for stopping by my story, even if we can’t mingle our actual auras. May the new year bring blessings to you and your loved ones. Our power is in the heart – hugs all around. Hug your people as much as you can while you have them near you. It’s a sad day when you have no one to hug.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>A light in the darkness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Stones and brick, rubble from the floor of the “cave,” outline the heart.&nbsp; A ring of soft pine needles mingled with dried purple carnations and white Alstroemeria sprinkled with green leaves gifted from California and the last of my creosote gifted to me last year by Dru in Tucson for my birthday – it smells like the desert in the rain.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The next ring was an outline of pinecones gathered in the park with ferns and white pine sprigs and gifted dandelion seed heads that lit up the dark like stars.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I used a large stone as a centerpiece to hold many assorted lovely things lit by a candle.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A soft, leathery buckeye casing holding a spiral shell and manzanita berries with some Arkansas quartz below it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Quartz and a shed snakeskin for sparkly new beginnings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The last sprig of sage from Standing Rock gifted to me by Jason with a bit of fungus above it and acorns from which mighty things grow.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And an oak leaf for strength and fortitude.</p>
<p></p>
<p>River pebbles – may the rich tapestry of our experiences, both beautiful and challenging, rub us to a polished crystalline smooth symmetry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>May we have the wits to find our way through the worm holes and arrive on the other side.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Smoke from a wrapped mullein leaf gifted to me by a beautiful family in Washington state, thank you kind herbalist and standing farmer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And this ridiculous figurine was already there when I arrived, in a niche made from where a portion of the wall had fallen away. I have no idea of the meaning behind it, but I suspect the trickster energy was perhaps expecting me. Bittersweet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Philadelphia has brought me a depth of understanding my life would not have had if I had landed somewhere else. While I am grateful for its many stories, I see it’s time to move on. Goodbye for now Kelpius Cave, ritual anchor for the Nephele era.</p>

<p>このシチリアーノは、バッハの作品の中で最も有名な曲の一つですが、一方では贋作疑惑がある曲でもあります。スタイルがバッハとちょっと違うのです。同時代のクヴァンツの曲を下敷きに弟子が書いたものにバッハが手を入れたのではないかとも言われています。これをバッハ作と伝えているのは、次男のこれも大作曲家のC.P.E.バッハ（彼についてはわたしの<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2014/08/2498/">ブログ「クラシック音楽の父、C.P.E.バッハ〜生誕300年」</a>を御覧ください）がそう記録しているからですが、弟子である彼自身が書いたものに父親が手を入れたものに父の名を記録したのではないかとも言われています<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/12/5465/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5465" title="詳しくは、<a href=&quot;https://sakimura.org/2014/02/2206/&quot;>「バッハのシチリアーノって、J.S.Bach作じゃ無いよね…」</a>をご参照ください。">1</a>。</p>



<p>ことしもいろいろなことが有りました。身近な人も何人も亡くしました<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/12/5465/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5465" title="松下さん、Vittorioさん、Morio さん">2</a>。世界の情勢も暗い色を示しており、女性や子供を多く含む非戦闘員が虐殺されています。なぜ人類は歴史に学ばないのかと思わせる日々です。そのような情勢から、普段の年とは違い、非宗教的な曲を選びました。本当はフォーレのIn Paradisumか賛美歌のVeni Emanuel をやろうかと思っていたのですが、地名が出てきてしまう<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/12/5465/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-5465" title="それぞれ、エルサレム、イスラエル、が出てくる">3</a>ので…。 </p>



<p>曲の背景の動画は主にシチリア島のものです。エトナ山やシラクサの灯台などが出てきます。平和な風景と音楽とが、みなさまの心に平安をもたらしますことを。 それでは、良い年の瀬を。</p>

I do a lot more cycling in Sonoma County, California than was possible in Cheshire County, New Hampshire. The Mediterranean climate here, which enables me to ride year-round, is a blessing for my mental and physical well-being. And because the topography is even more rugged, I’m doing more climbing that ever. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Yesterday, Luann dropped me at the Coleman Overlook on the coast and I cycled home from there. I’m not a fast climber, I can’t keep up with younger friends when we cycle together, and <a href="https://www.mapmyride.com/routes/view/5857726231">my rides</a> aren’t extreme by local standards. But my cumulative elevation gain over the course of a year far exceeds what it ever was back east, and I’ve had plenty of time to reflect on climbing strategy.</p>
<p>
A better gear ratio would help, but my older road bike won’t accommodate that. So on the steepest pitches I switch to a weaving ascent that eases the grade, which I’ve decided is OK. For a while I resisted shoes with cleats that lock into pedals, but now I use them to gain extra leverage which really helps. </p>
<p>
It’s never mainly about the equipment, though, the real challenge is always mental. How do you think about reaching the top of the big hill you’re climbing? One piece of conventional wisdom: don’t look ahead. If you look down at the road you aren’t forced to think about the grade, or your slow progress up it. Instead you see pavement moving beneath you, and feel steady progress.</p>
<p>
Of course that defeats the purpose of cycling through spectacular Sonoma County landscapes. Recently a friend suggested a different strategy: look to the side. Of course! There’s little or no traffic on many of these routes, so it’s safe to do that. And the effect is mesmerizing.</p>
<p>
I’ve <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/03/06/the-3d-splendor-of-the-sonoma-county-landscape/">described</a> it like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Everything looks different from everywhere. You’re always seeing multiple overlapping planes receding into the distance, like dioramas. And they change dramatically as you move around even slightly. Even just ten paces in any direction, or a slight change in elevation, can alter the sightlines completely and reveal or hide a distant landmark.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
So, don’t look ahead to the top of the hill, and don’t look down at the road. Look left and right to see sliding panels of majestic scenery. It really helps!</p>

<p>I asked ChatGPT and Bard to “List all Christmas holiday tunes in chronological order, by the year they were written, running from oldest at the top to the newest at the bottom.” ChatGPT gave me a lame list. Bard gave me a much better one, improved by my follow-ups. Here ya go:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While creating a definitive chronological list of every Christmas tune throughout history is near impossible, I can offer you a comprehensive, categorized timeline of notable Christmas music spanning centuries, from ancient hymns to modern-day pop hits. Keep in mind this is not an exhaustive list, and some dates may be approximate:</p>
<p>Pre-Renaissance Era (Before 1450)</p>
 
 4th Century:&nbsp;“Hymnus ad Natales Domine Jesu” (attributed to Hilary of Poitiers) – One of the earliest known Latin hymns referencing Jesus’ birth. 
 13th Century:&nbsp;“In dulci jubilo” – Traditional German carol celebrating the joy of Christmas. 
 14th Century:&nbsp;“O Come, All Ye Faithful” – Latin hymn, believed to be of English origin, later translated into many languages. 
 
<p>Renaissance Era (1450-1600)</p>
 
 15th Century:&nbsp;“There Is No Rose” – Traditional English carol referencing Mary as a “spotless rose.” 
 15th Century:&nbsp;“Deck the Halls” – Welsh carol with pagan roots, originally a celebration of the winter solstice. 
 
<p>Baroque Era (1600-1750)</p>
 
 1642:&nbsp;“What Child Is This?” – English carol based on a poem by William Chatterton Dix. 
 1678:&nbsp;“Silent Night” – German carol written by Franz Xaver Gruber and Joseph Mohr. 
 
<p>Classical Era (1750-1830)</p>
 
 1818:&nbsp;“O Holy Night” – French carol originally titled “Cantique de Noël” with lyrics by Placide Cappeau and music by Adolphe Adam. 
 
<p>Romantic Era (1830-1900)</p>
 
 1865:&nbsp;“Jingle Bells” – American song originally written by James Lord Pierpont with lyrics unrelated to Christmas. 
 1874:&nbsp;“O Little Town of Bethlehem” – American carol written by Phillips Brooks. 
 
<p>20th Century and Beyond</p>
 
 1934:&nbsp;“Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” – American song written by Ralph Blane and Hugh Martin for the Judy Garland film “Meet Me in St. Louis.” 
 1942:&nbsp;“White Christmas” – American song written by Irving Berlin for the film “Holiday Inn.” 
 1953:&nbsp;“Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” – American rock and roll song written by Johnny Marks. 
 1964:&nbsp;“Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” – American song written by Johnny Marks, based on the poem by Robert L. May. 
 1973:&nbsp;“All I Want for Christmas Is You” – American pop song written and performed by Mariah Carey. 
 1984:&nbsp;“Last Christmas” – English song written by George Michael for Wham! 
 1994:&nbsp;“Santa Claus Is Comin’ to Town” – American song written by J.C. Sprink and Haven Gillespie. 
 2019:&nbsp;“All Is Well” – British song written and performed by James Arthur. 
 
<p>This list showcases the evolution of Christmas music through various eras and genres. Remember, Christmas music is constantly evolving, with new carols and songs emerging every year.</p>
<p>Happy Holidays!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, “What about A Chrismas Song, by Mel Tormé? Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas? Frosty the Snowman? Mary’s Boy Child?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You’re absolutely right! I apologize for omitting those wonderful Christmas classics from my previous response. Here’s where they fit into the timeline:</p>
 
 1946:&nbsp;“Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” – As mentioned previously, this beloved song by Judy Garland was written in 1934 by Ralph Blane and Hugh Martin. 
 1951:&nbsp;“A Christmas Song” – This charming and introspective tune by Mel Tormé perfectly captures the bittersweet sentiment of Christmas. 
 1950:&nbsp;“Frosty the Snowman” – Jack Rollins and Steve Nelson penned this playful Christmas carol about a jolly snowman in 1950. 
 1956:&nbsp;“Mary’s Boy Child” – This moving gospel carol was written by Jester Hairston in 1956, based on an African American spiritual. 
 
<p>My apologies for the earlier oversight. These songs undoubtedly deserve their place among the cherished Christmas tunes throughout history.</p>
<p>Do you have any other Christmas music questions for me? I’m happy to delve deeper into the fascinating world of holiday melodies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, “Oh, and Rockin Around the Christmas Tree?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ah, you’re absolutely right! How could I forget the infectious energy of “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree”? It definitely belongs on the list. In fact, it was written earlier than some of the others I mentioned:</p>
 
 1958:&nbsp;“Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” – This rock n’ roll Christmas classic,&nbsp;penned by Johnny Marks,&nbsp;brought a vibrant and playful edge to holiday music. 
 
<p>Thank you for reminding me! Your keen eye for festive tunes is impressive. Merry Christmas and keep the musical celebration going!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I stopped there. But I assume you can keep going here: https://bard.google.com/chat/5623a530dcc35251</p>

<p>Die EU-Kommission hat <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/ALL/?uri=COM:2023:797:FIN">gestern die seit Monaten überfällige Bilanz der freiwilligen Chatkontrolle veröffentlicht. </a>Mit der Begründung Kinder schützen zu wollen durchsuchen US-Anbieter massenhaft, anlass- und unterschiedslos private Chats, Nachrichten und E-Mails nach verdächtigen Inhalten. Für den Europaabgeordneten und profiliertesten Gegner der Chatkontrolle Dr. Patrick Breyer (Piratenpartei) ist die Bilanz verheerend:</p>



<p>„Die monatelang verspätete Bilanz der freiwilligen Chatkontrolle entpuppt sich inhaltlich als Luftnummer: Da werden Zahlen zu Verdachtsmeldungen, Identifizierungen und Verurteilungen in den Raum gestellt, ohne dass ein Zusammenhang mit der Chatkontrolle privater Nachrichten belegt ist, weil NCMEC-Meldungen auch auf Nutzermeldungen oder öffentlichen Posts/Webseiten beruhen. Beim einvernehmlichen Sexting die Versender selbstgemachter Nacktbilder zu ‚identifizieren‘, ist keine Kunst und schützt niemanden vor Missbrauch. Damit fehlt jeder Nachweis, dass die eigenmächtige Massenüberwachung unserer privaten Kommunikation durch US-Dienste von Meta, Google oder Microsoft einen signifikanten Beitrag zur Rettung missbrauchter Kinder oder Überführung von Missbrauchtätern leiste. Sie kriminalisiert umgekehrt tausende Minderjähriger, überlastet Strafverfolger und öffnet einer willkürlichen Privatjustiz der Internetkonzerne Tür und Tor.</p>



<p>Im Bericht wird verschwiegen, was <a href="https://video.consilium.europa.eu/event/en/27239">Kommissarin Johansson vor den EU-Innenministern jüngst eingeräumt hat</a>: Nur mit jedem vierten ausgeleiteten Privatfoto oder -video kann die Polizei überhaupt etwas anfangen, zu 75% gelangen durch die Chatkontrolle strafrechtlich völlig irrelevante private und intime Bilder und Videos in Hände von Mitarbeitern, bei denen sie nicht sicher sind. 2022 offenbarten die fehleranfälligen Chatkontrolle-Verdächtigungsmaschinen demnach sage und schreibe 750.000 europäische Privatnachrichten ohne jede polizeiliche Relevanz. So wird das digitale Briefgeheimnis mit Füßen getreten!</p>



<p>Die Verordnung zur freiwilligen Chatkontrolle ist obsolet und grundrechtswidrig: Die sozialen Netzwerke als Hostingdienste brauchen zur Überprüfung öffentlicher Posts keine Verordnung. Und die millionenfachen fehlerträchtigen Verdachtsanzeigen aus der Durchleuchtung privater Kommunikation durch Zuckerbergs Meta-Konzern werden durch die angekündigte Einführung von Ende-zu-Ende-Verschlüsselung ohnehin demnächst entfallen. Das Rechtsgutachten einer ehemaligen EuGH-Richterin belegt, dass die freiwillige Chatkontrolle grundrechtswidrig ist. Ein Missbrauchsbetroffener und ich klagen dagegen, verhandelt wird am 1. Februar 2024. Dieser Irrweg muss schleunigst vom Tisch!“</p>



<p>Breyer kritisiert die von der EU-Kommission favorisierte Chatkontrolle als solutionistischen Irrweg zum Schutz von Kindern: „Mit ihrem in der freien Welt ungekannten gescheiterten Angriff auf das digitale Briefgeheimis und sichere Verschlüsselung sind die ‚Big Sisters‘ Zensursula und Johansson dafür verantwortlich, dass überhaupt nichts zum besseren Schutz unserer Kinder erreicht wird. Mit ihrer unverbesserlichen Obsession für Massenüberwachung verhindern die EU-Kommissarinnen wirklich wirksame Schutzmaßnahmen etwa durch sichere Gestaltung von Internetdiensten (Security by Design). Missbrauchsopfer haben Politiker verdient, die zu einem effektiven, mehrheitsfähigen, grundrechtskonformen und gerichtsfesten Kinderschutz in der Lage sind – wie es im EU-Parlament parteiübergreifend Konsens ist.“</p>



<p>Patrick Breyer, Elina Eickstädt (Chaos Computer Club) und der Bundesdatenschutzbeauftragte Ulrich Kelber werden am 29. Dezember auf dem <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2023/hub/en/event/chatkontrolle_-_es_ist_noch_nicht_vorbei/">Chaos Computer Kongress einen Vortrag zur Zukunft der Chatkontrolle</a> halten.</p>

<p>Ten years ago today the drafts that would be approved as the final OpenID Connect specifications were published, as announced in my post <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=1154">Fourth and possibly last Release Candidates for final OpenID Connect specifications and Notice of 24 hour review period</a>.</p>
<p>The adoption of OpenID Connect has exceeded our wildest expectations.  The vast majority of federated signins to sites and applications today use OpenID Connect.  Android, AOL, Apple, AT&amp;T, Auth0, Deutsche Telekom, ForgeRock, Google, GrabTaxi, GSMA Mobile Connect, IBM, KDDI, Microsoft, NEC, NRI, NTT, Okta, Oracle, Orange, Ping Identity, Red Hat, Salesforce, Softbank, Symantec, T-Mobile, Telefónica, Verizon, Yahoo, and Yahoo! Japan, all use OpenID Connect, and that’s just the tip of the iceberg.  While OpenID Connect is “plumbing” and not a consumer brand, it’s filling a need and doing it well.</p>
<p>It’s fitting that the second set of errata corrections to the OpenID Connect specifications were just approved, as described in the post <a href="https://openid.net/second-errata-set-for-openid-connect-specifications-approved/">Second Errata Set for OpenID Connect Specifications Approved</a>.  While we are proud of the quality of the final specifications, with 9 3/4 years of thousands of developers using and deploying the specifications, it’s unsurprising that issues would be found that needed clarification and correction.</p>
<p>The updated OpenID Connect specifications have just been submitted to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for Publicly Available Submission (PAS) status.  Approved PAS submissions are published as ISO specifications.  This will foster adoption in jurisdictions that require using standards that are published by organizations with international treaty status.</p>
<p>Celebrations of the <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=1191">tenth anniversary of the approval of OpenID Connect</a> will occur worldwide in 2024.  The first will be in Asia at the <a href="https://www.openid.or.jp/summit/2024/en/">OpenID Summit Tokyo</a> in January.  The second will be in the Americas at <a href="https://identiverse.com/">Identiverse</a> in May.  The third will be in Europe at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">European Identity and Cloud Conference</a> in June.  Join us at these events for the celebrations!</p>
<p>I can’t wait to see what the next decade brings for <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>!</p>

 “Honesty is the best policy,” George Burns said. “If you can fake that you’ve got it made.” 
 
 The same applies to feeling in composition and musical expression. Long ago I went with a friend who was a pianist and composer, to a concert by a somewhat famous pianist. While I was enjoying the concert, she grabbed my hand and pulled us out of the place. “Didn’t you hear it?” she said after we left. “That guy wasn’t feeling it.” 
 
 No AI will ever feel anything. There is no “next level” where it will feel in a human way—or at all—because AIs are machines and the human stuff they do is all emulation. That emulation can do superhuman stuff. But that doesn’t make them human. It makes them uncanny. And useful. (Hell, I’ve quickly come to rely on AI for lots of stuff, every day. It’s extremely handy and often fun.) 
 
 All that uncanny stuff is emulation. Pattern matching. Way-cool parroting. Even when it can beat a human at Go or recite pi to trillions of digits, a machine is still just a machine. It ought to be good at stuff machines are better at than humans. Feeling isn’t one of them. 
 
 Right now I want to finish this post. That&nbsp;want is a feeling in my creative drive. I’m not doing this shit just because I’ve been programmed to do it. 
 
 As you sit, watch, and listen to musicians in a top-ranked orchestra, what amazes you most, besides the music they play, is fellow human beings can do this stuff at all, and do it together. Why sit, watch, and listen to robots doing the same, even if they do all of it better, technically? 
 
 Will there be robot musicians as original, and moving, as Miles Davis? Will robot artists be better at doing Picasso than Picasso? Better at Shakespeare than Shakespeare? 
 
 Not if they can’t feel. And, I submit, none ever will.

<p>This article shows how to setup and sign git commits on Windows for Github. Most of this is already documented on the Github docs, but I ran into trouble when using this with git Extensions on a windows host. My commits could not be signed until I set the home system variable on the windows host.</p>



 Install gpg on Windows 



<p>To sign git commits, you can download the windows <a href="https://www.gpg4win.org/">gpg4win</a> and install it. Git should already be installed. No extra features are required.</p>



 Generate a key on Windows 



<p>The Windows cmd line is used to generate a new gpg key. I have a safe host PC and do not require a passphrase. Other than this, I just used the default settings to generate a new gpg key. </p>



<p>Note: The requested email needs to match the email used on your Github account.</p>


  gpg --full-generate-key
  


<p>Github docs: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key">https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key</a></p>







<p>The pub key can be used to export the pub key and upload it to the Github account.</p>



 Use Git Extensions and apply the signing per repo 



<p>I would like to use this key for a single repository. I have multiple user accounts for multiple systems and each have different git requirements. For one Github repository, I would like to sign all commits. I generated the key  in the global user profile but only use the key on this repository.</p>



<p></p>



<p>In the git bash window from the repository, if you want to sign the commits, the following commands can be executed. I open the bash through git extensions. If you already have the key id from the creating of it, you can skip step 3.</p>


  git config commit.gpgsign true

git config --global gpg.program "C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuPG\bin\gpg.exe"

gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long

git config user.signingkey &lt;your key&gt;
  


 Signing key not found 



<p>If the signing key is not found on windows, it is probably because the application is looking in the wrong location for the gpg key. To validate this, open the git bash from the repository and find the Home: value. This must match the value in the windows command line. </p>


  gpg --version
  


<p>Find the value for Home:</p>



<p>Now open and the value in the windows cmd and check that it matches the git bash console. If it does not match, take the window cmd Home: value and add this to the system variables.</p>



<p>Add an environment variable called <code>GNUPGHOME</code> with the value found in the <code>gpg --version</code> cmd</p>







<p></p>



<p>Now the commit should be signed. Next step is to setup Github to use this key.</p>



 Add the gpg key to your Github account 



<p>The gpg key can be attached to the Github account. The docs explain this good.</p>



<p>Github docs: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/adding-a-gpg-key-to-your-github-account">https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/adding-a-gpg-key-to-your-github-account</a></p>


  gpg --list-secret-keys

gpg -a --export &lt;your-pub-key&gt;
  


<p></p>



<p>Display the verified commits on Github: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/displaying-verification-statuses-for-all-of-your-commits">https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/displaying-verification-statuses-for-all-of-your-commits</a></p>







<p></p>



<p>When you commit and push, Github should display a verified status</p>







<p></p>



<p>You can now require that all commits are verified for a repository</p>

<p>Recently I made a post on <a href="https://medium.com/@m-ruminer/veramo-and-verifiable-credentials-6e860b3035be">Veramo and Verified Credentials</a> where I discussed a little bit about Veramo and my findings in trying to use it. This post is about <a href="https://www.spruceid.dev/didkit/didkit">DIDKit</a> from SpruceID. DIDKit is another set of packages for creating DIDs, verifiable credentials, verifiable presentations, etc. I only used the command line interface (CLI) tool in my experimentation with it and was entirely focused on DID creation. This is how it&nbsp;went.</p><p>First off, let me say that I tried DIDKit not only because I wanted to see how another tool worked but because when using Veramo there is no way via the CLI to get the private key for a DID I created. I suspect with enough magic it could be retrieved via JavaScript, but maybe not. It’s locked away in a key management system&nbsp;(KMS).</p><p>Secondly, I found <a href="https://mhrsntrk.com/blog/create-and-publish-your-own-did-web">Create and Post Your Own did:web</a> post to be easier to navigate than the directions on the SpruceID site. I did find somewhere in the DIDKit docs how to create a did:web from their did:key generation command but can’t find it again which only goes to show how difficult it is to find some information in their documentation. (Since initially writing this I looked harder and did find it at “<a href="https://www.spruceid.dev/didkit/didkit-examples/did-web-in-minutes">did-web in minutes</a>”)Although SpruceID says it supports did:web it seems that it can resolve did:web but it doesn’t create a did:web fully. You must create a did:key and make some edits on it to make it into a did:web. The edits are minor, but I consider this a weird limitation. I read somewhere along the way that it only supports the ED25519 curve in creating did:key/did:web, but I am not sure if that limitation referred only to creation or resolving as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Once I created a JSON Web Key (JWK) using one of their key generation functions, built the did:key from the key, edited it to be a did:web, and published it to <a href="http://manicprogrammer.github.io/.well-known/did.json">manicprogrammer.github.io/.well-known/did.json</a> it resolved fine with their “didkit did-resolve” command.</p><p>Unlike the Veramo tool, I found no way through the CLI to add services so I just manually added a DIDComm service to the DID. As with my Veramo post let me say — don’t message me on that DIDComm service as I don’t have nor have I found a mobile device agent/wallet to which I can add an existing DID and mediator endpoints for DIDComm much less the DIDComm v2 endpoint I gave it. So I can’t get the messages. Even <a href="https://blocktrust.dev/">blocktrust.dev</a> which has the mediator doesn’t have such a thing. Perhaps I’ll setup a browser based DIDComm messaging app to test it out if I can find a DIDComm V2 set of libraries for the browser. (I’ll have to get proficient with JavaScript though, which I have never found the time to do.) Why do I have the endpoint in the DID then? Just for fun to see that I could add one and it properly resolve. Obviously, I have not been able to test&nbsp;it.</p><p>What else did I find in my experience with DIDKit? In the <a href="https://www.spruceid.dev/didkit/didkit-packages/command-line-interface">documentation</a>, I couldn’t find what the below ‘key” parameter did. But, following the directions to create a did:key the below command&nbsp;worked:</p> didkit key-to-did key -k issuer_key.jwk <p>I also found that on its Github it doesn’t have a discussion section.</p><p>All in all, the toolkit did a good job from the CLI. I am likely to try out the creation of a VC with it. It has packages for Rust (in which DIDKit is written), C, Java/Android, Python, and Javascript.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I messed around with the <a href="https://veramo.io/">Veramo</a> project for #verifiablecredentials. It’s not ready for prime time nor is it professed to be, but it does get some things done. I focused on DIDs. I was entirely using the CLI as javascript is not a “native” language for me but I may decide to get into that space to mess with this project some. The deficiencies I ran into may be CLI specific and not present when using the APIs directly.</p><p>I did get a well-formed DID out of it that I published at:</p> did:web:manicprogrammer.github.io <p>Don’t send me a didcomm message via it despite it having a service for that defined as I don’t currently have a personal agent setup to communicate via that service. I know, why publish the service then? For fun. Maybe I’ll remove&nbsp;it.</p><p>One issue I hit with the CLI that was especially off-putting to me is that I found no way to get the private key via the CLI for the created DID, even with the did export function (perhaps I am wrong, but I didn’t see it and thus wonder what the value of the export is). If someone finds me wrong let me know. &lt;EDIT&gt;: since writing this I have prompted a question about it and confirmed what I found. See <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/veramo/discussions/1303">here</a>.&lt;/EDIT&gt; It uses by default a local KMS. This means I can only create and send credentials created by Veramo as I don’t have the private key for signing via another method. I suppose I can get to it via some javascript magic and I may try to do that or else I’ll likely create a different did with keys I have generated in other&nbsp;ways.</p><p>All in all. It was worthwhile to play with from the CLI. No doubt, the real value is in the Javascript APIs. What’s it good for? I don’t really know yet. It’s good for messing around and becoming more familiar with verifiable credential structure, verifiable presentation structure, DID structure etc.</p><p>#decentralizedidentity #verifiablecredentials</p>

<p>There is some major positive good news for the KERI &amp; ACDC ecosystem. The European Banking Authority <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7141124705410818048/">announced on LinkedIn</a> the EBA Pillar 3 data hub which is built on KERI &amp; ACDC. The Pillar 3 data hub uses the vLEI system developed by <a href="https://gleif.org/">GLEIF</a>, the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation.</p>



 vLEI System Architecture Diagram: 


 
 


 What this means 



<p>This means that around 6000 financial institutions in the EU will now be required to use the EBA Pillar 3 data hub, and by extension KERI &amp; ACDC, for their financial reporting. You can read more in their <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-publishes-discussion-paper-centralisation-eea-banks">website announcement</a> and the <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/d5b13b4d-a9dc-4680-8b7c-0a3a4c694fac/Discussion%20paper%20on%20Pillar3%20data%20hub.pdf">linked report PDF</a>.<br><br>The important parts include pages 50-52, specifically the Garner analysis in section 6.3.128: </p>



 
 EBA had Gartner analyze KERI &amp; ACDC 



 found ” that there are no comparably efficient alternative solutions globally” 
 



<p>And section 6.4.130 Conclusion: </p>



 
 “vLEI effectively meets…Pillar 3 reporting requirements…perceived as a low-risk project overall…significant opportunity to enhance integrity of reporting processes” 
 



<p>A number of advantages and risks were identified with the paper saying </p>



<blockquote>
<p>The automation of identity verification and related processes through the vLEI could also offer numerous potential advantages for both Financial Institutions and other Regulators in the EU financial market<br></p>
<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/d5b13b4d-a9dc-4680-8b7c-0a3a4c694fac/Discussion%20paper%20on%20Pillar3%20data%20hub.pdf">https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/d5b13b4d-a9dc-4680-8b7c-0a3a4c694fac/Discussion%20paper%20on%20Pillar3%20data%20hub.pdf</a></blockquote>



<p>Potential Advantages:</p>



 
 For Financial Institutions
 
 Non-repudiable identification 
 
 This means once you say something with KERI you can’t un-say it, as in you can’t change your story without getting caught 
 
 



 Operational efficiency: unified digital format 



 Enhanced products and services: trusted information enables risk management, customer service, and enhanced online experience 
 
 



 For Supervisors/Regulators
 
 Enhanced Trust: simplify both validation of regulatory reports and authorized sign off 



 Comprehensive Entity Overview: transparent, aggregated view of legal entities and hierarchies 



 Standardization of Data Processes: smarter, more cost-effective, reliable data workflows 
 
 
 



<p>Risks:</p>



 
 Development of ecosystem
 
 Due to ecosystem novelty there is only one QVI right now (Provenant), 
 
 Support is needed from GLEIF to grow the population of QVIs, incentive structure, and ecosystem orchestration 
 
 



 Ensure adequate support to institutions
 
 End-user applications bank wallet 



 Wallet for reporting institutions 



 Compatibility with eIDAS 2.0 framework 



 User-friendly applications for digital signatures, key management, and logging services 
 
 



 Market’s recognition of benefits offered by vLEI
 
 Pillar 3 reporting requirement could trigger a “snowball effect” to catalyze market recognition of vLEI benefits. 
 
 
 
 
 



<p>This is an exciting development in the KERI space that this blog will continue to track.</p>

   Interoperability is a grand goal, and a tough problem to crack. After all, what is interoperability other than independent things just working out of the box?

<p>Interoperability is a grand goal, and a tough problem to crack. After all, what is interoperability other than independent things just working out of the box? In the standards and specifications world, we have to be precise about a lot of things, but none more precise than what we expect to be interoperable with, and how we get to the interop&nbsp;point.</p><p>In my experience, there are a few common ways to get&nbsp;there.</p> Conformance <p>The easiest way to achieve interoperability is for there to be no choice from the implementations. If there’s only one option, and implementations are motivated to follow that option, then interoperability is much easier to count on. If a specification has a MUST, and means it, you can realistically rely on that being followed by well-meaning developers.</p><p>This zero-level interoperability is not without its confusion, though. In any specification, there are a lot of assumptions that lead up to a MUST being placed. Changes in this context could make that MUST behave differently in between implementations. For example, taking the byte value of a data structure, even a simple one like a string or number, assumes an encoding and order for that data structure. What’s most dangerous about this kind of problem is that it’s easy for multiple developers to make the same assumptions and therefore assure themselves that the MUST as written is sufficient, until someone else comes along with different assumptions and everything breaks in spite of seeming to be conformant.</p><p>To give a concrete example, try asking anyone for a USB cable and chances are you’ll get a few different varieties back, from type A, to type C, to micro-B, to power-only varieties. All of them are USB and conform to all aspects of the cabling standard, but “USB” is not sufficient to ensure compatibility on a physical&nbsp;level.</p><p>Even with its limitations, it’s still a good idea for specifications to be specific as much as possible. But the world can’t always make a single choice and stick to it. Things start to get more interesting when there’s choice between options, though, so how do we handle&nbsp;that?</p> Discovery <p>If my system can ask your system which options it supports ahead of time, then ostensibly I should be able to pick one of those options and expect it to work. Many standard internet APIs are based around this concept, with an initial discovery phase that sets the parameters of interoperability for future connections.</p><p>This pattern works fairly well, at least for common options and happy paths. If your system supports some or all of what my system wants, then I can probably figure out how to connect to you successfully. If your system doesn’t support what I need, then at least I know I can’t start the process. OpenID Connect usually works from a discovery-based process, where the RP fetches the IdP’s discovery document prior to connecting.</p><p>The discovery pattern is predicated on an agreement of how to do discovery in the first place. I need to at least know how to make an initial call in order to figure out what the options are for all future calls. This is expected to be out of band for the rest of the protocol, but is often built on the same underlying assumptions. Does the protocol assume HTTP as a transport? Then discovery can use that,&nbsp;also.</p><p>Discovery is generally done without context, though. The existence of something in a discovery step does not guarantee that it will be usable in the context of a real request. A server might support seven different cryptographic algorithms, but might only allow some of them to specific clients or request types. That kind of detail is hard to capture through discovery.</p><p>For a physical example, let’s say that before you ask for a USB cable, you can check a list of all the available types that the person you’re asking has available. That way when you ask for a specific cable, you’ll at least know that they had it as an option. But maybe they only had one and already lent it out to someone else, or they only hand out power-only cables to people they haven’t met before, in case the cable goes walkabout.</p> Negotiation <p>If we can instead bake the discovery process into the protocol itself, we can end up with a negotiation pattern. One party makes a request that includes the options that they’re capable of, and the other party responds with their own set of options, or chooses from the first set. From there, both parties now know the parameters the need to&nbsp;connect.</p><p>This kind of option works well with connection-focused protocols, and it has the distinct advantage of avoiding an additional round trip to do discovery. There’s also no longer a need to specify a separate process for discovery, since it’s baked in to the protocol itself. Content negotiation in HTTP, algorithm selection in TLS, and grant negotiation in GNAP all follow this&nbsp;pattern.</p><p>Negotiation falls short when decisions have to be made about the initial connection, much like when there’s a separate discovery call. The protocol can be built to robustly account for those failures, such as a content type being unavailable in HTTP, but the ability to negotiate does not guarantee satisfactory results. Negotiation can also end up with less than ideal results when there’s not a clear preference order, but in such cases it’s possible for a negotiation to continue over several round&nbsp;trips.</p><p>If you need a USB cable, you can walk up to someone and say “Hi, can I borrow a USB cable? I need it to be USB-A or USB-C and I need it for a data connection.” The person you’re asking can then see if they have anything that fits your criteria, and choose appropriately from their supply. If they hand you something that’s less than ideal, you can clarify “I’d really prefer USB-C if you have it, but this will work if&nbsp;not”.</p> Configuration <p>On a simpler level, many developers simply want to choose an option and run with it, and if the other side makes a compatible choice, this can short-circuit any kind of discovery or negotiation process in a positive way. This might seem magical, but it happens way more often than many software architects and standards authors like to admit. It’s not uncommon for two developers to make similar assumptions, or for libraries to influence each others’ implementations such that they end up doing the same thing even without any external agreement to do&nbsp;so.</p><p>If a developer codes up something based on an example, and it works, that developer is not likely to look beyond the example. Why would they? The goal is to get something to connect, and if it does, then that job is done and they can move on to more interesting problems. And if it doesn’t work? Chance are they’ll tweak the piece that doesn’t work until it does&nbsp;work.</p><p>JSON works this way in practice, with well-formed JSON being the interoperability expectation and anything else being, effectively, schema-by-fiat. While there are schema languages on top of JSON, the practical truth is that applications apply their own internal schema-like expectations to the JSON by looking for a field with a certain name in a certain place with a data value that parses how they expect it to. Anything that runs afoul of that is an error not of JSON but for the application to deal with. This is a far cry from the days of XML, which expected processing of namespaces and schemas to make sense of tags at the parsing level. Was it more robust? Arguably, yes. But it was also far too heavy for an average developer to care about. JSON’s approach lets us get to data exchange simply by letting us get it right by accident most of the time, and ignoring things that don’t make&nbsp;sense.</p><p>If you want a USB-C cable but just ask someone for a USB cable, and they hand you a USB-C cable, everyone’s happy. You may have been accidentally interoperable with your request and response, but there’s power in that kind of accident and the frequency with which it&nbsp;happens.</p> Practicality <p>All of these interoperability methods have merit, and most systems are built out of a combination of all of them in one way or another. When we’re defining what interoperability means, we always need to take in the context of what is interoperable, for whom, and when.At the end of the day, practical interoperability means that things connect well enough to get stuff done. We should endeavor to build our standards and systems to allow for robust discovery and negotiation, but always keep in mind that developers will find the best path for them to&nbsp;connect.</p><p>Interoperability is a grand goal indeed, and while a lot of the time we stumble backwards into it, there are well-trodden paths for getting&nbsp;there.</p>

<p>This article shows how a Blazor application can be implemented in a secure way using MudBlazor UI components and Microsoft Entra ID as an identity provider. The MudBlazor UI components adds some inline styles and requires a specific CSP setup due to this and the Blazor WASM script requirements. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/MicrosoftEntraIDMudBlazor">https://github.com/damienbod/MicrosoftEntraIDMudBlazor</a></p>



<p></p>



 Setup 



<p>The application is setup using a Blazor WASM UI hosted in an ASP.NET Core application. The MudBlazor Nuget package was added to client project. Some MudBlazor components were added to the UI using MudBlazor <a href="https://mudblazor.com/docs/overview">documentation</a>.</p>







<p></p>



 Security Headers 



<p>The security headers need to be added to protect the session of the web application. I use NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders to implement the headers. We can protect the UI using CSP nonces and so the NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders.TagHelpers Nuget package is also used. The following packages are added to the server project. </p>



 
 NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders 



 NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders.TagHelpers 
 



<p></p>



<p>The SecurityHeadersDefinitions class adds the security headers as best possible for this technical setup. A nonce is used in the CSP for the scripts tag. The ‘unsafe-eval’ value is added to the script CSP definition due to the Blazor WASM technical setup. This reduces the security protections. The unsafe inline is added as a fallback for older browsers. The style CSP definition allows unsafe inline due to the MudBlazor UI components.</p>


  namespace MicrosoftEntraIdMudBlazor.Server;

public static class SecurityHeadersDefinitions
{
    public static HeaderPolicyCollection GetHeaderPolicyCollection(bool isDev, string? idpHost)
    {
        if(idpHost == null)
        {
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(idpHost));
        }

        var policy = new HeaderPolicyCollection()
            .AddFrameOptionsDeny()
            .AddContentTypeOptionsNoSniff()
            .AddReferrerPolicyStrictOriginWhenCrossOrigin()
            .AddCrossOriginOpenerPolicy(builder =&gt; builder.SameOrigin())
            .AddCrossOriginResourcePolicy(builder =&gt; builder.SameOrigin())
            .AddCrossOriginEmbedderPolicy(builder =&gt; builder.RequireCorp()) // remove for dev if using hot reload
            .AddContentSecurityPolicy(builder =&gt;
            {
                builder.AddObjectSrc().None();
                builder.AddBlockAllMixedContent();
                builder.AddImgSrc().Self().From("data:");
                builder.AddFormAction().Self().From(idpHost);
                builder.AddFontSrc().Self();        
                builder.AddBaseUri().Self();
                builder.AddFrameAncestors().None();

                builder.AddStyleSrc()
                    .UnsafeInline() // due to Mudblazor
                    .Self();

                builder.AddScriptSrc()
                    .WithNonce()
                    .UnsafeEval() // due to Blazor WASM
                    .UnsafeInline();

                // disable script and style CSP protection if using Blazor hot reload
                // if using hot reload, DO NOT deploy with an insecure CSP
            })
            .RemoveServerHeader()
            .AddPermissionsPolicy(builder =&gt;
            {
                builder.AddAccelerometer().None();
                builder.AddAutoplay().None();
                builder.AddCamera().None();
                builder.AddEncryptedMedia().None();
                builder.AddFullscreen().All();
                builder.AddGeolocation().None();
                builder.AddGyroscope().None();
                builder.AddMagnetometer().None();
                builder.AddMicrophone().None();

        if (!isDev)
        {
            // maxage = one year in seconds
            policy.AddStrictTransportSecurityMaxAgeIncludeSubDomains(
        maxAgeInSeconds: 60 * 60 * 24 * 365);
        }

        policy.ApplyDocumentHeadersToAllResponses();

        return policy;
    }
}
  


<p></p>



<p>The UseSecurityHeaders adds the security headers middleware.</p>


  app.UseSecurityHeaders(SecurityHeadersDefinitions
    .GetHeaderPolicyCollection(env.IsDevelopment(), 
         configuration["AzureAd:Instance"]));
  


<p></p>



<p>A nonce is used to protect the UI application and the tag helpers are used for this.</p>


  @addTagHelper *, NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders.TagHelpers
  


<p>The asp-add-nonce adds the nonce to the scripts for all the HTTP responses.</p>


      &lt;script asp-add-nonce src="_framework/blazor.webassembly.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script asp-add-nonce src="_content/MudBlazor/MudBlazor.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script asp-add-nonce src="antiForgeryToken.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  


<p></p>



 Microsoft Entra ID 



<p>Microsoft Entra ID is used to protect the Blazor application. The Microsoft.Identity.Web packages are used to implement the OpenID Connect client. The application authentication security is implemented using backend for frontend (BFF) security architecture. The UI part, is a view belonging to the server backend. All security is implemented using the trusted backend and the session is persisted using a secure HTTP only cookie. The WASM uses this cookie for the secure data requests.</p>



 
 Microsoft.Identity.Web 



 Microsoft.Identity.Web.UI 



 Microsoft.Identity.Web.GraphServiceClient 
 



<p></p>



<p>The AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication implements the UI OpenID Connect client.</p>


  var scopes = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("DownstreamApi:Scopes");
string[] initialScopes = scopes!.Split(' ');

services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(configuration)
    .EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(initialScopes)
    .AddMicrosoftGraph("https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0", initialScopes)
    .AddInMemoryTokenCaches();
  


<p>Note: if using in-memory cache, the cache gets reset after every application restart, but not the cookie. You need to use a persistent cache or reset the cookie when the tokens are missing.</p>

ruminating for years about women’s contributions to the domestic
economy, the massive time investment of producing clothing for a

She would now sweep the cottage, supported on props; now she would set the eggs to be hatched under the plumage of the brooding hen; or she gathered green mallows or white mushrooms, or warmed the low hearth with welcome fire.

  <p>I participated in a meeting titled “Meta’s Threads Interoperating in the Fediverse Data Dialogue”
at Meta in San Francisco yesterday. It brought together a good number of Meta/Threads
people (across engineering, product, policy), some Fediverse entrepreneurs like myself,
some people who have been involved in ActivityPub standardization, a good number of
industry observers / commentators, at least one journalist, and people from independent
organizations whose objective is to improve the state of the net. Altogether about 30 people.</p>
<p>It was conducted under the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_rule">Chatham House rule</a>, so I am only
posting my impressions, and I don’t identify people and what specific people said.
(Although most attendees volunteered for a public group photo at the end; I will post a
link when I get one. Photo added at the bottom of this post.)</p>
<p>For the purposes of this post, I’m not going to comment about larger questions such as
whether Meta is good or bad, should be FediBlock’ed immediately or not; I’m simply
writing down some notes about this meeting.</p>
<p>In no particular order:</p>
 
 
<p>The Threads team has been doing a number of meetings like this, in various geographies
(London was mentioned), and with various stakeholders including the types of people that
came to this meeting, as well as Fediverse instance operators, regulators and civil society.</p>
 
 
<p>Apparently many (most?) invitees to these meetings were invited because other
invitees had been recommending them. I don’t know whether or what kind of future meetings
like this they are planning, but I’d be happy to pass along names if we know each other
and you get in touch. Thanks to – you know who you are – who passed along my name.</p>
 
 
<p>The Threads team comes across as quite competent and thoughtful at what they do.</p>
 
 
<p>On some subjects that are “obvious” to those of use who have hung around open federated
systems long enough like myself, many attendees seemed strangely underinformed. I didn’t get the
impression that they don’t want to know, but simply that integrating with the
“there-is-nobody-in-charge” Fediverse is so different from other types of projects they
have done in the past, they are still finding their bearings. I heard several:
“A year ago, I did not know what the Fediverse was.”</p>
 
 
<p>Rolling out a large node – like Threads will be – in a complex, distributed system that’s
as decentralized and
heterogeneous as the Fediverse is not something anybody really has done before. It’s
unclear what can go wrong, so the right approach appears to be to go step-by-step,
feature by feature: try it, see how it works in practice, fix what needs fixing,
and only then move on to the next feature.</p>
 
 
<p>That gradual approach opens them up to suspicions their implementation is one-sided
and entirely self-serving. I guess that can’t be avoided until everything is deployed
they publicly said they will deploy.</p>
 
 
<p>While there are many challenges, I did get the impression the project is proceeding
more or less as planned, and there are no major obstacles.</p>
 
 
<p>Everybody knows and is aware Meta brings a “trust deficit” to the Fediverse. The best
mitigation mentioned was to be as transparent as possible about all aspects of what
they plan and do.</p>
<p>I think that’s a good approach, but also that they can do far more on transparency than
they have so far. For example, they could publicly share a roadmap and the engineering
rationale for why the steps they identified need to be in this sequence.</p>
 
 
<p>There are many, many questions on many aspects of the Fediverse, from technical
details, to operational best practices, to regulatory constraints and how they apply
to a federated system. The group generally did not know, by and large, how to get them
answered, but agreed that meetings like this serve as a means to connect with people
who might know.</p>
<p>I think this is a problem all across the Fediverse, not specific to Meta. We – the
Fediverse – need to figure out a way to make that easier for new developers;
certainly my own learning curve to catch up was steeper than I would have liked, too.</p>
 
 
<p>Many people did not know about <a href="https://fediforum.org/">FediForum</a>, our Fediverse
unconference, and I suspect a bunch of the meeting attendees will come to the
next one (likely in March; we are currently working on picking a date). Many of
the discussions at this meeting would have been right at home as FediForum sessions,
and while I am clearly biased as FediForum organizer, I would argue that doing
meetings like this in an open forum like FediForum could help substantially with
the trust deficit mentioned above.</p>
 
 
<p>There’s significant interest in the Fediverse Test Suite we just
<a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/FediverseTestsuite/">got funding approval</a>
for from the EU’s NGI Zero program. There’s general agreement that the Fediverse
could work “better”, be more reliable, and more be comprehensible to mainstream users,
if we had better the test coverage than the Fediverse has today. This is of interest
to all new (and existing) developers.</p>
 
 
<p>There was a very interesting side discussion on whether it would be helpful for Fediverse
instances (including Threads) to share reputation information with other instances that
each instance might maintain on individual ActivityPub actors for its own purposes already.
Block lists as they are shared today are
a (very primitive) version of this; a more multi-faceted version might be quite
helpful across the Fediverse. This came up in a breakout group discussion, and
was part of brainstorming; I didn’t hear that anybody actually worked on this.</p>
 
 
<p>When we think of privacy risks when Meta connects to the Fediverse, we usually think of
what happens to data that moves from today’s Fediverse into Meta. I didn’t realize the
opposite is also quite a challenge (personal data posted to Threads, making its
way into the Fediverse) for an organization as heavily monitored by regulators around
the world as is Meta.</p>
 
 
<p>There was very little talk (not none, but little) about the impact on regulation, such as
the “continuous and real-time access” provision in the EU’s Digital Markets Act and
whether that was a / the driver for Fediverse integration.</p>
 
 
<p>There was very little discussion on business models for Threads, and where exactly
ads would go. For example, would ads just stay within the Threads app, or would they
inject them into ActivityPub feeds, like some companies did with RSS back in the days?
Of course, should that happen, as a non-Threads Fediverse user, one can always unfollow;
there is no way for them to plaster non-Threads users with ads if they
don’t interact with Threads accounts.</p>
 
 
<p>I came away convinced that the team working on Threads indeed genuinely wants to make
federation happen, and have it happen in a “good” way. I did not get any sense whatsoever
that any of the people I interacted were executing any secret agenda, whether
embrace-and-extend, favoring Threads in some fashion or anything like that. (Of course,
that is a limited data point, but I thought I convey it anyway.)</p>
 
 
<p>However, the meeting did not produce a clear answer to the elephant-in-the-room question that was
raised repeatedly by several attendees in several versions, which is some version of:
“All the openness with Threads, namely integration with the Fediverse, supporting account
migration out from Threads etc, is the opposite
of what Facebook/Meta has done over its history. What has fundamentally changed so
that you now believe openness is the better strategy?” And: “In the past Facebook was
a far more open system than it is today, you gradually locked it down. What guarantee
is there that your bosses won’t follow the same playbook this time, even if you
think they won’t?”</p>
<p>Personally I believe this question needs a better answer than has been given publicly
so far, and the answer needs to come from the very top of Meta. The statement must have
staying power beyond what any one executive can deliver.</p>
 
 
<p>I left the meeting with far more questions than I could get answered; but nobody wanted
to stay all night :-)</p>
<p>My gut feel is that it is safe to assume they will do a reasonably fair, responsible job with a gradual
rollout of federation for at least the next year or two or such. Beyond that, and in particular if
it turns out creators with large follower groups indeed move off Threads at a significant
rate (one of the stated reasons why they are implementing Fediverse support as
creators have asked for this), I don’t think we know at all what will happen. (I’m not
sure that anybody knows at this point.) And of course, none of this addresses the
larger issues that Meta has as an organization.</p>

<p>This open letter and touching memoir was written by my friend Washington Sean after listening to my recent ramblings about Trichotomy and anticipated territorial skirmishes over an imagined inter-dimensional bridge where piles of soul bound tokens might be held in the future, inert digital golems awaiting the spirits of inbound travelers. My birthday is later this week and this offering feels like a special gift. It was a delight to picture myself a bit in that magical place beyond the looming gate of St. Thomas Aquinas. And I didn’t have to carry 40 pounds of gear up a mountain! </p>
<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about multiverses and portals and one’s life work. After I finished the trichotomy stream, Washington Sean and I exchanged a few emails about consciousness and shipping companies – waves, you know. I brought up W.R. Grace and J. Peter Grace Jr. of the Grace Line, devout Catholics with ties to the Trappist Abbey in Spencer, MA outside Worcester. RFK Jr.’s dad Joseph was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=curaT-RXUlA">fellow-Catholic colleague with the Maritime Commission.</a> I sense that standardized contemplative prayer is a key element in the B-Corp social impact “moral economy,” a game where focused spiritualized attention will be used to fuel the Web3 global brain platform. </p>
<p>Below is the stream, I’ll put a screenshot of that map with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpiZ3_P7B_I">link</a> in case you wish to explore where the Grace empire intersects with the Vatican and Zen Buddhist brownie bakeries staffed by former-felons. My friend is a talented photographer. Enjoy his windows into a time before the fire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dear Alison,</p>
<p>Ok — so I am having a hard time with this last email you sent me. &nbsp;In the email you addressed the concept of a trichotomy as a means of explaining the differences between the mind/spirit, the body and the soul. And you also mentioned Thomas Aquinas and pointed to J Peter Grace and his role as a past Governor (Board of Directors) for a school called Thomas Aquinas College.</p>
<p>Peter Grace, “whose wife was a key player in Vatican II” was also mentioned in your email. This wasn’t unexpected as we had been discussing shipping magnates Stavros Niarchos and Aristotle Onassis and their connection to the Negroponte brothers (another typical conversation with Alison, right?) and somehow Peter Grace was mixed in, someone I’d never heard of before. And so, with all of these topics thrown into an email is nothing too out of the ordinary, as our correspondences are often filled with different threads and rabbit holes. But unknowingly on your part, you had sent something else that was embedded in your email — something else that caused a peculiar epiphany – a sort of unsettling realization about our research endeavors that led to an interesting reevaluation of my own past – my own lived experience.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Specifically, it was your mention of how Thomas Aquinas College was fitting into this mix. I know I’ve mentioned I grew up in Ventura County, but I’ve never told you about the significance of the College in my own life. Nor would I have ever had a reason to until now… So, this is another ‘bizarre’ coincidence — or perhaps more evidence of our ability to tap into the magical realism of our lived experiences – perhaps sharing a mutual ‘frequency’ or a least being signaled to look at certain topics, certain ideas, within a common bandwidth, listening for concepts and symbols that resonate with me, with us, right now.</p>
<p>Thomas Aquinas College now has two locations – and they did not open the Massachusetts location until 2019. But — and here is why this is weird and personal — the California campus is in Ventura County where I grew up. But not just that — the campus sits at the entrance of a popular trail head where I literally ‘grew up’ — as in — where I slowly turned into a man; and where I formed a relationship with God and nature; where I battled my place in the world and contemplated my existence in the future.</p>
<p>The CA campus is located in Santa Paula canyon along state Highway 150 between the communities of Santa Paula and Ojai. It was near the campus that the ‘Thomas Fire’ of 2017 started. The Thomas Fire was, for a brief period, California’s largest wildfire in total burned acreage, scorching over 280,000 acres, but it’s place at the top of the charts was quickly usurped by another raging firestorm in the following season. Several of my close friends lost their homes in that fire including my two best friends. A great effort was made by the local fire department to protect the college a few days after the east winds event was over and when the winds changed, and the fire began to burn back the way it had come. The college experienced only minor physical damage, but the traumatic impact of the fire still lives on in that part of Ventura County.</p>
<p>Ironically, even though I have called the Pacific Northwest home for many years, I was visiting a friend for his birthday in 2017 (on November 30th — surely just another coincidence that November 30th is the same day you sent this perplexing email) who was battling cancer for the 3rd bout.&nbsp; A couple days later his sister’s home in the Ventura foothills, where the birthday party was hosted, was completely obliterated.&nbsp; I looked online at the drone shots that were available and I could pick their house out – a pile of ashes with only a gun safe standing in what used to be the garage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was in town for only two nights, so the day after the birthday party in Ventura I visited my best friend’s home in upper Santa Paula whose house was very close to the origin of the fire that would erupt two days later, and it was among the first to burn down. Of the few things they had time to grab before they left, was the wedding plaque that we had commissioned to be carved in leather commemorating the year of their union (2012). My friend’s wife tells a great story of how she ran back into the house and had to use a stick to knock it off the wall since she could not reach it.</p>
<p>Their home was not far as the crow flies from the campus grounds, and it is odd in fact, that I can still remember driving down Highway 150 after my visit with them as I was on my way back home to my parents’ house where I’d soon bum a ride from my father and get dropped at the Burbank airport and catch the last flight back to Portland. But on that drive home that night I passed by the campus, and I can recall how raw and powerful the winds were already blowing. Call it a premonition, or a hunch, but the thought of fire entered my mind that night, right as I drove by the Thomas Aquinas College campus. Two days later, the winds would grow even more ferocious and would knock down an electrical wire, sparking the fire. By that Tuesday I had learned what had happened. And it was on a Wednesday morning that I would be delivering opening remarks for the small non-profit I was president of at the time. It was our annual awards breakfast and while I kept a cheery face for our sponsors and guests, inside I was solemn and grieving, and I couldn’t help but feel a tad guilty for having a premonition, not having the knowledge or intuitive sense of how to act on it, and then learning how many of my friends were now burned out of their homes, their lives forever altered.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Thomas Aquinas College campus sits above the Santa Paula creek on a small bluff nestled between hilly terrain at the mouth of Santa Paula canyon. This is not a ‘mighty river’ or a mountain river that one might see or think of as imagined in one of the more pristine national parks of the Sierra Nevada. The Santa Paula creek is a typical river of the Los Padres National Forest. Much of the time, rivers in southern California run at a low flow rate and often they can barely muster a trickle or even dry up completely, running ephemerally for long stretches before entering the myriad of pathways into the greater water table. However, during periods of heavy rain, these same little creeks can turn into flood channels of immense power and geological change – deluges capable of swallowing huge swaths of land and altering the landscape in a matter of days or hours. The clay soils have poor drainage and cannot absorb the water fast enough. And after intense fires, the sage, manzanita, and scrub brush of the chapparal can leave a layer of plant derived oil that coats the surface with a thin, impermeable layer, further exacerbating the drainage issues. Thus, the Los Padres National Forest, and the terrain around the Santa Paula canyon are areas that have been experiencing rapid geological transformation – occurring in faster cycles than more stout or solid mountain ranges.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There is a sulphur spring near the mouth of the Santa Paula canyon. The smell is thick, and the pronounced stench of rotten eggs is hard to miss on the highway, as it just before the main trailhead parking areas. Up until very recently, by grant of an old easement with the Thomas Aquinas College, the National Forest Service, and the other ranch and property owners, the first mile of the trail actually cut through the campus property, ascending a few hundred feet in elevation along an asphalt road. The road crests by the Ferndale Ranch (home to a meandering flock of peacocks for many years) then drops down and heads around a bend. The last point on private property was just past the oil wells where the road ended, and a dirt trail formally began. It was only a few years ago that the campus was finally successful in obtaining new easement rights along the creek directly to the parking lots so that the official trail no longer goes through the campus property at all. But from the time I was a child and even through my 20’s and late 30’s the trail always involved that long, winding road.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My first trip into Santa Paula canyon was in 4th grade – as part of a day long field trip through my public elementary school. In fact, now that I think of it, lots of the public school kids in took day trips to the Ferndale Ranch (located just beyond the College campus) and hiked in to Punch Bowls — about 2 1/2 miles of hiking with a fairly steep and laborious slug up a hill at the end to climb for nine and ten year olds. The cliffs near the punch bowls were really dangerous — and the water could easily kill drown a child or adult during the non-drought years – as a series of cascading pools with increasingly large cliff jumps was more the stuff of adventurers and high school kids, not elementary or middle schoolers. I did not do the jumps until in my early twenties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The year after I did the ‘outdoor education’ through my public elementary school, it would have been 1992 or 1993, the district discontinued the program as a tragic drowning occurred with another school — a 12-year-old boy passed away when he got sucked over the falls. But even though the schools stopped taking kids there, the popularity of the spot has only grown and my mother kept taking us there through our adolescence. In fact, she used to call it ‘church’ and on more than one occasion she called in sick for us and took us hiking so that we could “go to church.” Raised catholic, but never practicing, my mom considered it more important to be in nature than in a giant building when it came to praising God and his creation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But it was later in my life that the East Fork trail and Santa Paula Canyon became even more important. One of my best friends, the one who would later lose his home near the origin of the Thomas Fire, was the one who introduced me and another friend to the camp. He had been there as a boy with his father, and he had sort of rediscovered it. Through the Thomas Aquinas college campus, up the Santa Paula Canyon trail and then past the popular ‘Punch Bowls’ (we always called them the moon rocks) hiking spot, was the old and in some spots, quite non-existent trail that went up the East Fork that led to the secret camp. Truth be told, it wasn’t really ‘secret’, and it was more like ‘rediscovered’. The camp, that we endearingly called ‘the land of one hundred waters’, was shown on some older maps, not on newer ones. But Santa Paula Peak, situated prominently above the valley where the camp was located, was listed on the Sierra Clubs’ Top 50 Peaks in California. And other prominent hikers knew of the camp and old trails. So, while it was sort of hard to get to and somewhat forgotten, the idea of it being a true secret was more romanticized than reality. The camp actually use to have a wagon trail to it (supposedly) in the late 19th century, where pioneer families would take extended vacations, but our ascent was always along the worn and mostly faded away and long neglected trail.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After the 2004-2005 floods, most of even the old trail washed away and it became more like boulder scrambling until the very last bit. Despite the technical difficulty and the lack of stable ground, the destination made it worth it. The camp was ‘a secret camp’ partly because it had some improvements that were added by a generation of hikers and campers that came before us. My friend’s father was a member of these hikers, part of a group of friends comprising an informal fraternity of sorts. The camp they built for themselves in the late 70’s and early 80’s included improvements that most camps do not have – especially those that are a full day’s hard walk through arduous terrain. The camp featured a twenty-foot long picnic table built out of a large fir tree that had been cut down and milled on site. There was also an asadero style bbq grill and an assortment of cast iron pots, skillets and other cookware. Nearby springs flowed year-round amidst a flat parcel of ground submerged beneath the deep shade of canyon live oaks that were hundreds of years old. Chumash griding bowls and mortars have been found in the area while exploring off the trails. About another thousand feet in elevation, above the camp, and along another worn and overgrown trail, there was located another camp sitting in huge boulders and cliffs comprised of sandstone and siltstone. The cliffs had this reddish tinge or hue to them that when hit with the last rays of sunlight, they’d turn the most amazing color before our eyes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we first started our hikes, the trail began by going through the large green cast iron gates at the entrance to the campus by the highway. On the weekends, the gates were locked and hikers were instructed by a sign to use the non-vehicle entrance. Strict instructions marked on signs all along the part of the road through the campus were hard to miss and the security guard was largely dedicated to making sure the hikers never wandered off the route. It almost felt intentional – the way the trailhead made the route so much longer. Surely, as we had tried on more than one occasion, there was a quicker, more efficient way through the campus.&nbsp; But on the weekends, hundreds, sometimes even over a thousand people on a real hot spell, would use the trailhead in search of the reliable swimming holes further up the canyon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All in all, I have spent over a year of my life sleeping in this place. Starting at nineteen and through a lot of my twenties, I needed to be there, up the East Fork, at the secret camp, at the headwaters, near the eternal springs, nestled amidst the oaks and old growth firs, above the dominion of the Thomas Aquinas Campus. I wasn’t the only one. I shared this experience with my best friends. Even my wife has spent a few weeks camping up in this place and would know the college if mentioned. I could tell stories for hours of this place.</p>
<p>Five nights here, three or four days there – the days turned into weeks and the weeks piled into months. I soon realized that I was spending much of my free time going to this place. When I wasn’t working or on another adventure, I made my best effort to get my bag packed and get up the mountain. When I was faced with either getting a new roommate or moving into my van to save money, I chose my van. I was already spending so much time at camp – it was an easy choice and it helped me save money even quicker for the big trip to New Zealand I had been planning.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Quickly however, it became apparent that Thomas Aquinas College with its big cast iron gates and zealous security guards was a barrier to our adventures up the mountain. Eventually, even parking on the highway at the trailhead would become too risky as more than one of us had our windows smashed. So, finding a cut-through, or a quicker path to the get to camp was a matter of circumstance, not choice. The impedance of the college and its long and winding road became cumbersome and annoying. For most people, the hike ended at around the 3 ½ mile mark – when they got to moon rocks. But for us, that was only about a quarter of the way, and the biggest nuisance was always going through the gates and walking up the long and winding road around the campus water reclamation pond (fancy for on-site sewage treatment). It took at least thirty or forty-five minutes to walk that first section – getting past the oil wells and onto the rock and dirt track always offered a sigh of relief. A mile is not that far, but it is a noticeable distance that was hard to ignore with 40-50lbs of rations and gear stuffed in a backpack. Clearly, we were hindered and greatly bothered with what seemed extra or unnecessary labor put in front of us by the College.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, we got bikes. We would use our bikes and ride up the hill along the asphalt path in extra low gear. Still physically difficult, but much quicker. And even better – on the way back we would really shave off the drag and droll of finishing a weekend of backpacking by plopping relentlessly along a hot, stinky asphalt path back to civilization. What better way than to whizz through the campus and down the hill in a mere instant – or about 25 mph. The security guard actually scolded us one time when we were riding our bikes too fast as even the cars were expected to observe a 15 mph speed limit.</p>
<p>Truth be told – there was actually another way to get to our secret camp – from an entirely different direction. So, in a sense, we could escape the dominion and the gates of Thomas Aquinas if we absolutely wanted to. We had found a way to our paradise that circumnavigated the more obvious and conventional path. But the other route featured its own drawbacks. First, it required an access code through a locked gate – so only certain people knew how to acquire the code (another easement battle from a forlorn era). But with the code, we could travel up the mouth of Timber canyon and ascend up the face of Santa Paula Peak. Like the Santa Paula Canyon trail, part of this felt redundant as there was, feasibly, a dirt road that would allow us to start closer to the actual forest (reserved public lands) lands. But we did not have permission to drive on the dirt roads. And this trail, being on an exposed and very sunny south face of a prominent 5,000 foot peak (the peak used to house a fire lookout tower and it was confirmed that a double-wide trail suitable for dirt bike travel used to exist all the way to the summit), was hard to climb during the day, and even in the winter months depending on the weather. We’d typically hike up the peak trail when cooler weather was around. On more than a few occasions we hiked up the peak at night. While better maintained and easier to navigate (up until 2021 washouts on the backside) this trail required more climbing and had a long descent into camp.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Weigh points along the peak trail last comprised of the following spots: ‘the house’ (burned in Thomas Fire but was the old trailhead start), the gate, the oaks (now known as ‘cow shit camp’, Kenny’s hill, the switchbacks, lunch rock, orange peel, soda pop, the peak spur, the saddle, the grassy spot, the last turn.</p>
<p>Weigh points along the canyon trail and the East Fork were last comprised of the following spots: The Gates (start of trail at highway), Ferndale, Noel’s place, the Oil well, the washout (aka ‘hell hill’), big cone, moon rocks, first crossing, log jam, poison oak camp, land of the milky white rocks, the witches portal, the flats, the spring trail, the meadow.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As I already mentioned, most hikers going up the canyon stopped just past big cone or the moon rocks (popularly known as the Punch Bowls), but our journey was always much longer. During the summer months we’d stash extra beers in the creek near the moon rocks for the last stop on our return hike home. Before retrieving our bikes (also stashed nearby) we would drink, swim and eat whatever last rations we had managed to save. Our adventures ended with riding the rest of the trail in a slightly altered state of consciousness, gleefully blowing past the other hikers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Eventually we learned the cycle of the big weekend hikers and campers could occasionally yield substantial gleanings of food, clothes and an assortment of abandoned camping gear. Descending the trail after a big summer weekend filled with tourists came with the feeling of returning to civilization in phases – the moon rocks and surrounding camping areas functioned as a sort of open-air dumpster or secondhand store. Any valuable gear we found we would stash for our next hike up. But discarded food stuffs such as ultra-processed and flavor enhanced cheese chips or a bag (opened or not it wouldn’t matter) of fortified and enriched chocolate chip cookies was always a welcome addition to our favorite end of hike snack – the ‘tuna boat’ – a green bell pepper stuffed with chunk tuna and chopped onions, cilantro and jalapeno or serrano, and finished with a few dallops of hot sauce from a fast food condiment packet.</p>
<p>Groups of people would come to the moon rocks from the nearby towns of Ventura, Oxnard, Camarillo and Port Hueneme for day hikes. Sometimes even people from Los Angeles County would hike in the canyon near the popular swimming spots. In my lifetime, the canyon acquired great popularity and many young people found it a particularly cool place to ‘camp out and party’. The drinking and revelry often combined with a lack of experience in many of the camping basics –concepts that we took for granted like what to bring and how to stay nourished and hydrated were not taught in the limited curriculum of field trips and ‘outdoor education’ available in elementary school. This resulted in a great number of hang overs and many of the inexperienced campers simply abandoning leftover food, dirty clothes, and even perfectly good gear that just looked too heavy to carry to a nineteen-year-old with a throbbing headache. Their discarded leftovers were always our miraculous discoveries.</p>
<p>So much of my life, my energy field, the imprint of who I am (and who I am still to become) is in relation to that magical place. I have hundreds (probably thousands) of photos of my time in the East Fork canyon and Los Padres National Forest. I hope you can appreciate the significance of the coincidence and the elements of magical realism that present here.</p>
<p>Thomas Aquinas College was always a gatekeeper – not just a ‘way’ point, on our trail, but also, a ‘weigh’ point, a spot on the trail that weighed both our packs and our worthiness as we traveled through its dominion. After passing through the gates, it taxed us appropriately on our travels into higher realms.</p>
<p>The important work that I would do up in the camps and bluffs above the dominion of the college, beyond the realm of the material world, was spiritual work. True, our materialist trappings of fine cuts of meat, malted ales and other liquors, legumes, potatoes and assorted vegetables, they always traveled with us, as they served to literally weigh us down all along the chosen route. But the majority of the work done at camp was always spiritual work. In fact, one of my best friends, (not the one who lived right next to the fire, but who also lost his home(s) to the fire), worked for several years to construct his very own cabin, hidden away from camp up in the bluffs, nestled in its own little nook. It was a beautiful little forest cabin before it burned down in the Thomas Fire. It was comprised of a variety of native stone and hand-hewn lumber, and also some building materials he had carried in. It had taken him months of accumulated time to build it, almost all by his own hand. Before it burned down, he used to refer to it as ‘his life’s work.’</p>
<p></p>
<p>What is this notion of our ‘life’s work’? The time that I craved to be there – and the amount of time I spent there – for some it was perceived as escaping from work or escaping from responsibility – from existence in the material realm. But it never felt like that for me.&nbsp; It was a place of great importance, and learning. Of experiments and mysteries.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I didn’t understand it in this way then – but the important barrier (or bridge) that Thomas Aquinas College served in my travels isn’t just an inconvenience. It was a physical burden to have to pass through the gates of Thomas Aquinas College and walk the extra mile. But now, now I see that it was also a spiritual bridge that they controlled – or, more precisely, closely monitored.</p>
<p>At first, I used to believe that the college was not receptive of the hikers, and that they’d rather not have us there. The stern nature of the signs and security guards keeping everyone on the right path seemed bothersome to the pristine and peaceful environment that was cultivated on the campus grounds. But now, re-thinking the role not as an inconvenience to the college, but instead, as a chosen duty, or a higher calling, a sort of self-endowed guardianship over a gateway and control of the bridge, or the portal, from one dimension to the next. The college watched over my travels as I left material world and prepared to ascend into the spiritual world. They were monitoring my travel into and out of Gods splendor – now I see that it was not an accident that the college situated itself in this manner. The perceived hacks and different techniques my friends and I learned to get around the expectation and presumed relationship with the College as gate keeper and pathway enforcer were beneficial to us, but that did not diminish the college’s dominion over the bridge or the majority of other hikers. In fact, it was only because of our desire to return to the higher realms over and over again that the important role the college served became noticeable. Had I only hiked into the canyon on occasion, it would be easy to overlook. But having made this special place my literal second home, the college was always the first weigh point on the longer journey.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thomas Aquinas College is not far from several other notable institutions of learning and foundations of spiritual significance. The Ojai Valley has been a center of new thought for well over a century now (and quite longer if considering indigenous cosmology). Just over four miles from the college campus as the crow flies, there is the Ojai Valley School, an alternative education school for children founded in 1911. And not far off, perhaps another mile or so further west is the Thacher School, established even earlier in 1887. Situated close to the Thacher school is the Krishnamurti Foundation for America, another well-known institution. It was in 1922, in Ojai, where Jiddu Krishnamurti is said to have had a “life changing experience.” Directly to the west of Thomas Aquinas College, about five miles away and sitting atop the summit of Sulphur Mountain is Meher Mount – a spiritual retreat center first established in 1946 and dedicated to the Avatar Baba Meher. A little further west and centrally located in the small town of Ojai is the Krotona Theosopical Society – first founded in Hollywood in 1912, and later relocated in Ojai in 1922. Yogi Paramahansa Yogananda was known to visit the area and helped found his spiritual sanctuary in 1950 as part of his self-realization fellowship. No doubt there are more places of spiritual and cultural significance in and around Thomas Aquinas College. The reputation of the area precedes itself.</p>
<p>However, in taking a step back and thinking about the college’s place differently, and in general contemplating what it is about this area that has drawn so many to the area in search of enlightenment, I could not help but wonder – where the energy is coming from? Is it inherent in the land, as if by a magical grid or ley lines? Or is this energy coming in from somewhere else?</p>
<p>Just south of the campus and the sulphur springs, about two miles away, is another site of importance that has reemerged as important – perhaps the most significant and important site of all – that suggests broadening my horizons even further – and asking, or perhaps, doing the work to begin to formulate new questions, better questions, that stretch my understanding of the intelligent forces at work in our world.</p>
<p>COMSAT, a global satellite communications company, established its teleport site in Santa Paula in 1975. The site is shown on the COMSAT webpage under its ‘commercial’ heading. But, as of November 1, 2023, COMSAT, and SatCom Direct, are now part of Goonhilly. The technical components at the site and the capabilities of the site far exceed mere commercial endeavors.</p>
<p>For many years I just assumed that the satellite dishes and arrays that are visible from the highway, just south of the gates at Thomas Aquinas, were nothing special – just more telecommunications equipment for the burgeoning cellular telephone industry. Now I understand that the array there is unique – and possesses capabilities to look farther into space – into a cosmic void where one day we might discover the true meaning of intelligence.</p>
<p>Goonhilly “is one of the world’s premier space communication gateways providing control and uplinks for satellites and deep space missions.” With the recent acquisition of COMSAT Teleports, including the Santa Paula site, Goonhilly is expanding “all communication service offerings from LEO (Low Earth Orbit) right through commercial GEO to lunar and deep space.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Goonhilly’s first site was located at Goonhilly Downs, near Helston on the Lizard Pennisula in Cornwall, England. Under a 999-year lease from British Telecom (BT Inc.) it was one of the largest stations in the world at its inception and still possesses some of the most advanced capabilities on the planet. Its parabolic dish, nicknamed ‘Arthur,’ was one of the first of its kind. Its current largest dish, called ‘Merlin’ is equally impressive in the modern era.</p>
<p>Now, connected to the Santa Paula site next to the Thomas Aquinas College (and others around the earth), Goonhilly has positioned itself in many ways as its own kind of keeper, or guardian, of our ability to move from one dimension to the next. Goonhilly maintains the flow of information as it is transformed from the physical experience into digitized atoms and bits that are parceled and scattered into the heavens. As the information slowly coalesces and comes back together again, it is Goonhilly that is now positioned to monitor and carefully watch over our access to intelligence and information as we pursue our rightful place in existence and amongst the higher realms.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Space signaling, and earth-based radar as a form of communication and wayfinding from one dimension to the next, is a technologically complex subject that I don’t ever think I will fully understand. Nor should I have to. As long as I am alive, I will keep my eyes (and my heart) open to discovering new ways around the barriers or tolled bridges or locked gates that slow me down and impede my journey. As long as I am alive, I will look for ways to lighten my pack and quicken my journey as I pass by the weigh points.</p>

<p>It was 11am at the Fort Lauderdale airport, an hour after my non-stop flight to Portland was supposed to have boarded. As I had been watching our estimated departure get pushed back in 15 minute increments, I finally received the dreaded news over the loudspeaker - the flight was cancelled entirely. As hordes of people started lining up to rebook their flights with the gate agent, I found a quiet spot in the corner and opened up my laptop to look at my options.</p>

<p>The other Alaska Airlines flight options were pretty terrible. There was a Fort Lauderdale to Seattle to Portland option that would have me landing at midnight. A flight on a partner airline had a 1-hour connection through Dallas, and there were only middle seats available on both legs. So I started to get creative, and searched for flights from Orlando, about 200 miles north. There was a non-stop on Alaska Airlines at 7pm, with plenty of available seats, so I called up customer service and asked them to change my booking. Since the delay was their fault, there were no change fees even though the flight was leaving from a different airport.</p>

<p>So now it was my responsibility to get myself from Miami to Orlando by 7pm. I could have booked a flight on a budget airline for $150, but it wouldn't have been a very nice experience, and I'd have a lot of time to kill in the Orlando airport. Then I remembered the Brightline train recently opened new service from Miami to Orlando, supposedly taking less time than driving there.</p>

 Brightline Station Fort Lauderdale 

<p></p>

<p>Never having tried to take that train before, I didn't realize they run a shuttle service from the Fort Lauderdale airport to the train station, so I jumped in an Uber headed to the station. On the way there, I booked a ticket on my phone. The price from Miami to Orlando was $144 for Coach, or $229 for Premium class. Since this will probably be the only time I take this train for the foreseeable future, I splurged for the Premium class ticket to see what that experience is like.</p>

<p>Astute readers will have noticed that I mentioned I booked a ticket from Miami rather than Fort Lauderdale. We'll come back to that in a bit. Once I arrived at the station, I began my Brightline experience.</p>

<p>Walking in to the station felt like something between an airport and a car rental center.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There was a small ticket counter in the lobby, but I already had a ticket on my phone so I went up the escalators.</p>

<p></p>

<p>At the top of the escalators was an electronic gate where you scan your QR code to go through. Mine didn't work (again, more on that later), but it was relatively empty and a staff member was able to look at my ticket on my phone and let me through anyway. There was a small X-Ray machine, I tossed my roller bag and backpack onto the belt, but kept my phone and wallet in my pocket, and walked through the security checkpoint.</p>

<p>Once through the minimal security checkpoint, I was up in the waiting area above the platform with a variety of different sections. There was a small bar with drinks and snacks, a couple large seating areas, an automated mini mart, some tall tables...</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>... and the entrance to the Premium lounge.</p>

 Brightline Station Premium Lounge 

<p></p>

<p>The Premium Lounge entrance had another electronic gate with a QR code scanner. I tried getting in but it also rejected my boarding pass. My first thought was I booked my ticket just 10 minutes earlier so it hadn't synced up yet, so I went back to the the security checkpoint and asked what was wrong. They looked at my boarding pass and had no idea what was wrong, and let me in to the lounge via the back employee-only entrance instead.</p>

<p>Once inside the lounge, I did a quick loop to see what kind of food and drink options there were. The lounge was entirely un-attended, the only staff I saw were at the security checkpoint, and someone occasionally coming through to take out dirty dishes.</p>

<p>The first thing you're presented with after entering the lounge is the beverage station. There are 6 taps with beer and wine, and you use a touch screen to make your selection and pour what you want.</p>

<p></p>

<p>On the other side of the wall is the food. I arrived at the tail end of the breakfast service, so there were pretty slim pickings by the end.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There were yogurts, granola, a bowl of bacon and egg mix, several kinds of pastries, and a bowl of fruit that nobody seemed to have touched. I don't know if this was just because this was the end of the morning, but if you were vegan or gluten free there was really nothing you could eat there.</p>

<p>There was also a coffee and tea station with some minimal options.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Shortly after I arrived, it rolled over to lunch time, so the staff came out to swap out the food at the food station. The lunch options were also minimal, but there was a bit more selection.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There was a good size meat and cheese spread. I'm not a big fan of when they mix the meat and cheese on the same plate, but there was enough of a cheese island in the middle I was reasonably confident I wasn't eating meat juice off the side of the cheeses. The pasta dish also had meat so I didn't investigate further. Two of the three wraps had meat and I wasn't confident about which were which so I skipped those. There was a pretty good spinach and feta salad, and some hummus as well as artichoke dip, and a variety of crackers. If you like desserts, there was an even better selection of small desserts as well.</p>

<p>At this point I was starting to listen for my train's boarding announcement. There was really barely any staff visible anywhere, but the few people I saw had made it clear they would clearly announce the train over the loudspeakers when it was time. There was also a sign at the escalators to the platform that said boarding opens 10 minutes before the train departs.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The trains run northbound and southbound every 1-2 hours, so it's likely that you'll only hear one announcement for a train other than yours the entire time you're there.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The one train announcement I heard was a good demonstration of how quickly the whole process actually is once the train shows up. The train pulls up, they call everyone down to the platform, and you have ten minutes to get onto the train. Ten minutes isn't much, but you're sitting literally right on top of the train platform so it takes no time to get down there.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once your train is called, it's time to head down the escalator to the train platform!</p>

 Boarding the Train 

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>But wait, I mentioned my barcode had failed to be scanned a couple times at this point. Let me explain. Apparently, in my haste in the back of the Uber, I had actually booked a ticket from Miami to Orlando, but since I was already at the Fort Lauderdale airport, I had gone to the Fort Lauderdale Brightline station since it was the closest. So the departure time I saw on my ticket didn't match the time the train arrived at Fort Lauderdale, and the ticket gates refused to let me in because the ticket didn't depart from that station. I don't know why none of the employees who looked at my ticket mentioned this ever. It didn't end up being a big deal because thankfully Miami was earlier in the route, so I essentially just got on my scheduled train 2 stops late.</p>

<p></p>

<p>So anyway, I made my way down to the platform to board the train. I should also mention at this point that I was on a conference call from my phone. I had previously connected my phone to the free wifi at the station, and it was plenty good enough for the call. As I went down the escalator to the platform, it broke up a bit in the middle of the escalator, but picked back up once I was on the platform outside.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There were some signs on the platform to indicate "Coach 1", "Coach 2" and "Coach 3" cars. However my ticket was a "Premium" ticket, so I walked to where I assumed the front of the train would be when it pulled up.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I got on the train on the front car marked "SMART" and "3", seats 9-17. It wasn't clear what "SMART" was since I didn't see that option when booking online. My seat was seat 9A, so I wasn't entirely sure I was in the right spot, but I figured better to be on the train than on the platform, so I just went in. We started moving shortly after. As soon as I walked in, I had to walk past the train attendant pushing a beverage cart through the aisles. I made it to seat 9, but it was occupied. I asked the attendant where my seat was, and she said it was in car 1 at the "front", and motioned to the back of the train. I don't know why their cars are in the opposite order you'd expect. So I took my bags back to car 1 where I was finally greeted with the "Premium" sign I was looking for.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I was quickly able to find my seat, which was not in fact occupied. The Premium car was configured with 2 seats on one side and 1 seat on the other side.</p>

 The Brightline Premium Car 

<p></p>

<p>Some of the seats are configured to face each other, so there is a nice variety of seating options. You could all be sitting around a table if you booked a ticket for 4 people, or you could book 2 tickets and sit either next to each other or across from each other.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Since I had booked my ticket so last minute, I had basically the last available seat in the car so I was sitting next to someone. As soon as I sat down, the beverage cart came by with drinks. The cart looked like the same type you'd find on an airplane, and even had some identical warning stickers on it such as the "must be secured for takeoff and landing" sign. The drink options were also similar to what you'd get on a Premium Economy flight service. I opted for a glass of prosecco, and made myself comfortable.</p>

<p>The tray table at the seat had two configurations. You could either drop down a small flap or the whole tray.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>The small tray was big enough to hold a drink or an iPad or phone, but not much else. The large tray was big enough for my laptop with a drink next to it as well as an empty glass or bottle behind it.</p>

<p>Under the seat there was a single power outlet for the 2 seats with 120v power as well as two USB-C ports.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Shortly after I had settled in, the crew came back with a snack tray and handed me these four snacks without really giving me the option of refusing any of them.</p>

<p></p>

<p>At this point I wasn't really hungry since I had just eaten at the airport, so I stuffed the snacks in my bag, except for the prosciutto, which I offered to my seat mate but he refused.</p>

<p>By this point we were well on our way to the Boca Raton stop. A few people got off and on there, and we continued on. I should add here that I always feel a bit unsettled when there is that much movement of people getting on and off all the time. These stops were about 20-30 minutes away from each other, which meant the beginning of the ride I never really felt completely settled in. This is the same reason I prefer a 6 hour flight over two 3 hour flights. I like to be able to settle in and just not think about anything until we arrive.</p>

<p>We finally left the last of the South Florida stops, West Palm Beach, and started the rest of the trip to Orlando. A bunch of people got off at West Palm Beach, enough that the Premium cabin was nearly empty at that point. I was able to move to the seat across the aisle which was a window/aisle seat all to myself!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Finally I could settle in for the long haul. Shortly before 3, the crew came by with the lunch cart. The options were either a vegetarian or non-vegetarian option, so that made the choice easy for me.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The vegetarian option was a tomato basil mozzarella sandwich, a side of fruit salad, and some vegetables with hummus. The hummus was surprisingly good, not like the little plastic tubs you get at the airport. The sandwich was okay, but did have a nice pesto spread on it.</p>

<p>After lunch, I opened up my computer to start writing this post and worked on it for most of the rest of the trip.</p>

<p>As the train started making a left turn to head west, the conductor came on the loudspeaker and made an announcement along the lines of "we're about to head west onto the newest tracks that have been built in the US in 100 years. We'll be reaching 120 miles per hour, so feel free to feel smug as we whiz by the cars on the highway." And sure enough, we really picked up the speed on that stretch! While we had reached 100-120mph briefly during the trip north, that last stretch was a solid 120mph sustained for about 20 minutes!</p>

 Orlando Station 

<p></p>

<p>We finally slowed down and pulled into the Orlando station at the airport.</p>

<p>Disembarking the train was simple enough. This was the last stop of the train so there wasn't quite as much of a rush to get off before the train started again. There's no need to mind the gap as you get off since there's a little platform that extends from the train car.</p>

<p></p>

<p>At the Orlando station there was a short escalator up and then you exit through the automated gates.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I assumed I would have to scan my ticket when exiting but that ended up not being the case. Which actually meant that the only time my ticket was ever checked was when entering the station. I never saw anyone come through to check tickets on the train.</p>

<p>At this point I was already in the airport, and it was a short walk around the corner to the tram that goes directly to the airport security checkpoint.</p>

<p>The whole trip took 176 minutes for 210 miles, which is an average speed of 71 miles per hour. When moving, we were typically moving at anywhere from 80-120 miles per hour.</p>

 Summary 

 
 The whole experience was way nicer than an airplane, I would take this over a short flight from Miami to Orlando any day. 
 It felt similar to a European train, but with service closer to an airline. 
 The service needs to be better timed with the stops when people are boarding. 
 The only ticket check was when entering the station, nobody came to check my ticket or seat on the train, or even when I left the destination station. 
 While the Premium car food and drinks were free, I'm not sure it was worth the $85 extra ticket price over just buying the food you want. 
 Unfortunately the ticket cost was similar to that of budget airlines, I would have preferred the cost to be slightly lower. But even still, I would definitely take this train over a budget airline at the same cost. 
 

<p>We need more high speed trains in the US! I go from Portland to Seattle often enough that a train running every 90 minutes that was faster than a car and easier and more comfortable than an airplane would be so nice!</p>

<p>Just before Thanksgiving, <a href="https://www.npr.org/">NPR</a>‘s <a href="https://www.npr.org/programs/all-things-considered/">All Things Considered</a> radio program had a <a href="https://www-cf.npr.org/2023/11/21/1214529474/how-to-keep-an-eye-out-for-cyber-scams-during-this-holiday-shopping-season">short item</a> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMARC">DMARC</a>, a protocol that attempts to control fraudulent use of internet domains by email spammers by asserting that messages coming from those domains are authenticated using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail">DKIM</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework">SPF</a>. Since I have been working in that area, a colleague alerted me to the coverage and I listened to it online.</p>



<p>A couple of people asked me about my opinion of the article, which I thought might be of interest to others as well.</p>



 



<p>From the introduction:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>JENNA MCLAUGHLIN, BYLINE: Cybercriminals love the holiday season. The internet is flooded with ads clamoring for shoppers’ attention, and that makes it easier to slip in a scam. At this point, you probably know to watch out for phishing emails, but it might surprise you to know that there’s a tool that’s been around a long time that could help solve this problem. It’s called DMARC – or the Domain Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance Protocol – whew. It’s actually pretty simple. It basically helps prove the sender is who they say they are.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Of course it doesn’t help prove the sender is who they say they are at all, it expresses a request for what to do when the sender doesn’t. But I’ll forgive this one since it’s the interviewer’s misunderstanding.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>ROBERT HOLMES: DMARC seeks to bring trust and confidence to the visible from address of an email so that when you receive an email from an address at wellsfargo.com or bestbuy.com, you can say with absolute certainty it definitely came from them.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>(1) There is no “visible from address”. Most mail user agents (webmail, and programs like Apple Mail) these days leave out the actual email address and only display the “friendly name”, which isn’t verified at all. I get lots of junk email with addresses like:</p>



 From: Delta Airlines &lt;win-Eyiuum8@Eyiuum8-DeltaAirlines.com&gt; 



<p>This of course isn’t going to be affected by Delta’s DMARC policy (which only applies to email with a From address of @delta.com), but a lot of recipients are going to only see “Delta Airlines.” Even if the domain was visible, it’s not clear how much attention the public pays to the domain, compounded by the fact that this one is deceptively constructed.</p>



<p>(2) There is no absolute certainty. Even with a DKIM signature in many cases a bogus <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8601">Authentication-Results</a> header field could be added, or the selector record in DNS could be spoofed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_spoofing">cache poisoning</a>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>HOLMES: So the thing about good security – it should be invisible to Joe Public.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This seems to imply that the public doesn’t need to be vigilant as long as the companies implement DMARC. Not a good message to send. And of course p=none, which for many domains is the only safe policy to use, isn’t going to change things at all, other than to improve deliverability to Yahoo and Gmail.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>HOLMES: I think the consequences of getting this wrong are severe. Legitimate email gets blocked.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Inappropriate DMARC policies cause a lot of legitimate email blockage as well.</p>



<p>When we embarked on this authentication policy thing (back when we were doing <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc5617/">ADSP</a>), I hoped that it would cause domains to separate their transactional and advertising mail, use different domains or subdomains for those, and publish appropriate policies for those domains. It’s still not perfect, since some receive-side forwarders (e.g., alumni addresses) break DKIM signatures. But what has happened instead is a lot of blanket requirements to publish restrictive DMARC policies regardless of the usage of the domain, such as the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/bod-18-01-enhance-email-and-web-security">CISA requirement on federal agencies</a>. And of course there has been a big marketing push from DMARC proponents that, in my opinion, encourages domains to publish policies that are in conflict with how their domains are used.</p>



<p>Going back to my earlier comment, I really wonder if domain-based policy mechanisms like DMARC provide significant benefit when the domain isn’t visible. On the other hand, DMARC does cause definite breakage, notably to mailing lists.</p>

  <p>Some riddles are so complex that people just stop contemplating, and concede. Here on the VRM dev list, over many years, the struggle to explain structural concepts in motion has fought for words in a social context that disavows progress by design. There is only one place where "self-induced Sovereignty" is approachable in accurate human terms, and conversing the methods elsewhere, like Canada, Europe, China, or via the modern Administrative State, etc... is a failure at inception, and the process of grabbing the word to apply policy obfuscations on accurate use is intentional. As has been discussed plenty of times, the State-defined "Sovereign citizen movement" is the most dangerous ideology&nbsp;in existence, and the people who live under its definition are the most dangerous people in existence. I mean, have you seen them all out there doing what they do, acting all Sovereign unto themselves? Scary stuff, right?</p> "Human Rights" is another great example, used pervasively in Government administration, and by identity entrepreneurs in aggressively collating the un-identified/&nbsp;un-banked/&nbsp;un-civilized. Powerful words and concepts are always open to perversion by intent, and require courageous stewardship to hold accountable to the actual meaning conferred by utterance. Most western societies operate under the belief that human rights exist, and their society protects them. Yet, in defining the human rights for and unto the human population being administered, the order of operations is strictly accurate, where words documenting process fall well-short.&nbsp;  <br>  In the US, human rights are administered rights. Prior to administration, there is no&nbsp;functional concept of human rights, thats why the UN applies its language to the most vulnerable, children, as it does... an administered right to administration of Nationality and Identity sets the stage for data existence. You, the Individual person, like all the rest of us, have no existence until you are legally administered, despite an ability to observe human existence prior to administration. "Civil Society", like math once did, exists in a state that denies the existence of zero - the unadministered pre-citizen, pre-customer, pre-Righted, pre-identified with actual existence as a human with Rights. Sorry, but you are going to need an administered ID for that.  <br>  If human rights existed, then human migration would be a matter of free expression, and access to Sovereign jurisdictions proclaiming support for "Human Rights" would need to quibble less about process of admittance. Simple in theory, but get ready for the administrative use of fear to induce human behavior in compliance to expected procedures.... "Terrorist Migrants Are Coming!!!!" ... ie, no actual, structural human rights here, move along. Only cult-politics can confront this with policy, as structural human rights have no meaningful expression in structural terms... just linguistics.  <br>  Now in China, who cares... human&nbsp;rights don't exist. The default commie-state of the newborn baby, dependent on others for survival, is extended throughout life. Little commie-baby-brains are the most compliant, most enforceable population on the planet, and structural considerations of participation are not to be found - bring on the social credit score. At home, or in the hospital, newborn families are not inherently tuned to the structural considerations of a new born&nbsp;life, they are tired, exhausted, hopefully in glee at the newly arriving human they have custody for. This is where the heist occurs. Systems love compliant people, they can do anything with them as their fodder.&nbsp;  <br>  Data collection starts immediately; afterall, that new baby needs administered existence in order to exist with rights. Right?&nbsp;  <br>  Data plantations running on endless databases, storing administered credentials in State Trusts, set the stage for the participation of living beings that will one day wake in a world that they themselves will have custody for,&nbsp;in theory. But in that moment, those little commie-baby-brains need to be administered by the State, need to be defined by State identification processes, in order to exist legally, and as a function of the future, those theories will yield to administered practices.  <br>  Structure yields results...&nbsp;  <br>  How many people care? As "we" look around and communicate on this list, W2 employees with pensions become pervasive in all of these conversations. These structural participants, one-level removed from their Righted structure as citizens, even within "more perfect Sovereign unions", form sub-unions protecting their continuity as structural outcomes. What outcomes? What is the structural outcome they achieve? Like little commie-baby-brains, these adult participants cede their self-Sovereign integrity and representation, to induce group-action via group-think and group-coordination. It works really well, and makes these people "feel" really powerful in their time and place, inducing actions that try to scale their structural considerations for all people who remain out-of-step.  <br>  Thats where "You" come in, and by example, where a more perfect union comes in, to protect the greatest minority, and default sub-unit of the human organism, the Individual. Here, the commie-baby-brain must stand accountable to the inherent structural integrity of an Individual human life with direct, personal living authority. Personal authority, the kind that really makes little adult-commie-brains upset as "people"&nbsp;who can't/don't/won't be able to express such authority with any confidence, and without any guidance from a group-administrator. You see it all the time, as the administrative system routs&nbsp;one attention to channel 4 for programming, and channel 5 for another. Cult-capture is structurally assured by design, a coup by actual intent.&nbsp;  <br>  This sets the backdrop of work and conversation here. There are too many people on this list that will NEVER materialize an accurate understanding of the structural accuracy of human rights, and the Sovereign structure of human liberty and accountability, the kind that builds real "civil" societies. Instead, they will pervert words, quibble&nbsp;against words, use fear to harm dialogue, and insist on centralized authority to secure people from themselves, and the most scary people on the planet... people who think and act for themselves to stand up Sovereign jurisdictions as self-represented participants and sources of Sovereign authority.&nbsp;  <br>  Too hard? Too old? Too young? Too compliant? Too accurate?&nbsp;  <br>  Prior to any administrative act, actual human rights exist. (<a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2023/10/zero-party-doctrine.html">Zero Party Doctrine</a>) Good people, with functionally literate adult minds, and the persistent choice to preserve human health, wealth, wisdom, liberty, and personal pursuits of happiness in time serve as the actual foundation of a dominant world-view with no equal. Own your own life, own your own work, own your own future, own your own administration as righted people in civil societies. The alternative is not civil, and not humane to Individuals, all people. Structure yields superior results....  <br>  As builders of AI systems serving such people, structural considerations trump hype. I will stop short of discussing technical methods ensuring such outcomes, but suffice it to say it is a choice to induce unending focus on such outcomes. It requires no marketing, it requires no venture capital, and it wins because it is supported by winners. People, Individuals&nbsp;all, who give accountability personally to the freedoms they express incrementally in the face of far too ample losers who are always one comma away from proclaiming your adult minds a threat to the existence of their little commie-baby-brains while begging for access to the world built by self-Sovereign efforts of leaders, the real kind.  <br>  AI is about raising the bottom up to the statistical mean in present form. Protecting leading edge human thought, and output, is going to require a new approach to human identity. Databases are the domain of AI, and humanity will not be able to compete as artifacts living on a databased plantation.&nbsp;  <br>  A great civil society reset is required (Not the "Build Back Better" commie-baby-brain variety), and it is just a matter of time before it becomes essential for any person now participating in the masses as little commie-baby-brains despite believing "they" exist in some other way as a result of linguistics or flag flying. Watch the administration process devolve, as people, the bleeding kind, are conflated with "people", the linguistic variety, and have their "Rights" administered as "permissions" due to some fear-inducing event. Well documented on this list by pseudo-leaders.  <br>  Open source AI, local AI, rooted human authority... all in the crosshairs. Remember who you are up against. Universal derivation and sharing no longer exist in the same place at the same time. Declare your structural reality.. human Individual leader, or statistical mean on a data-driven plantation. It is still not optional. People, Indiviiduals all, must own root authority.

  I've been trying to be intentional about using generative AI for more and more tasks in my life. For example, the image above is generated by DALL-E. I think generative AI is going to upend almost everything we do online, and I'm not alone. One of the places it will have the greatest impact is its uses in personal agents whether or not these agents enable people to lead effective online lives.

As Jamie points out: "Digital identity [is how we] prove who we are to others"​​. This statement is particularly resonant as we consider not just the role of digital identities in enhancing personal agents, but also their crucial function in asserting ownership of our creations in an AI-dominated landscape.</p><p>Personal agents, empowered by AI, will be integral to our digital interactions, managing tasks and providing personalized experiences. As Bill Gates says, <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/AI-agents">AI is about to completely change how you use computers</a>. The key to the effectiveness of these personal agents lies in the robust digital identities they leverage. These identities are not just tools for authentication; they're pivotal in distinguishing our human-generated creations from those produced by AI.</p><p>In creative fields, for instance, the ability to prove ownership of one's work becomes increasingly vital as AI-generated content proliferates. A strong digital identity enables creators to unequivocally claim their work, ensuring that the nuances of human creativity are not lost in the tide of AI efficiency. Moreover, in sectors like healthcare and finance, where personal agents are entrusted with sensitive tasks, a trustworthy, robust, self-sovereign identity ensures that these agents act in harmony with our real-world selves, maintaining the integrity and privacy of our personal data.</p><p>In this AI-centric era, proving authorship through digital identity becomes not just a matter of pride but a shield against the rising tide of AI-generated fakes. As artificial intelligence becomes more adept at creating content—from written articles to artwork—the line between human-generated and AI-generated creations blurs. A robust, owner-controlled digital identity acts as a bastion, enabling creators to assert their authorship and differentiate their genuine work from AI-generated counterparts. This is crucial in combating the proliferation of deepfakes and other AI-generated misinformation, ensuring the authenticity of content and safeguarding the integrity of our digital interactions. In essence, our digital identity becomes a critical tool in maintaining the authenticity and trustworthiness of the digital ecosystem, protecting not just our intellectual property but the very fabric of truth in our digital world.</p><p>As we embrace this new digital frontier, the focus must not only be on the convenience and capabilities of AI-driven agents but also on fortifying our digital identities so that your personal agent is controlled by you. Jamie ends his post with five key questions about personal agents that we shouldn't lose sight of:</p>  <p>Who does the digital assistant belong to?</p>  <p>How will our personal agents be funded?</p>  <p>What will personal agents do tomorrow, that we can’t already do today?</p>  <p>Will my personal agent do things WITH me and FOR me, or TO me?</p>  <p>Which brands will be trusted to offer personal agents?</p>  <p>Your digital identity is your anchor in the digital realm, asserting our ownership, preserving our uniqueness, and fostering trust in an increasingly automated world, helping you <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">operationalize your digital relationships</a>.

<p>Tomorrow (well today, since I’m ten minutes late in getting this posted) is Thanksgiving in the United States. I’ve had mixed feelings about it since the February 2017 raid on Standing Rock where Regina Brave made her treaty stand. After watching MRAPs coming down a muddy, snowy hill to confront a Lakota grandmother and Navy veteran on Unicorn Riot’s livestream, it was hard to go back to being a parade bystander. It didn’t feel right watching the Major Drumstick float go by as we took in drum corps performances and waited for Santa to make his appearance on the Ben Franklin Parkway, officially opening the season of holiday excess. To be honest, I was kind of a downer.</p>
<p>Six years later, I have more life experience and clarity around cognitive domain management, identity politics, prediction modeling, and the strategic use of drama and trauma. I sense now that Standing Rock was likely part of an unfolding spectacle that was intended to set the stage for the use of indigenous identity as cover for faux green sustainability markets linked to web3 natural capital – the rights of nature literally tethered to digital ledgers in the name of equity and acknowledgement of past harms. </p>
<p>That is not to say protester concerns around the threats of pipelines to water systems weren’t valid. They were. It is not to dismiss the injustice of broken treaties, to diminish the horror of violence waged against native bodies, to undermine authentic efforts towards being in right relationship with the Earth and one another. No, the reasons people came to Standing Rock mattered. They did, but I expect few who participated would have ever realized the community that arose on that icy riverbank was viewed by myriad analysts as an emergent complex system, an extremely valuable case study at a time when we were on the cusp of AI swarm intelligence and cognitive warfare.</p>
<p>I’d come to know a man through my education activism who was there on the day of the raid, a person I considered a friend and mentor. We’ve drifted apart since the lockdowns. Such digital entanglements now seem pervasive and ephemeral. Were we really friends? Was it an act? In some extended reality play? Part of some larger campaign meant to position us where we were supposed to be years hence? I don’t think we’re meant to know. Perhaps like “degrees of freedom,” “degrees of uncertainty” are baked into the “many-worlds” equations humming within the data center infrastructure spewing out today’s digital twin multiverses. In any event, his research opened the door of my mind to the quiet, devastating treachery of social impact finance as well as the vital importance of indigenous spiritual practice and sovereignty. His ties to Utah’s complex and troubled history, a place that birthed virtual worlds of encrypted teapots under craggy mountains soaked in radioactive star dust on the shores of crystalline salt lakes sitting atop vast stores of transmitting copper ore, spun me into the space where I am now.</p>
<p>Looking back I held a simmering anger that hurt my family in ways I did not realize. It was probably an energetic frequency. We didn’t talk about it. We didn’t argue. Everything was fine, until lockdowns happened and suddenly it wasn’t. I felt betrayed having been what I considered a “good citizen” doing all the right things for so many decades and then abruptly having the scales fall from my eyes. This culture to which I had been habituated wasn’t at all what I thought it was. Nonetheless we were supposed to continue to perform our assigned roles as if nothing had changed. As long as we kept saying the assigned lines, things in middle-class progressive America would be ok. I was expected to paper over the rifts that were opening up in reality as I had known it, tuck away my disenchantment, my questions. Once one domino fell, they would all go, and that would be incredibly painful to everyone around me. And anyway, I didn’t have an answer that would reconcile the inconsistencies ready in my back pocket. There was a sad logic in it. If there was no easy fix, why wreck the status quo? Surely that wasn’t doing anyone any favors, right?</p>
<p>Nothing turned out like I thought it would. Suddenly, I was a planner without a plan. Today I have lots more information, and if anything, I recognize that I know less than I need to – that is than my mind needs to. In a world of information you can never pin it all down, organize it, make sense of it from an intellectual standpoint. But maybe it’s time to lead with the heart, at least that’s what all the techno-bros are saying. Maybe I should just shrug and let Sophia the robot guide me into some transformative meditation? Well, probably not. And I’ll pass on the Deepak Chopra wellness app, too. I foresee a future where rocks and water and trees are my partners in biophotonic exchange. At least that is what feels right for now. Patience.</p>
<p>For the moment I am on my own. I still love my small family with all my heart, and I really miss my dad every day. I have his watch with the scent of his Polo cologne on the band. It makes me tear up, a mix of poignant loss, and remembering hugs in his strong arms. It’s funny since I seem to have fallen outside of “civilized” time now. The days all run into one another and mostly I’m just aware of the contours of the seasons as I wait for the next phase of my life to start in the spring. Oh, that watch – there is a sense of irony in the universe for sure, a trickster energy I have to learn to appreciate more.</p>
<p>I have a small turkey brining in the fridge. I’ll be eating alone, but that’s ok. I don’t feel pressured to make all the fixings – sweet potatoes and broccoli will be fine. Maybe this weekend I’ll make an apple pie, my dad’s favorite. I’m downsizing. I’m leaning into less is more. I’m going to work on seeing playfulness in the world and practicing ways to embody the type of consciousness that might bring more of it in. I have a new friend, we’ll just say my Snake Medicine Show buddy who has been practicing this art for many years in a quest to move into right relationship and, well maybe vanquish is too strong a word, but at least neutralize what she calls the McKracken consciousness. She’s the kind of fun friend you want to have around to riff off of one another. I’m fortunate to have a small group of people in my life who despite my oddities manage to vibe with far-out concepts that stretch well beyond not only the norm, but a lot of the alternative modes of thinking. We are learning, together.</p>
<p>So for tomorrow I will concentrate on being grateful. Indigenous worldviews center gratitude. In spite of all of the disruptions to my year, I still have many blessings. Those who read my blog and watch my long videos, I count you among them. Thank you. Below is the stream we ran last night. It is the first in what will probably be an ongoing series about our trip from Colorado to Arkansas and back. My relocation plans are centered around Hot Springs now, so if you are in the area or have insight, do send them my way. I will include a map I made that weaves together photos from the trip and historical materials.

Underneath I’m sharing a write up I did of insights gifted to me by my Snake Medicine Show friend. I love new tools for my toolbox. Maybe you will find it helpful on your journey.</p>
<p>Much love to you all; we are a wonderous work in progress, each and every one.</p>

<p>My summary of insights from Snake Medicine Show who gifted me with a guest post last December. You can read her lively linguistic offering, Emotional Emancipation – A Prayer of Proclamation, <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/12/13/labyrinthian-reflections-healing-verses-from-moab-utah/">here</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve been conditioned to perceive the world from a perspective that prioritizes matter. Such a view reduces our lived experience to leaderboards where our value is measured by the things we acquire objects, stuff, credentials, prestige. And yet an open invitation has been extended. We can try on different lens. What if we shift our worldview to center the dynamic potential of energy in motion. Rather than getting entangled by inconsequential nodes popping up here and there within the universe’s vast current, we can join as partners in a cosmic dance of fluid motion and unlimited possibility.</p>
<p>As authentic beings, grounded in truth, attuned to nature and the wonders of cosmic creation, we have the opportunity to dip into that current and reflect imaginative constructs into our shared reality. We are prisms of abundance.</p>
<p>The sea of shared consciousness is mutable, playful, and emergent. We can invite ideas into this dimension. However, once we do so, we have the responsibility to nurture them by giving them focused attention. Through creative partnerships, we can bring more energy to the process than we can acting on our own. As dancers in the current we hold space together, wombs to sustain modes of being beyond our conditioned expectations. We can choose to be patient and await what unfolds.</p>
<p>With proper tuning we will encounter guidance, grace, that directs us towards actions furthering a larger purpose. We many not even be fully aware of what that purpose is. As playful co-creators we should have faith and hold space for circuits to connect, activating the generative feedback that can begin to heal zero-sum consciousness. Mingle our unique bioenergetic frequencies with the understanding that resonant harmonies will guide sacred signals to the right receptor(s). It doesn’t take much to activate healing, just the right amount.</p>
<p>Show up with right relationship and the current will meet us there. We don’t need to know the right time or place; we just need to embody the right tune.</p>

<p>It was really nice of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethgarber/">Elizabeth Garber</a> to acknowledge me in the whitepaper that she co-authored with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-haine/">Mark Haine</a> titled “<a href="https://openid.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Human-Centric_Digital_Identity_Final-v1.1.pdf">Human-Centric Digital Identity: for Government Officials</a>”. I recommend everyone read it, even if you aren’t in government, as it is a very strong and considerate effort to try and tackle a broad, complicated, but important topic. It reminded me that I was overdue to publish the talk I gave at <a href="https://identiverse.com/idv23/session/1361547/">Identiverse 2023</a>, since it was her being in the audience that led us to have some nice conversations about our shared viewpoint on how Value-Sensitive Design and Human-Centric Design are key cogs in building ethical and inclusive digital identity systems. So, below is a re-recording of my talk, “Collision Course: Ethics vs Human-Centered Design in the New Perimeter”.</p>



 

 



<p>This talk was a challenging one for me to put together, because the subject matter is something I’ve been struggling to come to grips with. With digital identity becoming a critical component of a more digital-centric world, it seems clear that success and sustainability hinges on placing people and their societal values at the center of the architecture. But in doing so as part of my day-to-day work, I sometimes find the principles of human-centered design, inclusion, privacy-by-design, and ethics coming into conflict with each other. How are we, as identity practitioners, supposed to resolve these conflicts, navigating the challenge of building for the world that people actually live in, and not the one we wished they lived in? I increasingly found that there was no blueprint, no guide, already existing that I could tap into.</p>



<p>Well, I’ve often found that nothing brings things into better focus than being forced to develop a talk around it, so that’s what I set out to do. Can’t say I have the answers, but I did try to lay out some approaches and ideas that I found helpful when faced with these questions in the global projects I’m involved in. As always, I would love to hear people’s thoughts and experiences as they relate to this topic.</p>

<p>This article shows how an ASP.NET Core application can be authenticated using OpenID Connect and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9126">OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR) RFC 9126</a>. The OpenID Connect server is implemented using Duende IdentityServer. The Razor Page ASP.NET Core application authenticates using an OpenID Connect confidential client with PKCE and using the OAuth PAR extension.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/oidc-par-aspnetcore-duende">https://github.com/damienbod/oidc-par-aspnetcore-duende</a></p>



<p>Note: The code in this example was created using the Duende example found here: <a href="https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer">https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer</a></p>







<p></p>



<p>By using Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR), the authentication flow security is improved. In ASP.NET Core using PAR, the application is authenticated on the trusted backchannel before sending any authentication request. The parameters are no longer sent in the URL reducing the risk by not sharing the parameters or prevent parameter pollution with redirect_uri injection. No parameters are shared in the front channel.  The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework: JWT-Secured Authorization Request (JAR) <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9101/">RFC 9101</a> can also be used together with this to further improve the authentication security.</p>



 Overview 



<p>The OAuth PAR extension adds an extra step to the two step OpenID Connect client authentication code flow. OAuth Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR) extended flow has three steps:</p>



 
 Client sends a HTTP request in the back channel with the authorization parameters and the client is authenticated first. The body of the request has the OpenID Connect code flow parameters. The server responds with the request_uri. 



 The client uses the request_uri from the first step and authenticates. The server uses the flow parameters from the first request. As code flow with PKCE is used, the code is returned in the front channel. 



 The client completes the authentication using the code flow in the back channel, standard OpenID Connect code flow with PKCE. 
 



 Duende IdentityServer setup 



<p>I used Duende IdentityServer to implement the standard. Any OpenID Connect server which supports the OAuth PAR standard can be used. It is very simple to support this using Duende IdentityServer. The RequirePushedAuthorization is set to true and PAR is active for this client. The rest of the client configuration is a standard OIDC confidential client using code flow with PKCE.</p>


  new Client[]
{
  new Client
  {
	ClientId = "web-par",
	ClientSecrets = 
	{ 
		new Secret("--your-secret--".Sha256()) 
	},

	RequirePushedAuthorization = true,

	AllowedGrantTypes = GrantTypes.CodeAndClientCredentials,

	RedirectUris = 
	{ 
		"https://localhost:5007/signin-oidc" 
	},
	FrontChannelLogoutUri = 
		"https://localhost:5007/signout-oidc",
	PostLogoutRedirectUris = 
	{ 
		"https://localhost:5007/signout-callback-oidc" 
	},

	AllowOfflineAccess = true,
	AllowedScopes = { "openid", "profile" }
  }
};
  


<p></p>



 ASP.NET Core OpenID Connect client 



<p>The ASP.NET Core client requests extra changes. An extra back channel PAR request is sent in the OpenID Connect events. The OIDC events needs to be changed compared to the standard core OIDC setup. I used the Duende.AccessTokenManagement.OpenIdConnect nuget package to implement this and updated the OIDC events using the ParOidcEvents class from the Duende examples. The setup uses the PAR events in the AddOpenIdConnect configuration which requires a HttpClient and the IDiscoveryCache interface from Duende.</p>


  services.AddTransient&lt;ParOidcEvents&gt;();

// Duende.AccessTokenManagement.OpenIdConnect nuget package
services.AddSingleton&lt;IDiscoveryCache&gt;(_ =&gt; 
    new DiscoveryCache(configuration["OidcDuende:Authority"]!));

services.AddHttpClient();

services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
{
    options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddCookie(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options =&gt;
{
    options.ExpireTimeSpan = TimeSpan.FromHours(8);
    options.SlidingExpiration = false;
    options.Events.OnSigningOut = async e =&gt;
    {
        // automatically revoke refresh token at signout time
        await e.HttpContext.RevokeRefreshTokenAsync();
    };
})
.AddOpenIdConnect(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options =&gt;
{
    options.Authority = configuration["OidcDuende:Authority"];
    options.ClientId = configuration["OidcDuende:ClientId"];
    options.ClientSecret = configuration["OidcDuende:ClientSecret"];
    options.ResponseType = "code";
    options.ResponseMode = "query";
    options.UsePkce = true;

    options.Scope.Clear();
    options.Scope.Add("openid");
    options.Scope.Add("profile");
    options.Scope.Add("offline_access");

 Notes 



<p>It is simple to use PAR and the it adds an improved authentication security with one extra request in the authentication flow. This should be used if possible. The standard can be used together with the OAuth JAR standard and even extended with the OAuth RAR. </p>

<p>Towards the end of 2019, I was invited to deliver a keynote at the OpenID Foundation Summit in Japan. At a very personal level, the January 2020 Summit was an opportunity to spend time with dear friends from around the world. It would be the last time I saw Kim Cameron in person. It would include a dinner with the late Vittorio Bertocci. And it was my last “big” trip before the COVID lock down.</p>



<p>At the Summit, I was asked to talk about the “<a href="https://www.tuesdaynight.org/2020/11/24/the-future-of-digital-identity-2020-2030/">Future of Identity</a>.” It was a bit of a daunting topic since I am no real futurist and haven’t been an industry analyst for a long time. So I set about writing what I thought the next 10 years would look like from the view of a practitioner. You can read what I wrote as well as see a version of me presenting this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A concept I put forward in that talk was one of “counselors”: software agents that act on one’s behalf to make introductions of the individual to a service and vice versa, perform recognition of these services and associated credentials, and prevent or at least inhibit risky behavior, such as dodgy data sharing. I provide an overview of these concepts in my&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/4ZPvWC4Kcbw?t=1217">Future of Identity talk at approximately minute 20</a>.</p>



 Why even talk about counselors 



<p>That’s a reasonable question. I have noticed that there is a tendency in the digital identity space (and I am sure in others too) to marvel at problems. Too many pages spent talking about how something is a fantastically hard problem to solve and why we must do so… with scant pages of follow up on&nbsp;how&nbsp;we do so. Additionally, there’s another tendency to marvel at very technical products and services that “solve the problem.” Except they don’t. They solve a part of the problem or they are one of many tools needed to solve the problem. The challenges of digital identity management are legion and they manifest themselves in different ways to different industry sectors in different geographies. One can argue that while we have used magnificent tools to solve account management problems, we really haven’t begun to solve identity management ones. Counselors are a way to both humanize online interactions and make meaningful (as in meaningful and valuable to the individual) progress on solving the challenges of digital identity management.</p>







 Counselors in the Modern Era 



<p>Sitting through the sessions at&nbsp;<a href="https://authenticatecon.com/event/authenticate-2023/">Authenticate 2023</a>, and being surrounded by a ton of super smart people, I realized that the tools to make counselors real are very much within our grasp. Among these tools, 4 are the keys to success:</p>



 
 Interface layer powered by generative AI and LLMs 



 Bilateral recognition tokens powered by passkeys 



 Potentially verifiable data powered by Verified Credentials 



 Safe browsing hints 
 



 Interface layer powered by generative AI and LLMs 



<p>At their core, counselors are active clients that run on a person’s device. Today we can think of these akin to personal digital assistants, password managers, and digital wallets. What is missing is a user interface layer that is more than a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Ruxpin">Teddy Ruxpin</a>&nbsp;clone that only knows a few key phrases and actions accompanied by zero contextual awareness. What is needed is a meaningful conversational interface that is contextually aware. Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) are showing promise that they can power that layer. And these models are now running on form factors that could easily be mobile, wearable, and eventually implantable. This would enable the counselor to understand requests such as “Find me the best price for 2 premium economy seats to Tokyo for these dates in January” and “know” that I’ll be flying out of D.C. and am a Star Alliance flier.&nbsp;</p>



 Recognition tokens powered by passkeys 



<p>We have got to get out of the authentication business. It fails dramatically and spectacularly and seemingly on a daily basis. We have to move to the business of enabling service providers and consumers to recognise each other. Both the original talk and my more recent&nbsp;<a href="https://weaveidentity.com/blog/2023/07/19/ceremonies/">Ceremonies</a>&nbsp;talk speak to this need. A crucial puzzle piece for recognition is the use of cryptography. Right now the easiest way a normal human being can use cryptography to “prove” who they are is WebAuthn and, more generally,&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>. Armed with passkeys, a counselor can ensure that a service recognizes the person and that the counselor recognizes the service. To be clear, today, passkeys and the ceremonies and experiences surrounding them are in the early stages of&nbsp; global adoption… but it is amazing to see the progress that happened in the prior year and it bodes well for the future.</p>



<p>One thing to note is that passkeys as they work today provide a form of cryptographic proof that the thing interacting with a service is the same one you saw the day before, and notional there is the same human associated with the thing. There is no real reason why, in theory, this couldn’t be flipped around such that the service has to provide a form of cryptographic proof that the service is the same one with which the thing interacted the day before. A counselor could broker these kinds of flows to ensure that the service recognizes the person that the counselor is working on behalf of and the counselor can recognize the service.</p>



 Potentially verifiable data powered by verifiable credentials 



<p>One thing a counselor needs to do is to share data, on behalf of the individual, with a service. This data could be credit card information, home address, passport number, etc. Some of the data they would need to share are pieces of information about the individual from 3rd party authorities such as a local department of motor vehicles or employer. Ideally, the service would like a means to verify such information, and the individual, in some cases, would like the issuer of the information not to know where the information is shared. Here verified credentials (VCs) could play a role. Additionally, the service may want information about an individual that the individual provides and acts as the authority/issuer. Here too verified credentials could play a role. Standardized request and presentation patterns and technologies are crucially important and my hope is the VCs will provide them.</p>



<p>So why include the word “potentially” in the title of this section? There are many scenarios in which the service neither needs nor cares to&nbsp; verify information provided by the individual. Said differently, not every use case is a high assurance use case (nor should it be) and not every use case is rooted in a regulated sector. Hopefully VCs will provide a standardized (or at least standardizable) means for data presentation that can span both use cases that require verification and those that do not. If not, we’ll always have&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/0NFanER0g8w?t=322">CSV</a>.</p>



 Safe interaction hints 



<p>While one’s street sense might warn you that walking down that dark alley or getting money from that shifty looking ATM isn’t a good idea, an online version of that same street sense isn’t as easily cultivated. Here we need to turn to outside sources. Signals such as suspect certificates, questionable privacy policies, and known malware drop sites can all be combined to inform the individual everything from “This isn’t the site you actually are looking for” to “I suggest you do not sign up on this service… here are 3 alternatives” to “I’ll generate a one-time credit card number for you here.” One can imagine multiple sources for such hints and services. From browser makers to government entities to privacy-oriented product companies and well beyond. This is where real differentiation and competition can and should occur. And this is where counselors move from being reasonably inert cold storage layers for secrets and data to real valuable tools for an online world.</p>



 The missing something: privacy&nbsp; 



<p>At this point, I felt like I had identified the critical ingredients for a counselor: interface layer, recognition tokens, potentially verifiable data, and safe browsing hints… and then I mentioned this to Nat Sakimura. Nat has a way of appearing at the critical moment, say 10 words, and disrupt your way of thinking. I joke that he’s from the future here to tell us what not to do in order to avoid catastrophe. And I have been lucky and privileged enough to have Nat appear from time to time.</p>



<p>This time he appeared to tell me that the four things I had identified were insufficient. There was something missing. Having safe browsing hints is not enough… what is missing are clear, processable and actionable statements about privacy and data use. A counselor can “read” these statements from a site or service, interpret them into something understandable for the individual, better informing them on how the service will behave, or at least how it ought to behave. Couple this with things like consent receipts, which the counselor can manage, and the individual has records of what the service provider said they would do and to what the individual agreed to. There is an opportunity here for counselors to focus the individual’s attention on what is material for the individual and learn their preferences, such as knowing the individual will not accept tracking cookies.</p>



 From where will these counselors come 



<p>One can easily imagine a variety of sources of counselors. The mobile operating system vendors are best-placed to extend their existing so-called smart assistants to become counselors by leveraging their existing abilities to manage passwords, passkeys, debit and credit cards, and along with other forms of credentials. 3rd parties also could build counselors much like we see with digital assistants, password managers, and digital wallets. I expect that there is a marketplace for services, especially safe browsing hints. Here, organizations from government entities to civil society organizations to privacy-oriented product companies could build modules, for lack of a better word, that would be leveraged by the counselor to enhance its value to the individual.</p>



<p>Regardless of where counselors originate, observability and auditability is key. An individual needs a means to examine the actions the automated counselor took and the reasons for the actions. They need a way to revoke past data sharing decisions and consents granted. And they need a means to “fire” their counselor and switch to a new one whilst retaining access, control, and history.</p>



 In conclusion 



<p>We, as an industry, have been working on identity management for quite some time. But, from some perspectives, we haven’t made progress. Pam Dingle once said something to me to the effect of, “We’ve built a lot of tools but we haven’t solved the problems. We are just at the point where we have the tools we need to do so.” We have solved many of the problems of user account management, but we have yet to solve the problems of identity management to the same extent. The magical future where I can put the supercomputer on my wrist to work in a way that delivers real value and not just interesting insights and alerts feels both disappointingly far away yet tantalizingly within our grasp. I believe that counselors are what is needed to extend our reach to that magical, and very achievable, future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To do this I believe there are five things required:</p>



 
 Ubiquitous devices, available to all regardless of geography and socio economic condition, in all manner of form factors, which can run privacy-preserving LLMs and thus the interface layer for counselors 



 Maturation of passkey patterns including recovery use cases such that the era of shared secrets can be enshrined in history 



 Standardization of request and presentation processes of potentially verifiable data, along with standardized data structures 



 Trustable sources of safe interaction signals with known rules and standardized data formats 



 Machine-readable and interpretable privacy and data use notices coupled with consent receipts 
 



<p>The tools we need to unlock the magical future are real… or certainly real enough for proof of concept purposes. Combining those five ingredients makes the magical future and much more magical present… and this is the present in which I want to be.</p>

<p>It is a testament to his enduring spirit that we all continue to find ways to cope with the absence of Vittorio from our identity community and from our lives. On the day that I learnt of the news, I poured out my immediate feelings <a href="https://blog.talkingidentity.com/2023/10/and-just-like-that-hes-gone.html">in words</a>. But as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/iglazer/">Ian</a> put it so eloquently (like only he can), we continued to look for ways to operationalize our sadness. In his case, he and Allan Foster set out to honor Vittorio’s legacy by setting up <a href="https://digitalidadvancement.org/awards-and-grants/vittorio/">the Vittorio Bertocci Award</a> under the auspices of <a href="https://digitalidadvancement.org/">the Digital Identity Advancement Foundation</a>, which hopefully will succeed in becoming a lasting tribute to the intellect and compassion that Vittorio shared with the identity community. My personal attempt was to try and remember the (often twisted yet somehow endearingly innocent) sense of humor that Vittorio imbued into our personal interactions. And so, prodded by the inquiries from many about the fun (and funny) t-shirt I had designed just to get a good laugh from him at Identiverse, I created <a href="https://www.customink.com/fundraising/in-memory-of-vittorio-our-identity-fabio">a fundraiser</a> for the <a href="https://pancan.org/">Pancreatic Cancer Action Network</a> in his honor.</p>



 



<a href="https://7ee14c.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screen-Shot-2023-11-14-at-9.46.29-AM.png"></a>



 



<p>Thanks to all of you Vittorio stans and your incredible generosity, we raised $3,867.38 through t-shirt orders ($917.63) and donations ($2,949.75). I am obviously gratified by the support you gave my little attempt at operationalizing my sadness. But the bonus I wasn’t expecting was the messages people left on the fundraiser site – remembering Vittorio, what he meant to them, and in some cases how cancer affected their lives personally. In these troubling times, it was heartwarming to read these small signals of our shared humanity.</p>



<p>Thank you all once again. And love you Vittorio, always.</p>

<blockquote><p>
The join was failing because the two network_interfaces columns contained JSONB objects with differing shapes; Postgres’ JSONB containment operator, @&gt;, couldn’t match them. Since the JSONB objects are arrays, and since the desired match was a key/value pair common to both arrays, it made sense to explode the array and iterate through its elements looking to match that key/value pair.</p>
<p>Initial solutions from ChatGPT, Copilot Chat, and newcomer Unblocked implemented that strategy using various flavors of cross joins involving Postgres’ jsonb_array_elements function.

Blockchains are an implementation choice and there are other ways to solve the problem. That said, if you're looking to create a dApp with a smart contract, then Igor's article is a nice place to start.</p><p>Let's start with the goal and work backwards from there. The goal of a dApp is to give people control over their apps and the data in them. This is not how the internet works today. As I wrote in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/04/the_compuserve_of_things.shtml">The CompuServe of Things</a>, the web and mobile apps are almost exclusively built on a model of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml#administrative">intervening administrative authorities</a>. As the operators of hosted apps and controllers of the identity systems upon which they're founded,  the administrators can, for any reason whatsoever, revoke your rights to the application and any data it contains. Worse, most use your data for their own purposes, often in ways that are not in your best interest.</p><p>dApps, in contrast, give you control of the data and merely operate against it. Since they don't host the data, they can <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2023/11/cloudless_computing_at_the_edge.shtml">run locally, at the edge</a>. Using smart contracts on a blockchain is one way to do this, but there are others, including peer-to-peer networks and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). The point is, to achieve their goal, dApps need a way to store data that the application can reliably and securely reference, but that a person, rather than the app provider, controls. The core requirement for achieving control is that the data service be run by a provider who is not an intermediary and that the data model be <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/03/substitutability_is_an_indispensable_property_for_the_internet_of_things.shtml">substitutable</a>. Control requires meaningful choice among a group of interoperable providers who are substitutable and compete for the trust of their customers.</p><p>I started writing about this idea back in 2012 and called it <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/pcaa">Personal Cloud Application Architecture</a>. At the time the idea of personal clouds had a lot of traction and a number of supporters. We built a demonstration app called <a href="https://www.windley.com/liveweb/forever/forever.shtml">Forever</a> and later, I based the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2013/10/fuse_connecting_your_car_-_our_new_kickstarter_campaign.shtml">Fuse connected car application</a> on this idea: let people control and use the data from their cars without an intermediary. Fuse's technical success showed the efficacy of the idea at scale. Fuse had a mobile app and felt like any other connected car application, but underneath the covers, the architecture gave control of the data to the car's owner. Dave Winer has also <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2015/01/nodestorage_and_the_personal_cloud_application_architecture.shtml">developed applications that use a substitutable backend storage based on Node</a>.</p><p>Regular readers will wonder how I made it this far without mentioning <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/07/the_most_inventive_thing_ive_done.shtml">picos</a>. Forever and Fuse were both based on picos. Picos are designed to be self-hosted or hosted by providers who are substitutable. I've got a couple of projects tee'd up for two groups of students this winter that will further extend the suitability for picos as backends for dApps:</p>  <p>Support for Hosting Picos—the root pico in any instance of the pico engine is the ancestor of all picos in that engine and thus has ultimate control over them. To date, we've used the ability to stand up a new engine and control access to it as the means of providing control for the owner. This project will allow a hosting provider to easily stand up new instance of the engine and its root pico. For this to be viable, we'll use the support for peer DIDs my students built into the engine last year to give owners a peer DID connection to their root pico on their instance of the engine and thus give them control over the root pico and all its decedents.</p>  <p>Support for Solid Pods—at IIW this past October, we had a few sessions on how picos could be linked to <a href="https://solidproject.org//users/get-a-pod">Solid pods</a>. This project will marry a pod to each pico that gets created and link their lifecycles. This, combined with their support for peer DIDs, makes the pico and its data movable between engines, supporting substitutability.</p>  <p>If I thought I had the bandwidth to support a third group, I'd have them work on building dApps and an App Store to run on top of this. Making that work has a few other fun technical challenges. We've done this before. As I said Forever and Fuse were both essentially dApps. <a href="https://manifold.picolabs.io/#/login">Manifold</a>, a re-creation of <a href="https://www.windley.com/liveweb/sqtag/">SquareTag</a> is a large dApp for the Internet of Things that supports dApplets (is that a thing?) for each thing you store in it. What makes it a dApp is that the data is all in picos that could be hosted anywhere...at least in theory. Making that less theoretical is the next big step. Bruce Conrad has some ideas around that he calls the <a href="https://picolab.github.io/PLAN/">Pico Labs Affiliate Network</a>.</p><p>I think the work of supporting dApps and personal control of our data is vitally important. As I wrote in 2014:</p><blockquote><p>On the Net today we face a choice between freedom and captivity, independence and dependence. How we build the Internet of Things has far-reaching consequences for the humans who will use—or be used by—it. Will we push forward, connecting things using forests of silos that are reminiscent the online services of the 1980’s, or will we learn the lessons of the Internet and build a true Internet of Things?</p><p>From <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/04/the_compuserve_of_things.shtml">The CompuServe of Things</a><br>Referenced 2023-11-12T17:15:48-0500</p></blockquote><p>The choice is ours. We can build the world we want to live in.</p>

<p>This article shows how to implement authentication in ASP.NET Core using multiple identity providers or secure token servers. When using multiple identity providers, the authentication flows need to be separated per scheme for the sign-in flow and the sign-out flow. The claims are different and would require mapping logic depending on the authorization logic of the application. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/MulitipleClientClaimsMapping">https://github.com/damienbod/MulitipleClientClaimsMapping</a></p>



<p></p>



 Setup 



<p>OpenID Connect is used for the authentication and the session is stored in a cookie. A confidential client using OpenID Connect code flow with PKCE is used for both schemes. The client configuration in the secure token servers need to match the ASP.NET Core configuration. The sign-in and the sign-out callback URLs are different for the different token servers. </p>







<p></p>



<p>The AddAuthentication method is used to define the authentication services. Cookies are used to store the session. The “t1” scheme is used to setup the Duende OpenID Connect client and the “t2” scheme is used to setup the OpenIddict scheme. The callback URLs are specified in this setup. </p>



<p></p>


  builder.Services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
{
    options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddCookie()
.AddOpenIdConnect("t1", options =&gt; // Duende IdentityServer 
{
    builder.Configuration.GetSection("IdentityServerSettings").Bind(options);
    options.SignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.ResponseType = OpenIdConnectResponseType.Code;
    options.SaveTokens = true;
    options.GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint = true;
    options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
    {
        NameClaimType = "name"
    };
    options.MapInboundClaims = false;
})
.AddOpenIdConnect("t2", options =&gt; // OpenIddict server 
{
    builder.Configuration.GetSection("IdentityProviderSettings").Bind(options);
    options.SignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.ResponseType = OpenIdConnectResponseType.Code;
    options.SaveTokens = true;
    options.GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint = true;
    options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
    {
        NameClaimType = "name"
    };
});
  


<p></p>



<p>The configurations which are different per environment are read from the configuration object. The source of the data can be the appsettings.json, Azure Key Vault, user secrets or whatever you use.</p>


  "IdentityProviderSettings": { // OpenIddict
	"Authority": "https://localhost:44318",
	"ClientId": "codeflowpkceclient",
	"ClientSecret": "--your-secret-from-keyvault-or-user-secrets--",
	"CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc-t2",
	"SignedOutCallbackPath": "/signout-callback-oidc-t2"
},
"IdentityServerSettings": { // Duende IdentityServer
	"Authority": "https://localhost:44319",
	"ClientId": "oidc-pkce-confidential",
	"ClientSecret": "--your-secret-from-keyvault-or-user-secrets--",
	"CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc-t1",
	"SignedOutCallbackPath": "/signout-callback-oidc-t1"
}
  


<p></p>



 Sign-in 



<p>The application and the user can authenticate using different identity providers. The scheme is setup when starting to authentication flow so that the application knows which secure token server should be used. I added two separate controller endpoints for this. The Challenge request is then sent correctly.</p>


  [HttpGet("LoginOpenIddict")]
public ActionResult LoginOpenIddict(string returnUrl)
{
	return Challenge(new AuthenticationProperties
	{
		RedirectUri = !string.IsNullOrEmpty(returnUrl) ? returnUrl : "/", 
	}, "t2");
}

[HttpGet("LoginIdentityServer")]
public ActionResult LoginIdentityServer(string returnUrl)
{
	return Challenge(new AuthenticationProperties
	{
		RedirectUri = !string.IsNullOrEmpty(returnUrl) ? returnUrl : "/"
	}, "t1");
}
  


<p></p>



<p>The UI part of the application calls the correct endpoint. This is just a HTTP link which sends a GET request.</p>


  &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
    &lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" 
       href="~/api/Account/LoginIdentityServer"&gt;Login t1 IdentityServer&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
    &lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" 
       href="~/api/Account/LoginOpenIddict"&gt;Login t2 OpenIddict&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  


<p></p>



 Sign-out 



<p>The application also needs to sign-out correctly. A sign-out is sent to the secure token server and not only locally in the application. To sign out correctly, the application must use the correct scheme. This can be found using the HttpContext features. Once the scheme is known, the sign-out request can be sent to the correct secure token server.</p>


  [Authorize]
public class LogoutModel : PageModel
{
    public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnGetAsync()
    {
        if (User.Identity!.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            var authProperties = HttpContext.Features
               .GetRequiredFeature&lt;IAuthenticateResultFeature&gt;();

            var schemeToLogout = authProperties.AuthenticateResult!.Ticket!
               .Properties.Items[".AuthScheme"];

            if (schemeToLogout != null)
            {
                return SignOut(new AuthenticationProperties
                {
                    RedirectUri = "/SignedOut"
                },
                CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
                schemeToLogout);
            }
        }

        await HttpContext.SignOutAsync(
          CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);

        return Redirect("/SignedOut");
    }
}
  


 Notes 



<p>Setting up multiple secure token servers or identity providers for a single ASP.NET Core application is relatively simple using the standard ASP.NET Core endpoints. Once you start using the different identity provider authentication Nuget client packages from the specific libraries, it gets complicated as the client libraries overwrite different default values which breaks the other client flows. Using multiple identity providers, it is probably better to not use the client libraries and stick to the standard OpenID Connect implementation. </p>

Photo credit: Brian Campbell from this <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/blog/post/vittorio-bertocci-identity-community-contributions.html">article</a> on the Ping Identity&nbsp;blog<p>Vittorio Bertocci, much like many others in the identity space, had an important impact on my professional life. You can imagine how I felt when, a month following his tragic passing, I saw another <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/our-take-on-verifiable-credentials/">blog post</a> produced by the <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/g-o-a-t/">GOAT</a> of creating understandable technical content about identity. Further, the subject of the post is my deepest area of knowledge: verifiable credential adoption (which was the topic of conversation for almost all my time spent with Vittorio).</p><p>Vittorio’s sage perspective on verifiable credentials is important for the IDtech community to understand. In this post, I want to outline how Vittorio influenced our direction at Trinsic and highlight a few important points from the recent&nbsp;post.</p><p>In 2017 I was a fresh face in the identity industry, pumped full of slogans and claims from the infinitely optimistic self-sovereign identity (SSI) evangelists who I surrounded myself with at the time. Having only seen one perspective, I fully believed that consumers could “own” their identity, that “data breaches would be a thing of the past”, and that verifiable credentials would usher in a new era of privacy maximalism.</p><p>The world needs idealists — but it also needs pragmatists. Vittorio became an archetype of the pragmatic energy that eventually worked its way into the culture and products at the company I cofounded in 2019, <a href="https://trinsic.id/">Trinsic</a>. His directed questions and healthy skepticism of marvelous SSI claims came not from a Luddite spirit, but from deep experience. In a <a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/2022/01/11/remembering-kim-cameron/">blog post</a> about his involvement in the CardSpace project at Microsoft, he said, “When the user centric identity effort substantially failed to gain traction in actual products, with the identity industry incorporating some important innovations (hello, claims) but generally rejecting many of the key tenets I held so dear, something broke inside me. I became disillusioned with pure principled views, and moved toward a stricter Job to be done, user cases driven&nbsp;stance.”</p><p>For the last four years as a reusable identity infrastructure company, our developer tools for integrating verifiable credentials, identity wallets, and policy/governance tools have become quite popular. Thousands of developers have created dozens of applications that have acquired hundreds of thousands of end-users and issued close to a million credentials in production. This experience has given us a unique vantage point on patterns and methods for successfully deploying verifiable credentials in production. We’ve also spoken to many of these customers and other partners on our <a href="https://trinsic.id/podcast">podcast</a> and in private to understand these patterns more&nbsp;deeply.</p><p>I state all of this so that I can say the following with some credibility: Vitorrio’s perspectives (and by extension Auth0’s) are a must-read for anyone working on user-centric identity. I’ll double click on a few of what I view to be the most important points&nbsp;below.</p><blockquote>What do we need to do to make a classic OpenID Connect flow behave more like the drivers license for buying wine scenario in offline&nbsp;life?</blockquote><blockquote>The two main discrepancies we identified were: Ability to use the token with multiple RPs and Ability to transact with an RP without IdP knowing anything about time and parties involved in the transaction</blockquote><p>The first point I want to highlight is that Vittorio introduces verifiable credentials (VCs) by relating them to something his audience is familiar with — OIDC. This is not only a helpful practice for pitching products in general, but it embeds an important point for IDtech people: VCs are not a fundamental transformation of identity. VCs are an incremental improvement on previous generations of identity technology. (But one that I believe can enable exponentially better product experiences when done&nbsp;right.)</p><p>VCs will be adopted when they are applied to use cases that existing solutions fail to accommodate. It’s key for VC-powered products to demonstrate how VCs enable a problem to be solved in a new way — otherwise, buyers will opt for the safer federated solutions over&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>A classic example to illustrate my point is “passwordless login”. I’ve been hearing about it for 6 years, and yet never actually seen verifiable credentials be adopted for passwordless authentication. I believe the reason for this is that the two points above (ability to use the token with multiple RPs, IdP not knowing about the transaction) aren’t important enough for this use case, and that other, lighter-weight solutions can do it&nbsp;better.</p><blockquote>We might say that there are too many cooks in the kitchen… I dare say this space is overspecified… A lot of work will need to happen in the marketplace, as production implementations with working use cases feel the pain points from these specs and run into a few walls for some of VCs to fully come to&nbsp;life.</blockquote><p>Vittorio taught me about the history of OAuth, OpenID, OAuth2, and OpenID Connect. I learned about early, nonstandard iterations of “login with” buttons that had millions of active users. I learned about the market forces that led these divergent applications to eventually standardize.</p><p>Standardization is essential for adoption. But adoption is essential for knowing what to standardize (there’s nothing worse than standardizing the wrong thing)! Prematurely standardizing before adoption is a classic “cart before the horse” scenario. My conversations with Vittorio led me to write <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/the-catch-22-of-interoperability-fea4dc5ef582">this catch-22 of interoperability post</a>.</p><p>IDtech builders need to focus on building a good, adoptable product first. Then make it interoperable/compatible with other products second. This is a key design principle baked into Trinsic’s platform (e.g. whatever you build will inherit interoperability when it’s needed, but you won’t waste time figuring it out in the meantime).</p><blockquote>[A misconception:] Centralized DBs will disappear… and in turn this would prevent some of the massive data leaks that we have seen in <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites">recent history</a>. It’s unclear how that would&nbsp;work.</blockquote><p>Vittorio correctly identified this as a misconception. Centralized databases indeed won’t disappear anytime soon. The notion that companies “won’t need to hold my data”, if it ever happens, will be far in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>The near-term disruption that will happen, however, is something I pointed out in a <a href="https://x.com/rileyphughes/status/1663745376372023298?s=20">conversation</a> with Vittorio that started on Twitter and moved offline. Service providers who don’t originate data themselves, but aggregate or intermediate between parties in a transaction, are at risk of disruption from verifiable credentials.</p><p>The example I use in the post linked above is <a href="https://theworknumber.com/">Work Number</a>. Employers give Work Number information about their employees to avoid fielding background screening calls. If employers gave that information directly to employees in a verifiable credential, however, Work Number’s role would need to change dramatically. Because of this threat, identity verification, student attestations, background screening, and other of these kinds of companies are among the first to adopt verifiable credentials.</p><blockquote>Unless users decide to not present more data than necessary for particular operations, it is possible that they will end up disclosing more/all credential data just for usability sake.</blockquote><p>This dynamic is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox">Jevons paradox</a> applied to identity — VCs counterintuitively risk creating worse privacy conditions, even with things like data minimization, because of the frequency of use. Nobody has a crystal ball, so it’s impossible to know whether this risk will materialize. Governance is the best tool at our disposal to reduce this risk and enable better privacy for people. I talk about this a fair bit in <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/ssi-adoption-what-will-it-take-riley-hughes-webinar-67/">this webinar</a> and plan to write a blog post about it in the&nbsp;future.</p><blockquote>Users will typically already have credentials in their wallets and verifiers will simply need to verify them, in a (mostly) stateless fashion… However, we do have a multi-parties cold start problem. To have viable VCs we need effective, dependable and ubiquitous wallets. To have good wallets, we need relying parties implementing flows that require them, and creating real, concrete requirements for actual use. To incentivize RPs to implement and explore new flows, we need high value, ubiquitous credentials that make good business sense to leverage. But to get natural IdPs to create the infrastructure to issue such credentials, you need all of the above… plus a business&nbsp;case.</blockquote><p>The chicken-and-egg problem (or, “cold start” problem) is a trick for almost all IDtech products. While there will always be exceptions to the rule, I have seen enough failure and success to feel confident in a somewhat concrete recipe for overcoming this obstacle.</p>  Remove the wallet as a dependency. If a user needs to be redirected to an app store, download an app, step through onboarding steps, see an empty app, go scan QR codes to get credentials, all before it can actually be used… it’s extremely unlikely to be adopted. Instead, give users invisible “wallets” for their credentials. This is the #1 unlock that led to several of Trinsic’s customers scaling to hundreds of thousands of&nbsp;users.  If your entity can play the role of issuer (or IdP) then you’re in a great position. If you’re not, obtain your own data so that you can be. Dig in with one or more companies and partner closely to build something very specific first with existing&nbsp;data.  Sell to use cases that aren’t well-served by existing OIDC or similar technologies. Expand the markets you’re selling to by going into the long tail. Focus on either low-frequency, high-value use cases or high-frequency, low-value applications. Make it easy to integrate.  <p>Shamefully, it took me 5 years of pattern matching to land at the conclusions that Vittorio and others saw much sooner. These are the same points that led to adoption of OAuth/OIDC. And frankly, when you look at it, are pretty&nbsp;obvious.</p><blockquote>The main one is being able to disclose our identity/claims without issuers knowing. It is a civil liberty; it is a right. As more of our life moves online, we should be able to express our identity like we do it&nbsp;offline.</blockquote><p>Privacy is an important point. This requirement, in particular, is a requirement for most governments to be involved. It’s also a biggie for any sensitive/”vice” industry (gambling, adult content, controlled substances, etc.) which historically is a driver of new technology due to having broad appeal and high frequency.</p><blockquote>Once [the adoption flywheel] happens, it will likely happen all of a sudden… which is why it is really a good idea to stay up-to-date and experiment with VCs&nbsp;TODAY</blockquote><p>This “slow… then all at once” dynamic is a critical insight, and very true. We’ve seen this over the last year in the identity verification segment. My first conversations with identity verification companies were at Sovrin in 2018. Despite consistently following along, there was no movement from anybody for years. Suddenly, after <a href="https://onfido.com/press-release/onfido-acquires-airside/">Onfido acquired Airside</a> in May, <a href="https://plaid.com/blog/one-click-verification-plaid-idv/">Plaid</a>, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/persona-introduces-industry-first-reusable-identity-solution-with-dynamic-risk-signals-301964490.html">Persona</a>, <a href="https://www.axios.com/pro/fintech-deals/2023/10/05/clear-acquires-sora-id">ClearMe</a>, <a href="https://www.instnt.org/ourpress/instnt-launches-multipass">Instnt</a>, <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/au10tix-id-document-biometric-verification-platform-and-reusable-id-solution-now-available-in-the-microsoft-azure-marketplace-1032758864?op=1">Au10tix</a>, and more have jumped into the fray with their own “Reusable ID” solutions.</p><p>Auth0 posits that governments will be the critical unlock for verifiable credentials. While I don’t think that’s wrong, we are seeing increased bottoms-up adoption from the private sector, both from <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/10/19/idtech-is-the-new-fintech/?sh=78c115cb3a88">IDtech</a> companies and verification providers of all kinds. Governments will play an important role, ideally anchoring wallets with high-assurance legal identity credentials and leading with standards that will produce to interoperable solutions.</p><p>If you haven’t already, I encourage you to read the whole <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/our-take-on-verifiable-credentials/">post</a>. I’m grateful for the Auth0 team for shipping the post after Vittorio’s passing, so the world can benefit from his knowledge.

<p>OpenID Federation draft 31 has been published at <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0-31.html">https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0-31.html</a> and <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html">https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html</a>.  It’s the result of concerted efforts to make the specification straightforward to read, understand, and implement for developers.  Many sections have been rewritten and simplified.  Some content has been reorganized to make its structure and relationships more approachable.  Many inconsistencies were addressed.</p>
<p>Some inconsistencies fixed resulted in a small number of breaking changes.  For instance, the name “<code>trust_mark_owners</code>” is now consistently used throughout, whereas an alternate spelling was formerly also used.  The editors tried to make all known such changes in this version, so hopefully this will be the last set of breaking changes.  We published draft 31 now in part to get these changes out to implementers.  See the history entries at <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0-31.html#name-document-history">https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0-31.html#name-document-history</a> for a detailed description of the changes made.</p>
<p>A comprehensive review of the specification is still ongoing.  Expect more improvements in the exposition in draft 32.  With any luck, -32 will be the basis of the next proposed Implementer’s Draft.</p>
<p>We’re definitely grateful for all the useful feedback we’re receiving from developers.  Developer feedback is gold!</p>

<p>Conversing with LLMs isn’t like either of these options, it’s something else entirely; and we’re all in the midst of figuring out how it can work. Asking an LLM to write code, and having it magically appear? That’s an obvious life-changer. Talking with an LLM about the code you’re partnering with it to write?

<p>This article shows how to use a strong nonce based CSP with Angular for scripts and styles. When using a nonce, the overall security can be increased and it is harder to do XSS attacks or other type of attacks in the web UI. A separate solution is required for development and production deployments.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/bff-aspnetcore-angular">https://github.com/damienbod/bff-aspnetcore-angular</a></p>



<p>When using Angular, the root of the UI usually starts from a HTML file. A meta tag with the CSP_NONCE placeholder was added as well as the ngCspNonce from Angular. The meta tag is used to add the nonce to the Angular provider or development npm packages. The ngCspNonce  is used for Angular, although this does not work without adding the nonce to the Angular provider.</p>


  &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;
    &lt;meta name="CSP_NONCE" content="**PLACEHOLDER_NONCE_SERVER**" /&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;ui&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;base href="/" /&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" /&gt;
    &lt;link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico" /&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;app-root ngCspNonce="**PLACEHOLDER_NONCE_SERVER**"&gt;&lt;/app-root&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
  


<p>The CSP_NONCE is added to the Angular providers. This is required, otherwise the nonce is not added to the Angular generated scripts. The nonce value is read from the meta tag header.</p>


  import { provideHttpClient, withInterceptors } from '@angular/common/http';
import { ApplicationConfig, CSP_NONCE } from '@angular/core';
import { secureApiInterceptor } from './secure-api.interceptor';

import {
  provideRouter,
  withEnabledBlockingInitialNavigation,
} from '@angular/router';
import { appRoutes } from './app.routes';

const nonce = (
  document.querySelector('meta[name="CSP_NONCE"]') as HTMLMetaElement
)?.content;

export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideRouter(appRoutes, withEnabledBlockingInitialNavigation()),
    provideHttpClient(withInterceptors([secureApiInterceptor])),
    {
      provide: CSP_NONCE,
      useValue: nonce,
    },
  ],
};
  


 CSP in HTTP responses production 



<p>The UI now uses the nonce based CSP. The server can return all responses forcing this and increasing the security of the web application. It is important to use a nonce and not the self attribute as this overrides the nonce. You do not want to use self as this allows jsonp scripts. The unsafe-inline is used for backward compatibility. This is a good setup for production.</p>


  style-src 'unsafe-inline' 'nonce-your-random-nonce-string'; script-src 'unsafe-inline' 'nonce-your-random-nonce-string';
  


 CSP style in development 



<p>Unfortunately, it is not possible to apply the style nonce in development due to the Angular setup. I used self in development for styles. This works, but has problems as you only discover style errors after a deployment, not during feature development. The later you discover errors, the more expensive it is to fix it.</p>



 Replace the values in the index.html 



<p>Now that the Angular application can use the nonce correctly, it needs to be updated with every page refresh or GET. The nonce is generated in the server part of the web application and is added to the index html file on each response. It is applied to all scripts and styles.</p>

Clive is focusing on how the cassette tape unlocked creativity, but in doing so he describes its properties in a way that is helpful to discussions about online relationships in general.</p><p>Clive doesn't speak about cassette tapes being decentralized. In fact, I chuckle as I write that down. Instead he's focused on some core properties. Two I found the most interesting were that cassette tapes allowed one-to-one exchange of music and that they were permissionless. He says:</p><blockquote><p>If you wanted to record a cassette, you didn’t need anyone’s permission.</p><p>This was a quietly radical thing, back when cassette recorders first emerged. Many other forms of audio or moving-image media required a lot of capital infrastructure: If you wanted to broadcast a TV show, you needed a studio and broadcasting equipment; the same goes for a radio show or film, or producing and distributing an album. And your audience needed an entirely different set of technologies (televisions, radios, projectors, record players) to receive your messages.</p><p>From <a href="https://clivethompson.medium.com/the-empowering-style-of-cassette-tapes-e3a620590d42">The Empowering Style of Cassette Tapes</a><br>Referenced 2023-11-02T08:01:46-0400</p></blockquote><p>The thing that struck me on reading this was the idea that symmetric technology democratizes speech. The web is based on assymetric technology: client-server. In theory everyone can have a server, but they don't for a lot of reasons including cost, difficulty, and friction. Consequently, the web is dominated by a few large players who act as <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml#anemic">intervening administrative authorities</a>. They decide what happens online and who can participate. The web is not one-to-one and it is decidedly not permissionless.</p><p>In contrast, the DIDComm protocol is symmetric and so it <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">fosters one-to-one interactions</a> that provide <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">meaningful, life-like online relationships</a>. DIDComm supports <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml#autonomic">autonomic identity systems</a> that provide a foundation for one-to-one, permissionless interactons. Like the cassette tape, DIDComm is a democratizing technology.</p>   <p>Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/andreanna/4320423382">Mix Tape</a> from Andreanna Moya Photography (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 DEED</a>)</p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria!

<p>The new “<a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-rha-jose-hpke-encrypt-01.html">Use of Hybrid Public-Key Encryption (HPKE) with Javascript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE)</a>” specification has been published.  Its abstract is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This specification defines Hybrid public-key encryption (HPKE) for use with Javascript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE). HPKE offers a variant of public-key encryption of arbitrary-sized plaintexts for a recipient public key.</p>
<p>HPKE works for any combination of an asymmetric key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), key derivation function (KDF), and authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) function. Authentication for HPKE in JOSE is provided by JOSE-native security mechanisms or by one of the authenticated variants of HPKE.</p>
<p>This document defines the use of the HPKE with JOSE.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) is defined by <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9180.html">RFC 9180</a>.  There’s a whole new generation of specifications using it for encryption.  The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) Protocol [<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9420.html">RFC 9420</a>] uses it.  <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-tls-esni-17.html">TLS Encrypted Client Hello</a> uses it.  <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-cose-hpke-07.html">Use of Hybrid Public-Key Encryption (HPKE) with CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)</a> brings it to COSE.  And this specification brings it to JOSE.</p>
<p>One of our goals for the JOSE HPKE specification is to keep it closely aligned with the COSE HPKE specification.  That should be facilitated by having multiple authors in common, with Hannes Tschofenig and Orie Steele being authors of both, and me being a COSE co-chair.</p>
<p>Aritra Banerjee will be presenting the draft to the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/jose/about/">JOSE working group</a> at <a href="https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/118/">IETF 118 in Prague</a>.  I’m hoping to see many of you there!</p>

  <p>It <a href="https://herestomwiththeweather.com/2022/10/25/indieauth-login-history/">has been a year</a> since I have blogged about my IndieAuth server <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/irwin">Irwin</a>.  Prior to that, in <a href="https://herestomwiththeweather.com/2022/10/09/minimum-viable-indieauth-server/">Minimum Viable IndieAuth Server</a>, I explained my motivation for starting the project.  In the same spirit, I would like an activitypub server as simple to understand as possible.  I thought it might be interesting to add the activitypub and webfinger support to an IndieAuth server so I have created an experimental branch <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/irwin/tree/ap_wip">ap_wip</a>.  An important part of this development has been writing specs.  For example, <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/irwin/blob/ap_wip/spec/requests/accounts_spec.rb#L23">here are my specs</a> for handling the “<a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/spec/activitypub/#Move">Move</a>” command, an important Mastodon feature.</p>

<p>I still have about half a dozen items to do before I consider dogfooding this branch but hopefully I can do that soon.</p>

<p>The initial <a href="https://openid.net/connect">OpenID Connect</a> specifications became final on February 25, 2014.  While the working group is rightfully proud of the quality of the work and the widespread adoption it has attained, specification writing is a human endeavor and mistakes will inevitably be made.  That’s why the OpenID Foundation has a process for publishing Errata corrections to specifications.</p>
<p>Eight issues were identified and corrected that year, with the first set of errata corrections being published on November 8, 2014.  Since that time, suggestions for improvements have continued to trickle in, but with a 9+ year trickle, a total of 95 errata issues have been filed!  They range from the nearly trivial, such as an instance of <code>http</code> that should have been <code>https</code>, to the more consequential, such as language that could be interpreted in different ways.</p>
<p>I’m pleased to report that, with a substantial investment by <a href="https://openid.net/wg/connect/">the working group</a>, I’ve managed to work through all the 87 additional errata issues filed since the first errata set and incorporate corrections for them into published specification drafts.  They are currently undergoing <a href="https://openid.net/review-second-proposed-errata-openid-connect-specifications/">OpenID Foundation-wide review</a> in preparation for a vote to approve the second set of errata corrections.</p>
<p>As a bonus, the OpenID Foundation plans to submit the newly minted corrected drafts for publication by ISO as <a href="https://www.iso.org/deliverables-all.html#PAS">Publicly Available Specifications</a>.  This should foster even broader adoption of OpenID Connect by enabling deployments in some jurisdictions around the world that have legal requirements to use specifications from standards bodies recognized by international treaties, of which ISO is one.  Just in time for OpenID Connect’s <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2448">10th anniversary</a>!</p>

<p>I’m pleased to bring your attention to the upcoming <a href="https://www.openid.or.jp/summit/2024/en/">OpenID Summit Tokyo 2024</a>, which will be held on Friday, January 19, 2024.  Join us there for a stellar line-up of speakers and consequential conversations!</p>
<p></p>
<p>This builds on the successes of past summits organized by the <a href="https://www.openid.or.jp/">OpenID Foundation Japan</a>.  For instance, I found the <a href="https://www.openid.or.jp/summit/2020/en/">OpenID Summit Tokyo 2020</a> and associated activities and discussions both very useful and very enjoyable.</p>
<p>A special feature of the 2024 summit will be celebrating the 10th anniversary of the <a href="https://openid.net/connect">OpenID Connect</a> specifications, which were approved on February 25, 2014.  Speakers who were there for its creation, interop testing, and early deployments will share their experiences and lessons learned, including several key participants from Japan.  As I recounted at EIC 2023, <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2345">building ecosystems is hard</a>.  And yet we achieved that for OpenID Connect!  We are working to create new identity ecosystems as we speak.  I believe that the lessons learned from OpenID Connect are very applicable today.  Come join the conversation!</p>
<p>Finally, as a teaser, I’m also helping the OpenID Foundation to plan two additional 10th anniversary celebrations at prominent 2024 identity events – one in Europe and one in the Americas.  Watch this space for further news about these as it develops!</p>

Like the term <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2023/10/zero_data.shtml">zero data</a><a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2023/10/zero_data.shtml"> that I wrote about a few weeks ago</a>, cloudless computing is a great name that captures an idea that is profound.</p><p>Cloudless computing uses cryptographic identifiers, verifiable data, and location-independent compute1 to move apps to the data wherever it lives, to perform whatever computation needs to be done, at the edge. The genius of of the name cloudless computing is that it gets us out of the trenches of dapps, web3, blockchain, and other specific implementations and speaks to an idea or concept. The abstractions can make it difficult get a firm hold on the ideas, but it's important to getting past the how so we can speak to the what and why.</p><p>You be rightly skeptical that any of this can happen. Why will companies move from the proven cloud model to something else? In this talk, Peter Levine talks specifically to that question.</p>    <p>One of the core arguments for why more and more computing will move to the edge is the sheer size of modern computing problems. Consider one example: Tesla Full Self Driving (FSD). I happen to be a Tesla owner and I bought FSD. At first it was just because I am very curious about it and couldn't stand to not have first-hand experience with it. But now, I like it so much I use it all the time and can't imagine driving without an AI assist. But that's beside the point. To understand why that drives computing to the edge, consider that the round trip time to get an answer from the cloud is just too great. The car needs to make decisions onboard for this to work. Essentially, to put this in the cloudless perspective, the computation has to move to where the data from the sensors is. You move the compute to the data, not the other way around.2</p><p>And that's just one example. Levine makes the point, as <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2013/05/imagining_trillion_node_networks.shtml">I and others</a> have done, that the Internet of Things leads to trillions of nodes on the Internet. This is a difference in scale that has real impact on how we architect computer systems. While today's <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/07/alternatives_to_the_compuserve_of_things.shtml">CompuServe of Things</a> still relies largely on the cloud and centralized servers, that model can't last in a true Internet of Things.</p><p>The future world will be more decentralized than the current one. Not because of some grand ideal (although <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml#self-sovereign">those certainly exist</a>) but simply because the problems will force it to happen. We're using computers in more dynamic environments than the more static ones (like web applications) of the past. The data is too large to move and the required latency too low. Cloudless computing is the future.</p>    Notes   <p>Anderson calls this deterministic computer. He uses that name to describe computation that is consistent and predictable regardless of how the application gets to the data, but I'm not sure that's the core idea. Location independence feels better to me.</p>  <p>An interesting point is that training the AI that drives the car is still done in the cloud somewhere. But once the model is built, it operates close to the data. I think this will be true for a lot of AI models.</p>  <p>Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/santafeegret/3279695354">Cloudless Sunset</a> from Dorothy Finley (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY 2.0 DEED</a> - cropped)</p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria!

Pre-COVID, the structured and passed down wisdom focussed on developing the following skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Be Adaptable: In times of crisis, including war and conflict, the operating environment becomes highly volatile and uncertain. A leadership team must become more adaptable and flexible to respond to rapidly changing circumstances. Directors are trained to be more willing to recognise and pivot their strategies and make quick decisions, unlike stable times, where longer-term planning is often feasible.</p><p>Unity and Cohesion: A leadership team should act cohesively during a crisis and drop the niggles and power plays. Clear communication and collaboration among executives and directors are essential to ensure everyone is aligned and working towards a common goal. Unity is critical in times of uncertainty to maintain the organisation's stability and morale.</p><p>Decisiveness: Crisis demands decisiveness, with fewer facts and more noise, from its leaders. In the face of adversity, a leadership team should be ready to make tough choices promptly which will be very different to normal day-to-day thinking. Hesitation can be costly, and the consequences of indecision are amplified and become more severe during a crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>Resource Allocation: A crisis will strain resources, making efficient and effective allocation idealistic and not practical. A leadership team should reevaluate its resource allocation, prioritising the needs based on the best opinion today, which will mean compromise and sacrifice.&nbsp; It is about doing your best, as it will never be the most efficient, effective or right.&nbsp;</p><p>Risk Management: In times of crisis, certain risks are heightened. A leadership team must adjust its risk management strategy, potentially being more conservative and prudent to safeguard the people and the organisation's long-term viability.</p> This is a lovely twee list, they are obvious, highly relevant and important, but the reality is totally different. Leaders and directors quickly move past these ideals to the reality of crisis management.&nbsp;  The day-to-day stress and grind of crisis surface the unsaid, hostile and uncomfortable - all aspects we learned in COVID and include. <br><p>Consistency: Maintaining a level of consistency across the leadership’s behaviour, regardless of the personal view and external circumstances. Drastic changes in leadership style create additional confusion and anxiety, creating an additional dimension to the existing crisis.</p><p>Ethical Compass: The moral and ethical compass of a leadership team should not waver in times of crisis. Principles such as honesty, integrity, acceptance, and respect (for all views and opinions that are legal) should be upheld, as compromising on ethics can lead to long-term damage to the individual and organisation's reputation.&nbsp; Different opinions matter, as does the importance of ensuring they are aired and discussed openly, however hard and uncomfortable.&nbsp; We might not agree because of our own framing, but that does not mean we actually know what is true or false.&nbsp;</p><p>Strategic Focus: While adaptability is important, a leadership team should not lose sight of its agreed long-term strategic vision. Abrupt changes can disrupt the organisation's core mission and values. Strategies may need to be tweaked, but the overarching values and vision should remain consistent, even in the face of uncertainty.&nbsp; If it does not - then there is a massively different issue you are facing.</p><p>Transparency: Honesty and transparency are essential, particularly during times of crisis. A leadership team should communicate openly with themselves, employees and stakeholders, providing them with a clear understanding of the challenges and the strategies being employed to overcome them.&nbsp; Those prioritising themselves over the cause and survival need to be cut free.&nbsp;</p><p>Legal and Regulatory Compliance: A leadership team should not compromise on legal and regulatory compliance, however much there is a push to the boundaries. Violating laws or regulations can lead to severe consequences that may outweigh any short-term benefits. Many will not like operating in grey areas, which might mean releasing of the leadership team.</p><p>Crisis on Crisis: because we don't know what is going on in someone else's head, heart or home, individuals can quickly run into burnout.&nbsp; We don’t know who has a sick child, a family member has cancer, lost a loved one or is just in a moment of doubt.&nbsp; Each leadership team should assume that everyone in their team needs help and support constantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br> What have we already forgotten? <p>Post-pandemic leadership quickly forgot about burnout, ethics, transparency and single-mindedness to revert to power plays, incentives and individualism.&nbsp; It was easy to return to where we are most comfortable, and most experiences exist - stability and no global crisis.&nbsp; Interest rates and debt access are hard but are not a crisis unless your model is shot. &nbsp; The congratulatory thinking focussed on we survived the global crisis, it was a blip that is unlikely to be repeated.&nbsp;</p><p>The unique challenges and pressures of war demand adaptability, unity, decisiveness, and resource allocation adjustments - essential skills.&nbsp; However, we have learned that this focus should not come at the expense of consistency, ethical integrity, strategic focus, transparency, and legal compliance. A leadership team's ability to strike this balance can determine the organisation's survival and success during the most trying times. Ultimately, leadership must adapt while maintaining its core values and principles to navigate the turbulent waters of wartime effectively.</p><p>Whether a leadership team should act differently in times of war is a matter of balance, but the lessons and skills we have need to be front and centre.&nbsp; Today, focus on the team and spend more time than ever checking in on your team, staff, suppliers and those in the wider ecosystem.&nbsp; Crisis and conflict destroys life and lives at many levels.</p> <br>

<p>This article looks at implementing an ASP.NET Core application hosting an Angular nx application which authenticates using Microsoft Entra External ID for customers (CIAM). The ASP.NET Core authentication is implemented using the Microsoft.Identity.Web Nuget package. The client implements the OpenID Connect code flow with PKCE and is a confidential client.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/bff-MicrosoftEntraExternalID-aspnetcore-angular">https://github.com/damienbod/bff-MicrosoftEntraExternalID-aspnetcore-angular</a></p>



<p>Microsoft Entra External ID for customers (CIAM) is a new Microsoft product for customer (B2C) identity solutions. This has many changes to the existing Azure AD B2C solution and adopts many of the features from Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD). At present, the product is in public preview.</p>



 App registration setup 



<p>As with any Microsoft Entra ID, Azure AD B2C, Microsoft Entra External ID CIAM application, an Azure App registration is created and used to define the authentication client. The ASP.NET core application is a confidential client and must use a secret or a certificate to authenticate the application as well as the user.</p>



<p>The client authenticates using an OpenID Connect (OIDC) confidential code flow with PKCE. The implicit flow does not need to be activated.</p>



 
<a href="https://damienbod.files.wordpress.com/2023/05/azure_ciam_web_01.png"></a>
 



 User flow setup 



<p>In Microsoft Entra External ID for customers (CIAM), the application must be connected to the user flow. In external identities, a new user flow can be created and the application (The Azure app registration) can be added to the user flow. The user flow can be used to define the specific customer authentication requirements.</p>



 
<a href="https://damienbod.files.wordpress.com/2023/05/azure_ciam_web_02.png"></a>
 



 Architecture Setup 



<p>The application is setup to authenticate as one and remove the sensitive data from the client browser. The single security context has UI logic implemented in Angular and server logic, including the security flows, implemented in ASP.NET Core. The server part of the application handles all requests from the client application and the client application should only use the APIs from the same ASP.NET Core implemented host. Cookies are used to send the secure API requests. The UI implementation is greatly simplified and the backend application can add additional security features as it is a confidential client, or trusted client.</p>



 
<a href="https://damienbod.files.wordpress.com/2023/09/bff-arch-production_01.png"></a>
 



<p></p>



 ASP.NET Core Setup 



<p>The ASP.NET Core application is implemented using the&nbsp;Microsoft.Identity.Web&nbsp;Nuget package. The recommended flow for trusted applications is the OpenID Connect confidential code flow with PKCE. This is setup using the&nbsp;AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp&nbsp;method and also the&nbsp;EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi&nbsp;method. The CIAM client configuration is read using the json&nbsp;EntraExternalID&nbsp;section.</p>


  services.AddScoped&lt;MsGraphService&gt;();
services.AddScoped&lt;CaeClaimsChallengeService&gt;();

services.AddAntiforgery(options =&gt;
{
    options.HeaderName = "X-XSRF-TOKEN";
    options.Cookie.Name = "__Host-X-XSRF-TOKEN";
    options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.Strict;
    options.Cookie.SecurePolicy = CookieSecurePolicy.Always;
});

services.AddHttpClient();
services.AddOptions();

var scopes = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("DownstreamApi:Scopes");
string[] initialScopes = scopes!.Split(' ');

services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(configuration, "MicrosoftEntraExternalID")
    .EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(initialScopes)
    .AddMicrosoftGraph("https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0", initialScopes)
    .AddInMemoryTokenCaches();
  


<p></p>



<p>In the&nbsp;appsettings.json, user secrets or the production setup, the client specific configurations are defined. The settings must match the Azure App registration. The SignUpSignInPolicyId is no longer used compared to Azure AD B2C. This is linked in the user flow.</p>


    "MicrosoftEntraExternalID": {
    "Authority": "https://damienbodciam.ciamlogin.com/",
    "ClientId": "0990af2f-c338-484d-b23d-dfef6c65f522",
    "CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc",
    "SignedOutCallbackPath ": "/signout-callback-oidc"
    // "ClientSecret": "--in-user-secrets--"
  },
  


<p></p>



 Angular Setup 



<p>The Angular solution for development and production is setup like described in this blog:</p>



 
<blockquote><a href="https://damienbod.com/2023/09/11/implement-a-secure-web-application-using-nx-standalone-angular-and-an-asp-net-core-server/">Implement a secure web application using nx Standalone Angular and an ASP.NET Core&nbsp;server</a></blockquote>
 



<p></p>



<p>The UI part of the application implements no OpenID connect flows and is always part of the server application. The UI can only access APIs from the single hosting application. </p>



 Notes 



<p>I always try to implement user flows for B2C solutions and avoid custom setups as these setups are hard to maintain, expensive to keep updated and hard to migrate when the product is end of life.</p>



<p>Setting up a CIAM client in ASP.NET Core works without problems. CIAM offers many more features but is still missing some essential ones. This product is starting to look really good and will be a great improvement on Azure AD B2C when it is feature complete.</p>



<p>Strong authentication is missing from Microsoft Entra External ID for customers (CIAM) and this makes it hard to test using my Azure AD users. Hopefully FIDO2 and passkeys will get supported soon. See the following link for the supported authentication methods:</p>



<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/customers/concept-supported-features-customers">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/customers/concept-supported-features-customers</a></p>



<p>I also require a standard OpenID Connect identity provider (Code flow confidential client with PKCE support) in most of my customer solution rollouts. This is not is supported at present.</p>



<p>With CIAM, new possibilities are also possible for creating single solutions to support both B2B and B2C use cases. Support for Azure security groups and Azure roles in Microsoft Entra External ID for customers (CIAM) is one of the features which makes this possible.</p>

<p>After a lot of discussion on the mailing list over the last few months, and after some excellent discussions at the OAuth Security Workshop, we've been working on revising the draft to provide clearer guidance and clearer discussion of the threats and consequences of the various architectural patterns in the draft.</p>

<p>I would like to give a huge thanks to&nbsp;<a href="https://pragmaticwebsecurity.com/about.html">Philippe De Ryck</a> for stepping up to work on this draft as a co-author!</p>

<p>This version is a huge restructuring of the draft and now starts with a concrete description of possible threats of malicious JavaScript as well as the consequences of each. The architectural patterns have been updated to reference which of each threat is mitigated by the pattern. This restructuring should help readers make a better informed decision by being able to evaluate the risks and benefits of each solution.</p>

We had 315 people from around the world who called 163 sessions. The energy was high and I enjoyed seeing so many people who are working on identity talking with each other and sharing their ideas. The topics were diverse. Verifiable credentials continue to be a hot topic, but authorization is coming on strong. In closing circle someone said (paraphrashing) that authentication is solved and the next frontier is authorization. I tend to agree. We should have the book of proceedings completed in about a month and you'll be able to get the details of sessions there. You can <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/past-workshops/">view past Books of Proceedings here</a>.</p><p>As I said, there were attendees from all over the world as you can see by the pins in the map at the top of this post. Not surprisingly, most of the attendees were from the US (212), followed by Canada (29). Japan, the UK, and Germany rounded out the top five with 9, 8, and 8 attendees respectively. Attendees from India (5), Thailand (3), and Korea (3) showed IIW’s diversity with attendees from APAC. And there were 4 attendees from South America this time. Sadly, there were no attendees from Africa again. Please remember we offer scholarships for people from underrepresented areas, so if you’d like to come to IIW38, please let us know. If you’re working on identity, we want you there.</p><p>In terms of states and provinces, California was, unsurprisingly, first with 81. Washington (32), British Columbia (14), Utah (11), Ontario (11) and New York (10) rounded out the top five. Seattle (22), San Jose (15), Victoria (8), New York (8), and Mountain View (6) were the top cities.</p><p>As always the week was great. I had a dozen important, interesting, and timely conversations. If Closing Circle and Open Gifting are any measure, I was not alone. IIW is where you will meet people help you solve problems and move your ideas forward. Please come! IIW 38 will be held April 16-18, 2024 at the Computer History Museum. We'll have tickets available soon.</p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria!

<p>I highly recommend that everyone read the&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/Human-Centric-Digital-Identity-Final">“Human-Centric Digital Identity: for Government Officials”</a>&nbsp;whitepaper that&nbsp;Elizabeth Garber&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mark Haine&nbsp;have written, even if you aren’t in government. Published by the <a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID Foundation</a> and co-branded by twelve non-profit organisations, this paper offers a broad view of the global digital identity landscape, key considerations for government officials, and the path ahead to global interoperability. It is also grounded in the key role that digital identity plays in the wider international human rights agenda and the recent OECD Digital Identity Recommendations. </p>



<p>It is really difficult to write about digital identity when trying to put humanity (not individuals) AND society at the center. This paper is a very strong and considerate effort to try and tackle a broad, complicated, but important topic.</p>



<p>Elizabeth was kind enough to acknowledge me in the paper because of our shared viewpoint and discussions on how Value-Sensitive Design and Human-Centric Design are key cogs in building ethical and inclusive digital identity systems. But what she and Mark have tackled goes far beyond what I am able to do, and I do hope to see their work have a big impact on all the Identirati&nbsp;currently engaged in shaping the future of Digital Credentials and Digital Identity.</p>

<p>This article shows how a secure ASP.NET Core application can use Microsoft Entra ID downstream APIs and an in-memory cache. When using in-memory cache and after restarting an application, the tokens are missing for a value session stored in the cookie. The application needs to recover. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/bff-aspnetcore-angular">https://github.com/damienbod/bff-aspnetcore-angular</a></p>



<p></p>



 OpenID Connect client setup 



<p>The ASP.NET Core application is secured using OpenID code code with PKCE and the Microsoft Entra ID identity provider. The client is implemented using the Microsoft.Identity.Web Nuget package. The application also requires data from Microsoft Graph. This is implemented using the OBO flow from Microsoft. This uses the delegated access token to acquire a graph access token on behalf of the application and the user. The UI application stores the session in a secure cookie. The downstream API tokens are stored in a cache. If the application is restarted, the tokens are missing and the application needs to recover. You can solve this by forcing a login, or using a persistent cache.</p>



<p></p>







<p></p>



<p>The AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication method is used to setup the Microsoft Identity client.</p>


  var scopes = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("DownstreamApi:Scopes");
string[] initialScopes = scopes!.Split(' ');

services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(configuration)
    .EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(initialScopes)
    .AddMicrosoftGraph("https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0", initialScopes)
    .AddInMemoryTokenCaches();
  


<p></p>



 Microsoft Graph downstream API 



<p>The MsGraphService class implements the Microsoft Graph delegated client using the Microsoft.Identity.Web.GraphServiceClient Nuget package. This uses the Microsoft Graph V5 APIs. As this is a delegated client, the GraphServiceClient can be directly injected into the service and no token acquisition is required. In the original UI client setup, an in-memory cache was used to store the downstream APIs.</p>


  public class MsGraphService
{
    private readonly GraphServiceClient _graphServiceClient;
    private readonly string[] _scopes;

    public MsGraphService(GraphServiceClient graphServiceClient, 
         IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _graphServiceClient = graphServiceClient;
        var scopes = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("DownstreamApi:Scopes");
        _scopes = scopes!.Split(' ');
    }

    public async Task&lt;User?&gt; GetGraphApiUser()
    {
        return await _graphServiceClient.Me
            .GetAsync(b =&gt; b.Options.WithScopes(_scopes));
    }
  


<p></p>



 Revoke the session when the tokens are missing 



<p>The RejectSessionCookieWhenAccountNotInCacheEvents class implements the CookieAuthenticationEvents class. This checks the cache if a token exists for the defined scopes. If the token is missing. the cookie session is invalidated and the user must login again. This prevents unwanted exceptions for clients which are hard to recover from.</p>


  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Microsoft.Identity.Client;
using Microsoft.Identity.Web;

namespace BffAzureAD.Server;

public class RejectSessionCookieWhenAccountNotInCacheEvents 
       : CookieAuthenticationEvents
{
    private readonly string[] _downstreamScopes;

    public RejectSessionCookieWhenAccountNotInCacheEvents(string[] downstreamScopes)
    {
        _downstreamScopes = downstreamScopes;
    }

    public async override Task ValidatePrincipal(
      CookieValidatePrincipalContext context)
    {
        try
        {
            var tokenAcquisition = context.HttpContext.RequestServices
                .GetRequiredService&lt;ITokenAcquisition&gt;();

            string token = await tokenAcquisition.GetAccessTokenForUserAsync(
                scopes: _downstreamScopes, user: context.Principal);
        }
        catch (MicrosoftIdentityWebChallengeUserException ex)
           when (AccountDoesNotExitInTokenCache(ex))

            &amp;&amp; (ex.InnerException as MsalUiRequiredException)!.ErrorCode 
                   == "user_null";
    }
}
  


<p></p>



<p>The service is added to the applicaiton and the user will only have cookies with valid in-memory tokens.</p>


  // If using downstream APIs and in memory cache, you need to reset the cookie session if the cache is missing
// If you use persistent cache, you do not require this.
// You can also return the 403 with the required scopes, this needs special handling for ajax calls
// The check is only for single scopes
services.Configure&lt;CookieAuthenticationOptions&gt;(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, 
    options =&gt;  options.Events = new RejectSessionCookieWhenAccountNotInCacheEvents(initialScopes));
  


<p></p>



 Alternative solutions 



<p>You can also solve this problem in different ways. One quick way would be to use a persistent cache like Redis or a user session. See the cache link at the bottom from the Microsoft.Identity.Web Wiki. You could also return a HTTP 403 response with the missing tokens and force the UI to reauthenticate requesting the access token for the scopes. This can be complicated when sending ajax requests.</p>



<p>Other ways of solving this problem:</p>



 
 Use a persistent cache 



 Don’t use downstream APIs 



 Return a 403 challenge which requests the missing scopes and this response needs to be handling correctly 
 



<p>Per default using in-memory cache and downstream APIs require extra logic and implementation.</p>

<p>I convened the session “What does Presentation Exchange do and what parts of it do we actually need?” this week at the <a href="https://www.internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop (IIW)</a> to continue the discussion started during <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2395">two unconference sessions</a> at the <a href="https://oauth.secworkshop.events/osw2023">2023 OAuth Security Workshop</a>.  I briefly summarized the discussions that occurred at OSW, then we had a vigorous discussion of our own.</p>
<p>Key points made were:</p>
 
 There appeared to be rough consensus in the room that Presentation Exchange (PE) is pretty complicated.  People had differing opinions on whether the complexity is worth it. 
 A lot of the complexity of PE comes from being able to request multiple credentials at once and to express alternatives. 
 Ultimately, the verifier knows what kinds of credentials it needs and the relationships between them.  PE tries to let the verifier express some of that to the wallet. 
 Code running in the verifier making choices about the credentials it needs will always be more powerful than PE, because it has the full decision-making facilities of programming languages – including loops, conditionals, etc. 
 Making a composite request for multiple credentials can have a better UX than a sequence of requests.  In some situations, the sequence could result in the person having to scan multiple QR codes.  There may be ways to avoid that, while still having a sequence of requests. 
 Some said that they need the ability to request multiple credentials at once. 
 Brent Zundel (a PE author) suggested that while wallets could implement all of PE, verifiers could implement only the parts they need. 
 Not many parties had implemented all of PE.  Torsten Lodderstedt suggested that we need feedback from developers. 
 We could create a profile of PE, reducing what implementers have to build and correspondingly reducing its expressive power. 
 
<p>The slides used to summarize the preceding discussions are available as <a href="https://self-issued.info/presentations/What_does_PE_do_and_what_do_we_need-Part_3.pptx">PowerPoint</a> and <a href="https://self-issued.info/presentations/What_does_PE_do_and_what_do_we_need-Part_3.pdf">PDF</a>.  There are <a href="https://self-issued.info/presentations/What_does_PE_do_and_what_do_we_need-Part_3_Notes.txt">detailed notes</a> capturing some of the back-and-forth at IIW with attribution.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who participated for an informative and useful discussion.  My goal was to help inform the profiling and deployment choices ahead of us.</p>
<p>P.S.  Since Thursday’s discussion, it occurred to me that a question I wish I’d asked is:</p>
 
 When a verifier needs multiple credentials, they may be in different wallets.  If the verifier tries to make a PE request for multiple credentials that are spread between wallets, will it always fail because no single wallet can satisfy it? 
 
<p>Fodder for the next discussion…</p>

lifecycle. It’s a powerful enabler and fundamental technology underpinning
CipherDoc. I’m so happy to have found it.</p>
 Confusion 
<p>However, the distinction between the SQL/JSON Path operators <code>@@</code> and <code>@?</code>
confused me. Even as I found that the <code>@?</code> operator worked for my needs and <code>@@</code>
did not, I tucked the problem into my mental backlog for later study.</p>
<p>The question arose again on a recent work project, and I can take a hint. It’s
time to figure this thing out. Let’s see where it goes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSON-PROCESSING-TABLE" title="PostgresSQL Docs: JSON Functions and Operators">The docs</a> say:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 <code>jsonb @? jsonpath → boolean</code> 
 Does JSON path return any item for the specified JSON value? 
 
<p><code>'{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}'::jsonb @? '$.a[*] ? (@ &gt; 2)' → t</code></p>
 
 
 <code>jsonb @@ jsonpath → boolean</code> 
 Returns the result of a JSON path predicate check for the specified JSON
value. Only the first item of the result is taken into account. If the
result is not Boolean, then <code>NULL</code> is returned. 
 
<p><code>'{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}'::jsonb @@ '$.a[*] &gt; 2' → t</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These read quite similarly to me: Both return true if the path query returns an
item. So what’s the difference? When should I use <code>@@</code> and when <code>@?</code>? I went so
far as to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/77046554/79202" title="Stack Overflow: What's the difference between the PostgreSQL @? and @@ JSONB Operators?">ask Stack Overflow</a> about it. The <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/77046858/79202">one answer</a> directed my attention
back to the <code>jsonb_path_query()</code> function, which returns the results from a
path query.</p>
<p>So let’s explore how various SQL/JSON Path queries work, what values various
expressions return.</p>
 Queries 
<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSON-PROCESSING-TABLE" title="PostgresSQL Docs: JSON Functions and Operators">The docs</a> for <code>jsonb_path_query</code> say:<a>1</a></p>
<blockquote>
 
 <code>jsonb_path_query ( target jsonb, path jsonpath [, vars jsonb [, silent boolean ]] ) → setof jsonb</code> 
 Returns all JSON items returned by the JSON path for the specified JSON
value. If the <code>vars</code> argument is specified, it must be a JSON object, and
its fields provide named values to be substituted into the jsonpath
expression. If the <code>silent</code> argument is specified and is true, the
function suppresses the same errors as the <code>@?</code> and <code>@@</code> operators do. 
 
  <code>select * from jsonb_path_query(
    '{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}',
    '$.a[*] ? (@ &gt;= $min &amp;&amp; @ &lt;= $max)',
    '{"min":2, "max":4}'
) →
 jsonb_path_query
------------------
 2
 3
 4
</code>   
 
</blockquote>
<p>The first thing to note is that a SQL/JSON Path query may return more than one
value. This feature matters for the <code>@@</code> and <code>@?</code> operators, which return a
single boolean value based on the values returned by a path query. And path queries
can return a huge variety of values. Let’s explore some examples, derived from
the sample JSON value and path query from the docs.<a>2</a></p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}', '$ ?(@.a[*] &gt; 2)');
    jsonb_path_query    
------------------------
 {"a": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}
(1 row)
</code>  <p>This query returns the entire JSON value, because that’s what <code>$</code> selects at the
start of the path expression. The <code>?()</code> filter returns true because its
predicate expression finds at least one value in the <code>$.a</code> array greater than
<code>2</code>. Here’s what happens when the filter returns false:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}', '$ ?(@.a[*] &gt; 5)');
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
(0 rows)
</code>  <p>None of the values in the <code>$.a</code> array are greater than five, so the query
returns no value.</p>
<p>To select just the array, append it to the path expression after the <code>?()</code>
filter:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}', '$ ?(@.a[*] &gt; 2).a');
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
(1 row)
</code>   Path Modes 
<p>One might think you could select <code>$.a</code> at the start of the path query to get the
full array if the filter returns true, but look what happens:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}', '$.a ?(@[*] &gt; 2)');
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
 3
 4
 5
(3 rows)
</code>  <p>That’s not the array, but the individual array values that each match the
predicate. Turns out this is a quirk of the Postgres implementation of <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#STRICT-AND-LAX-MODES" title="PostgresSQL Docs: Strict and Lax modes">path
modes</a>. From what I can glean, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2016" title="Wikipedia: “SQL:2016”">SQL:2016</a> standard dictates something like
these <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/json/json-path-expressions-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16#PATHMODE" title="JSON Path Expressions (SQL Server): Path mode">SQL Server descriptions</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 In lax mode, the function returns empty values if the path expression
contains an error. For example, if you request the value $.name, and the
JSON text doesn’t contain a name key, the function returns null, but
does not raise an error. 
 In strict mode, the function raises an error if the path expression
contains an error. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>But the Postgres lax mode does more than suppress errors. From <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#STRICT-AND-LAX-MODES" title="PostgresSQL Docs: Strict and Lax modes">the docs</a> (emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The lax mode facilitates matching of a JSON document structure and path
expression if the JSON data does not conform to the expected schema. If an
operand does not match the requirements of a particular operation, it can be
automatically wrapped as an SQL/JSON array or unwrapped by converting its
elements into an SQL/JSON sequence before performing this operation.
Besides, comparison operators automatically unwrap their operands in the lax
mode, so you can compare SQL/JSON arrays out-of-the-box.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a few more details, but this is the crux of it: In lax mode, which is
the default, Postgres always unwraps an array. Hence the unexpected list of
results.<a>3</a> This could be particularly confusing when querying multiple
rows:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query(v, '$.a ?(@[*] &gt; 2)')
        from (values ('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}'::jsonb), ('{"a":[3,5,8]}')) x(v);
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
 3
 4
 5
 3
 5
 8
(6 rows)
</code>  <p>Switching to strict mode by preprending <code>strict</code> to the JSON Path query restores
the expected behavior:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query(v, 'strict $.a ?(@[*] &gt; 2)')
        from (values ('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}'::jsonb), ('{"a":[3,5,8]}')) x(v);
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 [3, 5, 8]
(2 rows)
</code>  <p>Important gotcha to watch for, and a good reason to test path queries thoroughly
to ensure you get the results you expect. Lax mode nicely prevents errors when a
query references a path that doesn’t exist, as this simple example demonstrates:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}', 'strict $.b');
ERROR:  JSON object does not contain key "b"

select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}', 'lax $.b');
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
(0 rows)
</code>  <p>In general, I suggest always using strict mode when executing queries. Better
still, perhaps always prefer strict mode with our friends the <code>@@</code> and <code>@?</code>
operators, which <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSONB-OP-TABLE" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Additional jsonb Operators">suppress some errors even in strict mode</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The jsonpath operators <code>@?</code> and <code>@@</code> suppress the following errors: missing
object field or array element, unexpected JSON item type, datetime and numeric
errors. The <code>jsonpath</code>-related functions described below can also be told to
suppress these types of errors. This behavior might be helpful when searching
JSON document collections of varying structure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have a look:</p>
  <code>select '{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}' @? 'strict $.a';
 ?column? 
----------
 t
(1 row)

select '{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}' @? 'strict $.b';
 ?column? 
----------
 &lt;null&gt;
(1 row)
</code>  <p>No error for the unknown JSON key <code>b</code> in that second query! As for the error
suppression in the <code>jsonpath</code>-related functions, that’s what the <code>silent</code>
argument does. Compare:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}', 'strict $.b');
ERROR:  JSON object does not contain key "b"

select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}', 'strict $.b', '{}', true);
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
(0 rows)
</code>   Boolean Predicates 
<p>The Postgres <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-SQLJSON-PATH">SQL/JSON Path Language docs</a> briefly mention a pretty significant
deviation from the SQL standard:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A path expression can be a Boolean predicate, although the SQL/JSON standard
allows predicates only in filters. This is necessary for implementation of the
<code>@@</code> operator. For example, the following <code>jsonpath</code> expression is valid in
PostgreSQL:</p>
<p><code>$.track.segments[*].HR &lt; 70</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This pithy statement has pretty significant implications for the return value
of a path query. The SQL standard allows predicate expressions, which are akin
to an SQL <code>WHERE</code> expression, only in <code>?()</code> filters, as seen previously:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}', '$ ?(@.a[*] &gt; 2)');
    jsonb_path_query    
------------------------
 {"a": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}
(1 row)
</code>  <p>This can be read as “return the path <code>$</code> if <code>@.a[*] &gt; 2</code> is true. But have a
look at a predicate-only path query:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}', '$.a[*] &gt; 2');
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
 true
(1 row)
</code>  <p>This path query can be read as “Return the result of the predicate <code>$.a[*] &gt; 2</code>,
which in this case is <code>true</code>. This is quite the divergence from the standard,
which returns contents from the JSON queried, while a predicate query returns
the result of the predicate expression itself. It’s almost like they’re two
different things!</p>
<p>Don’t confuse the predicate path query return value with selecting a boolean
value from the JSON. Consider this example:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[true,false]}', '$.a ?(@[*] == true)');
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
 true
(1 row)
</code>  <p>Looks the same as the predicate-only query, right? But it’s not, as shown by
adding another <code>true</code> value to the <code>$.a</code> array:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[true,false,true]}', '$.a ?(@[*] == true)');
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
 true
 true
(2 rows)
</code>  <p>This path query returns the <code>true</code>s it finds in the <code>$.a</code> array. The fact that
it returns values from the JSON rather than the filter predicate becomes more
apparent in strict mode, which returns all of <code>$a</code> if one or more elements of
the array has the value <code>true</code>:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[true,false,true]}', 'strict $.a ?(@[*] == true)');
  jsonb_path_query   
---------------------
 [true, false, true]
(1 row)
</code>  <p>This brief aside, and its mention of the <code>@@</code> operator, turns out to be key to
understanding the difference between <code>@?</code> and <code>@@</code>. Because it’s not just that
this feature is “necessary for implementation of the <code>@@</code> operator”. No, I would
argue that it’s the only kind of expression usable with the <code>@@</code> operator</p>
 Match vs. Exists 
<p>Let’s get back to the <code>@@</code> operator. We can use a boolean predicate JSON Path
like so:</p>
  <code>select '{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}'::jsonb @@ '$.a[*] &gt; 2';
 ?column? 
----------
 t
(1 row)
</code>  <p>It returns true because the predicate JSON path query <code>$.a[*] &gt; 2</code> returns true.
And when it returns false?</p>
  <code>select '{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}'::jsonb @@ '$.a[*] &gt; 6';
 ?column? 
----------
 f
(1 row)
</code>  <p>So far so good. What happens when we try to use a filter expression that returns
a <code>true</code> value selected from the JSONB?</p>
  <code>select '{"a":[true,false]}'::jsonb @@ '$.a ?(@[*] == true)';
 ?column? 
----------
 t
(1 row)
</code>  <p>Looks right, doesn’t it? But recall that this query returns all of the
<code>true</code> values from <code>$.@</code>, but <code>@@</code> wants only a single boolean. What happens
when we add another?</p>
  <code>select '{"a":[true,false,true]}'::jsonb @@ 'strict $.a ?(@[*] == true)';
 ?column? 
----------
 &lt;null&gt;
(1 row)
</code>  <p>Now it returns <code>NULL</code>, even though it’s clearly true that <code>@[*] == true</code>
matches. This is because it returns all of the values it matches, as
<code>jsonb_path_query()</code> demonstrates:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[true,false,true]}'::jsonb, '$.a ?(@[*] == true)');
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
 true
 true
(2 rows)
</code>  <p>This clearly violates the <code>@@</code> documentation claim that “Only the first item of
the result is taken into account”. If that were true, it would see the first
value is <code>true</code> and return true. But it doesn’t. Turns out, the corresponding
<code>jsonb_path_match()</code> function shows why:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_match('{"a":[true,false,true]}'::jsonb, '$.a ?(@[*] == true)');
ERROR:  single boolean result is expected
</code>  <p>Conclusion: The documentation is inaccurate. Only a single boolean is expected
by <code>@@</code>. Anything else is an error.</p>
<p>Futhermore, it’s dangerous, at best, to use an SQL standard JSON Path expression
with <code>@@</code>. If you need to use it with a filter expression, you can turn it into
a boolean predicate by wrapping it in <code>exists()</code>:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_match('{"a":[true,false,true]}'::jsonb, 'exists($.a ?(@[*] == true))');
 jsonb_path_match 
------------------
 t
(1 row)
</code>  <p>But there’s no reason to do so, because that’s effectively what the <code>@?</code>
operator (and the corresponding, cleverly-named <code>jsonb_path_exists()</code> function
does): it returns true if the SQL standard JSON Path expression contains any
results:</p>
  <code>select '{"a":[true,false,true]}'::jsonb @? '$.a ?(@[*] == true)';
 ?column? 
----------
 t
(1 row)
</code>  <p>Here’s the key thing about <code>@?</code>: you don’t want to use a boolean predicate path
query with it, either. Consider this predicate-only query:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}'::jsonb, '$.a[*] &gt; 6');
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
 false
(1 row)
</code>  <p>But see what happens when we use it with <code>@?</code>:</p>
  <code>select '{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}'::jsonb @? '$.a[*] &gt; 6';
 ?column? 
----------
 t
(1 row)
</code>  <p>It returns true even though the query itself returns false! Why? Because <code>false</code>
is a value that exists and is returned by the query. Even a query that returns
<code>null</code> is considered to exist, as it will when a strict query encounters an
error:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}'::jsonb, 'strict $[*] &gt; 6');
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
 null
(1 row)

select '{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}'::jsonb @? 'strict $[*] &gt; 6';
 ?column? 
----------
 t

</code>  <p>The key thing to know about the <code>@?</code> operator is that it returns true if
anything is returned by the path query, and returns false only if nothing is
selected at all.</p>
 The Difference 
<p>In summary, the difference between the <code>@?</code> and <code>@@</code> JSONB operators is this:</p>
 
 <code>@?</code> (and <code>jsonb_path_exists()</code>) returns true if the path query returns any
values — even <code>false</code> or <code>null</code> — and false if it returns no values.
This operator should be used only with SQL-standard JSON path queries that
select data from the JSONB. Do not use predicate-only JSON path expressions
with <code>@?</code>. 
 <code>@@</code> (and <code>jsonb_path_match()</code>) returns true if the path query returns the
single boolean value <code>true</code> and false otherwise. This operator should be
used only with Postgres-specific boolean predicate JSON path queries,
that return data from the predicate expression. Do not use SQL-standard JSON
path expressions with <code>@@</code>. 
 
<p>This difference of course assumes awareness of this distinction between
predicate path queries and SQL standard path queries. To that end, I <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/7262A188-59CA-4A8A-AAD7-83D4FF0B9758%40justatheory.com" title="pgsql-hackers — Patch: Improve Boolean Predicate JSON Path Docs">submitted
a patch</a> that expounds the difference between these types of JSON Path
queries, and plan to submit another linking these differences in the docs for
<code>@@</code> and <code>@?</code>.</p>
<p>Oh, and probably another to explain the difference in return values between
strict and lax queries due to array unwrapping.</p>
 Thanks 
<p>Many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/ewie" title="GitHub: Erik Wienhold">Erik Wienhold</a> for patiently answering my <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/15DD78A5-B5C4-4332-ACFE-55723259C07F%40justatheory.com" title="pgsql-hackers —&nbsp;JSON Path and GIN Questions">pgsql-hackers

oddities of <code>@@</code> were previously discussed in detail.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Well almost. The docs for <code>jsonb_path_query</code> actually say, about the
last two arguments, “The optional <code>vars</code> and <code>silent</code> arguments act the same
as for <code>jsonb_path_exists</code>.” I replaced that sentence with the relevant
sentences from the <code>jsonb_path_exists</code> docs, about which more later.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>
 
 
<p>Though omitting the <code>vars</code> argument, as variable interpolation just
gets in the way of understanding basic query result behavior.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>
 
 
<p>In fairness, the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/adjsn/json-path-expressions.html#GUID-8656CAB9-C293-4A99-BB62-F38F3CFC4C13" title="Oracle Database JSON Developer’s Guide: SQL/JSON Path Expression Syntax Relaxation">Oracle docs</a> also discuss “implicit array
wrapping and unwrapping”, but I don’t have a recent Oracle server to
experiment with at the moment.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

<p>Experiments with JSON-LD VC payloads secured by JWS vs. Data Integrity<br>Detailed results: <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/json-ld-vcs-not-just-json">https://github.com/peacekeeper/json-ld-vcs-not-just-json</a></p><p>In the world of Verifiable Credentials (VCs), it can be hard to keep track of various evolving formats and data models. A potpourri of similar-sounding terms can be found in specification documents, mailing lists and meeting notes, such as VCDM, VC-JWT, VC-JWS, JWT VCs, SD-JWT, SD-JWT-VC, SD JWS, VC JOSE COSE, SDVC, JsonWebSignature2020, etc.</p><p>Also, statements like the following can frequently be found in discussions:</p>  “Can we make @context optional. It’s simpler and not always&nbsp;needed.”  “If you don’t want to use @context and just ignore it, you&nbsp;could.”  “You can secure a JSON-LD VC using&nbsp;JWT.”  “You can use SD-JWT for any JSON payload, including JSON-LD.”  “JSON-LD is&nbsp;JSON.”  <p>One concrete question related to this is what it means if a VC using the JSON-LD-based W3C VC Data Model is secured by proof mechanisms that were designed without JSON-LD in&nbsp;mind.</p> Experimentation <p>To explore this, I conducted two experiments to describe what happens if you take a JSON-LD document based on the W3C VC Data Model, and you secure it once with <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-jose-cose/">JWS</a>, and once with <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-integrity/">Data Integrity</a>. The former signs the document, while the latter signs the underlying RDF graph of the document. The part where this gets interesting is the JSON-LD @context. For JWS, only the contents of the document matter. For Data Integrity, the contents of the @context matter as well. The two proof mechanisms have a rather different understanding of the “payload” that is to be&nbsp;secured.</p> Experiment #1: Data Integrity changes, JWS&nbsp;doesn’t <p>In the first experiment, we start with a JSON-LD document named <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/json-ld-not-just-json/blob/main/examples/example1a.input">example1a.input</a>. This document references a JSON-LD @context <a href="https://example.com/context1/,">https://example.com/context1/,</a> and the contents of that @context are as in the file <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/json-ld-not-just-json/blob/main/contexts/context1a.jsonld">context1a.jsonld</a>.</p><p>In a subsequent variation of this, we start with another JSON-LD document named <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/json-ld-not-just-json/blob/main/examples/example1b.input">example1b.input</a>, which is equivalent to the above example1a.input. This document also references the same JSON-LD @context <a href="https://example.com/context1/,">https://example.com/context1/,</a> but now, the contents of that @context are as in the file <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/json-ld-not-just-json/blob/main/contexts/context1b.jsonld">context1b.jsonld</a>, which is different from the file context1a.jsonld that was used&nbsp;above.</p><p>The result: If the contents of the JSON-LD @context change, even if the JSON-LD document stays the same, the Data Integrity signature also changes, whereas the JWS signature doesn’t change. This also means that verifying a Data Integrity signature would fail, whereas verifying a JWS signature would&nbsp;succeed.</p> Experiment #2: JWS changes, Data Integrity doesn’t <p>In the second experiment, we start with a JSON-LD document named <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/json-ld-not-just-json/blob/main/examples/example2a.input">example2a.input</a>. This document references a JSON-LD @context <a href="https://example.com/context2a/,">https://example.com/context2a/,</a> and the contents of that @context are as in the file <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/json-ld-not-just-json/blob/main/contexts/context2a.jsonld">context2a.jsonld</a>.</p><p>In a subsequent variation of this, we start with another JSON-LD document named <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/json-ld-not-just-json/blob/main/examples/example2b.input">example2b.input</a>, which is different from the above example2a.input. The difference is that the first document used the term “givenName”, while the second document uses the term “firstName”. The second document references a different JSON-LD @context <a href="https://example.com/context2b/,">https://example.com/context2b/,</a> and the contents of that @context are as in the file <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/json-ld-not-just-json/blob/main/contexts/context2b.jsonld">context2b.jsonld</a>, which is different from the file context2a.jsonld that was used above. The difference is that the first @context defines the term “givenName”, while the second @context defines the term “firstName”, however, they define them using the same URI, i.e. with equivalent semantics.</p><p>The result: Despite the fact that the JSON-LD document changes, the Data Integrity signature doesn’t change, whereas the JWS signature changes. This is because Data Integrity “understands” that even though the document has changed, the semantics of the RDF graph are still the same. JWS on the other hand “sees” only the JSON-LD document, not the semantics behind it. This also means that verifying a Data Integrity signature would succeed, whereas verifying a JWS signature would&nbsp;fail.</p> Conclusion <p>Depending on your perspective, you could interpret the results in different ways. You could call Data Integrity insecure, since it depends on information outside the JSON document. You could also call JWS insecure, since it fails to secure the JSON-LD data&nbsp;model.</p><p>The real point of this article is however NOT to say that any of the mentioned data models or proof mechanisms are inherently insecure, but rather to raise awareness of the nuances. To say “JSON-LD is JSON” is correct on the document layer, and wrong on the data model layer. Certain combinations of data models and proof mechanisms can lead to surprising results, if they are not understood properly.</p>

<p>This article shows how to implement identity verification in a solution using ASP.NET Core and trinsic.id, built using an id-tech solution based on self sovereign identity principals. The credential issuer uses OpenID Connect to authenticate, implemented using Microsoft Entra ID. The edge or web wallet authenticates using trinsic.id based on a single factor email code. The verifier needs no authentication, it only verifies that the verifiable credential is authentic and valid. The verifiable credentials uses JSON-LD ZKP with BBS+ Signatures and selective disclosure to verify.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/swiss-ssi-group/TrinsicV2AspNetCore">https://github.com/swiss-ssi-group/TrinsicV2AspNetCore</a> </p>



<p>History</p>



 
 2023-12-02 Updated .NET 8 
 



 Use Case 



<p>As a university administrator, I want to create BBS+ verifiable credentials templates for university diplomas.</p>



<p>As a student, I want to authenticate using my university account (OpenID Connect Code flow with PKCE), create my verifiable credential and download this credential to my SSI Wallet.</p>



<p>As an HR employee, I want to verify the job candidate has a degree from this university. The HR employee needs verification but does not require to see the data.</p>



 
 The sample creates university diplomas as verifiable credentials with BBS+ signatures. 



 The credentials are issued using OIDC with strong authentication (If possible) to a candidate mobile wallet. 



 The issuer uses a trust registry so that the verifier can validate that the VC is authentic. 



 The verifier uses BBS+ selective disclosure to validate a diploma. (ZKP is not possible at present) 



 The university application requires an admin zone and a student zone. 
 



 Setup 



 
 The university application plays the role of credential issuer and has it’s own users. 



 Trinsic.id wallet is used to store the verifiable credentials for students. 



 Company X HR plays the role of verifier and has no connection to the university. The company has a list of trusted universities. (DIDs) 
 



 Issuing a credential 



<p>The ASP.NET Core issuer application can create a new issuer web (edge) wallet, create templates and issue credentials using the template. The trinsic.id .NET SDK is used to implement the SSI or id-tech integration. How and where trinsic.id store the data is unknown, and you must trust them to do this correctly if you use their solution. Implementing your own ledger or identity layer is at present too much effort and so the best option is to use one of the integration solutions. The UI is implemented using ASP.NET Core Razor pages and the Microsoft.Identity.Web Nuget package with Microsoft Entra ID for the authentication. The required issuer template is used to create the credential offer.</p>


  var diploma = await _universityServices.GetUniversityDiploma(DiplomaTemplateId);

var tid = Convert.ToInt32(DiplomaTemplateId, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);

var response = await _universityServices
	.IssuerStudentDiplomaCredentialOffer(diploma, tid);

CredentialOfferUrl = response!.ShareUrl;
  


<p>The IssuerStudentDiplomaCredentialOffer method uses the University eco system and issuer a new offer using it’s template.</p>



<p></p>


  public async Task&lt;CreateCredentialOfferResponse?&gt; IssuerStudentDiplomaCredentialOffer

<p>The UI returns the offer and displays this as a QR code which can be opened and starts to process to add the credential to the web wallet. This is a magic link and not an SSI OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance flow or the starting point for a Didcomm V2 flow. Starting any flow using a QR Code is unsafe and further protection is required. Using an authenticated application with a phishing resistant authentication reduces this risk or using OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance VC issuing.</p>

 Creating a proof in the wallet 



<p>Once the credential is in the holders wallet, a proof can be created from it. The proof can be used in a verifier application. The wallet authentication of the user is implemented using a single factor email code and creates a selective proof which can be copied to the verifier web application. OpenID for Verifiable Presentations for verifiers cannot be used because there is no connection between the issuer and the verifier. This could be possible if the process was delegated to the wallet using some type of magic URL, string etc. The wallet can authenticate against any known eco systems.</p>


  public class GenerateProofService
{
    private readonly TrinsicService _trinsicService;
    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

    public List&lt;SelectListItem&gt; Universities = new();

    public GenerateProofService(TrinsicService trinsicService, IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _trinsicService = trinsicService;
        _configuration = configuration;

        Universities = _configuration.GetSection("Universities")!.Get&lt;List&lt;SelectListItem&gt;&gt;()!;
    }

    public async Task&lt;List&lt;SelectListItem&gt;&gt; GetItemsInWallet(string userAuthToken)
    {
        var results = new List&lt;SelectListItem&gt;();
        // Auth token from user 
        _trinsicService.Options.AuthToken = userAuthToken;

        // get all items
        var items = await _trinsicService.Wallet.SearchWalletAsync(new SearchRequest());
        foreach (var item in items.Items)
        {
            var jsonObject = JsonNode.Parse(item)!;
            var id = jsonObject["id"];
            var vcArray = jsonObject["data"]!["type"];
            var vc = string.Empty;
            foreach (var i in vcArray!.AsArray())
            {
                var val = i!.ToString();
                if (val != "VerifiableCredential")
                {
                    vc = val!.ToString();
                    break;
                }
            }

            results.Add(new SelectListItem(vc, id!.ToString()));
        }

        return results;
    }

    public async Task&lt;CreateProofResponse&gt; CreateProof(string userAuthToken, string credentialItemId)
    {
        // Auth token from user 
        _trinsicService.Options.AuthToken = userAuthToken;

        var selectiveProof = await _trinsicService.Credential.CreateProofAsync(new()
        {
            ItemId = credentialItemId,
            RevealTemplate = new()
            {
                TemplateAttributes = { "firstName", "lastName", "dateOfBirth", "diplomaTitle" }
            }
        });

        return selectiveProof;
    }

    public AuthenticateInitResponse AuthenticateInit(string userId, string universityEcosystemId)
    {
        var requestInit = new AuthenticateInitRequest
        {
            Identity = userId,
            Provider = IdentityProvider.Email,
            EcosystemId = universityEcosystemId
        };

        var authenticateInitResponse = _trinsicService.Wallet.AuthenticateInit(requestInit);

        return authenticateInitResponse;
    }

    public AuthenticateConfirmResponse AuthenticateConfirm(string code, string challenge)
    {
        var requestConfirm = new AuthenticateConfirmRequest
        {
            Challenge = challenge,
            Response = code
        };
        var authenticateConfirmResponse = _trinsicService.Wallet.AuthenticateConfirm(requestConfirm);

        return authenticateConfirmResponse;
    }
}
  


<p>The wallet connect screen can look some like this:</p>







<p>The proof can be created using one of the credentials and the proof can be copied.</p>







<p></p>



 Verifying the proof 



<p>The verifier can use the proof to validate the required information. The verifier has no connection to the issuer, it is in a different eco system. Because of this, the verifier must validate the issuer DID. This must be a trusted issuer (university).</p>


  public class DiplomaVerifyService
{
    private readonly TrinsicService _trinsicService;
    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

 
    public List&lt;SelectListItem&gt; TrustedUniversities = new();
    public List&lt;SelectListItem&gt; TrustedCredentials = new();

    public DiplomaVerifyService(TrinsicService trinsicService, IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _trinsicService = trinsicService;
        _configuration = configuration;

        TrustedUniversities = _configuration.GetSection("TrustedUniversities")!.Get&lt;List&lt;SelectListItem&gt;&gt;()!;
        TrustedCredentials = _configuration.GetSection("TrustedCredentials")!.Get&lt;List&lt;SelectListItem&gt;&gt;()!;
    }

    public async Task&lt;(VerifyProofResponse? Proof, bool IsValid)&gt; Verify(string studentProof, string universityIssuer)
    {
        // Verifiers auth token
        // Auth token from trinsic.id root API KEY provider
        _trinsicService.Options.AuthToken = _configuration["TrinsicCompanyXHumanResourcesOptions:ApiKey"];

        var verifyProofResponse = await _trinsicService.Credential.VerifyProofAsync(new VerifyProofRequest
        {
            ProofDocumentJson = studentProof,
        });

        var jsonObject = JsonNode.Parse(studentProof)!;
        var issuer = jsonObject["issuer"];

        // check issuer
        if (universityIssuer != issuer!.ToString())
        {
            return (null, false);
        }

        return (verifyProofResponse, true);
    }
}
  


<p>The ASP.NET Core UI could look something like this:</p>

 Notes 



<p>Using a SSI based solution to share data securely across domains or eco systems can be very useful and opens up many business possibilities. SSI or id-tech is a good solution for identity checks and credential checks, it is not a good solution for authentication. Phishing is hard to solve in cross device environments. Passkeys or FIDO2 is the way forward for user authentication. The biggest problem for SSI and id-tech is the interoperability between solutions. For example, the following credential types exist and are only useable on specific solutions:</p>



 
 JSON JWT 



 SD-JWT (JSON-LD with LD Signatures) 



 AnonCreds with CL Signatures 



 JSON-LD ZKP with BBS+ Signatures 



 mDL ISO ISO/IEC 18013-5 
 



<p>There are multiple standards, multiple solutions, multiple networks and multiple ledgers. No two systems seem to work with each other. In a closed eco system, it will work, but SSI has few advantages over existing solutions in a closed eco system. Interoperability needs to be solved.</p>

<p>Writing this post is hard, because the emotions are still fresh and very raw. In so many ways, I feel like I was only just beginning to know Vittorio Luigi Bertocci.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, we all feel like we “know” him, because he has always been a larger-than-life character operating at the very forefront of our industry, driving the development of some of the most important of our industry standards efforts, and leading the effort to educate technologists everywhere through his conference talks and educational videos, blogs, and articles. His enthusiasm, humor, and depth of knowledge would make his talks on even the driest of topics engaging and effective. He was so incredibly open on social media, sharing everything from his travel experiences, to his experiments in health data tracking, to his misadventures in Starbucks naming. He was always willing to engage in conversation with anyone and everyone on a wide variety of topics – on identity, on books and science fiction, on philosophy. And he was not shy about sharing his opinions. But more than anything, he was always ready to help someone breaking into our complex and confusing world of identity. He would often say that it was driven by his narcissism. But even if that were true, at the core of it was a desire to make sure we were all working towards making identity better.</p>



<p>Yes, we have all felt like we “know” him. Who else in identity has an anime character? Who else but him could pull off literally stopping mid sentence during a conference talk to pose for the photographer? And that hair!</p>


 
<a href="https://7ee14c.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WithVittorio.jpg"></a> 


<p>But it was only in these last few months, as he learnt about and tried to battle the disease that took him away from us, did I get to know just how much the public persona was not a facade. He reached out and connected with many of us, with the kind of honesty, openness, love, and vulnerability that I do not think I would ever be capable of. And in doing so, he did what he always did best – he taught a bunch of us so much about ourselves, about each other, and brought us together in a way that would have been damn near impossible if it weren’t for him.</p>



<p>We have all been robbed, because Vittorio has been taken from us way, way too soon. But we have also been given a gift, one that goes way beyond Vittorio’s contributions to the field of digital identity that in no small measure have enabled all of us to make a living. The memories that live in our hearts, the lessons on what it means to be one of the identirati, and the passion for life itself that he exemplified, and that I now feel compelled to try and emulate – this will be his legacy, for me at least.</p>



<p>Love you Vittorio. Forever.</p>

But the benefits go far beyond better security. </p><p>A few weeks ago, I came across this <a href="https://www.citizenme.com/the-future-of-data-is-zero-data/">article from StJohn Deakin from 2020 about </a><a href="https://www.citizenme.com/the-future-of-data-is-zero-data/">zero data</a>. I've been <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2023/08/zero_trust.shtml">thinking a lot about zero trust</a> lately, so the name leapt out at me. I immediately knew what StJohn was speaking about because I've been talking about it too. My new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1098117697/technometria-20">Learning Digital Identity</a>, talks about the concept. But the name—zero data—is simply brilliant. I want to dig into zero data in this post. I'll discuss the link between zero data and zero trust in a future post.</p><p>StJohn describes the idea like this:</p><blockquote><p>Personal data should be held by humans first, and by the companies, organisations and governments that humans choose to interact with, second. The ultimate in ‘data minimisation’ is for the platforms in the centre to simply facilitate the interactions and not hold any data at all. This is the exact opposite of our Google/Facebook/Amazon dominated world where all human data is being concentrated in a few global silos.</p><p>A zero data society doesn’t mean that data isn’t shared between us, quite the opposite. With increased trust and participation, the data available and needed to drive our global society will explode exponentially.</p><p>From <a href="https://www.citizenme.com/the-future-of-data-is-zero-data/">The Future of Data is ‘Zero Data’</a><br>Referenced 2023-09-30T17:37:15-0600</p></blockquote><p>If you think about this in the context of how the internet has worked for the last three decades, the concept of zero data might seem baffling. Yet, consider a day in your life. How often do you establish lasting relationships—and thus share detailed information about yourself—with every individual or entity you come across? Almost never. It would be absurd to think that every time you grab a coffee from the local store, you'd need to form a lasting bond with the coffee machine, the cashier, the credit card terminal, and other customers just to facilitate your purchase. Instead, we exchange only the essential information required, and relevant parties retain just the data that is needed long term.</p><p>To build a zero data infrastructure we need to transfer trustworthy data just-in-time. <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/12/verifiable_credential_exchange.shtml">Verifiable credentials</a> (VCs) offer a way to represent information so that its authenticity can be verified through cryptographic means. They can be thought of as digital attestations or proofs that are created by an issuer about a subject and are presented by the holder to a verifier as required. </p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85d2af5e-4625-42c5-bf60-f69e2dbfbe24.heic">    </a>Verifiable Credential Exchange  <p>Here are some of the interaction patterns facilitated by verifiable credentials:</p>  <p>Selective Disclosure: VCs enable users to share only specific parts of a credential. For instance, a user can prove they are of legal age without revealing their exact date of birth.</p>  <p>Credential Chaining: Multiple credentials can be linked together, enabling more complex proofs and interactions. For example, an employer might hire an employee only after receiving a VC proving they graduated and another proving their right to work.</p>  <p>Holder-Driven Data Exchange: Instead of organizations pulling data about users, VCs shift the interaction model to users pushing verifiable claims to organizations when needed.</p>  <p>Anonymous Credential Proofs: VCs can be designed to be presented anonymously, allowing users to prove a claim about themselves without revealing their identity. For example, VCs can be used to prove the customer is a human with less friction than CAPTCHAs.</p>  <p>Proofs without Data Transfer: Instead of transferring actual data, users can provide cryptographic proofs that they possess certain data or prove predicates about the data, reducing the exposure of personal information. For example, VCs can be used to prove that the subject is over 21 without revealing who the subject is or even their birthdate.</p>  <p>Adaptive Authentication: Depending on the sensitivity of an online interaction, users can be prompted to provide VCs of varying levels of assurance, enhancing security in adaptable ways. I plan to talk about this more in my next post about zero data and zero trust.</p>  <p>These interaction patterns change traditional data management and verification models, enabling businesses to retain considerably less data on their clients. Verifiable credentials have numerous benefits and features of that provide a positive impact on data management, security, and user trust:</p>  <p>Data Minimization: As we've seen, with VCs, users can prove facts without revealing detailed data. By selectively sharing parts of a credential, business only see necessary information, leading to overall reduced data storage and processing requirements.</p>  <p>Reduced Redundancy &amp; Data Management: Trustworthy VCs reduce the need for duplicate data, simplifying data management. There's less need to track, backup, and maintain excess data, reducing complexity and associated costs.</p>  <p>Expiration, Revocation, &amp; Freshness of Data: VCs can be designed with expiration dates and can be revocable. This ensures verifiers rely on up-to-date credentials rather than outdated data in long-term databases.</p>  <p>Trust through Standardized Protocols: VCs, built on standardized protocols, enable a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2017/01/a_universal_trust_framework.shtml">universal trust framework</a>. Multiple businesses can thus trust and verify the same credential, benefiting from reduced integration burdens and ensuring less custom development.</p>  <p>Enhanced Security &amp; Reduced Exposure to Threats: Data minimization reduces the size of the so-called honey pot, reducing the attraction for cyber-attacks and, in the event of a breach, limit the potential damage, both in terms of data exposed and reputational harm.</p>  <p>Compliance, Regulatory Benefits &amp; Reduced Liability: Adhering to data minimization aligns with many regulations, reducing potential legal complications. Storing minimal data also decreases organizational liability and regulatory scrutiny.</p>  <p>Cost Efficiency: By storing less data, organizations can achieve significant savings in storage infrastructure and IT operations, while also benefiting from focused data analytics.</p>  <p>Enhanced User Trust &amp; Reputation: By collecting only essential data, organizations can build trust with users, gaining a competitive edge in a privacy-conscious market that is increasingly growing tired of the abuses of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/05/can_the_digital_future_be_our_home.shtml">surveillance capitalism</a>.</p>  <p>In essence, verifiable credentials shift the paradigm from "data collection and storage" to "data verification and trust." Online interactions are provided with the assurance they need without the business incurring the overhead (and risk) of storing excessive customer data. Zero data strategies not only reduce the potential attack surface for cyber threats but also offers a variety of operational, financial, and compliance benefits.</p><p>The biggest objection to a zero data strategy is likely due to its decentralized nature. Troves of user data make people comfortable by giving them the illusion of ready access to the data they need, when they need it. The truth is that the data is often unverified and stale. Nevertheless, it is the prevailing mindset. Gettng used to just-in-time, trustworthy data requires changing attitudes about how we work online. But the advantages are compelling.</p><p>And, if your business model depends on selling data about your customers to others (or facilitating their use of this data in, say, an ad network) then giving up your store of data may threaten precious business models. But this isn’t an issue for most businesses who just want to facilitate transactions with minimal friction.</p><p>Zero data aligns our online existence more closely with our real-world interactions, fostering new methods of communication while decreasing the challenges and risks associated with amassing, storing, and utilizing vast amounts of data. When your customers can prove things about themselves in real time, you'll see several benefits beyond just better security:</p>  <p>Reduced Sign-Up Friction: For services that rely on verified attributes (e.g., age, membership status, qualifications), users can <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2023/01/better_onboarding_with_verifiable_credentials.shtml">provide these attributes quickly with VCs, eliminating lengthy sign-up or verification processes</a>.</p>  <p>Cross-Platform Verification: A VC issued by one service can be verified and trusted by another, facilitating smoother cross-platform interactions and reducing the need for users to repetitively provide the same information.</p>  <p>Fewer intermediaries: VCs can allow for <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/held_hostage.shtml">direct trust between parties without the need for a centralized authority</a>. This fosters more direct and decentralized interactions.</p>  <p>Zero data, facilitated by verifiable credentials, represents a pivotal transition in how digital identity is used in online interactions. By minimizing centralized data storage and emphasizing cryptographic verifiability, this approach aims to address the prevalent challenges in data management, security, and user trust. Allowing online interactions to more faithfully follow established patterns of transferring trust from the physical world, the model promotes just-in-time data exchanges and reduces unnecessary data storage. As both businesses and individual users grapple with the increasing complexities of digital interactions, the integration of verifiable credentials and a zero data framework stands out as a practical, friction-reducing, security-enhancing solution for the modern digital landscape.</p>

Because they have a well-defined equity mission, I wanted to make sure the vendors of technologies and services being chosen adhered to their values.

The idea is not to undertake a research project: most prompts can be answered with a simple search, and the whole assessment should be completable in under an hour.

<p>Jason and I will be hitting the road to explore Arkansas in a few days. We’ll be away until the end of the month scouting potential landing spots for the next chapter in my life. Over the course of the last 48 hours, I’ve had many interconnected realizations; or if not fully new realizations, then ones that helped clarify my thinking in deep, meaningful ways. The cascade of ideas in today’s stream resulted from Stephers sending me this1930s paper yesterday morning.</p>
<p><a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Electro-Dynamic-Theory-of-Life-H.S.-Burr-and-F.S.C.-Northrop.pdf"></a></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Electro-Dynamic-Theory-of-Life-H.S.-Burr-and-F.S.C.-Northrop.pdf&nbsp;">https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Electro-Dynamic-Theory-of-Life-H.S.-Burr-and-F.S.C.-Northrop.pdf&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>You can see how it precedes Michael Levin and Neri Oxman’s bio-electrical research. What bubbled up were ideas about how ideas of environmental templating would be informed by the installation of cybernetic outside-in robots. I thought about life being remade as a digitally manipulated psychodrama structured with game mechanics to create a puzzle / problem solving collective in non-linear time. I revisited previous lines of study, including Edward Dewey’s Foundation for the Study of Cycles and Julius Stulman, Fritz Kunz, and Oliver Reiser’s “Foundation for Integrated Education” and “World Institute.” By the evening I had pulled out Barbara Dewey’s book on Laminated Spacetime and queued up the movie “Arrival.” I’d meant to see it for some time, but that day all the stars aligned. Today is my dad’s birthday, and it is a month since his death. As everything came into focus for me, I felt like he was right there with me in this liminal space. I love you dad.</p>
<p>After bombarding the inboxes of a few close associates with way too many emails, I decided to pull together my thoughts in an off-the-cuff presentation. I didn’t have time to make a super fancy map with lots of supporting material. Instead I just spoke from the heart. These are the two main ideas I wanted to convey. I’m not saying they are right, but only that it’s worth looking at them hypothetically as thought experiments to see how they hold up in the context of cybernetic impact finance, bio-digital convergence, radiation hormesis, and collective consciousness management.</p>
<p>Thought experiment one:</p>
<p>Consider the internet (and soon extended reality) as a portal into the equivalent of Battle School in Ender’s Game where cooperative infinite games are substituted for finite competitive games. Nested brackets of teams engage in problem solving under conditions of real time sensing, programmed stress, and dynamic constraints. Gameplay is situated in live action role play to tap into the collective subconscious. Picture participants compensated with UBI or crypto play to earn micropayments for their in-game contributions tracked on blockchain mindfile ledgers. The interspecies / inter-intelligence communication medium in this problem-solving space could be Web3 tokens with embedded, nested narratives (think Chinese characters ala Leibniz’s aspirations for the Characteristic Universalis or sigils). Perhaps aspects of the digital stories would be unlocked and presented via holograms (think Princess Leia’s distress message for Obi Wan Kenobi). Exchange of tokens through the ritual game play of votes, trades, media engagement, and biometric and cognitive data could result in computational solutions grounded in real truths of human emotion, culture, and soulful imagination. Could Web3 tokens be a long-sought computational language bringing together the social and physical sciences?</p>
<p>Thought experiment two:</p>
<p>Could this collective cooperative “Battle School” problem space be a digital petri dish for a mass anthropological experiment where ubiquitous sensing charts lived behaviors on planet Earth in order to develop a new interspecies language? Perhaps there is something beyond this dimension, time scale, or sensing framework that really wants to communicate with life here, but it hasn’t yet found the key. What if Fourth Industrial Revolution mass surveillance, natural language processing, the shift to platform life, digital therapeutics, and human weather forecasting are being used to build mental models for linguistic analysis? As we perform our humanity in alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, is there a biofilm colony keeping track and working to devleop a computational system of sociology that can bridge across our mental models of the cosmos? If so, I wonder to what end? If Barbara Dewey is correct about mind creating matter from the endosphere, installing a coordinating infrastructure (decentralized ledgers and tokens) for mass mind coordination could be leveraged to manifest unimagined realities. I don’t think we are prepared for what the chaos magician posse has in store for us with their foxy Ethereum Consensys program.</p>

  I gave a talk at PGCon this year on a privacy-first data storage service I designed and implemented. Perhaps the encryption and searching patterns will inspire others.

<div class='wrap'>

 
         
<p>Over the last year, I designed and implemented a simple web service, code-named
“CipherDoc”, that provides a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete" title="Wikipedia: “Create, read, update, and delete”">CRUD</a> API for creating, updating, searching, and
deleting <a href="https://json.org" title="ECMA-404 The JSON Data Interchange Standard">JSON</a> documents. The app enforces document structure via <a href="https://json-schema.org" title="JSON Schema is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents">JSON
schema</a>, while <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/datatype-json.html#DATATYPE-JSONPATH" title="PostgreSQL Docs: jsonpath Type">JSON/SQL Path</a> powers the search API by querying a hashed subset
of the schema stored in a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/gin.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: GIN Indexes">GIN-indexed</a> <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html" title="PostgresSQL Docs: JSON Types">JSONB</a> column in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" title="PostgreSQL: The World's Most Advanced Open Source Relational Database">Postgres</a>.</p>
<p>In may I gave a public presentation on the design and implementation of the
service at <a href="https://www.pgcon.org/" title="PGCon - PostgreSQL Conference for Users and Developers">PGCon</a>: CipherDoc: A Searchable, Encrypted JSON Document Service on
Postgres. Links:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.pgcon.org/events/pgcon_2023/schedule/session/360-a-pattern-for-a-searchable-encrypted-json-document-service/" title="PGCon 2023 — CipherDoc: A Searchable, Encrypted JSON Document Service on Postgres">Description</a> 
 <a href="https://www.pgcon.org/events/pgcon_2023/sessions/session/360/slides/73/cipher-doc.pdf">Slides</a> 
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUyHnjpr-0Q" title="CipherDoc: A Pattern for a Searchable, Encrypted JSON Document Service: David E Wheeler - PGCon 2023">Video</a> 
 
<p>I enjoyed designing this service. The ability to dynamically change the JSON
schema at runtime without database changes enables more agile development cycles
for busy teams. Its data privacy features required a level of intellectual
challenge and raw problem-solving (a.k.a., engineering) that challenge and
invigorate me.</p>
<p>Two minor updates since May:</p>
 
 I re-implemented the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/datatype-json.html#DATATYPE-JSONPATH" title="PostgreSQL Docs: jsonpath Type">JSON/SQL Path</a> parser using the original Postgres
<a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/REL_15_4/src/backend/utils/adt/jsonpath_gram.y" title="jsonpath_gram.y: Grammar definitions for jsonpath datatype">path grammar</a> and <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goyacc" title="Goyacc is a version of yacc for Go. It is written in Go and generates parsers written in Go">goyacc</a>, replacing the hand-written parser roundly
castigated in the presentation. 
 The service has yet to be open-sourced, but I remain optimistic, and
continue to work with leadership at The Times towards an open-source
policy to enable its release.

<p>I wrote a post last year about Buzz theory, and the year before about <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2009/03/how-twitter-works-in-theory.html">Twitter theory</a>, so I thought I'd compare how Google+ (hereafter Plus) fits in with them too.</p> Flow <p>Plus is a <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2009/08/flow-past-web-even-better-than-realtime.html">flow</a> but it is re-ordered by responses to posts. It has a second flow of Notifications, that not only has an unread count (though it caps out at 9+), but that lurks atop every Google page, drawing you back in as you search or read gmail. What it chooses to notify you about are people who follow you (now mercifully collated into clumps, comments on your posts, and people plussing you (the equivalent of twitter @replies). Like Buzz, these Notifications end up privileged over the core flow, and also email you by default. </p> Faces <p>There are <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2009/05/faces-call-trust-code-in-our-brains.html">faces</a> of people next to each post, tapping into the subtle nuances of trust we all carry in our heads. The replies and notifications have smaller faces, which makes it harder to work out who they are, as this is where strangers show up more. The faces shown for the circle you're watching, or the list of people also in a limited post are very tiny indeed.</p> Phatic <p>The phatic feel of Twitter is partially there, but at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuThg91-4Nw">the launch</a> there was much talk of Google 'hiding the irrelevant' so the social gestures where we groom each other may be tidied away by an uncomprehending machine.</p><p>The replies from faceless strangers flooding your inbox if you respond to anyone with a large following will put people off interacting socially. The feeling of talking intimately to those you know is replaced by something closer to the 'naked in the school lunchroom' nightmare.</p> Following <p>Buzz does pick up Twitters asymmetric following model, and indeed adds a way to create private Buzzes for small groups, both key features. However, these are undermined by the confusing editing process. The Follower/Following editing is only in pop-up javascript dialogs on your <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?ui=2&amp;shva=1#buzz">Buzz in gmail</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/profiles/me">Google Profile</a> pages, and because of the auto-follow onboarding, rather opaque. The groups editing is in <a href="http://">Google Contacts</a>, but that doesn't show the Followers, Following, Chat Friends, Latitude or other subgroups. There is also no way to see just conversations with those groups.</p><p>The overall effect makes it feel more like a <a href="http://kevan.org/morningtonia.pl?MC_On_The_Net">Mornington Crescent server</a> than Twitter. I made a <a href="http://">Mornington Crescent</a> Buzz account; it seems to fit.</p> Publics <p>Twitter's natural view is different for each of us, and is of those we have chosen. We each have our own public that we see and we address. </p><p>The subtlety is that the <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/04/digital-publics-conversations-and.html">publics</a> are semi-overlapping - not everyone we can see will hear us, as they don't necessarily follow us, and they may not dip into the stream in time to catch the evanescent ripples in the flow that our remark started. To see responses to us from those we don't follow, we have to click the Mentions tab. However, as our view is of those we choose to follow, our emotional response is set by that, and we behave more civilly in return.</p><p>Buzz reverses this. The general comments from friends are in the Buzz tab, but anyone can use '@' to mention you, forcing the whole conversational thread into your inbox. Similarly, if you comment on someone else's Buzz, any further updates to the web show up in your main email inbox. The <a href="http://many.corante.com/archives/2004/11/06/the_tragedy_of_the_comments.php">tragedy of the comments</a> ensues, where <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/conferences/blog/2006/07/oscon_how_open_source_projects.html">annoying people</a> can take over the discussion, and their replies are privileged twice over those you choose to follow.</p><p>This is the <a href="http://xkcd.com/202/">YouTube comments problem</a> yet magnified; when all hear the words of one, the conversation often decays.</p> Mutual media <p>By bringing in Twitter,blogs, Google Reader shared items, photos and other Activity Streams feeds, Buzz has the potential to be a way to connect the loosely coupled flows those of us who live in the <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/02/09/Information-Aristocracy">listening Web</a> to the email dwellers who may left behind. By each reading whom we choose to and passing on some of it to others, we are each others media, we are the synapses in the global brain of the web of thought and conversation. Although we each only touch a local part of it, ideas can travel a long way.</p><p>If the prioritisation of secondary commentary and poking over collated ideas can be reversed in Buzz, this could be made to work.</p> Small world networks <p>Social connections are a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Six-Degrees-Science-Connected-Market/dp/0393325423%3FSubscriptionId%3D1K3HRANMNP9TFHJC9282%26tag%3Depeusepigone-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0393325423">small-world network</a> locally strongly-connected, but spreading globally in a small number of jumps. The email graph that Buzz taps into may be a worse <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2005/11/29/attention_netwo.html">model</a> of real world social networks that articulated SNS's like Facebook, but it could be improved if the following and editing models are fixed.</p><p>Buzz's promise is that it builds on <a href="http://activitystrea.ms/">Activity Streams</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/buzz/dclinton/XxER6oP4WGe/The-best-way-to-get-a-sense-of-where-the-Buzz-API">other open standards</a>, so it could help encourage others to do this better.</p>

  I've been invited to be on a few more podcasts to talk about my new book Learning Digital Identity from O'Reilly Media. That's one of the perks of writing a book. People like to talk about it. I always enjoy talking about identity and especially how it's so vital to the quality of our lives in the digital world, so I'm grateful these groups found time to speak with me.

<p>来る9月28日に、OIX主催の IdentityTrust Conference 2023 でキーノートをします。</p>



<p>タイトルは「The Fallacy of Decentralisation」です。もしロンドンにいらしたらぜひお立ち寄りください。なお、わたしの直後のセッションは、科学・イノベーション・技術省のポール・スカリー政務次官です。また、午後には「ウォレットとフレームワーク」という座談会に出演します。</p>



 このカンファレンスについて 



<p>デジタル・クレデンシャルは、信頼できるスマート・ウォレットを介して信頼できるユーザから提供されるため、オンラインでも対面でも、ビジネスのやり方を変えることができます。</p>



<p>Identity Trust 2023 には、デジタル・クレデンシャルの受領者<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/09/5403/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5403" title="acceptor">1</a>と、デジタル ID エコシステム内でサービ スを作成および提供する関係者が世界中から集まります。</p>



<p>この会議では、ユーザーのデジタル ID ウォレットからクレデンシャルを信頼と信用をもって受け入れることができる理由を探ります。そのユーザーは本人ですか？サービスにアクセスする資格はありますか？</p>



<p>年齢確認、金融機関へのアクセス、住宅売買、旅行、雇用審査などの主要なユースケースにおいて、デジタル ID がどのように普及しているかを探ります。</p>



<p>また、デジタルIDが国境を越えてどのように機能するかについても詳しく見ていきます。ある国を訪問する場合でも、リモートでサービスにアクセスする場合でも、「スマート・ウォレット」は、ユーザーがやり取りしたい相手ごとのアクセプターの要件に動的に適応する必要があります。</p>



<p>300人を超える参加者とともに、デジタルIDの利用がどのように加速しているか、また、それが貴社と貴社の顧客にどのような利益をもたらすかをご確認ください。</p>



<p>直接参加できない場合は、このイベントのメインステージセッションをライブストリーミングでご覧いただけます。</p>

 <p></p>Mothwing patterns, often including structures resembling “owl eyes,” are a prime example of nature’s adaptation to survival.<p>Mothwing eyes are intricate patterns that have evolved over millions of years through a process of natural selection. Initially, moths developed cryptic colouration to blend into their environments, evading predators. Over time, some species developed wing scales with microstructures that reduced light reflection, helping them remain inconspicuous. These structures eventually evolved into complex arrays resembling the texture of eyes to deter predators, a phenomenon called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyespot_(mimicry)">eyespot mimicry</a>.” This natural error-creation adaptation likely startled or confused predators, offering those moths an advantage — precious moments to escape. The gradual development of these eye-like patterns underscores the intricate interplay between environmental pressures and biological responses, resulting in the remarkable diversity of moth wing patterns seen today.</p><p>Critically, moths are not and were not conscious in or of the development of eyespot mimicry or any other evolutionary adaptations. They did not think, “Let us moths create a pattern on the wing to confuse the owl.” Evolution is a gradual, unconscious process that occurs over generations through the mechanism of natural selection. Individual organisms do not consciously choose or design their adaptations; rather, random genetic mutations lead to variations in traits within a population. Suppose a particular trait, such as the “eyes” pattern on wings, provides some advantage in terms of survival or reproduction. In that case, individuals possessing that trait are more likely to pass on their genes to the next generation. Over time, these advantageous traits become more prevalent in the population.&nbsp;This process occurs without the organisms having any conscious intent or awareness of the changes in their traits. It results from environmental pressures and the differential survival and reproduction of individuals with different traits.</p><blockquote><p>AI can develop new traits with advantages, but that does not make it conscious.</p></blockquote><p>AI (as of 2023) does not possess consciousness or intent like humans. However, consciousness and the development of new survival traits are unrelated. Indeed, neither is the characteristic of “independent decision-making” linked to survival. Adaption, evolution and the crafting of new advantage does not have any links to higher-order thinking or awareness.</p><p>AI operates based on algorithms, data, and programming, and any development of new traits or capabilities at the start (where we are today) will be a direct result of deliberate human design and engineering rather than unconscious adaptation.</p><p>Whilst simple algorithms can simulate processes that resemble aspects of evolution, such as genetic algorithms and neural architecture search, to optimise certain parameters or designs. Whereas&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo">AlphaGo</a>&nbsp;(Google Deepmind) demonstrated the ability to learn and improve its gameplay through a combination of deep neural networks and reinforcement learning techniques based on data.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero">AlphaZero</a>&nbsp;went further insomuch that it doesn’t even need a data set to start as it is generated through selfplay.</p> What is happening here? <p>AlphaGo &amp; AlphaZero demonstrated that processes guided by predefined objectives and criteria set by human programmers or researchers have enabled new traits (moves) to be crafted. These “AI” implementations do not have self-awareness or independent decision-making ability, but that does not prevent the autonomous development of new traits or adaptations in the same way living organisms do through evolution. AlphaGo’s capabilities are still within the bounds of its programmed algorithms and training data. It doesn’t possess a consciousness and is a product of human engineering, designed to excel at a specific task, but as with AlphaZero and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaFold">AlphaFold</a>, such systems can create new traits and advantages.</p><p>Whilst AI systems such as AlphaGo/ AlphaFold showcase the power of AI to adapt and improve within predefined parameters, it highlights that we are on the cusp of AI developing traits or adapting in the same way living organisms do through evolution.</p><blockquote><p>We are on the cusp of AI developing traits or adapting in the same way living organisms do through evolution.</p></blockquote><p>We should not be surprised as these AI systems are trying to mimic how humans and living organisms learn and evolve; therefore, a natural consequence is evolution, the development of traits based on “<a href="https://opengovernance.net/why-finding-purpose-feels-impossible-d5c92eb1bde3">errors</a>” that provide an advantage.</p><p>There is a very fine line between AI systems operating under the guidance of human-defined objectives and constraints and such systems creating errors and adaptations, essentially improvements based on patterns learned from data, just like nature. The observation becomes interesting as data can now be created independently of human activity using&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-play">selfplay</a>.</p><p>The development of new traits or improvements in AI based on “<a href="https://opengovernance.net/why-finding-purpose-feels-impossible-d5c92eb1bde3">errors</a>” in data will soon mimic the unconscious forces of natural selection, which we will only see once it has been created.&nbsp;Critically, we have to question “how will we know” because it is new and different.&nbsp;This question is one that regulation is not set up to address or can solve, and it is why regulating the AI industry makes no sense.</p><blockquote><p>The development of new traits or improvements in AI based on “<a href="https://opengovernance.net/why-finding-purpose-feels-impossible-d5c92eb1bde3">errors</a>” in data will soon mimic the unconscious forces of natural selection, which we will only see once it has been created.</p></blockquote> Questions for the directors and senior leadership team. <p>We are fully into automation and the implementation of AI across many of our systems, and indeed, we are using the data to make improvements that we did not see. Have you questioned if this new trait has an advantage, and how have you determined it has an advantage and for whom? Is the advantage for you, your ecosystem, your customer or your AI?</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-david-35a5887/">Scott</a>&nbsp;for seeding this.</p>

   <br><p>The (un)intended consequence of focusing on data, looking for significance, determining correlation, testing a hypothesis, removing bias and finding the consensus is that you ignore the outliers.&nbsp;</p><p>Hidden in the outliers of data are progress, innovation, invention and creativity, and the delay is that by ignoring this data and the signals from it, we slow down everything because we will always be late to observe and agree on what is already happening with those who are not driven by using data to reduce and manage today's risk.&nbsp; Our thrust to use data to make better decisions and apply majority or consensus thinking creates delays in change and, therefore, increases future risk.&nbsp;</p><br><p>------</p><p>In our increasingly data-driven world, the unintended consequence of data often manifests as delay. While data is hailed as the lifeblood of decision-making, its sheer volume and complexity can paradoxically slow down processes, hinder innovation, and impede productivity. This phenomenon underscores the critical importance of managing data effectively to avoid unintended delays.</p><p>One primary way data leads to delay is through information overload. As organisations accumulate vast amounts of data, sorting through it can be overwhelming. Decision-makers may spend excessive time sifting through data, distinguishing relevant insights from the noise. This can result in analysis paralysis, where decisions are postponed indefinitely and opportunities are missed.</p><p>Data can also introduce delays when it is siloed within organisations. Departments may collect and store data independently, leading to fragmentation and redundancy. When data is not easily accessible across the organisation, collaboration suffers, and decision-making processes become fragmented. This can slow down projects and hinder the ability to respond swiftly to changing market conditions.</p><p>Moreover, the increasing focus on data privacy and security regulations has introduced a layer of complexity and delay. Organisations must navigate a labyrinth of compliance requirements, which can slow down data sharing and processing. The need for stringent data protection measures can sometimes clash with the need for agility and speed in decision-making.</p><p>The unintended delay caused by data can be mitigated through effective data management strategies. Investing in data analytics tools and platforms that can streamline data processing and analysis is crucial. Fostering a data-centric culture that encourages data sharing and collaboration can help break down organisational silos.</p><p>In conclusion, data is a powerful asset but can also be a source of unintended delay if not managed properly. Organisations must recognise the potential pitfalls of data overload, fragmentation, and compliance challenges and take proactive steps to mitigate these issues. With the right strategies and tools in place, data can be a catalyst for informed decision-making and innovation rather than a source of delay.</p><br><br><br>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>In April, I <a href="https://blog.joeandrieu.com/2023/04/12/fighting-for-consensus-at-the-w3c/">appealed</a> a decision by the W3C Chairs to place DID Methods in scope in the next DID WG Charter. </p>



<p>That appeal was <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-did-wg/2023Jul/0000.html">ignored</a> and the charter advanced to AC Review.</p>



<p>This is our Formal Objection to that charter.</p>



<p>We oppose this charter on several grounds.</p>



  Process  Collaboration  Technical Fundamentals  Interoperability Goals  



 PROCESS 



<p>We stand by our appeal (<a href="https://blog.joeandrieu.com/2023/04/12/fighting-for-consensus-at-the-w3c/">https://blog.joeandrieu.com/2023/04/12/fighting-for-consensus-at-the-w3c/</a>), which we feel was improperly handled. The Process rules, about consensus, appeals, and Formal Objections, in our opinion, were ignored.</p>



<p>The incident (and the appeal) were filed under Process 2021; the current process is Process 2023. Staff’s response meets the requirements of neither Process. Since Philippe Le Hegaret cited Process 2023 in his response to my appeal, let’s look at what Process 2023 requires.</p>



<p>Process 2023 requires Groups to formally address issues with a response that includes a rationale for decisions that “a W3C reviewer would generally consider to be technically sound”. Neither Philippe Le Hegaret’s nor the Chairs’ responses met that standard. Philippe simply claimed that “this charter is the most acceptable for the majority of the group (an assessment that was confirmed by a recent poll); and that 2) the charter is not a WG deliverable, and consensus must be reached at the AC level anyway, so Joe’s argument should be raised during AC review, not prior to it.”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the cited poll did not even attempt to gauge consensus. It merely gauged the popularity of advancing the WG, without consideration of the multiple options under consideration by members of the group. Rather than attempting to establish a legitimate vote, Staff created a poll that, like a Politburo election, only offered one candidate to vote on, where, in fact, it should have been inquiring about any objections to best understand the proposal with the weakest objections, instead of blatantly attempting to rubber stamp the offending decision.</p>



<p>More problematic is that the rules for Formal Objections were not followed. There should have been a W3C Council formed to evaluate the objection on its own merits, prior to AC Review.</p>



<p>Staff’s assertion that “consensus must be reached at the AC level anyway” is fundamentally in error. The AC is not involved in resolving formal objections. Councils are.</p>



<p>According to Process 2023, a Council MUST be formed to consider the merits of the objection.</p>



<p>Given that the objection was filed April 12, Staff should have started a council no later than July 11, 2023. PRIOR to sending the Charter to review by the AC. Unfortunately, no council was formed. Instead, on July 26, Philippe finally responded to the appeal by saying Staff is going to ignore it. On August 8, the charter was proposed, unchanged, to the AC for review.</p>



<p>One may raise the concern that the new process was not adopted until June 12, leaving Staff only a month before the deadline. However, Staff did not have to wait until the process was adopted. They could have responded under the previous process any time before June 12 or, realizing that the process was likely to be adopted, they could have begun the prep work to start the council in a timely manner, as required. The idea of councils had been extensively debated and iterated on months before I filed my appeal to the chair decision. And yet, we still have no council.</p>



<p>Further as part of its obligations under Process 2023 when there are Formal Objections, Staff is tasked with investigation and mediation. Since Staff’s efforts in that regard did not lead to consensus–by Staff’s own acknowledgement–its only option is to form a council and prepare a report:<br>“Upon concluding that consensus cannot be found, and no later than 90 days after the Formal Objection being registered, the Team must initiate formation of a W3C Council, which should be convened within 45 days of being initiated. Concurrently, it must prepare a report for the Council documenting its findings and attempts to find consensus.”</p>



<p>As a result, the AC is reviewing not the legitimate continuation of the DID Working Group, but rather a hijacking of the work that I and others have given years of time and effort to advance.</p>



 



 COLLABORATION 



<p>Taking the charitable position that everyone involved continues to act in good faith and the process as defined was properly followed (even if its documentation might be inadequate), then we still oppose this charter on the grounds that the development of the charter violated the fundamental purpose of the W3C: collaboration through consensus.</p>



<p>The question we ask is this: should WG chairs be able to propose a continuation of that WG without consensus from the WG itself? Should anyone?</p>



<p>This is the situation we’re in and I did not expect that collaboration at the W3C would look like this.</p>



<p>I first got involved with W3C work by volunteering feedback to the Verifiable Credentials Task Force on their draft use case document. From those early days, I was asked to join as an invited expert and have since led the use case and requirements efforts for both Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers, where I remain an editor. I also developed and continue to edit the DID Method Rubric a W3C NOTE. Somewhere in that tenure I also served as co-chair of the W3C Credentials Community Group.</p>



<p>During this time, I have been impressed by the organizations’ advocacy for consensus as something unique to its operations. The idea of consensus as a foundational goal spoke not only to my heart as a human being seeking productive collaborations with others, but also to my aspirations as a professional working on decentralized identity.</p>



<p>And then, citing a non-binding recommendation by the then-acting director in response to previous Formal Objections, the chairs of the DID WG turned that narrative of consensus upside down.</p>



 



<p>Here’s what happened:</p>



<p>June 30, 2022 – DID Core decision by Director “In its next chartered period the Working Group should address and deliver proposed standard DID method(s) and demonstrate interoperable implementations. The community and Member review of such proposed methods is the natural place to evaluate the questions raised by the objectors and other Member reviewers regarding decentralization, fitness for purpose, and sustainable resource utilization.” Ralph Swick, for Tim Berners-Lee<br><a href="https://www.w3.org/2022/06/DIDRecommendationDecision.html">https://www.w3.org/2022/06/DIDRecommendationDecision.html</a></p>



<p>July 19, 2022 – DID WG Charter extended, in part “to discuss during TPAC the rechartering of the group in maintenance mode.” Xueyuan xueyuan@w3.org <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-did-wg/2022Jul/0023.html">https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-did-wg/2022Jul/0023.html</a></p>



<p>August 18, 2022 – Brent Zundel proposed to add DID Methods in PR#20 <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/20">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/20</a></p>



<p>September 1, 2022 – Group email from Brent Zundel about TPAC “We plan to discuss the next WG charter and will hopefully end up with a draft ready to pass on to the next stage in the process.” Brent Zundel <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-did-wg/2022Sep/0001.html">https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-did-wg/2022Sep/0001.html</a></p>



<p>The Charter at the time of announcement <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/blob/af23f20256f4107cdaa4f2e601a7dbd38f4a20b8/index.html">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/blob/af23f20256f4107cdaa4f2e601a7dbd38f4a20b8/index.html</a></p>



<p>September 12, 2022 – Group meeting at TPAC “There seems to be strong consensus that we’d rather focus on resolution” <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2022-09-12-did">https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2022-09-12-did</a></p>



<p>September 20, 2022 – Summary of TPAC. Manu Sporny <a href="mailto:msporny@digitalbazaar.com">msporny@digitalbazaar.com</a> “The DID Working Group meeting had significant attendance (40-50 people). The goal was to settle on the next Working Group Charter. […] There were objections to standardizing DID Methods. […] There didn’t seem to be objections to DID Resolution or maintaining DID Core.”<br><a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2022Sep/0177.html">https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2022Sep/0177.html</a></p>



<p>September 21, 2022 – PR#20 from Brent Zundel merges, without discussion or any notice to the WG, PR#20 DID Method resolution into spec, saying “I am merging this PR over their objections because having the flexibility to go this route could be vital should our efforts to move DID Resolution forward be frustrated.”</p>



<p>October 18, 2002 – DID Resolution PR #25 created to add DID Resolution</p>



<p>October 24, 2002 – DID Resolution PR #25 merged, adds DID Resolution</p>



<p>October 25, 2022 – Reviewing other work, I discovered the unannounced merge of #20 and commented asking to revert. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/20#issuecomment-1291199826">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/20#issuecomment-1291199826</a></p>



<p>December 14, 2022 – Brent Zundel created PR #27 to add DID Methods and DID Resolution to the deliverables section.</p>



<p>December 15, 2022 – DID WG Charter extended to “allow the group to prepare its new charter” Xueyuan xueyuan@w3.org <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-did-wg/2022Dec/0000.html">https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-did-wg/2022Dec/0000.html</a></p>



<p>The Charter at the time of the December 15 extension <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/blob/b0f79f90ef7b8e089335caa301c01f3fc3f8f1ef/index.html">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/blob/b0f79f90ef7b8e089335caa301c01f3fc3f8f1ef/index.html</a></p>



<p>December 15, 2022 – Brent Zundel asserts consensus is not required. “There are no WG consensus requirements in establishing the text of the charter.” And “The time and place to have the conversation about whether the charter meets the needs of the W3C is during AC review.” <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1353537492">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1353537492</a> </p>



<p>January 19, 2023 — Christopher Allen raised issue #28 suggesting DID Resolution WG instead of DID WG. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/issues/28">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/issues/28</a> </p>



<p>January 23, 2023 – Brent Zundel initially welcomes seeing a DID Resolution WG charter. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/issues/28#issuecomment-1401211528">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/issues/28#issuecomment-1401211528</a> </p>



<p>January 23, 2023 – Brent Zundel continues to argue that consensus does not apply: “This charter is not a DID WG deliverable. It is not on the standards track, nor is it a WG Note, nor is it a registry. Thus, the strong demands of WG consensus on its contents do not apply. Consensus comes into play somewhat as it is drafted, but primarily when it is presented to the AC for its consideration.” <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1401199754">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1401199754</a></p>



<p>January 24, 2032 — Brent Zundel creates PR #29 offering an alternative to PR #27, excluding the offending language. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/29">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/29</a></p>



<p>March 13, 2023 — Christopher Allen raises Pull Request #30 proposing a DID Resolution WG charter. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/30#issue-1622126514">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/30#issue-1622126514</a></p>



<p>March 14, 2023 — Brent Zundel admits he never actually considered PR #30 “It was never my understanding that a DID Resolution WG would replace the DID WG. I do not support that course of action. If folks are interested in pursuing a DID Resolution WG Charter separate from the DID WG Charter, the place to do it is not here.” <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/30#pullrequestreview-1339576495">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/30#pullrequestreview-1339576495</a></p>



<p>March 15, 2023 – Brent Zundel merged in PR #27 over significant dissent “The DID WG chairs have met. We have concluded that merging PR #27 will produce a charter that best represents the consensus of the DID Working Group participants over the past year.” “The inclusion of DID Methods in the next chartered DID WG was part of the W3C Director’s decision to overturn the Formal Objections raised against the publication of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0. The chairs feel that that decision represents the consensus of the W3C and as such the inclusion of DID Methods as optional work in this charter is absolutely necessary.” <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1470920464">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1470920464</a></p>



<p>March 21, 2023 – Announcement of intention to Appeal Joe Andrieu joe@legreq.com <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1478595775">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1478595775</a></p>



<p>March 23, 2023 – Clarification from Philippe Le Hegaret<br>‘The “should” is NOT a “must”, otherwise it would say so explicitly in the Director’s decision. In other words, the Working Group is allowed to disagree with the direction set by the Director.’ Personal email from Philippe</p>



<p>March 30, 2023 – DID WG Charter extended. “The goal of this extension is to allow the group to propose its new charter [2], which the chairs consider reasonably stable now. ” xueyuan xueyuan@w3.org<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-did-wg/2023Mar/0000.html"> https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-did-wg/2023Mar/0000.html</a></p>



<p>April 12, 2023 — Appeal of Chair Decision filed <a href="https://blog.joeandrieu.com/2023/04/12/fighting-for-consensus-at-the-w3c/">https://blog.joeandrieu.com/2023/04/12/fighting-for-consensus-at-the-w3c/</a></p>



<p>June 12, 2023 — A new process document is adopted. Removes Director. Rather than the “Director, the W3C Council, which is composed of TAG+AB+CEO, will now hear and resolve formal objections.” “Merge Chair Decision Appeal, Group Decision Appeal, and Formal Objection; clarify what can be objected to.” <a href="https://www.w3.org/2023/Process-20230612">https://www.w3.org/2023/Process-20230612</a> </p>



<p>May 9-10, 2023 – Advisory Committee meeting in Sophia Antipolis. Joe Andrieu attended. Neither co-chair attended.</p>



<p>May 11, 2023 — Joe Andrieu reports success on conversations with prior formal objectors ‘There was exceptional support for focusing on resolution rather than DID methods as the route to interoperability. “That would go a long way to addressing our concerns” and “Yep, that seems like the better way to do it” and “That seems reasonable, but I need to think on it a bit more [before I say it resolves the issues of our FO].” I think it’s fair to say that a focus on resolution (without any DID methods) would likely avoid a FO from 2 out of 3 and, quite possibly all 3. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/issues/28#issuecomment-1543579206">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/issues/28#issuecomment-1543579206</a></p>

<p>July 26, 2023 — Philippe Le Hegaret dismisses appeal. “W3C team concurs there is no consensus” <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-did-wg/2023Jul/0000.html">https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-did-wg/2023Jul/0000.html</a></p>



<p>August 8, 2023 – Proposed DID WG Charter Call for Review “There is not consensus among the current working group participants as to whether the charter should permit work on the specification of DID methods. This charter proposal includes the option for the group to do that work if there is sufficient interest. This follows the director’s advice in the DID Core 1.0 Recommendation decision [3] to include the specification of DID methods in the future scope of the work.” <a href="https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/33280/did-wg-2023/">https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/33280/did-wg-2023/</a></p>



<p>August 8, 2023 – Brent Zundel asserts in W3C Credentials Community Group meeting that “In my experience, Formal Objections are noted and are usually overridden…” <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/meetings/2023-08-08/">https://w3c-ccg.github.io/meetings/2023-08-08/</a></p>



<p>No DID WG Meetings whatsoever after January of 2022.</p>



<p>These, I believe, are the relevant facts of the situation, covering the thread of this debate from its beginning through to today.</p>



 



<p>Why does it matter?</p>



<p>Because consensus is how the W3C delivers legitimate technical specifications.</p>



<p>Because the record clearly shows that the chairs never intended nor attempted to seek consensus and resolve objections to their initial proposal. In their defense, they argue consensus doesn’t apply, which if correct, would justify their behavior. However, we can’t see anything–neither in the member agreement nor in the process document–that constrain’s the requirement that chairs seek consensus to any particular activity.</p>



<p>We believe three points should prevail in this discussion:</p>



<p>First, we see the deference to the past director’s comments as completely outside the Process.</p>



<p>Second, regardless of intent or process, we believe that charter development for an existing working group MUST achieve consensus within that WG before advancing to AC Review.</p>



<p>Third, we see the chairs’ argument regarding the inapplicabilty of consensus to violate the fundamental point of the organization: consensuse-based collaboration.</p>



<p>Let’s look at each of these in terms of what it would take to deny these points.</p>



 



<p>For the first point, we could interpret the will of “The Director” in his response to the prior Formal Objections as a mandatory requirement.</p>



<p>As we asked formally in our appeal, it may well be that this outcome was always the intention of Staff. “Since the chairs are claiming a mandate from the Director as the justification for their decision, I am directly asking the Director if what is happening is, in fact, what the Director required.”</p>



<p>Staff answered this question by endorsing the Chairs’ decision, relying on the “Director’s comments” as justification. Staff and the chairs believe that it is appropriate for a past decision by the past Director to bind the future work of a Working Group.</p>



<p>I find this unreasonable and contrary to Process. Nowhere in any Process document does Staff or the Director get the right to mandate the work of working groups. Nor does the Process give Staff, Director or otherwise, the right to bind future work of WGs. </p>



<p>Even Phillippe Le Hegaret acknowledged that the Director’s comments did not require the group adopt that recommendation: “It’s a SHOULD not a MUST.” And yet, he claims that his decision to advance the current Charter “follows the director’s advice in the DID Core 1.0 Recommendation decision”.</p>



<p>Working Groups should be the sole determinant of the work that they perform. It is not Staff’s role to direct the technical work of the organization. It’s Staff’s role to support the technical work of the organization, by ensuring the smooth operation of Process.</p>



<p>We do not buy the argument that Ralph Swick, acting on behalf of the past Director in a decision made about a previous work item, appropriately justifies the willful denial of consensus represented by this charter.</p>



<p>The fact of the matter is that DID interoperability is a subtle challenge, not well understood by everyone evaluating the specifications. If we could have had a conversation with the Director–which I asked for multiple times–perhaps we could have cleared up the confusion and advanced a proposal that better resolves the objections of everyone who expressed concerns. But not only did that conversation not happen, it CANNOT happen because of the change in Process. We no longer have a Director. To bind the future work of the DID WG to misunderstandings of Ralph Swick, acting as the Director, is to force technical development to adhere to an untenable, unchallengeable mandate.</p>



<p>What we should have had is a healthy conversation with all of the stakeholders involved, including the six members of the WG who opposed the current charter as well as anyone other participants who cared to chime in. The chairs explicitly prevented this from happening by cancelling all working group meetings, failing to bring the matter to the groups attention through the mailing list, or otherwise attempting to arrange a discussion that could find a proposal with weaker objections as required by process.</p>



<p>Failing that, we should have had a W3C Council to review my appeal as per Section 5.5 and 5.6 of the current Process. That council may well have been able to find a proposal that addressed everyone’s concerns. That also did not happen. Rather than respond to my objection in a timely manner, staff advanced the non-consensual charter to AC review.</p>



<p>Finally, even if we accept that Ralph Swick, acting as the Director, in fact, officially represented the consensus of the W3C in the matter of the DID Core 1.0 specification (for the record, we do), the recommendation that resulted represents the formal W3C consensus at the time of the DID Core 1.0 specification, solely on the matter of its adoption as a Recommendation. It cannot represent the consensus of the W3C on the forced inclusion of unnamed DID Methods in the next DID WG Charter, because the organization has not engaged in seeking consensus on this matter yet. Not only did the chairs ignore their responsibility to seek consensus, Staff has as well.</p>



<p>I would like to think that every WG at the W3C would like to be able to set their own course based on the consensus of their own participants, rather than have it mandated by leadership.</p>



 



 



<p>For the second point, you could endorse that charter development is not subject to consensus, as argued by the Chairs.</p>



<p>The chairs claim that “This charter is not a DID WG deliverable. […] Thus, the strong demands of WG consensus on its contents do not apply.”</p>



<p>I find this untenable on two different grounds.</p>



<p>First, the Process does not restrict the commitment to consensus to just Working Group deliverables. The language is broad and unambiguous: “To promote consensus, the W3C process requires Chairs to ensure that groups consider all legitimate views and objections, and endeavor to resolve them, whether these views and objections are expressed by the active participants of the group or by others (e.g., another W3C group, a group in another organization, or the general public).”</p>



<p>The Process in fact, includes examples of seeking consensus that have nothing to do with formal deliverables.</p>



<p>Second, this interpretation would mean that, according to process, ANYONE could propose a new Working Group charter, with the same name and infrastructure as a current Working Group, WITHOUT seeking the consensus of the Working Group involved. All one needs is for Staff to support that effort. On their own initiative, Staff can simply hijack the work of a working group by recruiting chairs willing to propose a new charter without the input of the current group.</p>



<p>This is untenable. If a Working Group is still in existence, it should be a fundamental requirement that any charter proposals that continue that work achieve the consensus of the working group. Of course, if the WG is no longer operating, that’s a different situation. But in this case, the WG is still active. We even discussed the Charter in our meeting at TPAC where upon its first presentation no fewer than five participants objected to including DID Methods in scope.</p>



<p>Frankly, if a Charter proposal does not represent consensus of the group selected by staff to develop the charter… it should not advance to AC Review. Full stop.</p>



<p>That’s the whole point of charter development: for a small group of motivated individuals to figure out what they want to do together and propose that to the organization. If that small group can’t reach consensus, then they haven’t figured it out enough to advance it to AC Review. They should go back to the drawing board and revise the proposal until it achieves consensus. THEN, and only then, should it be proposed to Staff for consideration. When Staff receives a charter proposal that lacks consensus, it should reject it as a matter of course, having not met the fundamental requirements.</p>



 



 



<p>For the third point, you could accept the position that the chairs met their duty to seek consensus simply by asserting that there is no consensus.</p>



<p>This argument was raised by other W3C members (not the chairs or staff): the W3C has historically given broad remit to chairs to determine consensus, so whatever they do for “consensus” is, by definition, canon. This disposition is noted in the process itself “Chairs have substantial flexibility in how they obtain and assess consensus among their groups.” and “If questions or disagreements arise, the final determination of consensus remains with the chair.”</p>



<p>As the current discussion has shown, that latter statement is, as a matter of fact, incorrect. The chairs asserted a determination of consensus in this matter “PR #27 will produce a charter that best represents the consensus of the DID Working Group participants over the past year” which Staff judged inadequate: “There is not consensus among the current working group participants as to whether the charter should permit work on the specification of DID methods.” So, either the policy is in error because, in fact, the Staff is the ultimate determiner of consensus, or, Staff ignored process to impose their own determination.</p>



<p>However, even if Chairs have wide remit to determine consensus, the process unequivocally requires chairs to do two things:</p>



  ensure that groups consider all legitimate views and objections  endeavor to resolve [those objections]  



<p>In short, the chairs must actively engage with objectors to resolve their concerns.</p>



<p>The chairs did not do this.</p>



<p>First, they did not do any of the following suggestions in the process document about how to seek consensus:</p>



  Groups should favor proposals that create the weakest objections. This is preferred over proposals that are supported by a large majority but that cause strong objections from a few people. (5.2.2. Managing Dissent https://www.w3.org/2023/Process-20230612/#managing-dissent)  A group should only conduct a vote to resolve a substantive issue after the Chair has determined that all available means of reaching consensus through technical discussion and compromise have failed, and that a vote is necessary to break a deadlock. (5.2.3 Deciding by Vote) https://www.w3.org/2023/Process-20230612/#Votes  A group has formally addressed an issue when it has sent a public, substantive response to the reviewer who raised the issue. A substantive response is expected to include rationale for decisions (e.g., a technical explanation, a pointer to charter scope, or a pointer to a requirements document). The adequacy of a response is measured against what a W3C reviewer would generally consider to be technically sound. (5.3 Formally Addressing an Issue https://www.w3.org/2023/Process-20230612/#formal-address )  The group should reply to a reviewer’s initial comments in a timely manner. (5.3 Formally Addressing an Issue https://www.w3.org/2023/Process-20230612/#formal-address )  



<p>The record shows that chairs, rather than doing any of the above recommended actions for consensus, consistently avoided seeking consensus by dismissing concerns and merging PRs without actually seeking to address objectors’ concerns.</p>



<p>PR #20 still has no comments from either Chair. It was merged in over objections despite the working groups exceptionally consistent practice that unless there is consensus for a given change, PRs don’t get merged in.</p>



<p>In fact, controversial edits in this working group regularly receive a 7-day hold with, at minimum, a Github label of a pending action (to close or merge), and often an explicit mention in minutes of the meeting in which the change was discussed. PR #20 was merged by executive fiat, without adherence to the norms of the group and the requirements of process. If you feel charters don’t need consensus, maybe you’re ok with that. We’re not.</p>



<p>It’s clear that in the case of PR #20, Brent Zundel made an executive decision that was contrary to the groups established norms of requiring consensus before merging. Given that Brent never wavered in his commitment to the specific point of including DID Methods in scope as the “only option”, it’s clear that, at least on that point, he never intended to seek consensus.</p>



<p>In PR #27 Brent Zundel and Pierra-Antoine Champin (team contact) dismissed the concerns of objectors rather than “endeavoring to address” them.</p>



<p>Brent asserts that “flexibility in the charter does not require a group to perform any work” And “a future charter that doesn’t include possible DID Methods will be rejected” and “the strong demands of WG consensus on its contents do not apply.”</p>



<p>Pierre-Antoine asserts that “Considering the two points above, the chairs’ decision is in fact quite balanced.” and “But I consider (and I believe that others in the group do as well) that plainly ignoring this recommendation from the director amounts to painting a target on our back.”</p>



<p>Not once did Brent, Dan, or Pierre-Antoine acknowledge the merit of the concerns and attempt to find other means to address them.</p>



<p>PR #29 Remove mention of DID Methods from the charter was ostensibly created to seek input from the WG on the simplest alternative to #27. Unfortunately, not only did the chairs fail to make any comments on that PR, there remain four (4) outstanding change requests from TallTed, kdenhartog, Sakurann, and myself. This PR was never more than a distraction to appear magnanimous without any actual intention to discover a better proposal. If the chairs had been actually exploring PR #29 as a legitimate alternative to PR #27, they would have engaged in the conversation at a minimum, and at best, actually incorporated the suggested changes so the group could reasonably compare and discuss the merits of each approach.</p>



<p>PR #30 Charter for the DID Resolution WG was created in response to a request from TallTed, and initially supported by Brent Zundel, only to see him reverse course when he understood it was an alternative proposal to the DID WG Charter: “I do not support that course of action. … the place to [propose an alternative] is not here.”</p>



<p>Not once, at any time, did Brent, Pierre-Antoine, or Dan Burnett acknowledge the merit of our concerns. They did not ask objectors how else their concerns might be addressed. Not once did they attempt to address my (and others’) concerns about DID method over-centralization caused by putting DID Methods in scope.</p>



<p>Instead, they simply refused to engage objectors regarding their legitimate matters of concern. There were no new proposals from the chairs. There were no inquiries about the “real motivation” behind our objections in an effort to understand the technical arguments. There weren’t even rebuttals from leadership to the technical arguments made in opposition to DID Methods being in scope. It was clear from ALL of their correspondence that they simply expected that the rest of the WG would defer to their judgment because of the prior Director’s comments.</p>



<p>It is our opinion that in all their actions as chairs, WG Chairs MUST seek consensus, whether it is a WG deliverable, a charter, or any W3C matter. That’s the point of the W3C. If chairs can ignore process, what good is process? If staff can ignore the process, how are we to trust the integrity of the organization?</p>



<p>Finally, on the matter of the chairs and process, I find Brent Zundel’s assertion in the August presentation to the Credentials Community Group particularly problematic: “In my experience, Formal Objections are noted and are usually overridden”.</p>



<p>In other words, Brent believes that the Process, which describes in great detail what is to happen in response to a Formal Objection, doesn’t usually apply.</p>



<p>The fact is, he may end up being right. Given the improper dismissal of my appeal, the Process, in fact, does not appear to matter when it comes to the DID WG charter.</p>



 



 TECHNICAL FUNDAMENTALS 



<p>The primary technical objection to putting DID Methods in scope is simple conflict of interest. By empowering the DID WG to develop specific DID Methods, it would result in the group picking winners and losers among the 180+ DID Methods currently known. Not only would that give those methods an unfair advantage in the marketplace, it would affect WG deliberations in two important ways. First, the working group would, by necessity, need to learn those selected methods, placing a massive burden on participants, and elevating the techniques of that particular method to accepted canon–which will inevitably taint the DID Core specification with details based on those techniques. Second, this will require the group to evaluate, debate, and select one or a few of those 180+ methods, which will suck up the available time and energy of the working group, forcing them to work on “other people’s methods” rather than advancing the collective work that all DID Methods depend on. Those who want to pursue DID Methods at theW3C should propose their own charter based on a specific DID method.</p>



<p>Our second technical objection is more prosaic: there are no DID Methods ready for W3C standardization, as evidenced by the blank check in the current charter request. It may be within the bounds of the W3C process to authorize such an open ended deliverable, but we believe it is a fundamental problem that the chairs cannot even recommend a specific method for inclusion in the charter. Frankly, this weird hack of not specifying the method and restricting that work to First Public Working Draft (FPWD) status lacks integrity. If it is important for the group to develop a method, name it and make it fully standards track, without restriction. This middle-way is a false compromise that will satisfy no one.</p>



 INTEROPERABILITY GOALS  



<p>A significant failing of the initial DID Core specification was a failure to develop interoperability between DID Methods. This lack of interoperability was cited as a reason for multiple Formal Objections to that specification. We concur, it’s problem. </p>



<p>However, the problem was not a result of too many DID Methods, nor would it be resolved by forcing the standardization of one or more exemplars. It was a problem of scope. DID core was not allowed to pursue protocols and resolution was intentionally restricted to a mere “contract” rather than a full specification. </p>



<p>The result of those restrictions meant the WG could NOT achieve the kind of interoperability we are all seeking.</p>



<p>We believe the answer is simple: standardize DID Resolution. Not restricted to FPWD status, but actually create a normative global standard for DID Resolution as a W3C Recommendation.</p>



<p>By defining a common API that all DID Methods can implement to provide an interface for a back-end verifiable data registry, we allow any system that can support those implementations an equal opportunity to interoperate with any other, just like HTTP allows any browser to reach any website, regardless of the back-end technology that does the heavy lifting. </p>



<p>That’s how we get to interoperability.</p>



<p>Distracting the group with DID Method specifications would just limit the time and resources the DID WG can bring to bear on solving the real issue of interoperability between methods.</p>



<p>More technical and interoperability details are discussed in our <a href="https://blog.joeandrieu.com/2023/04/12/fighting-for-consensus-at-the-w3c/">appeal</a>.</p>



 RESPONDING TO CRITISMS  



<p>Finally, for those still reading, I’d like to address some criticisms that have been raised about my approach to this problem.</p>



<p>First, the assertion that this debate is going to end up in AC Review, so we should have it there and not in the WG.</p>



<p>The debate was not predestined to go to AC review. Like all objections under Process 2023, it should have been resolved in a council. Staff inappropriately accelerated the charter to AC Review despite an ongoing objection and requests by the objector to delay advancement until the matter could be resolved.</p>



<p>Second, the AC is not the appropriate place for a working group to work out its internal disagreements. The AC is the place where other member organizations have a chance to review and comment on proposed work done by the organization as a whole. This is a fundamental principle that, in other contexts, is known as federalism. It isn’t the job of the AC to tell every WG what to do. It’s the job of the AC to vet and confirm the work actually done by the WG. For staff and chairs to deny due process to my objection is, in fact, denying the ability for the AC to review the best proposal from the Working Group and instead requiring the AC to have a meaningless debate that will absolutely result in a council.</p>



<p>To reflect Philippe’s argument back, since the underlying objection is going to be decided in a council anyway, why didn’t we start there? Especially since that is what process requires.</p>



<p>Third, Philippe quoted the following Process section in his discussion of my appeal, despite ignoring the first part of the sentence.</p>



<blockquote><p>“When the Chair believes that the Group has duly considered the legitimate concerns of dissenters as far as is possible and reasonable, the group SHOULD move on.” [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>



<p>The group did NOT duly consider the legitimate concerns of objectors. Instead, the chairs intentionally avoiding any substantive discussion on the topic. There is no evidence at all that the chairs ever considered the legitimate concerns of objectors. They dismissed them, ignored them, and argued that the WG’s github is not the place to have this debate, the AC is.</p>



<p>So, because Staff and the chairs believed it was ultimately going to AC Review, they collectively decided to ignore their obligations: of Chairs to seek consensus within the WG and of Staff to seek consensus through a W3C Council after my appeal.</p>



<p>Finally, I’ll note that my disagreement has been described by one of the chairs as “Vociferous”, “Haranging”, and “Attacking”. I find this characterization to be inappropriate and itself a CEPC failure. “When conflicts arise, we are expected to resolve them maintaining that courtesy, respect, and dignity, even when emotions are heightened.”</p>



<p>The civil exercise of one’s right to challenge authority is fundamental to a free society and vital to any collaborative institution. To be attacked because I chose to engage in conversations that the chairs were trying to avoid, is inappropriate. To be attacked because I filed an appeal, as clearly allowed in the Process, is inappropriate. To attack those who disagree with you is neither collaborative, nor is it an effective mechanism to seek consensus.</p>



 SUMMARY 



<p>This charter never should have made it to the AC. It unfairly hijacks the DID WG name and its work, without the consent of the current DID WG. Worse, it does so in a way that fundamentally undermines the decentralized nature of Decentralized Identifiers. </p>



<p>This charter should be rejected and returned to the DID WG to find a proposal with weaker objections, one that represents the collective will of the working group and legitimately continues the work in which we all have invested our professional careers.</p>

As <a href="https://twitter.com/vibronet/status/1652088407445872640">Vittorio Bertocci wrote</a>, “One of the specs with the highest potential for (positive) impact in recent years.”  I couldn’t agree more!</p>
<p>The concise abstract says it all:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This document describes a mechanism for sender-constraining OAuth 2.0 tokens via a proof-of-possession mechanism on the application level. This mechanism allows for the detection of replay attacks with access and refresh tokens.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I described in my <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2278">2022 Identiverse presentation on DPoP</a> it’s been a Long and Winding Road to get here.  Efforts at providing practical proof of possession protection for tokens have included:</p>
 
 SAML 2.0 Holder-of-Key Assertion Profile – Not exactly OAuth 
 OAuth 1.0 used PoP – But message signing too complicated 
 OAuth 2.0 MAC draft – Used similarly complicated signing 
 OAuth 2.0 HTTP Signing draft – Abandoned due to complexity 
 TLS Token Binding – Some browsers declined to ship it 
 OAuth 2.0 Mutual TLS – Client certs notoriously difficult to use 
 OAuth 2.0 DPoP – Today’s RFC aimed at simply and practically solving this important problem 
 
<p>As they say, I think this one’s the one!  Implement, deploy, and enjoy!</p>

  I’ve had two different IETF specifications adopted by two different working groups in the last two days – a pleasant coincidence! Yesterday, the COSE “typ” (type) Header Parameter specification was adopted by the COSE working group.

<p>I’ve had two different IETF specifications adopted by two different working groups in the last two days – a pleasant coincidence!  Yesterday, the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-cose-typ-header-parameter-00.html">COSE “typ” (type) Header Parameter</a> specification was adopted by the COSE working group.  Today, the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-resource-metadata-00.html">OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata</a> specification was adopted by the OAuth working group.  Their journeys from individual drafts to working group drafts couldn’t have been more different!</p>
<p>As I was musing with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/phunt/">Phil Hunt</a>, who wrote the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-jones-oauth-resource-metadata-00">original individual draft of OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata</a> with me, I’m pretty sure that this is the longest time from writing an individual draft to it becoming a <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-resource-metadata-00.html">working group draft</a> in my experience:  August 3, 2016 to September 6, 2023 – seven years and a month!</p>
<p>Whereas, the time from the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-jones-cose-typ-header-parameter-00.html">individual draft of COSE “typ” (type) Header Parameter</a> to the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-cose-typ-header-parameter-00.html">first working group draft</a> was only three months:  July 8, 2023 to September 5, 2023.  Which got me thinking…  Is that the fastest progression I’ve had?</p>
<p>It turns out that my fastest time from individual draft to working group draft was for the JWK Thumbprint URI specification which I wrote with <a href="https://twitter.com/kristinayasuda">Kristina Yasuda</a>.  It went from <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-jones-oauth-jwk-thumbprint-uri-00.html">individual draft</a> to <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-jwk-thumbprint-uri-00.html">working group draft</a> in only two months:  November 24, 2021 to January 28, 2022.  (And it became <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9278.html">RFC 9278</a> on August 9, 2022 – less than nine months from start to finish, which I believe is also a personal record.)</p>
<p>Ironically, while OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata took over seven years from individual to working group drafts, a closely-related draft, OAuth 2.0 Discovery (which became <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8414.html">RFC 8414</a>) was previously my fastest from <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-jones-oauth-discovery-00.html">individual draft</a> to <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-discovery-00.html">working group draft</a>: 2.5 months!  (The journey to becoming an RFC took 2.5 years.)</p>
<p>The other relative speed demon was Proof-Of-Possession Semantics for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs): 3.5 months from <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-jones-oauth-proof-of-possession-00.html">individual draft</a> to <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-proof-of-possession-00.html">working group draft</a> and two years from start to <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7800.html">RFC 7800</a>.</p>
 
<p>What are my takeaways from all these musings about starting things?</p>
 
 Starting things is something to celebrate.  It’s a creative process to go from an idea to something concrete and useful.  But as my COSE co-chair <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivaylo-petrov-a0b17241/">Ivaylo Petrov</a> wrote, “We would also like to remind you that adoption does not mean a document is finished, only that it is an acceptable starting point.” 
 Perseverance is essential.  Progressing things can take dedication and persistence.  My most-referenced specification, <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html">JSON Web Token (JWT) – RFC 7519</a>, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/person/michael_b_jones@hotmail.com">referenced from 45 RFCs</a>, <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=1387">took 4.5 years</a>. 
 Focused specifications that do one thing well can progress quickly.  <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7800.html">Proof-Of-Possession Semantics for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) – RFC 7800</a> and <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9278.html">JWK Thumbprint URI – RFC 9278</a> are prime examples.  I’m hoping that <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-cose-typ-header-parameter-00.html">COSE “typ” (type) Header Parameter</a> will be one of these – a sentiment I shared with co-author <a href="https://twitter.com/OR13b">Orie Steele</a>. 
 Finishing things matters.  That speaks for itself, but it’s sometimes easier said than done.  Finished things get used!

<p>Well, this is a big one for the identity industry. Two stalwarts becoming one.</p>

<p>As someone who was there and in the thick of it during the last big merger of identity players, I wish all my (too many to tag) friends at ForgeRock and Ping Identity all the best, good luck, and a strong stomach. </p>



<p>Combining two product suites that have this much history and strength isn’t easy. There will be difficult decisions and even more difficult conversations ahead. The key is to have strong leadership with a clear vision for the future and a relentless commitment to helping your customers. Few would be up to that task, but Andre Durand is one of the few in this world who could.</p>



<p>Cheers to all of you, buckle up, and enjoy the ride!</p>

<p>This is the first of (I hope) numerous posts that I hope to write for tomi, where I’ll share my journey as the Project Manager for the first phase of specification writing for the tomiDAO. Actually, I wrote a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pVEuI6YgrWDYC4F0LIKwaehhGIlDbAT19N_GBiPK6V4/edit">summary of my Metafest experience</a> representing tomi, and I’ll have more to say about that later. But first, I want to start out with a quick introduction of why I’ve decided to devote my time to this project (other than that they’re paying me) and why you should join me (because they’ll pay you too, and I can’t do it&nbsp;alone).</p><p>For those of you who don’t know me, you might want to check out my work at <a href="http://www.daoleadership.com/">www.daoleadership.com</a> or my general everything website <a href="http://www.gracerachmany.com/">www.gracerachmany.com</a>. For those of you who do know me, you probably think of me as a contrarian who has been in the DAO space for half a decade, but I’ve never strongly associated myself with one project. So why has tomi captured so much of my time and attention?</p><p>I first came into contact with tomi when they were writing their whitepaper in September 2022. I knew nobody’s names, but from the outset it was clear that the team is serious about creating an alternative to the censored World Wide Web. But it was also obvious that most of them had no experience with public goods or the commons. Fortunately, around that time, they brought on DAOwl who explained to them that it would be impossible to expect a traditional DAO to set and enforce content moderation policies. “Hoo would want to look at the world’s most obscene content every day?” asked DAOwl. But that was just the start of the rabbit&nbsp;hole.</p> Who are these tomi people? (Spoiler, I don’t&nbsp;know.) <p>Every now and again, DAOwl would ask me about some particular part of DAO tooling. What did I think about JokeDAO for ranked voting? What did I think about copyright violations? The conversations were always interesting and insightful. But let’s face it, the tomiDAO itself is a simple yes/no voting mechanism for distributing a pot of tokens. I wasn’t impressed at all until <a href="https://twitter.com/DrNickA">Dr. Nick</a> said to me that this was one of the first DAOs he’d heard of with a working NFT voting implementation. “I’ve been talking about NFT voting for a while,” he said, “but this is the first time I’ve seen it working on a real project.” So it turns out the tomi team had pulled off something innovative after&nbsp;all.</p><p>Look, I’m a skeptic. I’ve been in the Web3 space for 5 years. Heck, I’ve been in tech for 35 years. It’s always a good bet that a project will fail, I say, because 98% of them&nbsp;do.</p><p>In January, the tomi team asked me to set up a panel for them to discuss the DAO. DAOwl says they refuses to show in person, so they asked me to moderate and bring in the panelists, and fortunately I got the wonderful Daniel Ospina from RnDAO, Esther Galfalvi from SingularityNET DAO, and Evin McMullen from Disco.xyz, and we had a fabulous time in Marrakesh, including an ATV tour and a hotel with a fabulous&nbsp;spa.</p><p>Most importantly, I finally got to meet the tomi team — and some of them even used real names! Apparently the video footage was great, but the videographer didn’t know it was illegal to fly a drone over the fancy hotel where the event was held, and now he and all the footage are in jail. You can’t make this stuff&nbsp;up!</p> Privacy is rapidly becoming&nbsp;illegal <p>Which brings us to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-charges-two-founders-sanctioned-virtual-currency-mixer-tornado-cash-with-2023-08-23/">Tornado Cash</a> and the way in which privacy is under attack by governments worldwide. If you join the tomi Discord or the tomiArmy, it might seem a bit sketchy. Like another one of those “wen moon projects”, but…</p><p>Boy, am I sick of open-source revolutionaries with no funds and no marketing and great code that nobody can use. How are underfunded projects like <a href="https://handshake.org/">Handshake</a> ever going to take off? They even call themselves an “experiment”. How are we going to have censorship resistance when <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/10/14/censored-ethereum-blocks-hit-the-51-threshold-over-the-past-24-hours/">most of the Ethereum nodes are hosted in countries that have made privacy illegal</a>? How are we going to have public goods when VCs own a big chunk of the&nbsp;project?</p><p>The tomi founders, apparently 8 of them, have put their money where their heart is. From what I could surmise from the amount of working code they’ve released, and from the first “Nakamoto Forum”, as they called their conference in Marrakesh, they are a bunch of successful crypto founders who have invested their own money (and a lot of it) to lift this project off the ground. When they launched the token, they simultaneously released the DAO, a testnet browser, an NFT collection, and hardware nodes. Since then, they’ve launched (and spun off) a privacy layer, a DNS NFT auction and marketplace, a marketing “army”, and a staking&nbsp;pool.</p><p>Another reason I was impressed with tomi is that they are committed to usability for everyone. The tomiNET is going to be accessible through a normal browser with normal URLs. It’s about time Web3 started to produce something that actually solves a problem for “normies”. So far, everything I’ve seen from tomi points to them making their interfaces intuitive and offering products that can be used without needing blockchain expertise. (Other than storing your private keys, and I expect MPC to solve that in the next&nbsp;year.)</p><p>The product team just seems to spew out product after product. Are these products ready for mainstream use? Not at all. Why are the founders putting in so much time and effort? Maybe they want to keep their money private. Or maybe they’ve made enough money that they figure it’s time to give back to the community. Maybe they are putting it in a DAO to avoid legal liability. Who&nbsp;knows?</p><p>Here’s what I do know. These guys are absolutely serious about building products and they are absolutely serious about empowering the community through the DAO. They just don’t know how. Neither do I, come to think of&nbsp;it.</p> Cold start <p>When tomi asked me to represent them at Metafest, I took up the challenge because, as I said, I think privacy is everyone’s right, and this is the first time I’ve seen such a comprehensive and well-funded project come together. I think that tomi is right that having a native cryptocurrency and governing DAO is necessary for the project’s success.</p><p>One of the main takeaways from Metafest was how hard it is to go from cold start (nobody) to a functioning DAO. The DAO is now made up of approximately 500 wallets of tomi Pioneers who purchased the initial NFTs granting them voting rights. In other words, they are the investors in the project, not the users. The tomi team is aware that this should change gradually over time — but they want experts and aligned people to join, which is why they invited me and why I’m inviting you, but it’s still hard. They probably need at least 5 different teams to run these DAOs, and theoretically, the teams should be made up of people all over the world who want an alternative WWW. But right now it’s you, me, and our friends. Meaning that a cold start DAO is not&nbsp;easy.</p> The tomi opportunity <p>When I accepted the challenge to approach the tomiDAO specifications documentation, there were two aspects that impressed me. First of all, they asked me to seek out multiple providers for the specifications. I’ll say more about that below, but in the end, they weren’t satisfied with any of the proposals, and they ended up <a href="https://dao.tomi.com/proposal/16">writing their own</a>, which combined elements from two existing proposals while also incorporating several of their own unique innovations. DAOwl said: no offense, I want to work with all the people who made proposals, but we will work on our terms until there is a solid and trusted team that can take over the&nbsp;project.</p><p>Even more promising, they recently approved the specification for a self-sovereign identity wallet integrated into their crypto wallet. The winner of the proposal, <a href="https://walt.id/">walt.id</a>, also wrote a <a href="https://dao.tomi.com/proposal/12">very impressive DAO proposal</a> and they are highly respected in the SSI industry. I didn’t know them before tomi, but their credentials checked out and it’s all open source, which I think is important. This shows me that the team has really gone down to the fundamentals of what has caused the WWW to become centralized and exploitative, and they are interested in integrating the essential components that give the project potential to actually transform the internet back into a place where people can have freedom of expression, including freedom to dissent and freedom to develop connections and commerce with anyone, anywhere.</p> Challenges for the DAO industry as a&nbsp;whole <p>Another exciting aspect of tomi is that they are grappling with specific instances of generalized problems. Everyone from X (formerly twitter), through Lens Protocol and Handshake, to ENS is dealing with the problems of naming and/or the problem of content moderation. DAO tooling is completely inadequate to touch any of these processes. And frankly, I’m frustrated with DAO solutions looking for problems. I want to start designing a solution based on a specific challenge, and tomi has plenty of&nbsp;them.</p><p>What tomi is trying to do is going to put them up against tremendous challenges. Some of them are straightforward, like the fact that the default language of tomi is English, but that’s probably not the default language of the people who are being oppressed and need an alternative internet. Other problems are more complex, such as preventing spam and denial of service attacks from rendering the network useless. Some are legal, for example, if tomi succeeds and its domain name system becomes the one everyone wants to use, they may open themselves up to lawsuits from everyone, from celebrities to corporations and governments.</p><p>But even if tomi doesn’t manage to complete its entire vision, the DAO tooling we can create together will resonate throughout Web3. DAOs for content moderation, DAOs for name services, DAOs for strategy-building, Verifiable Credentials and DIDs for DAOs, reputation for DAOS, accountability for fulfilling DAO proposals… All of these are part of tomi’s agenda for the next year’s planning.</p><p>And tomi has the budget to pull this off. The DAO is currently funded with an initial amount equivalent to $20 Million. According to what DAOwl told me, a portion of all the tomi domain name sales will continue to feed into the DAO. And it will be up to the DAO itself to create the business models on top of tomi that will allow it to be self-sustaining. Any one of the tools that I mentioned above could be implemented in dozens of DAOs today. So the suite of DAO tools could represent a comprehensive starter kit for just about any project. And best of all for me, I get the chance to demonstrate how communities can develop tools that are more collaborative and complex than simple yes-no and ranked&nbsp;voting.</p> Get on board: tomi needs&nbsp;you <p>One of the conditions I set for tomi was that, given the fact that there is a budget, we should not expect people to work for free and/or campaign to join. DAOwl said this was fine, but that they expect accountability for producing the work that is needed for the DAOs. Sometimes I think this is an emergent phenomenon: DAOs with limited funds waste a lot of time on meetings and give out little bounties that get distributed in a “nice” way where everyone gets something regardless of talent. In other words, many DAOs have been prioritizing inclusion over execution, partially because they can’t really afford highly professional work.</p><p>The first step that we’re taking is to create the DAO specifications. Together we <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a_EmXwsnQM0jQMaty72Ez3v316cqRKckVAIwEPhvX4o/edit">wrote this plan</a> and DAOwl and tomi’s CTO, Camel, have approved it. My goal is to include as many people as possible in the discussions, with those contributing significant time being compensated reasonably. In other words, if you are qualified, apply, and you’ll be paid for your work. This isn’t short-term either. Once the specifications are done, we need to actually staff these DAOs. It looks like there will be a dozen different processes and committees needed for the initial launch in May&nbsp;2024.</p><p>To get involved, join the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/tomi">tomi Discord</a> server and introduce yourself on the DAO channels. DAOwl and myself will be monitoring and welcoming people. Announcements will be made of the times and places of the discussions, and you’ll be able to join and participate in various&nbsp;ways.</p><p>Those of you who know me are aware that for the last 3 years I’ve been blathering on about how we are going to need a parallel network of passports, network infrastructure, and commerce because the authorities are becoming increasingly authoritarian worldwide. Although I’m mostly vegetarian, I wouldn’t want a world authority telling me I must be vegan and enforcing it through their CBDCs and supply chains. What tomi is providing can be an essential set of tools for those of us who want our freedom and are willing to pay the&nbsp;price.</p> How (not) to impress the tomi free&nbsp;birds <p>I’ve teamed up with my buddy <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/moritzbierling/">Moritz Bierling</a> to put together this project and we want you to join if you care about internet freedom or about the development of DAO&nbsp;tooling.</p><p>It’s a well-known secret that I spent a lot of years in fairly corporate environments and that I believe in some of the more structured ways of getting things done. So when tomi asked me to do this work, I said we should at least get three proposals and not just hire me because they know me. They said: ok, go ahead. But I&nbsp;failed.</p><p>I failed because most of the DAO experts are&nbsp;either:</p>  Super busy on multiple&nbsp;projects  More interested in promoting/integrating their technology than joining someone else’s&nbsp;projects  Inexperienced when it comes to presenting themselves to a&nbsp;client  More interested in having intellectual and cool conversations than getting stuff&nbsp;done  <p>DAOwl told me several people ghosted them, joined the Discord but didn’t follow the comments even when they were mentioned, promised to submit proposals and then disappeared, failed to invoice for work done, and needed multiple reminders of things they agreed to. In other words, they seemed to Owl to be discourteous (as if they were doing tomi a&nbsp;favour).</p><p>I won’t lie. I was embarrassed. I gave the names of several people I respected and I felt it reflected poorly on me when tomi didn’t get responses. Some people told me explicitly that they were uncomfortable with the tomi project and wouldn’t join because it seemed to “scammy”. I respect that, just as I respect the whole Gitcoin-Shell conversation. But I don’t respect it when my client is ignored, has to chase people down, or receives empty promises.</p><p>So if you do want to impress myself and DAOwl, please take a few simple&nbsp;steps:</p>  Do what you said you would do. If you say you’ll send a proposal or join the Discord channel, do&nbsp;it.  Be interested. If you write something on the Discord, check at least once to see what happened or answer&nbsp;DMs.  If you want to get paid for your work, take appropriate steps. Send a price proposal if appropriate. Make your payment terms known in advance. Send an invoice or at least an ETH address to the DAOwl or myself when you complete&nbsp;work.  Be proactive. For the DAO to function, we all need to take responsibility. If I have to remind people of what they promised and micromanage when people post to the Discord, it’s not a DAO. If you think we should be using Wonderverse or Jira or any of that, say so and be the one to initiate the project and ask to get paid for implementation.  Bring people in who need the work. Many of us are overwhelmed with work offers and sometimes we take it for granted. If this is not the project for you, or you don’t have the bandwidth, say so and find someone who does need the&nbsp;work.  Be courteous.  <p>Oh, and one more thing. If you can bring an equal number of men and women (or more women than men), that will be greatly appreciated. The specifications for the DAO discussions stipulate that all discussions require a minimum 40%&nbsp;women.</p> Let’s get decentralization right <p>We’ve all seen successful DAOs with multiple functioning sub-DAOs. The tomi project has the potential to provide infrastructure both for Web3 and for end users. My hope is that within 6 months there will be multiple project managers and team leads, and that this Medium blog will be filled with articles from the best of us discussing the solutions we’ve developed and the tradeoffs we’ve&nbsp;made.</p><p>So what are you waiting for? <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a_EmXwsnQM0jQMaty72Ez3v316cqRKckVAIwEPhvX4o/edit">Check out the plan</a>, and the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1OpYksmPAXGKSyvUmrQIzcaEdr3hQLif8v85_oKsUPwc/edit">Governance specifications workflow</a>, the next step is to <a href="https://discord.com/invite/tomi">introduce yourself on the tomi Discord channels</a>, under the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/983854078285201408/1144628687413723136">DAO channel</a> for introductions, and join us by helping us build a better World Wide&nbsp;Web.</p><p>See you&nbsp;there!</p><p>Follow us for the latest information:</p><p><a href="https://tomi.com/">Website</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/tomipioneers">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://discord.gg/tomi">Discord</a> | <a href="https://t.me/tomipioneers">Telegram Announcements</a> | <a href="https://t.me/tomi_official_chat">Telegram Chat</a> | <a href="https://tomipioneers.medium.com/">Medium</a> | <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tomipioneers/">Reddit</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tominetwork">TikTok</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/tomipioneers/why-i-took-on-the-tomi-challenge-and-you-should-too-dao-expert-opinion-bc60bc505bb7">Why I took on the tomi challenge and you should too: DAO expert opinion</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/tomipioneers">tomipioneers</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

I gambled with low phone power and lost when choosing talk to the bus driver instead of Greyhound's help hotline. With hindsight, since I called home before booking the Hilton explaining that I was afraid of the cold night and for my safety, I did have the phone power for both actions with Greyhound. Due to this and following experiences, I now own a backup battery charger. Also, I now prefer to fly due to less expensive tickets, zero cost cancellation fees, and generally better customer service. Yay to Southwest (although I'll sometimes mix it up). To Greyhound's credit though, I did get an updated ticket the next day with no penalty and for the same price as paid in July, 5 months before. <br><br>This might be Santa Barbara, CA<br><br>Perhaps this is a cactus at an Arizona rest stop in the higher desert a little while after leaving Phoenix, AZ?<br><br> In late February of 2023, I went to <a href="https://www.ethdenver.com/">EthDenver</a>. I really wasn't feeling like going after feeling financial strain, but Derrek the Community Steward gave me the encouragement to come. I do confess that I do spend money on : (1) travelling a lot looking for opportunity because I get a feeling of not fitting in and feel I am missing out, (2) buying a fair amount of electronics on AliExpress (and sometimes from HAM Radio people) trying to educate myself after wanting but not obtaining an electronics education earlier and within a comfortable budget. I probably should work more but I tend to be more productive and keep it together mentally when I pursue projects that I want to see in the world, rather than work with those who may not share my long term goals, interests, or beliefs.<br>Anyway, I ended up applying for the EthDenver Scholarship and the Antalpha Hackerhouse and was ultimately being accepted for both. I chose the Hackerhouse and it was generally a great experience except for being so far from the EthDenver venues that it would be hundreds of dollars in transportation fees if a car was not available. The quality of the people selected at the house was excellent as were the speakers. I got to meet Kostas Kryptos who worked on Meta's (formerly Facebook) Libra project as the lead cryptographer. I was lucky to have brought David Wong's book on Real World Cryptography because it brought joy to him (<a href="https://twitter.com/kostascrypto/status/1629722559783780352">https://twitter.com/kostascrypto/status/1629722559783780352</a>). There also were several other luminaries in the Zero Knowledge Space at the Hackerhouse.

This was probably close to the time when I had a mental breakdown and received the unexpected comfort of one the house organizers. They told me, if I recall, that I just have to accept things and move forward and sometimes that means that things don't work out. They loved all my links about decentralized identity and my hardware work and were impressed that I completed a Masters in Chemical Engineering. I hadn't been that productive during my stay at the hackerhouse. I messed up on the first night of the hackathon. I stayed out too late trying to mend a relationship with someone who I had worked with previously at EthDenver and by chance ran into in the registration line and who helped me through it and made the mistake of going to a party on the way back that some from the hackerhouse, but not the core people who formed the team I missed out on, were at. The person I was trying to mend a relationship with chose to abandon me by the next morning because I mentioned in a text that morning that that I had talked about our project idea, even in the vaguest of forms I thought because I knew they were sensitive, to another hacker in the space and they were afraid of having their ideas stolen and were not open to working with others besides me. The next morning was too late as the team had materialized with one person arriving late at night just as I was finishing entertaining them. Ultimately this led me to project to others that I had already found a team and miss out on working as an official team member with the four member team that formed the first night. This of course did not hit home for me till the following morning. Like the game of musical chairs, I ended being the odd guy out and worked and struggled as a one member team. I also had some belief in my mind that some in the hackerhouse would 
rather work with some people smarter or more talented or something else, but it turned out they would have had me on their team and we sustained a healthy relationship. I could have traveled into the EthDenver hackerbase, but I chose instead to be beside Jason and EZKL. I tried running a model on ezkl and hastily trying to learn machine learning. Late in the game I gained a team member when another showed up, and some attempt was made. It turns out the model I was trying wouldn't have worked at the time? The later <a href="https://github.com/zkonduit/ezkl/discussions/164#discussioncomment-5886750">fix</a>. Ahh, hackathons.

If it wasn't for the unexpected generosity of a friend, I probably would have decided it wasn't worth the risk to go. While there I got to meet the highly accomplished Brooklyn Zelenka whom I had interacted with months earlier on Twitter with the arrangement of Boris Mann. (comment: It turns out I had previously been at a techlahoma event, was it a mixer called OKCTech++?, where I ran into Lawrence Kincheloe ,a guy I first met at OhmSpace hackerspace in the later months of 2011, who asked a pertinent question about the Blinky Project, "What happens if you lose network connectivity?". This question unexpectedly led me to learn about UCANs which are object based access control tokens that require no network connectivity (<a href="https://ucan.xyz/">https://ucan.xyz/</a>). Too much untamed complexity, and I suppose delirum, has delayed me from trying UCANs with Blinky, but I can say now that the data payload may be too cumbersome for my hardware.) I like Fission's (<a href="https://fission.codes/">https://fission.codes/</a>) work (<a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg">IPVM</a> et al.), friendly just be yourself discord community, and high quality <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/c/events/distsys/79">Distributed Systems reading group</a> (and <a href="https://lu.ma/distributed-systems">https://lu.ma/distributed-systems</a>).

It was lengthend by the desire to grow and learn and perhaps lack of motivation to return to Oklahoma. There were three main chapters in the trip.

The workshop's name was Let Me Think (<a href="https://let-me-think.org/">https://let-me-think.org/</a>) and it was geared at imagining and establishing new academic institutions.<br><br>The first chapter of my journey led me to spend a few nights in Denver.<br>  <br>This is a picture I took as I was leaving the co-working space utilized by the cryptorado community. It was the day after I had attended another meeting with the cryptorado community at a craft brewery. I was attracted to the community as a possible place to locate due to my positive experiences with the EthDenver community in 2022 and 2023. There definitely seemed to be a strong community where terms like verifiable credentials were accepted as common parlance. I felt positive about meeting this community. I liked that I could hop on the Cryptorado discord and receive feedback from people like NukeManDan as well as get welcomed online for the solidity deep dive sessions (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@colinnielsen2158">https://www.youtube.com/@colinnielsen2158</a>) through Cryptorado meetups.&nbsp; John Paller, who wasn't there, and co-founded EthDenver had encouraged me online to practice meditation in order to achieve more success in life and deal with anxiety.<br>  <br>After leaving the co-working space, I joined someone I met at the space at an art exhibition in the RiNO neighrborhood.

It could help if I was a commercial builder and traveled to all of the identity events). Maybe it could be special kinds of verifiable credentials that help with connecting trusted parties for peer production. Since these verifiable credentials might be irregular, like <a href="http://adistributedeconomy.blogspot.com/2012/03/knowledge-discovery-with-semantic-web.html">http://adistributedeconomy.blogspot.com/2012/03/knowledge-discovery-with-semantic-web.html</a> mapping techniques mentioned in Benjamin Braatz paper might help. I also would like to finish the Blinky Project and apply it as a Sensorica project as Tibi suggested. Lastly, I cannot forget the laser and shift register projects with Arduino. These might lead to some pretty epic visualizations that could be synchronized to music, or rather driven by the sound itself!<br><br>If you'd like to help, feel free to reach out or donate. I think for IIW alone, I need to pull in between $400 to $800. If Sam came, this could be more. A couch to crash on would be worth at least $200. Alternatively, or in addition, I could try busking.

 The kind organizations will&nbsp;require. <p>The current Verifiable Credentials (VCs) data model <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/WD-verifiable-claims-data-model-20170803/">originated in 2017</a>, when it was called “Verifiable Claims”. There have been many sustaining innovations since that time but none disruptive¹ until now, for a new field of application for VCs: Organizational Identity&nbsp;(OI).</p><p>In <a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/the-dawn-of-decentralized-organizational-identity-part-2-organizational-credentials-d8baf5fd9114">The Dawn of Organizational Identity, Part 2: Credentials</a>, Stephan Wolf, GLEIF’s CEO and the piece’s co-author, and I introduced what we consider to be second-generation VCs. We made the case why they’re ideally suited for Organizational Credentials (OCs), and why they’re required for many, if not most, of the use cases for organizations.</p><p>That argument is reproduced here, along with a few additions and modifications, as second-generation VCs represent an important advancement in verifiable credentials generally, separate from and in addition to their importance for OI and&nbsp;OCs.</p> Second-Generation Verifiable Credentials <p>First-generation VCs, like the current VC JSON-LD standard at W3C or the emerging JWT standard at IETF, were developed with utility for individuals in mind, for proving things like identity, age, and academic credentials. They were and are a major breakthrough in digital identity, they’re what make ‘self-sovereign identity’ actually self-sovereign and ‘decentralized identity’ actually decentralized, by giving individuals a high degree of digital autonomy for the first&nbsp;time.</p><p>Second-generation VCs were developed with organizational use cases in mind, with all the capabilities of first-generation credentials plus sophisticated new capabilities that individuals don’t often need but organizations typically do, such as key rotation and recovery, delegability, multi-signature (“multi-sig”), contractually protected disclosure, freedom from blockchain/‘ledger lock’, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>These new organizational capabilities are made possible by a form of VCs called “Authentic Chained Data Containers” (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ssmith-acdc-02.html">ACDCs</a>), with signing and verification using an open key management protocol that replaces the need for blockchain or vulnerable web-based security: Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/ietf-keri">KERI</a>). These two decentralizing protocols together — ACDCs for VCs and KERI for signing — deliver significant advances for VCs, the kind that organizations require and that justify the ‘second-generation’ moniker.</p><p>Here are seven highlights:</p><p>1. Extraordinary advances in security:</p>  Recovery from private key compromise (suspected or actual) without reissuance of previously signed&nbsp;items*  Key rotation without re-issuance of previously signed&nbsp;items*  No reliance on web&nbsp;security  Privacy-respecting verifiable revocation  Non-repudiable signing with&nbsp;logging  Post-quantum proof*  Natively supports weighted ‘m-of-n’ multi-sig schemes with fractionally weighted thresholds (e.g., 2-of-3’, or 1-of-3 when the 1 has sufficient ‘weight’, etc.)  <p>2. No reliance on blockchain (and its limitations: “ledger-lock”/centralization, scalability, cost, complexity, interoperability, performance, privacy, security, etc.)</p><p>3. Use of existing cloud infrastructure and&nbsp;APIs</p><p>4. Multi-level issuance with chaining and delegation (anyone having authority can delegate and extend a chain of authority, rather than all delegates returning to the ‘mother ship’ for single-level, single-signer issuance)</p><p>5. Extraordinary advances in privacy with graduated disclosure (granular, legally enforceable privacy and disclosure capabilities, covered in greater detail later in this article):</p>  Selective disclosure (with or without Zero Knowledge Proofs)*  <a href="https://iang.org/papers/ricardian_contract.html">Ricardian Contract</a> capabilities through contractually protected disclosure (counterparties verifiably consent to terms of disclosure prior to disclosure)  Contingent disclosure (i.e., escrowed)  <p>6. Interoperable with anything using the same underlying protocols (without sharing blockchains, vendors, registries, databases, etc.)</p><p>7. Simpler; technically lighter-weight (not verbose, compared to first-gen VCs)</p><p>*Individuals need these,&nbsp;too.</p> Security First,&nbsp;Always <p>With second-generation VCs, security comes first, always, no exceptions. The security advances with second-generation VCs are stunning when you consider that key recovery and rotation are still the Achilles Heel not only of first generation VCs, but also of blockchain and existing web infrastructure generally. Second-generation VCs using KERI don’t just fix <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/VC_Enhancement_Strategy.md">security flaws for VCs</a> (especially web-based VCs), they’re a significant advance in digital security, period.</p> Come on In, the Water’s&nbsp;Warm <p>There are no significant technical reasons we are aware of not to advance to second-generation VCs — no notable trade-offs other than familiarity and switching costs from legacy systems. In fact, the complexity of blockchain-based first-generation VCs may be at least an order of magnitude greater than the more elegant, advanced, and blockchain-less second-generation VCs.</p><p>That said, some will reasonably argue that a second-generation of VCs that doesn’t directly and fully interoperate with first-generation VCs — which is true — is a step backward rather than forward. However, we feel that achieving interoperability of VCs that are insecure, reliant on blockchain or web infrastructure, and not stress tested in production at scale is a hollow victory and premature; it is not meaningful interoperability. Security — in the form of proper key management — must come first, it cannot be bolted onto the current VC model just like it cannot be bolted onto the internet after the fact. There is no way around&nbsp;this.</p><p>However, the good news is, with second-generation VCs we can have all the robust security capabilities described above plus <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/SPAC_Message.md">advances in privacy</a> simply not possible with first-generation VCs, and gain real, global, fully decentralized interoperability that only standardized non-platform-based protocols can deliver. Even then, serious work on interoperability should be undertaken only after some use cases have made it into production and demonstrated that all these things work well, at scale. Otherwise that would be premature interoperability, too.</p> The Unprecedented Power of Organizational Credentials (OCs) Using Second-Generation VCs <p>Some of the dreamy use cases for OCs [listed in <a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/the-dawn-of-decentralized-organizational-identity-part-2-organizational-credentials-d8baf5fd9114">Part 2</a>] are already possible, you say…&nbsp;but:</p>  Unlike most current identity technologies, including numerous high-profile implementations of first-gen VCs, OCs require no surveillance-enabling, privacy-killing ‘phone home’ to an intermediary for verification, do not rely on DNS/web security, and do not use shared ledgers/blockchains; OCs sacrifice neither security nor&nbsp;privacy.  OCs can convey the full provenance and details of authority — unlimited levels — in-band with strong verification, proving not only the authority of the representative, but the full chain of authority and where it originated.  OCs are B2C, helping prevent phishing by proving to customers and constituents that the company or government representative they’re interacting with really represents whom they claim to represent.  OCs are C2B, enabling customers and constituents to prove their identity, status, and entitlements to the businesses and governments they’re aligned with when they call in, log in, or walk&nbsp;in.  OCs can prove provenance not only back to the top of an organization, but to GLEIF (described in <a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/the-dawn-of-decentralized-organizational-identity-part-1-identifiers-ffb9091fd47a">Part 1</a>) and/or to any other chained root of trust such as a city, state, nation, or group of&nbsp;nations.  OCs can also make verifiable any other analog identifiers in addition to or instead of the LEI. For example, a national ID, regional ID, local ID, employee ID, and any other identifiers could become cryptographically verifiable with OCs (provided their inclusion is governed by rules and safeguards similar to GLEIF’s <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework">Ecosystem Governance Framework</a>, see <a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/the-dawn-of-decentralized-organizational-identity-part-2-organizational-credentials-d8baf5fd9114">Part 2</a> for&nbsp;more).  <p>When an authorized representative of an organization delegates some authority to a person or a thing, whether an employee, director, contractor, partner, customer, constituent, device or piece of software — no matter how many levels deep in the organization — OCs enable that person or thing to prove it digitally, instantly, securely, and globally. OCs are a game-changer.</p> Proof of Delegated Authority <p>It’s one thing to have authority, quite another to prove it. OCs enable global verification of a representative’s delegated authority — through unlimited levels of delegation — using a powerful capability of second-generation VCs: chaining.</p><p>Chaining enables multiple levels of signatures for the same credential, and also for authority to be conveyed from signature to signature and/or credential to credential, enabling the very last link in the chain of delegated authority to be as strongly provable as the&nbsp;first.</p><p>A janitor can prove his authority with a cryptographic chain of delegated authority in the OC he carries. When verified by someone (or something) he’s presented his OC to, the chain might look like&nbsp;this:</p>  the janitor got his authority to do X and Y&nbsp;from  the facilities manager, whose authority came&nbsp;from  the regional manager, whose authority came&nbsp;from  the vice president, whose authority came&nbsp;from  the president/COO, whose authority came&nbsp;from  the CEO, who was issued a vLEI credential* by  the Qualified vLEI Issuer (QVI)* that vetted the organization, who was qualified by  the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF), a global root of trust for legal entity identification.  <p>* Described in Part&nbsp;2.</p><p>The authority for the janitor begins with the CEO of the organization, originating from a special root-level OC that he/she holds, and not with GLEIF or its QVI. A CEO credential received from a QVI is not a delegation of authority; it is a digitally signed, non-repudiable attestation that the holder of that credential really is the CEO, issued by an accredited QVI or other reputable issuer after a rigorous vetting process. What the CEO does with the credential from thereon has nothing to do with the fact that an external entity asserts that he/she really is the CEO, and has digitally signed that assertion so that it’s verifiable anywhere.</p> OCs, Privacy, and Self-Sovereignty  Personal Privacy and Graduated Disclosure <p>With OCs the personal privacy of the holder — a representative of the organization — is of less relevance when that representative is an employee or contractor and they are acting within that context; the organization gets to decide what that representative should be disclosing or keeping private, which they can do quite powerfully with Graduated Disclosure as described below. When an OC holder is a customer or constituent, however, personal privacy becomes critically and legally important, magnifying the need for robust selective disclosure capabilities.</p><p>As with all ACDC VCs, OCs have three granular, legally enforceable “Graduated Disclosure” capabilities highly relevant to and needed by organizations:</p><p>Selective disclosure — the ability to provably disclose only some information without disclosing the rest, such as one’s authority but not their name, or their name but not their authority, or only one aspect of their authority such as their financial ceiling for signing purchase orders. This capability does not use Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) by default, but can take advantage of ZKPs when&nbsp;desired.</p><p>Contractually protected disclosure — when counterparties verifiably consent to the terms of disclosure prior to disclosure. The provided consent is non-repudiable, providing a path for recourse if the terms of disclosure are not&nbsp;honored.</p><p>Contingent disclosure — disclosure is possible only when certain conditions are met, such as keeping an identity encrypted and in a form of escrow for business purposes and interactions, but enabling that identity to be discoverable by law enforcement or regulators if it becomes necessary. Contingent disclosure solves tricky problems in telecommunications, for example, when the originator of a communication may not wish to be identifiable to network operators, but must become identifiable to authorities if their traffic turns out to be fraudulent or&nbsp;spam.</p> Self-Sovereignty <p>When employees or contractors are acting in representation of an organization, the org is sovereign and not the individual; there is no self-sovereignty in this situation. There is autonomy, as the person can choose to behave however they please regardless of rules or expectations, but not self-sovereignty. Like privacy, however, the principle changes when the representative is a customer or constituent; then the sovereignty of the OC’s holder becomes relevant. Still, the customer’s or constituent’s OC was issued by the organization and can be revoked at the organization’s discretion.</p> About Blockchain… <p>Blockchain, from a data standpoint, results from implementing a centralizing protocol, as it inescapably results in a single, master set of data that all counterparties must agree to (unlike TCP/IP, HTTP, etc.). While a blockchain’s data is physically replicated across many physical locations, the only semi-decentralized aspect of blockchain is its governance, but only when that governance is permissionless, and even then it is questionable². Every aspect of permissioned blockchains is centralized, putting all data into a single logical ledger and governance into the hands of a chosen few. The point here is, blockchains in all their flavors are platforms, not protocols, and always result in data centralization, the opposite of what’s needed for globally verifiable OCs.</p><p>(Learn more about the centralizing aspects of platforms and decentralizing aspects of protocols in the seminal essay “<a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech">Protocols, Not Platforms</a>”, by Mike Masnick.)</p> In Conclusion <p>For those who’ve been involved with Verifiable Credentials since their official beginning in 2017, and even before that as Timothy has, the idea that a particular new flavor of VCs calls itself “second generation” would seem presumptuous, as there are several competing data models, each with their own adherents and arguments, each feeling that their favored flavor is superior to the others for one reason or&nbsp;another.</p><p>In this piece we’ve made detailed arguments as to why ACDCs are at a new, generational level compared to all other existing VC data models, and we invite reasoned arguments to the contrary.</p><p>¹ See Harvard Business Review’s <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/12/what-is-disruptive-innovation">What is Disruptive Innovation?</a></p><p>² See <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/crypto-isnt-decentralized-nft-bored-ape-yacht-club-buys-cryptopunks-2022-3">Crypto isn’t decentralized</a>, <a href="https://engineeringideas.substack.com/p/blockchain-is-not-decentralised">Blockchain is not decentralized</a>, and <a href="https://qz.com/2112965/web3-is-not-decentralized">Web3 is not decentralized</a></p>

This blog post shares some insights on how we secure DevRev APIs (north/south traffic) at the edge, and the service-to-service interactions (east/west traffic).</p><p>The DevRev platform is designed to scale up to 1 million dev organizations, and 1 billion rev users. At the time of this writing the DevRev APIs cater closer to 1 million API requests on daily basis even at the very early stage of the product. In terms of API performance, we emphasize that all the APIs should operate with a very low latency. With this in mind, we wanted our security design to bring in only the valid, legitimate traffic into the DevRev platform. Anything that does not look right, we reject at the&nbsp;edge.</p><p>At the edge, we use Fastly Next-Gen WAF (powered by Signal Sciences) to monitor for suspicious and anomalous API traffic and protect in real-time, against attacks directed at our public APIs and the origin servers. Once the requests pass through the WAF, we use Fastly Compute@Edge to validate each&nbsp;request.</p><p>Fastly provides us with the capability to execute our code at the edge through a WebAssembly module. We’ve developed an edge gateway in Rust, which compiles into a WebAssembly module. This Rust code is responsible for rejecting any API requests lacking a valid JWT. JWT verification is just one of the tasks we perform at the edge. The edge gateway responsibilities also encompass cache management, reporting API statistics to Google BigQuery, sending logs to Datadog, enforcing captcha, URL rewriting, CORS management, API allow-listing based on various parameters, and proxying traffic to secure S3 endpoints, among others. Furthermore, we are in the process of introducing coarse-grained authorization at the edge. This additional measure will assist in filtering only legitimate traffic to DevRev services. The entire Rust code executing at the edge takes no longer than 5 ms to complete its&nbsp;tasks.</p><p>Fastly Compute@Edge serves as the entry point at the edge for DevRev services. At the origin, an API gateway intercepts all incoming traffic. The responsibilities of this API gateway go far beyond the functionalities typically found in open source or commercial API gateways. In fact, it functions as both an API gateway and an integrator, developed in-house at DevRev. Throughout the remainder of this blog, we will refer to it as the DevRev&nbsp;gateway.</p><p>As a second level of defense, we perform JWT verification at the origin using the DevRev gateway, even though it is redundant. Ideally, we should not receive any 401 errors from the origin, and we actively monitor this using Datadog alerts. The verification of a JWT takes less than 2ms at the origin. Additionally, we have implemented a token-based authentication mechanism between the Fastly edge and the DevRev gateway. This, coupled with IP allowlisting, ensures that no request can bypass the Fastly edge to reach the DevRev&nbsp;gateway.</p><p>The JWT carries the identity of the API user. An API user can be one of the following types:</p>  An Auth0 user. We utilize Auth0 as the trusted Identity Provider for the DevRev platform. Auth0 authenticates users through methods such as OTP over email, social connections, and enterprise connections. To access the DevRev web app or mobile app, users must first authenticate via Auth0. Auth0 assigns a distinctive identification to each user known as the Auth0 user ID. This ID is formed by combining the connection name with the immutable identifier specific to the user within the associated connection.  A Dev user: A Dev user is a member of a Dev organization within the DevRev platform. All Dev users are Auth0 users; however, the reverse is not necessarily true. The DevRev web app and mobile app invoke APIs on behalf of Dev users, or the Dev users themselves can directly invoke DevRev&nbsp;APIs.  A Rev user: A Rev user is a customer of a Dev organization and has the authorization to access specific DevRev APIs. In most cases, the DevRev main app doesn’t actively authenticate Rev users; instead, it relies on the corresponding Dev organization for authentication. Based on a trust relationship with the Dev organization, Rev users are granted access to DevRev APIs. However, the DevRev support portal permits Rev users to log in directly. In an upcoming blog post, we will delve into the details of building this trust relationship and explain how we authenticate Rev users at both the edge and the&nbsp;origin.  A service account: A service account represents an application that communicates with the DevRev APIs. For instance, when you integrate the DevRev PLuG widget into your web app or use the PLuG mobile SDK in your mobile app, the PLuG functions as a service account. A service account can access DevRev APIs independently or on behalf of a Dev user or a Rev&nbsp;user.  <p>The DevRev gateway at the origin serves as the entry point to the DevRev microservices backend. Once it verifies the JWT accompanying the API request, the gateway dispatches the request to the appropriate service. All services are developed in Golang and communicate with each other using&nbsp;gRPC.</p><p>The gateway and all other services are deployed within a Kubernetes cluster. Each service operates within its own namespace and is deployed behind an envoy proxy. When a service spins up, it is provisioned with a key by Istio, which also manages key rotation. These keys are subsequently utilized by each service for mTLS authentication between services. The same applies to the&nbsp;gateway.</p><p>mTLS is good enough to identify a service, but it has its own challenges as well. We’ve built a service-to-service authentication mechanism that combines mTLS with JWT due to the following reasons.</p>  Flexibility and decoupling: JWT can be used in scenarios where you need more flexibility and decoupling between services. It allows you to issue tokens that can carry various claims and information about the user or entity. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to provide fine-grained access control or share specific user attributes between services.  Statelessness: JWT is a stateless authentication mechanism, meaning the server doesn’t need to store token-related information. This can be advantageous when scalability and performance are crucial, as the server doesn’t need to maintain session-related data.  Cross-Domain Communication: JWT can be used for cross-domain communication between different services. Since JWTs are self-contained and can carry service-related information, they can facilitate communication between services without requiring direct interaction or shared session&nbsp;state.  <p>When a service spins up within the DevRev platform, it talks to the STS (Security Token Service) deployed in the same Kubernetes cluster. Through mTLS authentication, the service requests a JWT. This particular JWT is referred to as the Application Access Token (AAT). The AAT’s subject is a system-generated identifier linked to the Kubernetes service name of the corresponding service making the AAT request. In simpler terms, an AAT is accompanied by a corresponding service account, and the AAT’s subject is the identifier of that service account, which we call a service account&nbsp;DON.</p><p>The URI field within the X509 certificate corresponding to each service (or workload), issued by Istio contains the SPIFFE ID linked to that specific service. When the STS issues a JWT for a service that authenticates with the STS through mTLS, it appends the same SPIFFE ID found in the incoming X509 certificate as a claim to the JWT it creates and subsequently shares with the service. This process effectively binds the JWT to the corresponding service identity connected to the mTLS connection.</p><p>Each microservice is linked to a predefined service account, and a particular service has the ability to establish its own access control policies for these service accounts. For instance, the Janus service might permit read operations from the gateway service account, while the codex service could enable the gateway service account to impersonate a specific group of Rev&nbsp;users.</p><p>At the end of the day, every service is provisioned with a JWT, which it utilizes to access upstream microservices. These JWTs are of short duration, and as they approach expiration, the corresponding service is required to communicate with the STS once more to obtain a fresh&nbsp;JWT.</p><p>One fundamental best practice when generating a JWT is to define a restrictive audience. For instance, referring back to the service-to-service authentication using JWT discussed in the preceding section, the token generated by the STS for the gateway’s communication with the Janus service should specifically carry ‘janus’ as the audience value. Consequently, the Janus service cannot utilize the same JWT received from the gateway to communicate with the STS. This is because the token’s audience is ‘janus’, while the STS anticipates a token with an audience value of&nbsp;‘sts’.</p><p>One drawback of this model is that it would lead to more frequent interactions between the STS and other services, resulting in increased communication overhead. Furthermore, each service would be required to manage distinct tokens for every upstream service it engages with. While we opted not to adopt this model with different audience values, we were still unwilling to take the risk of one service employing a token from another service to access an upstream service, essentially impersonating the original&nbsp;service.</p><p>Binding the JWT to the SPIFFE ID associated with the X509 certificate of a particular service proves beneficial in this context. Every upstream service not only verifies the JWT received from the downstream service but also confirms whether it is tied to the SPIFFE ID related to the underlying mTLS connection. This mechanism ensures that the Janus service cannot utilize the JWT acquired from the gateway to gain access to the STS as if it were the&nbsp;gateway.</p><p>Alongside the service context, the interactions between services also include the user context. The gateway forwards the JWT it receives from the client to the upstream services when necessary. This JWT carries the user context. In the current model, these client JWTs might originate from two different issuers: Auth0 and the STS. However, as we move forward, our goal is for all services to exclusively trust STS-issued tokens. This implies that clients will need to exchange the token they receive from Auth0 for an STS-issued token before gaining access to DevRev&nbsp;APIs.</p><p>Why would the client need to exchange the Auth0 token for an STS token, and why shouldn’t the gateway handle this conversion in the background, passing the STS-issued token to the upstream services? However, this approach would result in more frequent interactions between the gateway and the STS, requiring token exchange for each request. Such an approach introduces unnecessary overhead.</p><p>A given service possessing the JWT containing the user context will not have unrestricted access to any arbitrary service using that JWT. We enforce stringent access control policies at each service, ensuring that incoming requests are processed only after evaluating not only the user context but also the corresponding service&nbsp;context.</p><p>A token that has been previously issued to a client or user, whether by Auth0 or the STS, can be revoked for two reasons. The associated user or the organization to which the user belongs may no longer be part of the DevRev platform, or the user themselves or an admin of the organization could explicitly revoke a specific&nbsp;token.</p><p>To address the former, the DevRev gateway verifies the active status of a user or organization within the platform after each token validation. In order to reduce unnecessary service calls and database queries, the gateway maintains a cache of recognized users.</p><p>To explicitly revoke a token, the client can make use of the revoke API provided by the STS. After a token is revoked, the STS includes the metadata related to the revoked token in a cache accessible to the gateway for reading. The gateway then rejects any tokens corresponding to the token metadata found within the revoked token cache. We are currently working on making this list of revoked tokens available to the Fastly edge gateway, which will then reject any requests carrying a revoked token at the edge&nbsp;itself.</p><p>In this blog post, we provided a high-level overview of how we secure both north/south and east/west traffic at DevRev. In future blog posts, we will delve deeper into the key aspects of the DevRev microservices security&nbsp;design.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/securing-north-south-and-east-west-traffic-devrev-2004b4397950">Securing north/south and east/west traffic @ DevRev</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Past practices included techniques like virtual private networks (VPNs) that tried to emulate the idea of an intranet where trusted computers and people were protected from hackers by a firewall that "kept the bad stuff out." As more and more work has gone remote and personal devices like phones, tablets, and even laptops are being used for work, a firewall—virtual or physical—offers less and less protection. Often the bad actors are hard to tell apart from your employees, partners, and customers.</p><p>Zero Trust operates on a simple yet powerful principle: "assume breach." In a world where network boundaries are increasingly porous and cyber threats are more evasive than ever, the Zero Trust model centers around the notion that no one, whether internal or external, should be inherently trusted. This approach mandates continuous verification, strict access controls, and micro-segmentation, ensuring that every user and device proves their legitimacy before gaining access to sensitive resources. If we assume breach, then the only strategy that can protect the corporate network, infrastructure, applications, and people is to authorize every access.</p> Defense in Depth <p>Zero Trust solutions offer a multifaceted defense against the evolving threat landscape, encompassing various aspects of network security, infrastructure protection, user authentication, and application security. These solutions collectively work together to uphold the "never trust, always verify" principle. Here are some of the different kinds of Zero Trust solutions that safeguard networks, infrastructure, people, and applications from malicious actors:</p>  <p>Network Security:</p>  <p>Micro-Segmentation: Dividing the network into smaller segments to limit lateral movement of threats and control access between different segments.</p>  <p>Software-Defined Perimeter (SDP): Creating an invisible perimeter around resources, allowing authorized users and devices to connect while remaining invisible to unauthorized entities.</p>    <p>Infrastructure Protection:</p>  <p>Identity and Access Management (IAM): Implementing strong identity verification and access controls to ensure that only authenticated users can access critical resources.</p>  <p>Endpoint Security: Employing solutions that monitor and secure devices (endpoints) to prevent malware infiltration and unauthorized access.</p>    <p>User Authentication:</p>  <p>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Requiring users to provide multiple forms of verification (e.g., password, fingerprint, OTP) before granting access.</p>  <p>Risk-Based Authentication: Assessing user behavior and context to dynamically adjust authentication requirements based on potential risks.</p>    <p>Application Security:</p>  <p>Application Whitelisting: Allowing only approved applications to run, preventing the execution of unauthorized or malicious software.</p>  <p>Application-Centric Authorization and Security: Implementing application-specific authorization policies and implementing security measures directly within applications, such as encryption, code signing, and runtime protection.</p>    <p>These Zero Trust practices collectively work to defend corporate assets in depth and implement a security architecture that assumes breach and enforces rigorous access controls. This not only reduces the attack surface, but also minimizes potential damage. By safeguarding networks, infrastructure, people, and applications, organizations can better defend against the increasingly sophisticated tactics employed by malicious actors in the digital realm. A comprehensive Zero Trust approach ensures that security is embedded at every layer, providing a robust defense against cyber threats.</p> Implementing Zero Trust <p>Some of the components of a zero trust strategy can be bought. For example, network equipment vendors offer products that make it easier to implement micro segmentation or define a perimeter. You can buy IAM solutions that make it easier to up your authentication game to simultaneously reduce phishing and the burden on your employees, partners, and customers (hint: <a href="https://www.passkeys.io/">use passkeys</a>). You can buy a endpoint security clients for devices that make it easier to manage corporate devices and to know the security posture of both corporate and personal devices. Authorization platforms like <a href="https://www.cedarpolicy.com/en">Cedar</a> are available to control access to your infrastructure and applications.</p><p><a href="https://www.technometria.com/p/zero-trust?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share">Share</a></p><p>While vendors provide ready-made solutions for many aspects of Zero Trust, you'll still need to tailor these solutions to your organization's unique needs and integrate them into a coherent strategy. Here's breakdown of the things you need to do on your own (i.e., you can't buy these):</p>  <p>Policy Development:</p>  <p>Access Policies: You'll need to design access policies that define who can access what resources and under what circumstances.</p>  <p>Authentication Policies: Developing policies for user authentication, device verification, and authorization.</p>  <p>Organizational Policies: The organization must define how it governs the various aspects of Zero Trust and the underlying identity infrastructure.</p>    <p>Identity and Access Management (IAM):</p>  <p>Identity Management Infrastructure: Building a user identity repository, user directories, and user profiles.</p>  <p>Access Control Logic: Developing the logic that enforces access controls based on user roles and permissions.</p>    <p>Custom Integrations:</p>  <p>Integration with Existing Systems: If you have legacy systems, you might need to develop custom integrations to ensure they adhere to the Zero Trust model.</p>    <p>Training and Awareness:</p>  <p>Security Awareness Programs: Creating training materials and programs to educate employees and stakeholders about Zero Trust principles and best practices.</p>    <p>Continuous Monitoring and Analysis:</p>  <p>Threat Detection Logic: Developing mechanisms to continuously monitor network traffic, endpoints, and applications for suspicious activities.</p>    <p>The Zero Trust components in the preceding list require internal expertise and a deep understanding of your organization's structure and workflows. You might need to change how your organization does authentication, develop a process for installing and maintaining device clients, perform numerous integrations, create authorization policies as well as organizational policies, build threat dashboards, and institute a training program. You can get help doing this, but ultimately it's up to you.</p><p>Zero Trust represents a big change for many organizations. Implementing a Zero Trust strategy involves not just changing the architecture of your network, infrastructure, and applications, but your organizational culture as well. In a hyper-connected digital landscape marked by relentless cyber threats and evolving attack vectors, the Zero Trust model is the best defense available. By challenging the conventional "trust but verify" approach, Zero Trust asks organizations to embrace an "assume breach" mindset, demanding continuous vigilance to authorize every access.</p>   <p>Photo Credit: <a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/shut-gate-open-message-security-2644555/">Open Gate</a> from aitoff (Pixabay License)</p>

 World ID&nbsp;Critique  OpenID Connect Implementation Antipatterns <p>On July 24th, Worldcoin <a href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/worldcoin-project-launches">publicly launched</a> World ID, and many friends and colleagues pinged me to get my opinion. I was attending <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/117/agenda">IETF 117</a> and this past weekend I finally had time to start exploring the service now that it has launched. There has been TONS of coverage on the orb, the biometrics, and the coin. I’m going to review their OpenID Connect implementation.</p><blockquote>This evaluation was made on August 7, 2023 using a production deployment of the Hellō app on Worldcoin; Worldcoin’s <a href="https://docs.worldcoin.org/reference/sign-in">Sign in with Worldcoin Reference</a>; and their <a href="https://docs.worldcoin.org/further-reading/oidc">OIDC Explainer</a>.</blockquote><blockquote>Update August 9: On August 8, I provided a draft of this document to Worldcoin prior to publication. They have addressed a number of issues as noted&nbsp;below.</blockquote> Tl;dr:   If you are a developer considering adding World ID to your project.&nbsp;Wait.  If you see an app using World ID. Be&nbsp;safe.  The <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics">OAuth Best Security Current Practices</a> have not been followed. Combined with the following point, applications using World ID may be vulnerable to&nbsp;attacks.  The implementation is not compliant with the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html">OpenID Connect</a> specification. Times are in milliseconds instead of seconds, requests can be made without required parameters. Update Aug 9, these have been addressed.  The user’s privacy is being violated. The authorization page presents no information on what the application is requesting, nor on what worldcoin.org is releasing. There are no application terms of service and privacy policy&nbsp;links.   OpenID Connect Background <p>OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a popular identity protocol used by social login services such as Apple, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft. There are libraries in all popular programming languages, and plug-ins for all popular platforms.</p><p>The typical user experience with OpenID Connect starts with clicking on a button in the app, and then redirecting you to your provider — Apple, Google etc. If you don’t have an active session, you are prompted to login to your provider. If you have not used the app where you started, you will be shown what will be shared, and prompted if you want to continue. If you continue, you will be redirected back to the app sharing your information. There are a few variants on what is sent back and forth between the app and your provider, but the end result is usually an ID Token that is digitally signed by the provider. The contents of the token indicate who issued it, which user it is for, when it was issued, when it expires, which app requested it, and handshake data to ensure the token is for the user that started the&nbsp;flow.</p><p>OpenID Connect is built on top of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749">OAuth 2.0</a>, the most popular authorization protocol on the internet. (I happen to have led the initial design, and am listed as the editor.) These protocols have been around for over a decade and have had significant security analysis and improvements including in the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/oauth/about/">IETF OAuth meetings</a>, the <a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID Foundation</a>, and <a href="https://oauth.net/workshop/">OAuth Security Workshop</a>. There are 28 published <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/oauth/documents/">IETF RFCs</a> and <a href="https://openid.net/developers/specs/">12 OpenID Connect specifications</a>.</p><p>Worldcoin launched with support for OpenID Connect, significantly lowering the barrier for developer adoption, and building on the decade of security and deployment experience. (My startup, <a href="https://hello.coop/">Hellō</a> chose to support OpenID Connect for the same reasons.)</p><p>There are two significant documents that have been under development for a couple of years: the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics/">OAuth 2.0 Best Security Practices</a>; and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1/">OAuth 2.1</a>. The latter does not introduce any new features, but compiles a dozen documents into a single coherent document that removes conflicting information.</p><p>Unfortunately it does not look like Worldcoin consulted them.</p> Adding World ID to&nbsp;Hellō <p>I have integrated all the popular OpenID Connect providers into <a href="https://hello.coop/">Hellō</a> (Apple, Facebook, GitLab, Google, Line, Microsoft, Twitch, Yahoo) and OAuth 2.0 providers (Discord, GitHub, Instagram, Mastodon, Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter, and WordPress). We also support Metamask, WalletConnect, and passkeys. Our code deals with how each of the providers is their own “special snowflake”, so I thought adding World ID would be straightforward, and we would have access to the unique “human” claim Worldcoin promised.</p> Signing up for World&nbsp;ID <p>To access the Developer Portal, you need a World ID which requires you to install the World App. I installed it on my iPhone, verified my phone number, and was then prompted to create a password. The app then crashed. Oops! After restarting, the app displayed “Creating World ID” and a counter that indicated it was going to take some time. I set my phone aside and when I checked it later it had crashed again. I restarted the app, was shown the passport-like display, and then once again displayed “Creating World ID”. As you can see from the screen grabs, some time passed between the initial install screen and the other screen shots included below. Eventually the World App was happy and I had a World&nbsp;ID.</p><blockquote>A password? It’s 2023. Why not support passkeys? All modern iOS and Android devices support it. I understand the desire to support older and less expensive devices, but it makes no sense to not support stronger, phishing resistant authentication when available. Passwords just increase the attack&nbsp;surface.</blockquote><blockquote>Face ID Opt in? The World App by default is able to log into a site without further authentication. There is no PIN or Face ID when you open the World App, or use it to log into another app. IE, if your phone is unlocked, someone can use it to login to a website just by scanning the QR code. If you poke around in the settings, you can enable Face ID, but I was not prompted to turn it&nbsp;on.</blockquote> World ID Developer Portal <p>To access the developer portal, you must log in with your World ID. The website shows a QR code that you scan with the World App on your phone. The process is smooth, and you see a logo verified mark beside Worldcoin Developer Portal giving me confidence I’m logging into the correct app with my World&nbsp;ID.</p> Developer Experience <p>If you are not a developer, you may be tempted to skip this section. Don’t. There is not much to it, and that is where the issues&nbsp;start.</p><p>After logging into the developer portal, I was prompted to enter and then verify my email address. Creating an app was straightforward. (Almost as straightforward as at the <a href="https://console.hello.coop">Hellō Console</a>&nbsp;;)</p><p>The initial delight of the simple experience disappeared when I realized key configuration was missing. There was no mechanism to upload a logo. No terms of service or privacy policy urls. No verification process so my app would show up verified like the Worldcoin Developer Portal.</p> register API <p>The Sign In Reference documents a <a href="https://docs.worldcoin.org/reference/sign-in#register-app:~:text=Copied!-,Register%20App,a%20new%20application%20for%20use%20with%20Sign%20In%20with%20World%20ID.,-Required%20attributes">Register App API</a>, an alternative to registering through the&nbsp;portal.</p><p>The one required parameter is “redirect_uris”, which is mislabelled as a string, despite the example showing it as an array of strings. The description:</p><blockquote>URLs the user will be redirected to after authentication. Must be HTTPS, and can always be updated in the Developer Portal.</blockquote><p>… is strange, as there is no authentication with the API, so how would Worldcoin know which application I can&nbsp;update?</p><p>The example curl code that you can copy to run yourself:</p> curl -X POST https://id.worldcoin.org/register \<br>    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \<br>    -d '{<br>        "client_name": "Example Application",<br>        "logo_uri": "https://app.example.com/logo.svg",<br>        "redirect_uris": ["https://app.example.com/callback", "https://app.example.com/redirect"],<br>        "application_type": "web",<br>        "grant_types": "authorization_code",<br>        "response_types": "code"<br>    }' <p>… shows an SVG file being provided as the logo. Wow. No providers allow SVG files due to the XSS security risks of an attacker embedding malicious JS in the image, which would then be loaded on id.worldcoin.org if the SVG was not run through a sophisticated filter.</p><blockquote>Worldcoin responded to this concern on Aug&nbsp;9:</blockquote><blockquote>Worldcoin developer portal is not vulnerable for the following reasons:</blockquote><blockquote>- The Worldcoin developer portal has a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) that prevents external images like a malicious SVG from loading entirely.</blockquote><blockquote>- The Worldcoin developer portal uses &lt;img&gt; tags to embed logo_url content, which prevents embedded scripts inside SVGs from executing.</blockquote><blockquote>- Additionally, apps must currently be manually verified to display logos, which has the added benefit of preventing impersonation scams.</blockquote><blockquote>UPDATE Aug 12: the example shows using a&nbsp;.png instead of a&nbsp;.svg file. The API provides the same error&nbsp;though.</blockquote><p>Unfortunately I was not able to test this (or fortunately given all the security risks of an anonymous registration API?) the API was not working. I tried a number of parameter permutations, but the server would always would return an HTTP 500 response code&nbsp;and:</p> {<br>  "code": "server_error",<br>  "message": "Internal server error. Please try again."<br>}  World ID Login Experience <p>With a configured app, I could now check out the World ID user experience on my own app. (See below for how I did this without writing&nbsp;code.)</p><p>Starting the flow in a browser looks similar to the login flow for the developer portal. Looking more carefully, it looks exactly the same. There is no indication that I am logging into my app vs the Worldcoin Developer Portal.</p><p>In the World App, the flow looks similar with the exception that Hellō is not a verified app. The only signals of which app is being logged into are the letter “H” as the logo, and “Hellō” as the app name. Note there is no terms or service or privacy policy links for Hellō anywhere, and no indication of what is being shared with&nbsp;Hellō.</p> Platform Detection <p>While resizing my browser window to access the developer tools, I noticed the web interface naively just looks at the window width to decide if it is on a mobile device. Pity the poor user trying to use their World ID on a web app where the browser window is&nbsp;narrow.</p> Developer Portal Session&nbsp;Length <p>I went back to the developer portal a day later, and my session was still active. I would have expected it to time out after an hour of inactivity at most. Sure, I should have logged out, but an attacker could take over a sloppy developer’s app.</p> Protocol Exploration <p>Ok, we are going to start to get a little more technical. If you have a some idea of how the web works, you should be able to follow&nbsp;along.</p><p>Given the nature of OpenID Connect, you don’t need to write any code to explore what a provider will do. You can open up a URL with the right parameters to make an authorization request, and then use the browser’s developer tools to see what was sent back. This is all I did in my exploration.</p><p>I started off with a simple and incomplete request to see what errors I got. (new lines are for readability)</p> https://id.worldcoin.org/authorize<br>  ?client_id=app_404ea2eb1e2d5155c05c3b2878ca1ade<br>  &amp;response_type=id_token<br>  &amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwallet.hello.coop%2Foauth%2Fresponse%2Fworldcoin <p>To my surprise, this worked. I got back the following JSON in the ID&nbsp;Token.</p> {<br>  "header": {<br>    "alg":"RS256",  <br>    "typ":"JWT",<br>    "kid":"jwk_dad75cf7c4bc159276c2c748a196b11d"<br>  }, <br>  "payload": {<br>    "iss":"https://id.worldcoin.org",<br>    "sub":"0x233c7136721dd85256e936a6a0b5a67b0f904bed6d1ce91d6d7364e9064f9cc2",<br>    "jti":"7fcd4fb6-63c4-4019-9ed2-43b14af657e0",<br>    "iat":1691444766901,<br>    "exp":1691448366901,<br>    "aud":"app_404ea2eb1e2d5155c05c3b2878ca1ade",<br>    "scope":"",<br>    "https://id.worldcoin.org/beta": {<br>      "likely_human":"weak",<br>      "credential_type":"phone"<br>    },<br>    "nonce":"1691444748611"<br>  }<br>} <p>Why was I surprised? I should have gotten an error response.</p><p>The “scope” parameter is required per OpenID Connect, and must contain the “openid” scope to differentiate between an OpenID Connect request and an OAuth 2.0&nbsp;request.</p><blockquote>UPDATE: Aug 9<br>An error is now returned if the “openid” scope is not&nbsp;provided</blockquote><p>Either a “nonce” or a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636">PKCE</a> “code_challenge” should be required per security best practices to prevent replay attacks per OAuth Security Best Practices. As this is an implicit flow, it would have to be a&nbsp;“nonce”.</p><blockquote>UPDATE: Aug 9<br>An error is now returned if a “nonce” is not provided<br>UPDATE: Aug 12<br>I only checked the “id_token” request type. Reading the docs I noticed they state the nonce is only required for the “id_token” request type, not the “code” request type. That is not spec compliant. It is required for the code request type as well since it is required to be in the “id_token” you get back when exchanging the code at the token endpoint.</blockquote><blockquote>UPDATE: Aug 12<br>I had only been testing the “id_token” response type. The “code” response type does NOT return a “nonce” in the ID token even if one is provided in the authorization request. IE, there is no way to check that the “id_token” you received is associated with the session that started the flow. While an attacker can inject a “code” and have you receive back a different ID Token. This is not a huge risk though since if you are validating the ID Token, it will fail since there is no&nbsp;“nonce”!</blockquote><p>Looking at the ID Token, I was even more surprised. The “iat” (issued at) and “exp” (expiry) claims are in milliseconds instead of seconds. Most validation libraries will consider the ID Token to be valid as it was issued in the far future. This online parser thinks the token was issued at November 10, 55569, over 53,000 years from&nbsp;now.</p><blockquote>UPDATE: Aug 9<br>This has been fixed. “iat” and “exp” are now in&nbsp;seconds</blockquote><p>Despite not providing a “nonce” in the request, I got back one with the value of “1691444748611”, a millisecond time stamp that is 18290 ms prior to when the ID Token was issued (1691444766901). A nonce should be a random value, so clearly there is some logic failure here as there should not be a “nonce” in the token as one was not provided.</p><p>My last surprise in the ID Token was the “https://id.worldcoin.org/beta" claim:</p> "https://id.worldcoin.org/beta": {<br>    "likely_human":"weak",<br>    "credential_type":"phone"<br> } <p>As a user, I had not been informed that this data was going to be shared. As a developer, I had not asked for it. I consider this a privacy&nbsp;issue.</p><p>Next I tried sending a valid request. The valid scopes are not documented, but poking around at the examples I saw that “openid”, “email”, and “profile” were being used. Here is what I sent next, that includes a “nonce” and “scope” parameters:</p> https://id.worldcoin.org/authorize<br>  ?client_id=app_404ea2eb1e2d5155c05c3b2878ca1ade<br>  &amp;response_type=id_token<br>  &amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwallet.hello.coop%2Foauth%2Fresponse%2Fworldcoin<br>  &amp;nonce=nonce1<br>  &amp;scope=openid+email+profile <p>And I received the following JSON back in the ID&nbsp;Token:</p> {<br>   "header": {<br>      "alg":"RS256",<br>      "typ":"JWT",<br>      "kid":"jwk_dad75cf7c4bc159276c2c748a196b11d"<br>  }, <br>  "payload": {<br>      "iss":"https://id.worldcoin.org",<br>      "sub":"0x233c7136721dd85256e936a6a0b5a67b0f904bed6d1ce91d6d7364e9064f9cc2",<br>      "jti":"bc24c584-e061-4c62-aaa1-c85cbb38579e",<br>      "iat":1691443980673,<br>      "exp":1691447580673,<br>      "aud":"app_404ea2eb1e2d5155c05c3b2878ca1ade",<br>      "scope":"openid email profile",<br>      "https://id.worldcoin.org/beta":{<br>        "likely_human":"weak",<br>        "credential_type":"phone"<br>      },<br>      "nonce":"nonce1",<br>      "email":"0x233c7136721dd85256e936a6a0b5a67b0f904bed6d1ce91d6d7364e9064f9cc2@id.worldcoin.org",<br>      "name":"World ID User",<br>      "given_name":"World ID",<br>      "family_name":"User"<br>  }<br>} <p>We got back the “nonce” value we sent. The “email”, “name”, “given_name”, “family_name” claims are not useful. Based on the documentation, it looks like they included them because some library complained.</p> Directed Identifiers <p>Next up was checking what was different in ID Tokens between different applications. I was hoping to confirm a different identifier, specifically the “sub”, would be different for me across applications per the <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2022/05/10/laws-of-identity/#:~:text=4.%20Directed%20Identity">4th Law of Identity</a>.</p><p>My app was&nbsp;given:</p> "sub":"0x233c7136721dd85256e936a6a0b5a67b0f904bed6d1ce91d6d7364e9064f9cc2" <p>… and the developer portal was given a different identifier, which is what we&nbsp;want:</p> "sub":"0x29a6e7c076c0922e146e96c92b5d4c8833818cc89166f483903a731d2e757253" <p>… and the second production app I setup was given yet another identifier:</p> "sub":"0x2d20b5094a2e2f8be4542f40e7eca9b701b4763877cc4fede42dfa6ea756a31c" <p>The latter is going to be a problem for developers as they want to know it is the same user across apps. Many large providers that only allowed one app per developer have kludged together mechanisms for developers to get this common identifier. Wanting the same user identifiers across each of developer’s app will motivate them to use the same “client_id” and “client_secret” across apps, dissolving the separation of concerns.</p> Access Token <p>The next thing I explored was setting “response_type” to “token” instead of an “id_token”. This provides an access token that can be used to call the user_info endpoint, and potentially any other API exposed by the provider.</p><p>First of all, this should not have worked in an implicit flow where the “token” is returned as a redirect parameter. It is now in the browser history and available to any malicious code with access. (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics#name-access-token-in-browser-his">Security BCP&nbsp;4.3.2</a>)</p><p>The bigger issue is that the access token is an ID Token. There was no difference in the token format in conflict with <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8725.html">RFC 8752</a> section 3.11 and 3.12, conflating authorization with authentication.</p> response_mode <p>The default mechanism to return the results from an authorization request is to include them as query parameters. This has the downside of sensitive parameters such as tokens being captured in server logs that save the URL being requested, and potentially exposes the parameters to unencrypted wireless networks.</p><p>The “fragment” response mode returns the results in the URL fragment, which is not sent to the server by the browser. This allows a web app to access the results. The “form_post” mode passes the parameters to the server as a form post rather than as query parameters, keeping the parameters out of the server logs of the page&nbsp;request.</p><p>I tried getting results by passing the “response_mode” parameter set to both “fragment” and “form_post”. Unfortunately, Worldcoin ignores the “response_mode” parameter. All results are returned as query parameters.</p> Documentation Concerns <p>Developers depend on a provider’s documentation to guide them. Unfortunately, the Worldcoin documentation is lacking, leading to developer frustration, or worse, vulnerable applications.</p><p>The only explanation for how to start the OpenID Connect flow is in <a href="https://docs.worldcoin.org/further-reading/oidc">Further Reading | OIDC Explainer</a>, not where a developer would start. The Quickstart tells developers to following the Auth0 Integration.</p><blockquote>I’m surprised the Auth0 integration would work given the non-standard ID Token “iss” and “iat” claims — but perhaps it only uses a token flow? — I have not investigated.</blockquote> nonce <p>The OIDC Explainer casually mentions the “nonce”, does not say it is required (it should be), and provides no explanation what the developer should do to confirm the ID Token they have received is linked to the authorization request they started, which is one of the purposes of the&nbsp;”nonce”.</p> scope <p>No mention of the “scope” parameter, which is required. No list of valid scopes is provided. I figured out the “openid”, “email”, and “profile” scopes by looking at examples. While “openid” is required, the “profile” scope return generic information, the “email” claim is just the “sub” claim prepended to “@id.worldcoin.org”.</p><blockquote>UPDATE Aug 12: <br>The documentation has been updated to include the “scope” parameter and shows “openid%20profile%20email”, so one can more easily guess what scopes are allowed. The docs say that the default scope is “openid”, but it is now required to be spec compliant. The “nonce” parameter is now stated as required when using id_token response type, although best practice is for there to be a nonce in the id_token returned for “code” response types as well. The docs are moving in the right direction!</blockquote> Closing Thoughts <p>Given the <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/worldcoin">$125M raised</a> and the involvement of Sam Altman of Y Combinator and OpenAI fame, I had expected a robust OpenID implementation that would have lowered the bar for developers to adopt World ID and inspired innovation.</p><p>This disregard for following the standard and published best security practices is alarming. Not informing a user about what is being released about them displays a disregard for user privacy. A step backwards for the identity industry.</p>

 An open solicitation for high-volume wallet&nbsp;projects <p>If you have, work with, or are aware of a digital personal wallet project capable of onboarding and supporting hundreds of millions of individuals in a short period of time, we’d like to speak with&nbsp;you.</p><p>Digital Trust Ventures (DTV) has launched a startup, currently in stealth mode, that will generate up to hundreds of millions of wallet holders sometime around the middle of 2024. This startup will not provide personal wallet services, and instead will rely on partners to satisfy the near-instant strong demand that will be generated upon launch. We are seeking two partners to be part of this launch, who will offer competing wallets that are fully interoperable with each other and with the DTV startup’s KERI-based tooling.</p><p>A personal wallet partner&nbsp;must:</p>  Be capable of scaling to hundreds of millions of users in a short period of time (from 1 to 30&nbsp;days)  Provide appropriate self-service and other support for all&nbsp;users  Support KERI and&nbsp;ACDCs  Be thin/keys-at-the-edge, with ACDCs managed through hosted cloud&nbsp;agents  Support all ACDCs, regardless of project participation  Support simple messaging  Have an excellent, simple&nbsp;UI/UX  Be ready to go by Summer&nbsp;2024  <p>The wallet must support freemium pricing; a strong monetization model for the personal wallet along with other details of the project will be shared under NDA with qualified prospective partners.</p><p>In exchange for providing all of this, the partner will enjoy global recognition on a stage with no equal, and the chance to quickly onboard hundreds of millions of users. We are looking for strong, established companies with clear capabilities to handle a project this large, not startups.</p><p>If you are involved with or know of a project that has these capabilities, please get in touch to learn more by sending an email to <a href="mailto:wallets@digitaltrust.vc">wallets@digitaltrust.vc</a>.</p>

<p>We’ve spent decades building up systems that identify people and devices, and interconnect all of them. We’ve built systems that let us define and control accounts, assign access rights, and associate trust within and across boundaries. But today’s mobile, cloud, and distributed systems are complex beasts that defy the assumptions many of our architectures bring to the&nbsp;table.</p><p>Maybe it’s time to rethink what accounts and federation even mean. And for that, I’ve been thinking lately about&nbsp;bubbles.</p> Bubbles <p>A bubble is an interesting physical construct. A thin boundary that surrounds its contents. What’s part of the bubble is separated from what’s around the bubble by that boundary, creating a sub-entity that only exists and makes sense in a larger&nbsp;space.</p>Just some bubbles making a&nbsp;foam<p>In classical computer network systems, we liked putting hard boundaries up around things. Firewalls and even physical network cable separation let us define what was “in” and “out”. If you were on the network, you had to be good, because we made sure of that before you were allowed on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>While these approaches still have their uses, today we know that it’s not enough. Devices cross network boundaries all the time, and even our trusted API services dart around cloud data centers, pulling pieces and components and data from places we can’t fully predict and plan ahead of time. So the world has moved to a zero-trust approach, where we build security into every part of the architecture instead of assuming it’ll get stopped at the door. That is a very good thing, but it also turns out to not quite be&nbsp;enough.</p><p>Organizations want to be able to control policies in a central fashion, to define accounts and access in one dashboard. But on the other hand, cloud services need to make extremely local decisions in potentially ephemeral environments — do I start X image on Y network to process Z request? This dichotomy creates a tension in the system that only increases when you start to cross network and trust domain boundaries.</p><p>We need to address this, and that’s why I’ve been thinking about bubbles. Bubbles provide context, boundaries, and differentiation, and that’s what I think we need to consider in our identity and security&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Within a bubble, there’s a certain degree of trust, like the set of services within a pod on a shared virtual network. I can make hyper-local decisions about access and security, and I can do it in a way that doesn’t require me to talk outside the bubble. I can authenticate users directly, I can check policies that only apply to my systems, I can identify software and hardware, and I can do that all within the comfort of the bubble. It’s a small world that I can see and control. The bubble offers safety and familiarity, and we like&nbsp;that.</p> Foam <p>Bubbles don’t exist on their own, though, and that’s where the classical network thinking breaks down. It would be easy to say that a bubble is just a regular local network, disconnected from the world, but that doesn’t solve the most interesting problems. A single bubble might be a helpful concept, but it’s when we get a lot of bubbles together that things really get exciting, if you ask&nbsp;me.</p><p>Let’s take a user account as our example. We tend to think of an account as having a specific home, an authoritative source that binds the attributes and authenticators to a person (or other entity, if we’re feeling spicy). But those attributes and authenticators often come from somewhere, and that’s where the bubble concept really starts to&nbsp;shine.</p><p>I’m not just talking about just-in-time provisioning, where a central account database points to a new bubble and says “here is everyone that’s supposed to be in that bubble”. I do think that this kind of push is an important tool, but it can’t be the only one. Any developer will tell you that even the best distributed and delegated systems tend to accrete things like local accounts, group accounts, admin passwords, service keys, and other techniques that solve specific problems.</p><p>Instead of trying to engineer those kinds of things away, the bubble concept embraces the local-ness of them. Within the bubble, we want to authenticate and make our decisions locally. This lets us be fast and robust, and build in the kinds of things that we only care about here. But how do we balance that need against usability and account&nbsp;control?</p><p>When I’ve got a user in my system, they’ve got an account that exists only within the bubble. They can authenticate locally to an IdP or AS that is in charge of all the services within that bubble. The account has attributes and access controls that might only make sense to systems inside the bubble. But it would be obnoxious for a user to create a new local account by hand every time they needed to do something, even though that’s how we have solved this kind of thing in the past. This is the strength of federation technologies like OpenID Connect and credentialing systems like Verifiable Credentials — a user can show up and point back to an authoritative source for their attributes, and get an authenticated session out of the deal. We can use these to get the user inside the bubble, but instead of using these to log in every time, these technologies can be used to instantiate and bind an account within the bubble. From that point forward, the user can authenticate locally. If at any time in the future we need to verify the account with its source, we can re-run the same items we used at&nbsp;ingest.</p><p>And importantly, a bubble should be allowed to trust any other bubble as a source for information. There can be no strict hierarchy in reality. When my bubble is out in the world, I might have a very clear and immediate business need to trust people, information, and services from another bubble that I didn’t know about a few minutes ago. I should be able to make a local decision to trust a user that came from that bubble and bind them to an account in my own&nbsp;bubble.</p><p>This trust is also not linear. A user could have accounts, credentials, and artifacts from multiple places. It’s a common requirement in identity proofing to present evidence from multiple sources that corroborate your claims. In the same fashion, a user might show up with a VC from one issuer and an OIDC login from a different place. The combination of those things can be meaningful to the bubble in a unique&nbsp;way.</p><p>As the foam of distinct bubbles grows, it’s important to be able to trace provenance from these different bubbles. In our local policies, we need a way to say that “This is user A, they came to us from cloud B, but cloud B said they originally came from both cloud C and cloud D”, and be able to verify that chain. And since our bubble could be the authoritative source for some other bubble, we need a way to talk about that kind of chain downstream. These kinds of durable provenance artifacts aren’t simple, and they bring with them a whole host of privacy concerns — can an adversary use this to track an individual through a system that doesn’t want to be tracked? Can I troll around the network of bubbles and correlate all these points? It’s clear that being able to selectively disclose the provenance chain, as well as the data about the user themselves.</p> Turtles <p>A bubble can provide context for another bubble to exist. The bubbles can share part of their barriers, allowing specific trusted information to pass freely between them in a way that the external walls don’t, but stopping other information.</p><p>A bubble could also exist entirely within another bubble, acting as a sub-division. If we really do care about zero-trust security architectures, we’ll make our bubbles as small as possible and composable so we can stack concerns.</p><p>We’re starting to have this conversation on the IETF’s new <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/wimse">Workload Identity for Multi-System Environments (WIMSE)</a> mailing list. So if that kind of thing interests you, please join us&nbsp;there.</p> Flow <p>Bubbles offer us another helpful metaphor, in that they aren’t static. When you’ve got a bunch of bubbles floating around, they really don’t like to stay still. They move, connect, disconnect, and eventually even&nbsp;pop.</p><p>In a classical multi-lateral federation, the focus is always on getting all the online systems to talk to each other in a way that makes sense for the moment. A new university just signed the agreement? Get them into the directory! We’ve got a new deployable unit that’s heading into the field? Write down the serial number on that router and out the door you&nbsp;go.</p><p>But once we’re up and running, things change. New parties could get brought on locally, new services get pulled in as needed, and the entities that we once relied on cease to&nbsp;exist.</p><p>Disaster response gives us a great example here. In this case, we want to be able to stand up a new bubble of services in response to a specific event, time, and place. Specialists come in with qualifications. Some of these we can verify — you’re a doctor, I can see your medical license is good right now, triage tent is that way. You’re an electrician, your union card looks good, go jump on that truck. But sometimes people show up to help, and their presence in the situation is enough to warrant giving them access. You used to be a firefighter, ok grab an axe and make a firebreak up on that hill. You can answer phones and direct calls? Great, have a seat, here’s the switchboard and directory. We have a mix of accounts that get provisioned from the outside — the doctors and union electricians — and accounts that get provisioned locally — the firefighter and switchboard operator. All of these accounts are valuable for different reasons, and our systems need to have that level of flexibility.</p><p>And eventually, the disaster is over, and we need to clean up our data as much as the physical mess of the disaster. That firefighter went and accessed a bunch of stuff, were they supposed to see that? Those union electrical workers, were they actively in the union with valid licenses while they were down here, or had some of them been kicked out? And depending on what they did, does that matter to us? We need auditability and accountability for dynamic systems like this. We need to be able to call back to the union and say “hey someone used their credential from you and we let them do the following kinds of things, are you OK with that and are we OK with that?” It’s not an easy set of questions to answer, and it gets even more complex when we start chaining our systems together in unexpected ways.</p><p>These bubbles can also disconnect and re-connect to the greater foam. This is the value of the hyper-local decisions — once you’re on board, I don’t need to see your IdP all the time in order for you to log in. So if we go offline for a while, or your IdP goes offline for a while, that’s OK. But once we’re back online, I might want to check in with your IdP, especially if you’ve done something fishy inside my bubble. Cross-domain trust should come with cross-domain accountability.</p> It’s Not A Technology <p>I truly believe that no one technology will solve this, for the simple reason that we will never get the online world to agree to one standard to address things, no matter how good it is or how much nerds love it. Any solution that requires us all to speak the same single protocol is doomed to&nbsp;failure.</p><p>Reality is heterogeneous, and we need to build for that heterogeneous world. The real value, then, comes in defining the interconnects. Interoperability occurs for a purpose and in a context. I believe that we can use a family of standards and technologies in a common pattern to build our the future of internet connectivity.</p><p>As a consequence, in this space I see room for OpenID Connect, Verifiable Credentials, SCIM, Shared Signaling, TLS, SPIFFE, FIDO, and many other moving parts. The bubbles should provide a common set of connection points into the larger foam in which they exist. Not every bubble is going to use the same connection points, but each point provides a specific set of functionality and addresses a specific problem. Even inside the bubbles there’s room for a lot of flexibility and innovation — how do I connect and verify my internal services, how do I spin up subsystems, how do I know who’s there in the first&nbsp;place?</p><p>Some of you reading might be expecting the bottom of this article to be a pitch of my new stealthy start-up that solves all these problems with some magic product I’m trying to sell you, but I’m sorry to disappoint your CTO that it’s not going to just come off the shelf. In all truth, I don’t know exactly what this solution looks like, but I’m eager to start building it to see what’s out&nbsp;there.</p>
