<p>Two of Spain’s leading FinTech specialists are joining forces to provide financial institutions with more comprehensive identity verification and fraud prevention services. <a href="https://www.facephi.com/en/">FacePhi</a> is best known for providing banks with remote onboarding and authentication technology, while <a href="https://www.revelock.com/en/">Revelock</a> (<a href="https://findbiometrics.com/buguroo-forms-new-advisory-board-rebrands-revelock-042107/">formerly buguroo</a>) monitors individual sessions with behavioral biometrics.</p>



  



<p>Together, the two companies will deliver end-to-end coverage for the entire customer journey. FacePhi’s platform compares a selfie to the image on a photo ID to verify the identity of a new user, and then lets that user authorize future transactions with facial recognition.</p>



<p>Revelock, meanwhile, will help financial institutions track user activity between step-up events. The company’s solution analyzes traits like typing speed and pressure to create a unique user profile, and can intervene if it notices behavior that does not fit the established pattern. Such discrepancies could point to the presence of a fraudster, a RAT, or another form of malware.</p>



<p>“Revelock and FacePhi share their Spanish origin and have managed to create reference technologies for the international banking sector,” said FacePhi CEO Javier Mira.&nbsp;“We are complementary companies, since we cover different stages in the interaction process between the customer and the bank.”</p>



<p>“We are excited to partner with FacePhi to promote more cybersecure and customer-friendly banking practices,”&nbsp;added Revelock Founder and CEO Pablo de la Riva.&nbsp;“Biometrics are the future of identity verification in digital banking and by coming together, we are blending best-of-breed solutions to reduce roadblocks from the user experience while at the same time reducing fraud prevention costs and fraud losses.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two companies currently provide coverage for more than 90 million banking customers around the world. Revelock recently released a proactive <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/revelock-introduces-new-proactive-fraud-prevention-platform-050406/">Fraud Detection &amp; Response Platform</a>, while FacePhi achieved <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facephi-receives-iso-27001-certification-042102/">ISO 27001 certification</a>. The company has a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facephi-reinforces-argentina-presence-with-inviu-partnership-704081/">strong presence in Latin America</a>, and has made <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facephi-expands-vietnam-with-pinetree-securities-partnership-041905/">consistent inroads in Asia</a> in the past few months.</p>



<p>The Spanish Chamber of Commerce and Banco Santander named FacePhi as <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facephi-named-spains-sme-of-the-year-702261/">Spain’s SME of the year</a> for 2020. Revelock, meanwhile, has been recognized with prizes at the Finnovate Awards and the Cybersecurity Excellence Awards, and has also received a <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/buguroo-grabs-european-innovation-award-frost-sullivan-071406/">European Technology Innovation Award from Frost &amp; Sullivan</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://onfido.com/">Onfido</a> has just seen its strongest sales quarter in the company’s nine-year history. The selfie biometrics specialist is reporting a 93 percent year-over-year increase in its revenues for the first quarter of 2021.</p>



<p>Sales were particularly strong in the United States and Central Europe, where Onfido says revenues increased by over 200 percent year-over-year. In a statement announcing the results, Onfido attributed the growth to accelerating interest from the financial services sector, and particularly from “challenger banks and companies focused on retail investing, payments and crypto.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Onfido’s partner ecosystem expanded by 116 percent, with new partners including major global brands <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/orange-uses-onfido-tech-biometric-onboarding-041503/">such as Orange</a>, Volkswagen (via its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/onfido-scrive-provide-onboarding-e-signatures-volkswagen-financial-services-030103/">Financial Services division</a>), and Microsoft, the latter of which named Onfido as one of the providers of biometric identity solutions that are compatible with its new <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/microsoft-azure-reaches-decentralized-id-milestone-in-collaboration-with-biometrics-leaders/">Azure AD Verifiable Credentials</a>.</p>



<p>Onfido has been growing its staff roster, too, which now amounts to a workforce of 428, including the recent addition of Onfido’s new Chief Product Officer, Alex Valle. Starting his career as a Product Manager in the Advanced Systems Engineering unit of Lockheed Martin’s “Skunkworks”, Valle has gone on to accumulate considerable engineering and product development experience with companies including Northrop Grumman, Google, and Criteo, among others.</p>



<p>Valle’s appointment was announced alongside Onfido’s strong Q1 results, with CEO Mike Tuchen highlighting his “enviable track record when it comes to building disruptive products,” and his “expertise in building scalable platforms that have consistently delivered billions in revenue, powered by innovative machine learning technology”.</p>



<p>As for Onfido’s fiscal results, they were likely helped along by the general <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/year-in-review-biometric-onboarding-goes-viral-701289/">spike in interest</a> in selfie-driven remote onboarding and authentication solutions in the wake of a pandemic that has driven business across a range of sectors into digital channels. Tuchen, for his part, believes it’s part of a longer-term trend.</p>



<p>“We continue to see a strong push by financial services to digital-first and digital-only customer strategies, which has contributed to this record quarter, and there is no sign of it slowing down,” he said. “Enterprises see strong ROI from putting robust digital identity at the center of these strategies, enabling them to quickly scale and improve their customer experience without having to compromise on fraud protection or compliance.”</p>

<p>A team of researchers at the University of Southern California has released a report that suggests that deepfake detection systems have many of the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/false-arrest-highlights-issues-racial-bias-facial-recognition-062507/">same biases as more traditional facial recognition systems</a>. In their report, the researchers evaluated three different deepfake detection systems, each of which was trained with the FaceForensics++ dataset and each of which was reputed to be able to identify deepfake videos with a high accuracy rate.</p>



  



<p>Unfortunately, systems that could detect deepfake videos in the sample group did not fare as well when applied to the general population. The researchers found that the error rate could vary by as much as 10.7 percent depending on the race of the person in the video, which suggests that racial bias has been coded into deepfake detectors in the same way that it has been <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-nist-study-confirms-racial-bias-many-facial-recognition-algorithms-122401/">encoded into other facial recognition algorithms</a>.</p>



<p>The reasons for that bias are the same in both cases, insofar as the deepfake detectors were trained with a non-representative dataset that does not fully capture the diversity of the population at large. In that regard, the FaceForensics++ videos had more women than men (58 percent as compared to 41.7 percent), and white people were similarly overrepresented. Less than five percent of the real videos included Black or Indian faces.</p>



<p>The researchers also called attention to the dataset’s “irregular swaps,” which transpose one face onto the face of a person of a different race. While the swaps are ostensibly supposed to reduce racial bias, they tend to exacerbate it in practice because it teaches the algorithm to associate altered videos with people of certain races and facial features.</p>



<p>“In a real-world scenario, facial profiles of female Asian or female African are 1.5 to 3 times more likely to be mistakenly labeled as fake than profiles of the male Caucasian,” wrote the researchers.&nbsp; “The proportion of real subjects mistakenly identified as fake can be much larger for female subjects than male subjects.”</p>



<p>Based on those findings, the researchers argued that deepfake detection systems are not ready for commercial deployment because the potential impact of biased systems is not yet fully understood. That remains true despite the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/fraudsters-use-deepfake-biometrics-hack-chinas-taxation-system-040103/">growing threat that deepfakes pose</a> to international security. In the meantime, <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/jumio-emphasizes-need-representative-data-sets-ai-development-110202/">many organizations</a> have emphasized the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facebook-looks-reduce-algorithmic-bias-with-new-video-dataset-042604/">need for representative datasets</a> in AI development, <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/anyvision-emphasizes-need-ethical-unbiased-facial-recognition-systems-010810/">whether for facial recognition</a> or deepfake detection.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.paravision.ai/">Paravision</a> will be looking to expand after bringing in $23 million in its latest funding round. J2 Ventures acted as the leader for the round, which had additional input from Marlinspike Capital, Atomic, Icon Ventures, Perot Jain, Red Cell Partners, and HID Global, amongst others.</p>



  



<p>Of those backers, HID Global is perhaps the most noteworthy because the identity specialist has indicated that it already has plans to integrate Paravisinon’s facial recognition technology into its own <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/hid-global-provides-mobile-access-russian-internet-provider-041202/">portfolio of access control products</a>. Paravision itself argued that its solution is well-suited to server-side and edge processing applications, since its SDKs and APIs have been specifically optimized for the Intel, NVIDIA, and Amarella hardware platforms.</p>



<p>Paravision plans to use the funds to round out its technology team and boost its development efforts. It will also bring on more staff to liaise with its various partners.</p>



<p>“We see something truly unique in Paravision,” said J2 Managing General Partner Alex Harstrick. “They are a leader in computer vision and face recognition and a dynamic company that has earned the respect and partnership of the world’s leading identity solution providers.”</p>



<p>“We feel incredibly fortunate to have such great support from both financial and strategic investors and the opportunity to build upon the technology and market foundation we’ve been able to establish in a relatively short time,” added Paravision CEO Doug Aley. “It resonates with what we’ve been seeing in the market, which is that partners appreciate the customer benefits of building around the most accurate and resilient technology.”</p>



<p>Paravision’s algorithm has <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/paravision-leads-all-western-developers-latest-nist-test-030409/">consistently performed well</a> in <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/paravision-posts-another-strong-score-latest-round-nist-biometric-testing-032608/">multiple rounds of NIST testing</a>, posting error rates that are two to three times lower than those of other American facial recognition providers. The company released its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/paravision-improves-accuracy-in-4th-gen-face-biometrics-solution-909301/">fourth-generation facial recognition solution</a> in September, and recently appointed a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/paravision-appoints-ethics-advisor-publishes-ai-principles-for-face-biometrics-701157/">new Ethics Advisor</a> to help guide the future development of its facial recognition tech.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bpsmart.ai/">BPSmart</a> has partnered with <a href="https://www.ipsidy.com/">Ipsidy</a> in an effort to prevent fraud on its Digital Assistant Platform. To that end, the company will be integrating Ipsidy’s Proof and Verified solutions into the platform to verify the identities of end users who access the Assistant.</p>



  



<p>Both Proof and Verified are biometric verification tools that rely on facial recognition. Proof is designed primarily for onboarding, and compares an image of an identity document to a selfie to make sure that the two are a match. The platform will confirm that the document is legitimate, and uses liveness detection to ensure that its owner is present for the interaction.</p>



<p>Verified, meanwhile, uses facial recognition to complete follow-up authentication requests. BPSmart users will be asked to take a selfie when they log into a session, and that new selfie will be compared to a template already registered with the system. The solution is intended to replace more vulnerable knowledge-based identifiers like one-time SMS codes.</p>



<p>The BPSmart Digital Assistant is an automated chatbot that can carry out a number of different online sales and customer service applications. The self-service platform has both text and text-to-speech capabilities, and helps organizations reduce their administrative costs while still responding to customer inquiries in a prompt and timely fashion.</p>

<p><a href="https://getheslo.com/">Heslo</a> is hoping to streamline the online checkout process with a new Heslo Pay solution that allows shoppers to enter information more quickly. To that end, Heslo Pay links someone’s payment and shipping information to their biometrics, and then lets them enter that information with one click once they verify their identity with face or fingerprint recognition.</p>



  



<p>The goal, according to Heslo, is to remove as much friction from the checkout experience as possible. The more steps there are, the more likely customers are to walk away from a sale. Heslo Pay is designed to eliminate that hassle to prevent shopping cart abandonment and improve conversion rates for digital retailers. The use of device biometrics allows Heslo to deliver that convenience without compromising on security, and gives the company’s technology a utility that goes beyond the realm of e-commerce.</p>



<p>In that regard, Heslo released Heslo Pay alongside a new Heslo Login solution built for enterprise authentication. The solution can be integrated into websites, applications, or other services to enable secure passwordless authentication for customers and employees alike. Heslo Login is built to the FIDO standard and leverages a FIDO-certified digital trust server.</p>



<p>Heslo Pay is currently compatible with the Shopify, Ecwid, and BigCommerce platforms. The solution should help meet the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/covid-will-help-fuel-28-83b-contactless-biometrics-market-report-020202/">growing demand for smooth payment experiences</a> in the wake of COVID-19. Mastercard (<a href="https://findbiometrics.com/selfie-biometrics-specialist-says-covid-19-kickstarting-digital-economy-111107/">amongst others</a>) has noted that <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/mastercard-report-finds-online-spending-was-up-900-billion-2020-040702/">e-commerce skyrocketed</a> during the pandemic, and its NuData subsidiary has argued that online retailers will need to make their services more convenient if they want to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/nudata-argues-behavioral-biometrics-can-help-online-merchants-retain-customers-052507/">retain those customers once physical stores reopen</a>.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts state legislature has officially passed a new police reform bill that establishes some basic rules for the use of facial recognition. The restrictions are <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/massachusetts-legislature-bans-police-use-biometric-facial-recognition-120208/">not as strong as privacy advocates had originally hoped</a>, though the bill is nevertheless one of the first pieces of legislation that attempts to govern the use of the technology at a state-wide level.</p>



  



<p>According to the new bill, local law enforcement officers will now need to obtain a court order before performing an image search using an FBI, state police, or Registry of Motor Vehicles (RMV) database. They will also need to make a record of each search, to generate statistics that will eventually be released to the public. A formal commission will then evaluate those statistics (and the technology itself) to make additional policy recommendations moving forward.</p>



<p>In the past, the police use of the technology was largely unrestricted, insofar as officers did not need to obtain permission and could conduct a state-wide search for virtually any reason. Many of those searches were not recorded, or disclosed to the defense during criminal trials. Under the new rule, officers will at least need to have a valid reason to perform a search.</p>



<p>“It prevents the use of it by the police when it’s not relevant to an investigation, which is an important but fairly low standard,” said ACLU of Massachusetts Executive Director Carol Rose. “That means [law enforcement] can’t track someone in their personal life for personal reasons, like an ex-spouse, and so it prevents the most bald-faced types of potential misuse.”</p>



<p>However, the law does have several loopholes that could limit its effectiveness as an anti-surveillance measure. Most notably, the law does not prevent the FBI or the State Police from signing a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/nypd-gets-caught-lying-about-rampant-use-clearview-ai-041411/">contract with a private company like Clearview AI</a>, so local law enforcement would still have access to unregulated databases when they collaborate with those agencies. The original version of the bill also would have required a warrant rather than a court order, though <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/massachusetts-senate-passes-revised-version-police-reform-bill-122205/">that rule was relaxed</a> due to the opposition of Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, who has indicated that he will refuse to sign any bill that prohibits facial recognition searches.</p>



<p>The bill’s proponents noted that facial recognition is <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/false-arrest-highlights-issues-racial-bias-facial-recognition-062507/">more likely to misidentify the faces of people with darker skin</a>, and cited the public’s growing awareness of such bias as a motivating factor in the legislature. Several municipalities (including <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/boston-bans-face-based-surveillance-906297/">Boston</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-cambridge-ma-becomes-latest-city-ban-facial-recognition-011506/">Cambridge</a>) have implemented local facial recognition bans, while Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey has tabled <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/members-of-congress-plan-to-reintroduce-facial-recognition-proposal-report-701201/">similar legislation at the federal level</a>. He indicated that the Massachusetts bill could show lawmakers how to get similar laws passed in other jurisdictions.</p>

<p>The Biden administration is abandoning a controversial Department of Homeland Security (DHS) <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/proposed-policy-would-give-dhs-sweeping-powers-collect-biometric-data-092106/">policy proposal</a> that would have dramatically expanded the agency’s data collection capabilities. The policy was first tabled under the Trump administration in September, and drew <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/eff-expresses-formal-opposition-dhs-biometric-policy-proposal-102305/">considerable backlash from privacy advocates</a> that objected to its content, and to DHS’s attempt to limit the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/eff-asks-us-citizens-comment-controversial-dhs-policy-proposal-100206/">usual public comment period</a>.</p>



  



<p>Under the current policy, US customs and immigration officers are only permitted to collect fingerprints, signatures, and photos from immigrants seeking green cards, visas, and (eventually) US citizenship. Those powers are also restricted to adults, preventing officers from capturing biometric data from children under the age of 14.</p>



<p>The new policy would have removed those age restrictions, and given customs agents the authority to collect far more biometric information. Most notably, the agents would have been able to gather the iris, palm, and voiceprints and DNA from immigrants and their US sponsors, giving them unprecedented abilities to collect biometric data from US citizens. The DNA would ostensibly be taken to establish family relationships in those sponsorship cases.</p>



<p>The proposed policy was never officially enacted, and will now be withdrawn without ever becoming a formal standard. Privacy advocates celebrated the decision, but still expressed concern about other, ongoing data collection practices. For example, the Trump administration started collecting the DNA of detainees in custody last April, and the Biden administration has yet to reverse that policy.</p>



<p>“The Biden administration is right to withdraw this DHS proposal, which would have massively expanded the government’s collection of sensitive biometric identifiers out of all proportion to any legitimate need,” said ACLU staff attorney&nbsp;Vera Eidelman. “But it isn’t enough to protect the privacy and dignity of immigrants, their families, and their communities. The Biden administration must also rescind the rule requiring forced DNA collection from individuals in immigration detention.”</p>



<p>The biometric data would have been stored indefinitely in a DHS database, though the DHS has acknowledged that <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/dhs-report-blames-poor-cbp-security-practices-2019-biometric-data-breach-092410/">poor security practices</a> have led to breaches in the past. The agency would have been able to collect records from as many as 6 million people on an annual basis, instead of the 3.9 million processed with the existing system.</p>

<p>The UK food delivery service Deliveroo will be expanding its use of facial recognition to verify the identities of registered riders. Under the new system, riders will first be asked to upload a selfie of themselves, and will then be asked to take follow-up selfies at random times to verify their identity while they are on the go. Those new selfies will be compared to the original to make sure there is a match.</p>



  



<p>The new system is being rolled out in an effort to prevent people from renting or selling their accounts to unregistered individuals. Account holders are allowed to delegate tasks to a substitute, but that substitute still needs to have valid work documents and a valid vehicle license, in addition to insurance. They must also pass a criminal background check, with Deliveroo offering to reimburse the rider for half of that expense.</p>



<p>The problem is that many Deliveroo riders forego those mandatory checks, and instead rent or sell their account to illegal migrants and other people without proper documentation. The selfies will prevent such practices, since only those registered with the system will be authorized to continue providing delivery services.</p>



<p>As an additional countermeasure, Deliveroo will no longer allow users to change their payment details through the app. The company will instead implement a separate verification process to ensure that payment goes to a registered individual. As a result, any illegal workers that try to keep up with a renting scheme will need to rely on the true account holder to make regular payments, which adds an extra (and potentially prohibitive) layer of complexity to the process.</p>



<p>In October, Deliveroo announced that it would be using <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/deliveroo-to-onboard-drivers-with-onfidos-biometric-tech-910061/">Onfido’s onboarding technology</a> to verify the identities of new drivers. Uber has implemented <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-uber-pressured-begin-collecting-driver-biometrics-london-112502/">similar measures in the UK</a>, and has also asked drivers to take selfies to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/uber-require-masked-selfie-authentication-some-passengers-090108/">prove that they are wearing masks</a> during the pandemic.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.agcs.allianz.com/">Allianz Global Corporate &amp; Specialty</a> (AGCS) has released a <a href="https://www.agcs.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/agcs/agcs/reports/agcs-financial-services-risk-trends.pdf">lengthy new report</a> that details many of the major challenges that financial institutions will face in the next few years. The findings are based on a survey of more than 900 industry respondents and supplemented with an analysis of 7,654 insurance claims worth roughly $1.05 billion.</p>



  



<p>Those industry responses were used to put together an Allianz Risk Barometer that ranks stakeholders’ various concerns. The top spot went to cybersecurity incidents, a category that includes cyberattacks and data breaches. The pandemic and business interruption were some of the other things that had a negative impact on the financial sector. The respondents also expressed concern about the changing regulatory environment, which covers both data protection legislation and green legislation intended to curb climate change.</p>



<p>Of those, cyber incidents triggered the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/transunion-warns-about-post-covid-spike-synthetic-identity-fraud-020911/">largest losses for financial institutions</a>. However, AGCS warned that compliance could create even more problems moving forward, since organizations that fail to comply with newer, stricter regulations (and organizations that fail to protect people’s personal and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/tiktok-reaches-92-million-settlement-bipa-lawsuit-022605/">biometric data</a> in particular) could face greater fines and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/legal-experts-warn-that-companies-could-be-held-liable-poor-data-protection-practices-031602/">expose themselves to costly civil litigation</a>.</p>



<p>That remains true despite the financial industry’s considerable investment in cybersecurity. Financial institutions are a lucrative (and popular) target for cybercriminals, and the reliance on third-party service providers creates a potential weak link in the security chain. A bank could still face consequences for a data breach that <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/macys-hit-bipa-lawsuit-using-clearview-biometric-surveillance-080701/">originates with a third-party partner</a>, with AGCS citing the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/solarwinds-hackers-guessed-passwords-cisa-701081/">recent SolarWinds incident</a> as one noteworthy example. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“How financial institutions manage risks presented by the cloud will be critical going forward,” said AGCS North America Head of Cyber, Tech, and Media Thomas Kang. “They are effectively offloading a significant portion of cyber security responsibilities to a third-party. However, by partnering with the right cloud service provider, companies can leverage the cloud as a way to manage their overall cyber exposure.”</p>



<p>AGCS went on to suggest that some financial institutions could face lawsuits from shareholders dissatisfied with an organization’s COVID-19 response. The report also tracked 170 new Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) laws that have been passed since 2018, arguing that financial institutions should be prepared to comply with those laws, and with laws that address other social issues like diversity and executive compensation.</p>

 Let’s talk about digital identity with Colin Wallis, Executive Director of Kantara Initiative, and Charlie Harry Smith, Political Theorist at the Oxford Internet Institute. 
<p>In episode 44, we shake things up with a fireside chat format. Colin and Charlie begin by discussing: “Is digital identity for citizens a commodity?”. From their different backgrounds in identity – Colin’s tenure as Kantara’s Executive Director, and Charlie’s work as a political theorist – they explore multiple considerations, including user experience, the role of private organisations in shaping citizen (or resident) identity and how to ensure adoption. As both are currently UK-based, they use the UK government’s historical and future plans around digital identity for context, as well as examples from other countries like New Zealand and the US.</p>
<blockquote><p>“[Digital identity] can be delivered effectively, securely, and in a way that’s lovely to look at as well. That’s an exciting thing and it’s an exciting time to be in this industry.”</p></blockquote>
 <p>Colin Wallis</p> 
<p>Colin Wallis is the Executive Director of the Kantara Initiative – the international industry association globally acknowledged for its ethos of no barriers to participation. Kantara is most recognised as a Trust Framework Operator of conformity assessment and Trust Marked schemes for digital Identity, Credential and Consent Management Service Providers.</p>
<p>Colin develops and executes the Kantara Initiative’s strategic plan in concert with the Board and Leadership Council, driving the organisation forward on a broad front with the financial support of private, public sector and individual members from every region of the world and the assistance of a dedicated band of expert volunteers. Colin’s work has been recognised by being named one of the Top 100 Influencers in Identity by independent research company One World Identity.</p>

 <p>Charlie Harry Smith</p> 
<p>Charlie Harry Smith is a political theorist pursuing a doctoral degree at the Oxford Internet Institute, part of the University of Oxford. In particular, his research considers the normative and theoretical issues surrounding digital governments and the ongoing development of federated identity systems in the UK.</p>
<p>Alongside his research, Charlie regularly consults on digital identity projects. He handles social media monitoring for the Open Identity Exchange and, most recently, has worked with the Digital Equity Association to bring the SMART Africa Trust Alliance – an ambitious cross-continental federated identity scheme – to the pilot project stage.</p>

 Let’s talk about digital identity with Erdoo Yongo, Policy and Advocacy Manager at GSMA. 
<p>In episode 43, Oscar and Erdoo explore the importance of mobile technology to digital identity, and what that means for inclusion in schemes that rely on identification of individuals. From her background in policy and advocacy at GSMA, Erdoo gives specific examples of mobile playing a role in the development of identity – identity enrolment in Nigeria, birth registration in Pakistan, health records in Kenya, and cash value assistance in Zambia. She also explores the challenges preventing mobile from playing a role in the development of digital identity ecosystems.</p>
<blockquote><p>“There are a range of opportunities for mobile technology and mobile operators to play a pivotal role in the development of digital identity ecosystems.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Erdoo joined GSMA in 2017. She is a Policy and Advocacy Manager across the Digital Identity (DI) and Mobile for Humanitarian Innovation (M4H) teams. As part of the advocacy and policy team, she is working to create an enabling policy environment for mobile operators to ensure that mobile can be used to support identification of underserved populations and as a platform to deliver humanitarian assistance. Erdoo is thus working with mobile operators, development partners and humanitarian organisations to uncover and resolve policy and regulatory barriers they face in providing mobile services to users.</p>
<p>She also leads GSMA’s research on mandatory SIM registration, exploring its relation to other key indicators in order to establish key trends that inform the work of the DI and M4H advocacy and policy streams.</p>
<p>Erdoo delivers the ‘Digital identity for the underserved and the role of mobile’ Capacity Building course to regulators and policymakers and represents GSMA at a broad range of events.</p>

Description: Today’s guest is Mick Ebeling, Founder and CEO of self-financed tech incubator NotImpossibleLabs. Mick’s mission and projects are proof that impossible is only a temporary state. We discuss technology’s role in identity, being a problem-solver, and having the conviction to create a better world. &nbsp; Key Takeaways: [2:03] Mick shares the mission and the focus of Not Impossible Labs and how his incubator breaks the rules. [5:28] Why storytelling is so powerful. [7:41] How a prototype morphed into something so much bigger.[13:21] A personal family tragedy drives Richard to make a difference in the world and find ways to protect humankind. [16:21] We all have within us the ability to make change. You don’t have to know how to do it all, you just have to have passionate conviction to resolve. [20:25] Mick’s observations on identity and the huge disparity between who we actually are vs. who we digitally are. [25:17] We are beginning to see people resist losing their digital identity and privacy. [28:50] How to find Mick, Not Impossible Labs, and his other projects. &nbsp; Quotes:    “Our incubator is about what we call technology for the sake of humanity.”—Mick   “Our metric is, ‘Does it do good for the world? How does it address absurdities?’”—Mick   “We look at the technology we create through this lens called ‘help one help many.’”—Mick   “Anybody can build a PowerPoint presentation. Not everybody can tell a good story.”—Richard   “Surround yourself with people who make you feel stupid.”—Mick   “Commit, then figure it out.”—Mick   “Some information, many times, can be way more dangerous than all of the information.”—Richard    Mentioned in This Episode:   Not Impossible Labs Not Impossible:The Art and Joy of Doing What Couldn’t Be Done, by Mick Ebeling Hunger: Not Impossible

 Let’s talk about digital identity with Mei Ngan, Scientist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). 
<p>In episode 42, we explore Mei’s work at NIST evaluating face recognition biometrics with the Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT), how accurate facial recognition actually is, and the effects of different variables on the FRVT – face masks (motivated by the pandemic), face morphing as a current FR vulnerability for identity credentials, demographic differentials, and twins – “the forgotten demographic”.</p>
<blockquote><p>“[Face recognition] technology really has come a long way, especially when you only have half the face available to do recognition with. But with that said though, there still remains certain limitations to the technology – such as being able to differentiate between identical twins, demographic differentials and extremely poor-quality photos.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Mei Ngan&nbsp;is a scientist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (<a href="https://www.nist.gov/">NIST</a>).&nbsp; Her research focus includes evaluation of face recognition and tattoo recognition technologies.&nbsp; Mei has authored and co-authored a number of technical publications, including the accuracy of face recognition with face masks, evaluation of face morphing detection algorithms, demographic effects in face recognition, performance of facial age and gender estimation algorithms, and publication of a seminal open tattoo database for developing tattoo recognition research, which she received the Special Contribution Award for at the&nbsp;2015 IEEE International Conference on Identity, Security and Behavior Analysis (ISBA).</p>
<p>Mei was awarded the&nbsp;Department of Commerce Gold Medal Award&nbsp;in 2020 and&nbsp;was a recipient of the&nbsp;2020 Women in Biometrics Award, a globally recognised award honouring innovative women in the biometrics field.</p>

<p>Description:</p> <p>This week’s guest is the Identity Jedi, David Lee. David is an Enterprise Architect and thought leader with nearly 20 years of experience in Identity and Access Management, Business Development, and Solution Architecture. David and Richard discuss the biases identity management decision-makers have when it comes to diversity, the consequences that can come with fast-paced software delivery, the future of digital anonymity, and the importance of having difficult conversations around diversity inclusion.</p> <p>Key Takeaways:</p> <p>[1:38] David discusses his background in tech and incidental journey in Identity and Access Management.</p> <p>[4:32] Sending all business digital due to the pandemic has caused a new crop of problems. Including the many concerns relative to diversity inclusion as it relates to digital identity.</p> <p>[8:03] The biggest problem when it comes to digital identity is access. Decision-makers often don’t consider the technological challenges others face because they have always had access.</p> <p>[13:15] There is an intersection of ethics and civic responsibility when it comes to identity. There is no discipline for software engineers when it comes to identity and privacy due to the pace at which they are expected to build, but this will likely change due to liabilities and regulation.</p> <p>[19:06] A potential side effect of the future of identity management could be a lack of anonymity. This exposes that gray area around allowing free speech while maintaining the right to privacy, and who should have access to authentication and verification.</p> <p>[23:28] The technology exists to be able to create accountability models as it pertains to identity and to reduce misinformation. The challenge is having uncomfortable conversations to address the issues surrounding diversity.</p> <p>[26:24] Right now, online anonymity is binary rather than the user having the ability to selectively decide.</p> <p>[29:23] Tech companies made decisions about identity without thinking about user choice.&nbsp; Older generations are more apt to have concerns about this lack of privacy and anonymity.</p> <p>[32:48] The demand for faster comes with a set of consequences. The same issues we encounter around diversity in analog will present themselves digitally if we do not address them.</p> <p>Quotes:</p>    “For some reason, we get introduced to the identity componentry and it becomes like a bag of chips. We can’t eat just one.”   “For the vast majority of companies, nobody had a business continuity plan that said, ‘I’m going to send 100% of my people home.’”   “There’s a room full of middle-aged white men who are controlling the narrative for billions of people.”   “Is it going to be built with access for everybody in mind?”   “We talk about data privacy regulations, but we don’t talk about protecting the user.”   “Some anonymity provides protection.”   “Challenge everything."    <p>Mentioned in This Episode:</p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/dlpresidente?lang=en">David Lee on Twitter</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.iamdavidlee.com/identity-jedi">Identity</a> Jedi</p> <p><a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/">Ping Identity</a></p>

 Let’s Talk About Digital Identity with Ben Cronin, Managing Director at UBO Service. 
<p>In episode 39 of LTADI, Oscar talks to Ben about UBO Service and the challenges it solves around verifying Ultimate Beneficiary Owners, how UBO Service is leveraging Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) for KYC and enhanced CDD, and the Global LEI Foundation’s validation agent (VA) framework.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It was very obvious to us that adding the LEI to that identification piece was very powerful because you’re really identifying and verifying the entity to a very high standard. By using data that we get from official government registries – adding that to an LEI just makes complete perfect sense to us.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Serial entrepreneur Ben Cronin founded GBR (Global Business Register) in 2008. GBR morphed into <a href="https://www.kyckr.com/">Kyckr</a> over the following years and Kyckr listed on the Sydney Stock Exchange in 2016, providing commercially proven products for the authentication of businesses globally. His roles at Kyckr included Managing Director and Chief Data Officer. Ben is a supporter of Max Schrem’s organisation, NOYB – European Centre for Digital Rights; the fight for data privacy is important for all citizens.

The one thing that we forgot to move was people.”   “Water always finds the path of least resistance and humans tend to find the path of least resistance, as well.”   “You own your identity, but others own the verified record of your behavior.”   “In some abstract way, we are the aggregate of all of our interactions with third-parties.”   “If you wanted to know the totality of our behavior, it probably exists somewhere in the digital exhaust of the identity management systems of all the companies we interact with.”   “The weakest link within national cybersecurity infrastructure right now is the ability to confirm that someone is who they say they are.”   “We’ve come up with terms for identity that are absent the individual.”   “Fraud costs money.”   “The house of cards of strong identity cannot be built upon weak identity verification.”    <p>Mentioned in This Episode:</p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andredurand/">Andre Durand</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/">Ping Identity</a></p>

<p>This week, Richard is joined by Eva Velasquez. Eva is the President and CEO of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/">Identity</a> <a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/">Theft</a> <a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/">Resource</a> <a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/">Center</a>, a nonprofit organization established to support victims of identity and cybercrimes. Eva discusses where she sees the biggest problems in identity theft today as well as the long-term and domino effects it has on both the victims and essentially all of us.</p> <p>Key Takeaways:</p> <p>[1:19] There is no such thing as a victimless crime when it comes to identity theft and fraud.</p> <p>[2:29] The Identity Theft Resource Center has been a nonprofit victim services organization for 20 years. They offer free and comprehensive services to victims of identity theft.</p> <p>[4:10] The process for victims to be made whole is inherently failed. They are often left both financially and emotionally damaged.</p> <p>[6:01] This year, 10% of people reported feeling suicidal due to identity crimes.</p> <p>[7:20] Richard has a very strong attachment and reaction to the way corporations handle identities due to the emotional harm caused when his wife passed away.</p> <p>[9:03] The problem with having all of this information harvested about our identities and then having that data poorly managed, is that it never goes away.</p> <p>[10:10] The more data we add to the identity verification and authentication process, the more we increase our risk.</p> <p>[11:11] Identity crimes can have long-term and lifetime effects; even children are at risk.</p> <p>[15:22] Historically, the risks and consequences from companies aggregating data on our identities, fall back onto the individual. Some will even capitalize on fixing their mistakes.</p> <p>[17:19] There’s an immediate need for organizations to be more responsible in managing identity. Eva wants the government to step it up, as this area accounts for the biggest losses.</p> <p>[22:09] The massive and long-term consequences of widespread unemployment benefits fraud; especially during the pandemic.</p> <p>[30:23] People should have the right to be able to confirm that they are who they say they are; we have this in person but not when it comes to digital identity. The solution needs to fall more on corporations and government, and not on the individual user.</p> <p>Quotes:</p>     <p>“Just because a bank makes you whole because of a fraud committed against your account, doesn’t mean that it was victimless.”</p>     <p>“There’s a person behind every single one of those data points and those fraud rates, and they need to have a voice.”</p>     <p>“When you look at how we use identity credentials and how we use them in authentication and verification, it is so pervasive now.”</p>     <p>“It’s only within the extreme examples that we see all the true fractures and breaks in the process that caused these types of things.”</p>     <p>“Right now the single biggest problem that we’re looking at, with the fraud losses in the billions, is through government benefits.”</p>     <p>“These are real costs, these are real consequences to human lives.”</p>     <p>“A human being should have the right to be able to confirm that they are who they say they are.”</p>     <p>“The first step in solving any problem is identifying that you have one.”</p>     <p>Mentioned in This Episode:</p> <p><a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/">Identity</a> <a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/">Theft</a> <a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/">Resource</a> <a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/">Center</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/">Ping</a> <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/">Identity</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

 Let’s Talk About Digital Identity with René Seifert, Co-Founder &amp; Co-Head at TrueProfile.io. 
<p>In episode 37, René Seifert talks about the current status of identity in the UK; the government’s recent call for evidence and DIU (digital identity unit); the resultant six guiding principles – including privacy and inclusivity; the potential of self-sovereign identity to solve some of these issues; TrueProfile.io and the importance of verified credentials in an HR context; plus the ethical, political and technical challenges of ‘immunity passports’.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I think it’s interesting if we overlay this utopia of a self-sovereign identity that sounds maybe like science fiction today, and where these UK digital initiatives are geared, and my best guess is we can and will land somewhere in the middle.”</p></blockquote>
<p>René Seifert is a serial entrepreneur and co-head of <a href="https://www.trueprofile.io/">TrueProfile.io</a>, a credential verification solution provider. Powered by the DataFlow Group, TrueProfile.io provides these services in a modern environment via the adoption of Ethereum blockchain. Prior to this, René was the co-founder and co-CEO of Venturate AG, a crowdfunding platform allowing regular people to invest side-by- side with experienced business angels.</p>
<p>In addition, he has been involved in founding several internet, tech and media companies, among the Holtzbrinck eLab. René, half German and half Croatian, began his career hosting radio shows and running an advertising agency parallel to his studies. He was head of marketing and presenter at the radio station Bayern 3. During the “new economy” he headed the entertainment department at Lycos Europe.</p>

 Let’s Talk About Digital Identity with Kaliya Young – consultant, conference organiser, author, activist. 
<p>In episode 36, Kaliya and Oscar discuss the long-running Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) that she co-founded, the effects of moving to virtual identity conferences in 2020, insights from Kaliya’s books – ‘The Domains of Identity’, newly published in 2020, and ‘A Comprehensive Guide to Self Sovereign Identity’ – plus some great tips for all business leaders on how to view the role of identity in their organisation.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I think we may be selling self-sovereign identity all wrong. It should be infinitely scalable, low-cost federation. That’s really powerful!”</p></blockquote>
<p>Kaliya Young is the author of two books “<a href="https://www.anthempress.com/the-domains-of-identity-pb">The Domains of Identity</a>” and “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Guide-Self-Sovereign-Identity-ebook/dp/B07Q3TXLDP/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=guide+to+self+sovereign+identity&amp;qid=1601333817&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">A Comprehensive Guide to Self Sovereign Identity</a>”.</p>
<p>For the past 15 years, she has been working to catalyse the creation of a layer of identity for people based on open standards. She co-founded the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> (IIW) in 2005 to bring together technologists who want to see decentralised identity come into being. In the fifteen years their community has been meeting, they have created standards being used all over the internet, like OpenID Connect and OAuth. In 2012 she was recognised as a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum.</p>
<p>The next IIW is in April. Sign up on <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/internet-identity-workshop-iiwxxxii-32-2021a-tickets-131551119941">Eventbrite</a>.</p>
<p>Kaliya is widely recognised for her community leadership. She travels to Africa and Asia at least once a year to ensure the development of person-centric identity is truly global and inclusive. Most recently, she co-founded <a href="https://humanfirst.tech/">HumanFirst.Tech</a> with Shireen Mitchell, a project focused on creating space for diverse voices and building a more inclusive industry.</p>
<p>In 2009, she was named one of Fast Company’s Most Influential Women in Technology.</p>

 Let’s Talk About Digital Identity with Khalid Maliki, Co-Founder &amp; Managing Director, and Jimmy J.P. Snoek, Co-Founder &amp; CEO at Tykn. 
<p>Khalid and Jimmy join Oscar for episode 35 of the podcast, discussing everything Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and the SSI company they co-founded, Tykn. The conversation details the ‘three pillars of SSI’ (verifiable credentials, decentralised identifiers and blockchain), how SSI fits with existing processes, what it should appear as to end users (and what level of education they need around the technology), the importance of accessibility for inclusivity, and what’s next for Tykn.</p>
<blockquote><p>“In 5 years, people should take [SSI] for granted”</p></blockquote>
 <p>Khalid Maliki</p> 
<p>After many years working in UX at the Dutch Ministry of the Interior, Khalid’s keen product design knowledge combined with a passion for social impact led him to put all his time and efforts into co-founding the award-winning digital ID company Tykn. Khalid believes Self-Sovereign Identity will positively impact billions of people’s lives and has advocated for its adoption on the most important stages, from the Economic Forum in Africa to the United Nations in NYC. He considers one of his biggest achievements to have co-founded a happy family.</p>
<p>Find Khalid on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/khalidmaliki/">LinkedIn</a> and on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/Khalidworks">@Khalidworks</a>.</p>
 <p>Jimmy J.P. Snoek</p> 
<p>Jimmy J.P. is a musician, business developer and entrepreneur, currently residing in The Hague, The Netherlands. After having worked as a professional musician in Spain and having started his first company in The Netherlands before the age of 20, Jimmy was accepted into the prestigious McGill University in Montréal, Canada and co-founded the now award-winning digital ID company Tykn. As an evangelist of data privacy and an early adopter of crypto, Jimmy has spoken about the merits of blockchain and self-sovereign identity at conferences and institutions worldwide since 2017, and has been featured in multiple publications, including The Guardian.</p>
<p>Find Jimmy J.P. on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimmy-jp-snoek/">LinkedIn</a> and Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/idforgood">@idforgood</a>.</p>
<p>Tykn leverages blockchain technology to bring trust, privacy, and interoperability to identity. Tykn’s Ana platform allows organisations to issue tamper-proof digital credentials which are verifiable anywhere, at any time. Users can prove their ID to access services while remaining in full control of what personal data is viewed, shared &amp; stored.</p>

In today’s episode, we talk about his new book “Currency Cold War” and relationship, and lack thereof, between digital currency and identity.  Dave describes how smart money is digital currency that embodies its community.  We talk about how data is NOT the new oil.  And Dave responds to Paul Graham’s recent suggestion that Stripe is the next Google with the key insight “data about payments is more valuable than payments themselves.”  We talk about the idea of community-level digital currencies (ie a NY coin vs just a USA coin, or different ethnic currencies) as well as the emergence of QR codes as a vision for the future of post-pandemic, community commerce.

 Let’s Talk About Digital Identity with Katryna Dow, founder and CEO of&nbsp;Meeco. 
<p>Katryna talks to Oscar about her career (including inspiration from Minority Report), Meeco’s personal data &amp; distributed ledger platform, the importance of data minimisation to inspire trust in organisations, and cultural differences in attitudes towards digital identity.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The greatest way to overcome this privacy paradox is transparency.”</p>
<p>“Where regulators have moved to increase the data transparency and data rights of individuals, these need to actually be part of the solution architecture.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Katryna Dow&nbsp;is the founder and CEO of&nbsp;Meeco; a personal data &amp; distributed ledger platform that enables people to securely exchange data via the API-of-Me with the people and organisations they trust. Katryna has been pioneering personal data rights since 2002, when she envisioned a time when personal sovereignty, identity and contextual privacy would be as important as being connected. Now within the context of GDPR and Open Banking, distributed ledger, cloud, AI and IoT have converged to make&nbsp;Meeco&nbsp;both possible and necessary.</p>
<p>Find out more about Meeco at <a href="https://meeco.me/">meeco.me</a>.</p>
<p>For the past three years, Katryna has been named as one of the Top 100 Identity Influencers. She is the co-author of the blockchain identity paper ‘Immutable Me’ and co-author/co-architect of Meeco’s distributed ledger solution and technical White Paper on Zero Knowledge Proofs for Access, Control, Delegation and Consent of Identity and Personal Data. Katryna speaks globally on digital rights, privacy and data innovation.</p>

 Let’s Talk About Digital Identity with Lisa Forte, Partner at Red Goat Cyber Security and Host of the Rebooting YouTube Channel. 
<p>In episode 29, Oscar talks to Lisa about her fascinating journey to cybersecurity, the lucrative schemes that hackers and scammers have been employing since the start of the pandemic, the group of volunteers (CV19) she co-founded to help protect hospitals against cyber-attacks with the onset of COVID19 in Europe, and top tips for individuals and organisations on cybersecurity and identity.</p>
<p>They also discuss a new Tomorrow Unlocked documentary that Lisa appears in – Ha(CK)c1ne: Healthcare on the Edge. It explores the shocking cyber-attacks that have hit vulnerable hospitals, healthcare supply chains and vaccine labs since the COVID-19 pandemic. Released on 25th September, watch Ha(CK)c1ne on <a href="https://youtu.be/tEVeITt5qu4">YouTube</a> now.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The pandemic is a crisis, but security has to continue. Even though we’re fighting a biological virus at the moment, security still has massive ramifications If you ignore it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Lisa Forte is a social engineering and insider threat expert. She is a partner at Red Goat Cyber Security and Host of the Rebooting YouTube Channel. Lisa is a regular on TV shows, documentary films and news broadcasts. Her career started in a very unlikely place, working to stop pirates off the coast of Somalia! She worked in one of the UK Police Cyber Crime Units before starting Red Goat Cyber Security. Lisa is also one of the very proud co-founders of the Cyber Volunteers 19 (CV19) initiative providing free help and intelligence to healthcare providers in Europe during the pandemic, an organisation that has been recognised and praised by Governments around Europe.</p>

 Let’s talk about digital identity with Susana Lopes, Director of Product at Onfido. 
<p>In episode 23, Oscar talks to Susana about what biometrics enable that other identifiers can’t; the importance of anti-spoofing (liveness); privacy concerns around biometrics and regulatory impact; algorithmic bias in biometrics (including race, age, gender and other demographic differentials) and Onfido’s work with the ICO in this regard.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Biometrics protect users against themselves in situations where they might not realise they’re under attack”</p></blockquote>
<p>Susana has a varied background in product management in the B2B space. She has a breadth of platform experience, from web front and backend, iOS, Android and Machine learning infrastructure. Her current role is director of product at Onfido, specifically focusing on their biometric product offering.</p>

<p>Onfido is building the new identity standard for the internet. Its AI-based technology assesses whether a user’s government-issued ID is genuine or fraudulent, and then compares it against their facial biometrics. Its mission is to create a more open world, where identity is the key to access.</p>

 Let’s talk about digital identity with Bengt Berg, Head of Compliance Management Services at Cybercom. 
<blockquote><p>“The most common system or platform to get hacked is the system you didn’t even know you had.”</p></blockquote>
<p>We all know the importance of regulatory compliance in any Identity and Access Management (IAM) scenario. What we don’t always know is how to make colleagues engage with compliance, to ensure they sit up, listen and remember to always keep compliance front of mind.</p>
<p>In episode 21, Bengt Berg fills us in on the new alternatives to the dreaded compliance management handbook that sits on the office shelf collecting dust, taking inspiration from the finance industry. Oscar and Berg also cover other key topics such as how to convince the board that IT security is important with easily accessible metrics, specific cases of IT security compliance in IAM and Cybercom’s approach to compliance management.</p>
<p>Bengt has been in the IT security industry since 1994, when building encryption systems for people in uniforms, have been a manager in an American big firm, has taken some time in the finance industry and today works as a do-all guy at Cybercom. Some sales, some consulting, some business strategy, and is also a member of the steering group of Cybercom Secure. He is also the proud father and protector of Cybercom’s products and services in the Compliance Management area.</p>

<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thanks for joining today. Today, we will hear our guest talking about Decentralised ID. So for that, I would like to welcome Sid Desai. Sid is a Boston-based IT security professional who’s passionate about user and machine identities, security, and PKI.

<p>Hi, Sid.</p>
<p>Sid Desai: Hey, Oscar. How is it going?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good. It’s nice talking with you. Welcome to the show.</p>
<p>Sid: Thank you for having me.</p>
<p>Oscar: A pleasure. Sid, let’s talk about digital identity and I would like to start hearing how was your journey to this world of digital identity?</p>
<p>Sid: I think it began around 2011. I was working on some energy smart grid projects for a large US-based smart metering company. And it was during that time where I was exposed to concepts of identity, especially something that’s got to do with Active Directory. I was also exposed to things like PKI and very early versions of single sign-on. And this applied not just for users at the company but also for machines, for the smart meters. So, concepts of machine identities were very early on at that time and was very much exposed to machine identities.</p>
<p>So, after a couple of years in the energy sector dealing with those sorts of concepts, I joined a Global Certificate Authority who, at that time, I believe was the second largest CA in the world. And this Certificate Authority, or CA, will issue millions of identities for things like websites or users, or servers and computers, essentially in the form of digital certificates. And this is where I had my first important lesson on learning how to manage identities or digital identities at scale. And at that time, I got to help organisations of all sizes deploy PKI and IAM-based solutions. So, if you just want to fast forward five years at that company, I found myself then getting more closer to the bleeding edge of identity technology, in this case it was blockchain. And I have been dealing with decentralised identity since.</p>
<p>So, at Remme, as you mentioned, I currently help companies transform their identity and authentication ecosystems through our non-blockchain as well as blockchain based enterprise solutions. That’s essentially my journey in digital identity.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. You have gone through different type of technologies all of those related to identity. And now, you are into something really hot, blockchain and decentralised ID. So, that’s the main thing I would like to talk today, about decentralised ID. And at this point I would like to hear what it is. Conceptually what is that? But even before that, I would like to hear what the problems are out there, what are the challenges that made that some people create this concept of decentralised ID?</p>
<p>Sid: I think in order to understand that concept, it’s important to understand what exactly a decentralised ID is. And in order to keep the definition as non-complex and non-technical as possible, essentially, a decentralised ID is a type of digital identity that lives in a distributed database architecture. And a blockchain is essentially a type of a distributed database architecture.</p>
<p>So, a decentralised ID in this case would allow you, not just to interact or transact with a single database of records but, in fact, cross pollinate across multiple such records and all the while ensuring that there’s a trace of those transactions that are available in this blockchain which is non repudiable. And then we’ll talk a little bit about what that is in just a second but, think about your online digital login IDs that we use today for most common websites we use. Think about Google, Facebook, Twitter… so in essence, a decentralised ID would allow you to perform a very similar login and authentication function as you do today but offers a far better scalability and security factor by allowing you to use that single identity or single secure distributed identity across multiple functions, across multiple web resources.</p>
<p>And the reason why a lot of people started to look at decentralised IDs as something very important is: think about how many digital IDs that we all have today for each website that we access. I personally have over 35 or 40 different user IDs and passwords that I have to maintain and manage myself. And the digital world is ever so connected. So, if I’m to create a new user ID and password for yet another digital service that I’m consuming, that’s just not scalable and it opens up a lot of issues around identity theft. So, we feel that a single identity or single robust distributed identity that you control, that you manage, the attributes of which you control is the way of the future, especially as more and more things become digital, or our interactions become more digital, and I think that’s one of the real reasons why decentralised ID was created.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, that’s a big problem. A new service that you have to use, you have to create another identity – and very often that’s a username and password. So, you said around 40. Actually, I was expecting even a bigger number and I was thinking of course there may be like 40 that are important. Let’s say 40 important identities and there might be another hundred that are less…</p>
<p>Sid: Yeah, there are probably 20 or 30 I have forgotten about because I just don’t use those services as often as I used the top 40. So yeah, you’re right. There’s probably more.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, others that are not so important, but your data is there in some of these service providers.</p>
<p>Sid: Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: So decentralised ID breaks the pattern of having a main organisation who is handling your identity such as in the past that there was only, let’s say, the government having that role or your bank. But nowadays, there are so many, both public and private institutions that do that and it’s getting a real mess.</p>
<p>Sid: Right.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, so I understand the need of the decentralised ID, of this solution, and the use of blockchain is part of that. So blockchain is –you gave us some explanation already– it’s like a distributed database somehow. Is the only way to do this decentralised ID with blockchain?</p>
<p>Sid: Yes. So, the underlying architecture is definitely possible only with a blockchain. And, if you look up the textbook definition of blockchain you would find something like that it’s an open distributed ledger of a peer-to-peer network that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and can verify those transactions and store those records in a permanent way. And obviously, this definition is very convoluted and not so easy to understand. So, the best way to talk about blockchain is to talk about centralised networks like we just talked about in the earlier question and compare that to a decentralised or a peer-to-peer network. By learning it through this example, people will understand why blockchain is the important bit in decentralised IDs.</p>
<p>So, if you think about a centralised network, all parties rely on a singular central entity to verify and perform transactions. You have a central database where every user’s username and the password and other data or attributes that belong to that user. Think about a bank. A bank is a good example of this. So is any website. So, if you have websites such as Facebook that maintains a central database of all its users that’s also a good example. But this design, if you think about it, has a very massive drawback.</p>
<p>For starters, if you invest as a consumer all your trust and reliance into a single party, that is a massive central point of failure for not just your security but everybody’s security. You’re dealing with things like consent, data breaches and we’ve all seen our fair share of data breaches in our life where essential database gets hacked and then again, all the user IDs and passwords are released out into the dark web.</p>
<p>But in a decentralised network every involved party manages their own independent ledger –database in this case– and then tracks all the transactions and works of everybody else’s ledger and then essentially forms your consensus. So, in this case, the records really can’t be manipulated in a very easy way. And I’m saying not in an easy way because if the majority of those involved in the group and distributed group and be corrupted then in that case, yes. But it’s very hard to corrupt an entire group of people in the consensus.</p>
<p>So, in essence, this blockchain piece replaces your traditional trust by authority with trust by computation. And that’s the single most important difference between centralised systems and decentralised systems. It removes threats of manipulation by a single party, data theft by a single party, and offers the users more control and influence into that digital transaction.</p>
<p>Oscar: Sure. It’s relatively new, the concept, I don’t know exactly how many years ago it started but it’s still relatively a concept in implementation in mainstream solutions. So, I would like to know at this point if there are already some standards, open standards in decentralised ID.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Sid: Yes, there are definitely some standards that the industry is working on together. You do have some industry heavyweights who are working on creating these open standards. The most well-known among these is the W3C foundation. So, the World Wide Web Consortium who is essentially working on building the web standards that we use today since the early 2000s. So that organisation has been around for a while. They have a spec called Decentralised Identifiers or DIDs. I think they have a working group that promotes a globally unique distributed identifier that’s highly available and cryptographically verifiable in a blockchain. That’s one to look at.</p>
<p>They also have the WebAuthn which used to be a group. Now, I think it’s a standard as far as I remember. And essentially, it’s an API to create and use public key credentials – so PKI concepts, in web applications and browser to promote a stronger authentication for users. So that WebAuthn is definitely also another powerful standard in this space.</p>
<p>And then you also have another organisation called Hyperledger, which is run by the Linux foundation and they have also multiples specs in this space and standards around key management and digital identity blockchains. And you may have heard of them obviously with their various projects they have ongoing.</p>
<p>And then you have the OpenID Foundation with its OpenID Connect that helps build an identity layer that builds authentication on top of OAuth 2. They obviously are not in the whole decentralised ID space but the concepts that the OpenID Foundation have come up with its OpenID Connect are definitely helping pave the path for future standards in the decentralised ID space.</p>
<p>So there’s definitely a few of them around and I think there’s a list published that you can access if you just do a quick Google search for Open Standards in DIDs, then you might be able to find all these lists.</p>
<p>Oscar: Good. So, there are some standards that are specific for decentralised ID and some others that are being used as building blocks and in specific solutions. As you mentioned, there are few of those so there might be some more consolidation in the future related to data standards.</p>
<p>Sid: Yes. I definitely expect that.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. So, I would like to hear now some more concrete examples in which use cases, being more specific, can benefit with decentralised ID.</p>
<p>Sid: Yes. So, when you’re talking about use cases, whether you’re talking about decentralised IDs or centralised IDs, the use cases have always been pretty much the same. You have things like authentication, enabling secure connection between two parties – whether those two parties are just users or machines or perhaps a user and a machine combination. You also have applications around the verification of identity attributes, use cases around key management… These applications sort of cross pollinate, as I said, between the centralised world and the decentralised world.</p>
<p>One of the major advantages that decentralised IDs can offer is that it gives that control of that digital identity back to the user. And that’s an important concept in decentralised ID, you may have heard this whole concept around self-sovereign identity.</p>
<p>And that’s definitely going to be the way of the future because as data breaches become more and more common, even large organisations would actually benefit from essentially outsourcing their identity management piece and giving the control back to the users. Because they don’t want to bear the burden of maintaining the security behind these identities. So I think those are some of the use cases that might pop up.</p>
<p>And there’s obviously some pain points associated with how we approach this and obviously the industry standards are helping to solve these pain points. But there’s right now just way too many standards out there as I talked about, so we just have to figure out which of the standards are ones that are very much universally applied all around the industry and used across the board.</p>
<p>Oscar: Going a bit more into what Remme is doing. I know that you use for instance a PKI – Public Key Infrastructure– in part of your solution. So that’s something that we recently talked about in one of the previous episodes, we had DigiCert talking about the world of certification authorities. PKI is one concept that is common between Remme and also them. So why and how Remme is using PKI?</p>
<p>Sid: Yes. PKI or, as you said Public Key Infrastructure, is very core component behind identities. If you think about it, PKI is what enables a digital representation of identities today. And it does that primarily in the form of digital certificates. The certificates are issued by a bunch of organisations called Certification Authorities, as I said, I used to work for GlobalSign and I think you mentioned in your last episode you spoke with DigiCert. These are Certification Authorities, and these are organisations who work with the web standards to make our websites secure for us for the longest time. So, every time you see an HTTPS page or that padlock icon on your browser, you know that there’s some kind of PKI at play behind the scenes.</p>
<p>So Remme’s ultimate goal is to make the entire model of PKI itself decentralised. You see that current PKI model is very much centralised in nature with its pyramid hierarchy structure. You have that single entity on top, which is the root CA, then they have multiple intermediate CAs, and then you have some issuing CAs underneath that and then you have the certificates coming off those issuing CAs. So, it’s very much like a pyramid structure. And I’m not saying it’s anything wrong but the design itself is very old. And if a single entity in that hierarchy is compromised, the entire network trust is actually broken down in an instant. We’ve seen a lot of this happen in the past with CAs. Examples include CAs like DigiNotar or even recently Symantec.</p>
<p>We believe that if you could use a more decentralised model of PKI, the one that we are building currently, then this trust can essentially be distributed across a network of nodes in your blockchain network. That’s what enables that decentralised trust model that we’ve been talking about. And that allows you to scale across billions of digital identities that we’re seeing pop up every day. And the traditional PKI model with the traditional standards were very good for the old, centralised economy when the world was not as connected. But we believe that, as the world sees more connectivity, the decentralised use cases will definitely be more popular and the decentralised PKI model will also have to evolve accordingly. So that’s how we use PKI.</p>
<p>Oscar: Those nodes that have some decentralised role or access Certification Authority, how many would it be? &nbsp;Would every user need that? Who would be in practice those?</p>
<p>Sid: Yes, there are multiple design models around this. And some of them are around underlying blockchain provider creating essentially a network of trusted authorities. So, in this case you’re not relying on a single trust authority, you’re creating a network of trusted authorities. And these networks of trusted authorities are the ones that will be part of essentially a node that would be part of that peer-to-peer network. So, the number is not as relevant. We obviously would want to have definitely more than a few dozen but not anymore that it reduces the speed at which transactions can be performed. Because full consensus within a given blockchain network can also be reached as low as 21 nodes for example. So, the number is not as important as long as it has that distributed nature.</p>
<p>Oscar: Who would they be in practice? I guess it depends on which network we are talking about.</p>
<p>Sid: It all depends on the network. It could be- in certain networks, it could be banks −because people inherently trust banks. So banks could be set up as one of the nodes. In the digital identity world, CAs could actually be one of the nodes, IAM companies who have been dealing with identities at scale for a long time could be one of the nodes. So, anybody who would like to participate in that network and be that node could essentially be one as long as they have a genuine reason behind it and a way to help the community.</p>
<p>Oscar: Government institutions or education institutions as well?</p>
<p>Sid: Yes. Obviously there’s certain blockchains where certain government institutions would also be part of that node network. But the traditional idea behind government is also very much a centralised design in nature. So I’m not entirely sure on how that would work out but in certain countries, I think in Finland or even in Estonia, there’s a lot of focus on government issued IDs, so in that case yes, certainly. But in certain countries like the US where each state has its own regulations around identities, I don’t think the government would play a huge role especially because we have different governments for federal and state.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. Very interesting. To understand Remme’s solution, could you give us an overview of what is Remme’s solution?</p>
<p>Sid: Yes. So, what we focus on Remme is really multiple things. The first thing, as I said, we’re trying to build out a decentralised PKI system. That’s the underlying blockchain layer that would allow us to, essentially, create transactions and verifications in our blockchain and allow the distribution of distributed decentralised PKI certificates out to entities. And these entities could be users or could be machines and whatnot.</p>
<p>But we understand that managing all these certificates is also a bigger pain point for most companies so, at Remme we also have a non-blockchain product that we call Keyhub. And Keyhub allows organisations to manage their digital identities, essentially certificates, all in one place for machines and users and that allows them to keep track of these certificate assets within the company and perform automations on the renewal of those identities behind the scenes.</p>
<p>And we also have another product called Auth which allows people to perform user decentralised identities to log on to different applications using a single touch of a button without a password.</p>
<p>Oscar: Passwordless authentication service.</p>
<p>Sid: Yes, essentially.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. So, you also combine the centralised identity with a decentralised identity for some of your customers when they’re required.</p>
<p>Sid: Yes, exactly. We have worked on a few pilots and few projects where we’ve combined the traditional IAM systems together with our decentralised Auth application and that allowed us to create a use case where we still ended up using some traditional technologies because of compatibility and also tied them into the decentralised world. That’s how we believe that most projects will be handled at least in the next few years until blockchains can be independent.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. So you also have this authentication service. And a potential problem that comes to my mind for blockchain based identity is the identity recovering. What happens if I lose my credentials?</p>
<p>Sid: That’s interesting. That was actually one of the questions that one of the projects we worked on was with BMW and one of the questions they had asked was that. The way we envisioned a recovery process for a blockchain based identity to work is through a concept of social recovery.</p>
<p>Let’s just assume for a second that a digital representation of your identity, your digital identity, is stored on a secure chip on a mobile device which, by the way, is one of the use cases that we have had quite a success in. So, during the registration process you as the user of this decentralised identity would assign a certain board of trustees, essentially a network of family or friends as somebody who can enable you to recover your identity in the event of loss. And whenever that event is triggered, because loss of mobile device or maybe theft, then the nominated users or trustees –that you as the user assigned– would help you essentially recover and replace your identity in the system.</p>
<p>That’s how we envision this happening and then obviously once your identity is restored, you can go back and enable your new identity on the new device and start using it with old applications. This concept has also been described in the DID spec from W3C. So, for those who are interested in learning in a bit more detail how this might work, the spec has a bit more information about this.</p>
<p>Oscar: Now, we would like to think of the future, because decentralised ID is still not mainstream at this point, but as you see in internal standards – there are few standards or organisations who are trying to lead the standards in parallel and that will converge at some point. What else would you see in the future? Let’s say three or five years from now. What would you say about decentralised ID?</p>
<p>Sid: In the future, obviously our digital interactions will evolve quite a bit. Because the world is becoming more and more connected, so trust will play a huge role in this. And the use of digital identity in such disputed world would be very fundamental. So, the way the decentralised ID would work in the future is by having a digital identity that’s owned – essentially managed or controlled– by the individual themselves. And then, allowing that individual to interact with participating third parties, where the user can use that identity while still keeping control of the identity and the data associated with this identity with themselves.</p>
<p>We envision a world where people and their devices will seamlessly interact with other devices and organisations with trust established easily and where people can actually gain access to services just by showing their digital IDs whether their services are financial services or government services or e-commerce, health or any other service.</p>
<p>I talked about the BMW use case –and let me talk a little bit about that because that might give an idea on how this might end up working. BMW wanted to work on a use case where they wanted to enable a decentralised ID use case for their car owners. The pilot that we did with them showcased essentially a couple of digital interactions that BMW wanted to prove. And one was essentially assigning a digital ID to each car owner so that in this case, not only the car itself has a digital ID or digital passport, but the car owner also has a digital ID.</p>
<p>And the second was enabling the car sharing economy and then allowing digital interactions to happen with this ecosystem. And the way Remme helped out was by provisioning a distributed identity for each user – for each car owner – and then allowing that car owner to create separate digital IDs or distributed IDs for the car sharing concepts. So, if I wanted to, for example, rent out my car to my friend for a weekend, I can create that decentralised ID for him just for the weekend. My friend can come to my house, pick up my car – because that ID would enable him to essentially authenticate with the car – and then drive it around for the weekend, come back, park it back at my place and then go back to his place. So these are concepts that BMW wanted to work on. And these are concepts that I’m talking about. The future digital interactions will be very seamless like this.</p>
<p>And obviously, as far as the co-existence of standards and authentication methods that we have enabled in this digital identity ecosystem so far, those will continue to exist. You’re probably familiar, Oscar, with standards like OAuth and OpenID Connect, and FIDO. Those will still continue to coexist along with DID –or distributed identities– because not all systems in organisations will just seamlessly jump to the newer standards overnight. So backwards compatibility is very important and will continue to exist.</p>
<p>We’ll continue to see this standard secure communication with third parties very well into the future whether we’re communicating to a user or a machine. Obviously, the design, the architecture, and the way we do that will evolve over time and so will the standards. But it’s important for organisations to keep an eye out for these updated standards so that they can understand how things within their organisation might also have to evolve in the future.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, I couldn’t agree more. The standards are so important in order to have any of these initiatives, any technology to be successful and widely accepted. I also like the example you gave about car sharing, that was very illustrative, I would say. You can share your car with your friend for the weekend and not just as is today –I give you the key and I trust, good luck, don’t break it, etc., – but also with this accountability of creating an identity for him with a specific timeframe and the authorisation. That’s an excellent example and I definitely like a lot all what you have told us about decentralised ID.</p>
<p>Final question for you is if you can give us, to anybody, a tip to protect our digital identity.</p>
<p>Sid: I can definitely go on and on about this question because we’ve all been following the tips from our governments on proper social distancing protocols during this COVID-19 crisis. We all need to practice very similar protocols when interacting with anything digital these days.</p>
<p>I think the first thing I recommend to anybody is just start making a list of your interactions with identities. Just make a list of all areas in your personal and professional life where digital identity might be at play. Obviously, it goes without saying when you are making this list do not write down your passwords on a piece paper to keep track of them. Just make a note of these identities and how many websites and places where you use these identities.</p>
<p>And then you can then group and sort this list by keeping the items that are of the most importance on top of the list. Things like bank IDs, government IDs, tax IDs and stuff like that and the login credentials associated with those. Give those definitely higher priority. And maybe, you can also filter out your login IDs for your news website for example, where you don’t have a lot of data, you don’t have credit card or potential information that the bad guys can actually steal, you don’t have all of that. Separate those out and what we’re trying to do here is essentially separate your high-risk identity or interactions with your low-risk interactions.</p>
<p>And the third tip I have is: if you are still using passwords, think about switching to a two-factor authentication method. Most of these are offered by websites today and you can also see if you can use some sort of identity and access management system. Most organisations, if you’re working for one, have some sort of IAM system enabled for users to access their applications with. So definitely, try to see if you can use some of these.</p>
<p>There are also password managers. People use them a lot. I know a lot of people that use them. I’m not a big fan of password managers, to be honest, I don’t use one. But if you do use one just ensure that your master password is absolutely strong. It has to be kept very, very strong. And there are also concepts or tools like FIDO-based Yubikeys that you can use for two-factor authentication.</p>
<p>There are a lot of these available out there in the market. And remember, protecting your identity is at the end of the day your responsibility. Sure, you use all these digital services and you expect them to protect your identity for you but I believe that organisations can only do so much. You take the necessary precautions on your end so you can definitely minimise the damage the data theft can cause for you as a user.</p>
<p>And if you don’t know how to still go about this, you can always reach out to a professional within your network. Perhaps somebody on LinkedIn who is talking a little bit more about digital identities, perhaps send them a message on how you can make these concepts work for you. That’s some of the tips I can offer anybody today.</p>
<p>Oscar: Quite a lot. Thanks a lot, some are very simple but we are reminded that we humans are often the weakest point behind this amazing technology that we have. Again, thanks a lot, Sid. It was great talking with you. Could you tell us how we can find you if someone wants to get in touch with you or learn about what you are doing?</p>
<p>Sid: Certainly, thank you Oscar. This was a very informative session. And yeah, for those of you who have any questions for me or want to reach out to me you can either email me at sid@remme.io and you can also find me on LinkedIn, just type in Sid and my last name, Desai, and I should pop up on the list under Remme. Those are the two ways you can reach out to me.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. Fantastic. It was great talking with you Sid and all the best.</p>
<p>[Outro] Thanks for listening to this episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity produced by Ubisecure. Stay up to date with episodes at ubisecure.com/podcast or join us on Twitter @ubisecure and use the #LTADI. Until next time.</p>

 [Podcast transcript] 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello, and thanks for joining today. Today, we will hear how certification authorities contribute to securing the internet but also what is their role in digital identity. And for that, I have a very special guest. Dean Coclin brings more than 30 years of business development and product management experience in software security and telecommunications. &nbsp;As Senior Director of Business Development at <a href="https://www.digicert.com/">DigiCert</a>, he is responsible for representing the company in industry consortia and driving the company’s strategic alliances with technology partners.</p>
<p>Mr. Coclin is also the past Chair of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/">CA/Browser Forum</a> and the <a href="https://casecurity.org/">CA Security Council</a>. Currently, he chairs the ASC X9 PKI Study Group. He holds a BSEE and MS from the George Washington University and an MBA from Babson College.</p>
<p>Hello, Dean.</p>
<p>Dean Coclin: Hello, Oscar! Thank you for having me today.</p>
<p>Oscar: You’re very welcome. It’s great talking with you, Dean. I’m really very excited to talk about your career and what you are doing today in this world of Certification Authorities, particularly in DigiCert. So, I would like to hear first, what was your journey to this world of digital identity?</p>
<p>Dean: Well, I’ve been involved with Public Key Infrastructure and Certificate Authorities since 1996 actually, starting out with a company called GTE CyberTrust. That business was sold to a company called Baltimore Technologies which was then sold to a company called Betrusted.</p>
<p>Then I left that group and worked at GeoTrust for a while before we sold the company to Verisign in 2006. And then I went off and worked at another startup which leveraged the company based in Germany, in Hamburg, Germany called TC TrustCenter. That company was then sold to PGP in 2010 and then PGP actually was sold to Symantec a few months later. And Symantec then acquired the assets from Verisign including GeoTrust so I basically joined a lot of my colleagues again. And we kept that going until 2017 when the website security business was sold by Symantec to DigiCert.</p>
<p>And so now, DigiCert by the virtue of acquiring all the assets from Symantec in website security, which included GeoTrust and Verisign from way back, now is the world’s largest, public certificate authority. So, it has been sort of a long journey, but the good thing is, I’ve been dealing with a lot of the same players as well as new players in the industry and have learned a lot along the way. So, I’m really happy to join you here today to talk a little bit more about certification authorities.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, that’s a very consistent and long experience in very specific field that is PKI until today that you are in the biggest one, that is DigiCert. So DigiCert as you said is the largest commercial CA. But for ones who are not so familiar with what is the role of these organisations, how would you define – what is a certification authority?</p>
<p>Dean: Well, it’s a good question. The certification authority plays a very key role in a public key infrastructure. In a public key infrastructure, you have a concept of private and public key pairs. The private key is something that you always keep with you. You never leave it out of your possession.</p>
<p>But the public key is something that you can send to others that they can then use to encrypt messages to you. However, when you send that public key to someone else, how does that other party know that that’s coming really from you and not a hacker?</p>
<p>And so, the role of a certification authority is to attest to the authenticity of that public key. And what essentially a certificate authority does is sign your public key with a certification authority’s private key. And that basically tells the recipient that, “Ah, someone has certified that yes, this public key is authentic.”</p>
<p>So, in a simple example, let’s say you and I need to communicate, and we’ve never met before and you say, “OK, Dean, I want to encrypt a message to me.” And I say, “OK, Oscar, send me your public key.” So, you send me your public key but if your public key has not been checked by a certification authority, how do I really know that that public key is your public key? Because if I send you a message that has been encrypted with your public key then only you can open it but how do I know a hacker hasn’t intercepted that conversation and inserted their public key into the conversation?</p>
<p>So, having it signed or attested to by a trusted third party, which is a certification authority, gives me confidence that someone has checked that that public key really belongs to you. And that example is for the secure mail world. But looking at things that are used every day for websites, websites used public key cryptography in the form of digital certificates – or that little lock that you see on the screen – to attest to the authenticity and the person who is behind that website.</p>
<p>So, I think we are going to talk a little bit about that more coming up. But in general, a certification authority is someone who attests to the authenticity of a public key.</p>
<p>Oscar: Sure. Thanks for that. And the certification authority is very important in security. In the example you have described is how to secure email for instance. Actually, most of us are not aware but most of us are sending email encrypted. That’s most of the cases and it’s very transparent from our side. In securing a service such as email, securing a website, security is one of the pillars of the certification authority. What about digital identity? How does a company like DigiCert view digital identity?</p>
<p>Dean: Well, we view it as something that’s very critical to operating on the World Wide Web. The World Wide Web has been a great tool to communicate, to learn, to educate others, but unfortunately, that world is also filled with people who don’t have the same intentions in mind. And these people are typically known as cyber criminals or hackers. And so, we want to make sure that when you’re doing business online, when you are communicating online, that you are communicating with the party you expect to be communicating with.</p>
<p>And so, we feel that digital identity is extremely important in e-commerce, in education, in business on the World Wide Web. We want to try to minimise the effect that hackers have by assuring people that those they are communicating with are in fact who they say they are.</p>
<p>And so, digital identity, when you can’t see someone, you can’t touch them, you can’t hear them, plays a very, very important role. I think the European Union especially has recognised this and they’ve put out some legislation and digital frameworks around digital identity. We are right in line with that, we support that. We want to make sure that e-commerce is safe on the web by assuring each party that their digital identity has been verified.</p>
<p>Oscar: So that’s mostly the digital identity of the organisation, not the end-user.</p>
<p>Dean: Well, it could be both. The identity of the organisation in SSL certificates for example is key. But for example, as we talked earlier about S/MIME certificates, we are talking about an individual, and that individual could be part of an organisation or it could be just an independent individual. Nonetheless, the identity is extremely important, and we want to make sure that it’s verified.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, I know for instance some of the main applications of DigiCert are TLS and IoT. Could you tell us a bit about how identity is in these fields?</p>
<p>Dean: Right. Yeah, in TLS, I think as we just started to talk about, ensuring that when visitors go to websites, that the website that they believe they are on is in fact that real website. This is extremely important. And maybe we know just by typing in a domain name that we are used to going to that we are sure we are on the right website, but what if we search for something on the internet and we are using a search engine?</p>
<p>And let’s say we are looking for sunglasses and we are looking for Ray-Ban sunglasses. Well, I happen to know that searching for Ray-Ban sunglasses is actually a very tedious task because there are so many sites that advertise Ray-Ban sunglasses and sometimes, it can be difficult to find out who is the authentic site. Which site is actually the real site for Ray-Ban? Is it Rayban.com? Is it Ray-Ban.com? Is it Rayban.us?</p>
<p>There are so many different permutations of the name that, to the average user, it’s impossible to tell which is the real website. And so, being able to identify that website with a digital certificate that actually shows the identity of who is behind that website is very, very important for e-commerce, for financial transactions, and for any other highly important transactions online.</p>
<p>Now with IoT, it’s a little bit of a different story. With IoT, we have so many different types of IoT devices. Of course, we have consumer devices like baby monitors and webcams. But then we have much more professional devices like medical devices used to monitor blood pressure or drug infusion pumps. We have SCADA systems, industrial controls, so things that take care of water dams and nuclear power plants. We have vehicle control systems now with the advent of autonomous vehicles. We have vehicle to vehicle communications. And these all have to be authenticated and they are done securely using digital certificates.</p>
<p>So, there are some critical applications in IoT that require identity and authenticity and encryption to happen and this is best done with digital certificates. These IoT applications are much larger than we would think of for World Wide Web applications because, for example, let’s talk about cable boxes, cable TV boxes have digital certificates in various parts of the world. And we are talking about hundreds of millions of devices. That’s a big number and that’s a lot more than the number of websites out there today. So, the scale is on a different level for IoT devices than it is for TLS. But nonetheless, identity is extremely important in both cases.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it is very interesting, these distinctions you make between websites. That’s something where we are much more familiar with. We are facing it every single day and we have this idea, the image of the padlock, the green padlock or similar, but when we extend that to IoT devices – you mentioned self-driving cars communicating with each other or even these set of boxes, the cable boxes we have at home -, the numbers are much, much bigger. So, it’s quite interesting.</p>
<p>And most of these applications, most of these sets of boxes or all of them, are they using certificates the majority of them?</p>
<p>Dean: In many parts of the world, that is true. Especially in the European Union and in the US. Many cable boxes use certificates to authenticate the device as well as to provide encryption for the device. So yes, that is true.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it’s excellent to see that and to know that these certificates are already there in devices that people really trust a lot because you buy these devices, and you trust that it’s already secure.</p>
<p>Another interesting aspect, again with the padlock on the web browsers and many people don’t know, there are of course organisations who work to build standards of all these browsers that we use also. So, we don’t notice how important these are and who is behind that. So of course, there are few companies that shift the browsers, update them, but that organisations even less known that are working on that.</p>
<p>And you are currently the Vice Chair Person of the CA/Browser Forum. If you can tell us a bit about this organisation and what has been its impact on online security.</p>
<p>Dean: Sure. The CA/Browser Forum was formed about…I would say 14 years ago. And the purpose of the Forum at that time was to come up with standards for digital certificates that are used on the web – formerly known as SSL certificates, now replaced with new protocol TLS.</p>
<p>At the time, remarkably, there were a few companies issuing these types of certificates but there was no recognised standard for how these certificates should be issued, renewed, revoked, etc. And so, a bunch of certificate authorities, competitors actually at the time and still are, as well as browsers, these are the companies that actually use these types of certificates in their environment got together and said, “OK, let’s come up with standards for different types of certificates”.</p>
<p>And the first standard they came up with was for Extended Validation certificates or EV certificates. And these are the certificates that are the highest form of authentication on the web today where we verify not only the domain name belongs to the person applying for the certificate, we verify that the person applying for the certificate is authorised by the company to do so, and we also verify the company existence by looking at third party documents from reputable sources to verify that it is a legitimate company.</p>
<p>So that standard came out, I would say around 2008. And then work started to develop the standard for the other types of certificates which are known as DV or Domain Validated, and OV or Organisationally Validated. And I believe those were issued around 2011-2012. Since then, the forum continues to meet on a regular basis, bi-weekly by telephone and three times a year face to face in different parts of the world. And it’s a great way for both CAs and Browsers to come together to talk about what issues they’ve seen, how they can be solved and how to keep improving these standards which were developed quite a few years ago.</p>
<p>Most recently in the CA/Browser Forum, new working groups have been stood up namely for code signing and I think very soon, we are going to have one for secure mail, to be able to set standards for those particular areas.</p>
<p>But it’s a great group of international folks that are working cooperatively together to help improve the security of the internet.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely very interesting to know that CA/Browser Forums brings these two worlds together because we are usually more familiar with the browser. We will install Firefox or install Chrome. Different people have different opinions about which one is better or which one do you trust the most.</p>
<p>Dean: Right.</p>
<p>Oscar: And there are a few of these. But after all, we trust. We trust that they are secured. They don’t have bugs and they have the certificates that are there once we install the browser. Yeah, excellent about that.</p>
<p>You already mentioned the types of certificates like the Extended Validation and then the OV, the Organisation Validation. You said that the highest level of assurance is the EV today.</p>
<p>Dean: Yes. Yes.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. Could you tell us more in practice how a certification authority does that validation? I mean how rigorous is it? Imagine that I have a website and I want to have this certificate validated, what are the steps to have the EV issued?</p>
<p>Dean: Sure. Right. You’re right. You’re correct. EV is the highest form of authentication and therefore, it requires multiple steps on the role of the certificate authority to ensure that the person applying for the certificate is not a criminal and actually represents a legitimate business.</p>
<p>And so first, we have to do the same thing we do for all types of certificates, and that’s to verify the domain name. So, let’s say your company was Oscar, Oscar.com. We would go and verify that Oscar.com is a legitimate domain and that you have the ability to control that domain. So, there are different ways that you can check the control of that domain. We can usually send an email to an email domain that we know belongs to you and if you respond to that, that might be one way to do it. Another way is to have you put something on a particular webpage that we can go and look at like a shared secret. So, there are multiple ways that we can confirm ownership of the domain.</p>
<p>After we’ve confirmed ownership of the domain, we need to confirm that you are an authorised representative of the company to be able to request that certificate. So that would require us going to a public directory to find the phone number for your company, calling the number that we find in the directory, and having the phone transfer to your extension. So that would validate that you are actually part of that company.</p>
<p>And then we have to validate the company’s existence from a legal perspective. That would involve going into possibly a corporate registry for that particular country where it’s registered. Let’s say, you are in Finland, so we probably have to go to the Finish registry, verify that your company is registered as a business there, check those records, and update our records accordingly.</p>
<p>If you are a certain type of business that is not listed in the registry, we require a legal opinion letter which would mean you would have to go to a lawyer, and they would just validate that you are a legitimate business and we would accept that letter.</p>
<p>So yeah, there are different types of authentication we have to do to verify all this for EV. But once that’s done then you can receive the EV certificate. Now, what’s important about the EV certificate is that it contains additional information than a domain-validated or an organisationally-validated certificate. And this can be viewed via the different browsers. Most browsers allow you to click on the lock and show that it is in fact an EV certificate, and the way you would verify this is because it will actually show the company name.</p>
<p>For example, if you were to go to BankofAmerica.com with Chrome or Firefox or Edge, you would click on the lock and it would say, “Certificate issued to Bank of America Incorporated” and then in parentheses would say US, which is the region where it’s incorporated.</p>
<p>So other types of certificates do not have that information. And this is the distinguishing factor between EV certificates and other certificates. And if you wanted to get more information such as the particular address where the company is located, you can click on more information and get all that information as well.</p>
<p>So, all of this information is there if someone needs it. It’s not necessarily displayed to a user every day, but it is there when they need it especially if they are trying to find out, “Is this the real Ray-Ban that I want go to?”</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. One interesting point, the one that you say that there is more information in the certificates. If you go to the browser, you can find much more information, the official name of the company, the jurisdiction and more information.</p>
<p>And one of the strongest things I can see of this is that it combines the digital world so things that you can verify purely in the digital world plus the physical world. They have to provide their physical address. So, the certification authority is going to make calls to that existing verification with the physical. And even in some cases as you explained, you have to visit a lawyer or do some paperwork, which might be difficult to truly validate the authenticity of the ownership of this.</p>
<p>Dean: Yes. In fact, I love that analogy. I think bringing the digital and physical world together into the digital certificates so that people can review things that they recognise in the physical world like their address, their corporate registry, and having that in the digital certificate which is verifying the authenticity of the website, I think this is a great analogy and it’s a way that makes it easy for folks to understand.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, Dean. Well, we have announced a couple of months ago that we have a partnership between DigiCert and <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/" title="Ubisecure">Ubisecure</a> and the focus of this partnership is exploring how the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/organisation-identity/" title="Legal Entity Identifiers">Legal Entity Identifiers</a>, LEIs, can help the certification authorities.</p>
<p>So, from your very vast experience in seeing a bit in the future what’s going to happen, what can consumers expect from this relationship?</p>
<p>Dean: This is great. I think LEIs, or Legal Entity Identifiers, are playing a very important role in the global business identification scheme. We see that that it is extremely valuable, and I think that as we said earlier, it’s a great way to marry the physical world and the digital world together by bringing together identity information into that digital certificate. LEIs provide another piece of that identity equation. These are identities that have been checked out by different registrars around the world and using a standard method that’s prescribed by the Global LEI Foundation, the GLEIF, puts this into a standard form that can be used around the world.</p>
<p>And these LEI numbers can be easily checked using a reference database that’s provided by GLEIF to verify identity. So, it’s another piece of identifying information that can be used to connect those two worlds that we talked about.</p>
<p>Currently, LEI numbers can be put into certain extensions in certain fields of certificates. We are looking at ways that we can actually expand that a little bit more in the CA/Browser Forum to allow for LEIs to be put in other particular fields of certificates that would make them more prominent to users and allow them to recognise them easier. We will see if that actually happens. There are a lot of people that are for that but there are some people that are against that. And we are going to keep pushing that to see if we can make that a reality. But I think it would be something that would be valuable to relying parties who are going to websites and looking at certificates, as well as entities that want to show relying parties who they are through the use of LEIs.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it definitely has a really good potential to bring more transparency to the organisations that show it in these certificates. Good. Something that I like to ask you, because I know that you also belong to another very important organisation, the ASC, and you are leading the ASC X9 PKI Study Group. Tell us a bit about this organisation and what you are doing there.</p>
<p>Dean: Sure. ASC X9 is a standards body for the financial community around security standards. And I think years ago they were very concerned about using publicly-trusted TLS certificates in financial devices. Think about automated teller machines, ATMs, or credit card terminals, payments terminals. Because what happened many years ago, actually not that many years ago, the industry moved from SHA-1 to SHA-2.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, at that time, some of these payment terminals, these smaller devices were older devices and could not communicate using SHA-2, and therefore they relied on SHA-1. But when the CA/Browse Forum outlawed the use of SHA-1 for servers, those payment terminals could no longer connect to servers that were using SHA-2 certificates. And so, they essentially became dead devices.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, there were large number of these devices around the world that were basically stuck, and merchants had to scramble and spend a lot of money to update those things on a very short notice.</p>
<p>So the ASC X9 Group wants to avoid any repeats of that particular action. So, they are looking at whether or not they should continue to use publicly-trusted TLS certificates or come up with their own standard for TLS certificates, and actually of PKI, in their environment and for their users.</p>
<p>We uncovered many different used cases for PKI in the financial community and we are focusing on the high priority ones in the second phase of the study to determine if a private PKI would be better for this community and how such a private PKI would be implemented. We expect to start phase 2 of that study group later this month and the nice thing is we have brought participation from a wide variety of financial community participants involved in this study.</p>
<p>I’m personally not from the financial community but I think that’s actually a good thing because I’m able to help guide this group along with my co-Chair who was a former Mastercard person. We are able to help guide this group without any sort of influence of being formerly in the financial community. However, we do have a lot of industry knowledge as I mentioned earlier, being in the space for many years to help guide this group and come up with the right conclusion.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, that’s really an excellent initiative, this new working group. And yeah, it’s a good example of how sometimes part of the industry is leading one direction, of course making innovations to make things more secure but sometimes you somehow ignore or don’t realise that other industries might not be in sync. And yeah, it’s very interesting to hear that. And so, we all will benefit from the work done in this initiative.</p>
<p>Dean: Yes, I think so.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, Dean, now I would like to ask you if you can give us a tip for anybody on how to protect our digital identities.</p>
<p>Dean: Well, being online these days, it can be very rewarding because we need to get business done. We need to access our accounts. Some of us take distance learning classes. We do research. And especially nowadays when many people are working from home due to this whole coronavirus situation, we have many people online at the same time at our homes, many different ages of our families. But what’s important is that we have to protect our identities and our transactions online.</p>
<p>So, there are a few things that we can do for that. Obviously, when we are online and doing financial transactions on websites, we need to look to ensure that those transactions are encrypted. And the one way to assure that is by looking for the lock in the website to show that the transaction is encrypted. The lock does not guarantee that you are at the website you think you are. So, it’s very important that you look at the website name, perhaps check the digital certificate that is securing that website before proceeding to enter personal information. And what good is encryption if we don’t know who we are encrypting to? So being able to check the authenticity of the other end is very important.</p>
<p>And then of course, there are basic tips for protecting identity. Make sure you log out of websites when you are done. Don’t just close the browser. Your web session might still be active.</p>
<p>Make sure you update any antivirus software that you might be using on your computer. Do software updates on your operating system whether you are on Apple, Macs, or PCs. These updates come out quite regularly. And make sure you stay up-to-date because those updates are there for your safety.</p>
<p>And in addition, make those updates for your cell phones, your smartphones. Those devices are also very susceptible to hackers intercepting things, and that’s why these device manufacturers come out with frequent security updates. So, it’s very important to ensure you’re up-to-date there.</p>
<p>In addition, most people don’t even check this but, for computer manufacturers, they also offer their own updates, Lenovo, Dell, HP, for their own operating system, for their own firmware, for their own device drivers. It’s important to check those on a regular basis to make sure you’re up-to-date because hackers will take advantage of vulnerabilities and weaknesses in Wi-Fi networks, Bluetooth controls, etc. to try and attack your computer. So, keeping those up-to-date is very important.</p>
<p>If you are using webcams or cameras on your phones, there had been reports in the past where hackers had been able to get into those cameras without you even knowing it. And so, keeping those cameras closed with either a little sticky note or a piece of tape is not a bad thing to do.</p>
<p>Those are some basic tips. I’m sure there are plenty of others we can think of but that’s the ones that pop into my head at the moment. So, I’ll leave it at that.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. It’s a great reminder there are many ways we can secure ourselves. Well, thanks a lot, Dean. It was a pleasure talking with you and know more about the certification authority and anything that is connected with that, like the financial industry, the browsers, and how LEIs can be in the future combined with these certificates to provide us better security and securing our identities.</p>
<p>Please, could you let us know how we can find you on the net? What are the best ways to find more about the work you are doing?</p>
<p>Dean: Well, you can always follow me on Twitter. My Twitter handle is <a href="https://twitter.com/chosensecurity">@chosensecurity</a>, that’s, all one word. And I also published periodically some blogs on <a href="https://www.digicert.com/blog">DigiCert.com/blog</a> and you will find some articles that I’ve written recently. I think those are probably the two best areas where you’ll find some of the stuff that I’ve been doing.</p>
<p>Also, if you are inclined to follow the activity of the CA/Browser Forum, all that information is publicly available. You can go to <a href="https://cabforum.org/">cabforum.org</a> and you can sign up for the public email lists for any of the working groups or just the general email list. I’ll warn you that you might get a lot of mail that you don’t really want to see but nonetheless, you can always delete that part and read what you want. So, it would be interesting for those that have a very specific interest in this area.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Many ways to find you and all the work you are doing. So again, thanks for being here, Dean, and all the best.</p>
<p>Dean: Thank you, Oscar. It was a pleasure.</p>

 [Podcast transcript] 
<p>[Intro] Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thanks for joining today. Today we’ll hear for the first time how is digital identity in the African continent. So, for that we have a special guest who is Grace Mutung’u. Grace is a research fellow at the Centre for IP and IT Law at Strathmore University in Nairobi studying digital identity and society in Kenya. She has been involved in ICT policy advocacy for over 10 years and was most recently providing support during litigation in Kenya’s digital ID case.</p>
<p>Hello Grace.</p>
<p>Grace Mutung’u: Hi, Oscar. Thanks for having me.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s a pleasure. I’m happy to have you today on the show. So the first thing I would like to hear from you is how you entered in the world of digital identity? What was your journey?</p>
<p>Grace: I just kind of stumbled upon it. I have been working in ICT policy work here in Kenya. And in 2017, we had the general elections and – something about Kenya is that people take their politics very seriously. For us in the ICT space we were observing use of technology in the elections. And we observed that there was a lot of use of digital identity from two spaces.</p>
<p>One is that the politicians were using identity data from the voters register to target voters, to vote for them. And then at the same time there was also use of social media for political discourse for political mobilisation. And later on, the news came out that one of the political parties had actually engaged the firm Cambridge Analytica for voter targeting and some sort of political manipulation. So after that we really got into the work of advocating for our rights based digital identity for data protection and for political accountability for use of digital identity data.</p>
<p>Oscar: And what would you say are today the main challenges in digital identity that Kenya is facing?</p>
<p>Grace: I’d say one big challenge is that there has been a lot of importation of ideas, technology and hardware. So for example, Kenya is one of the countries in Africa that has always had a legal identity. In Kenya, it’s the normal thing to walk around with a card, a national identity card. It’s very normal to be asked for your card in order to access a building. This just started from a long time ago during the colonial period and then over time it’s become normalised because of the security challenges that we’ve had, the terrorism issues that we’ve had, so it’s very normal to walk around with the paper identity.</p>
<p>But there have been a lot of problems with the paper identity because that identity is also proof of citizenship or status whether one is a resident or whatever else or refugee. So there are people who historically have not been able to get this identity document and therefore they have been unable to access a lot of things – from accessing buildings, to employment, to financial services because it is just so normal that you have to have an identity document in order to access all those things.</p>
<p>So now, the biggest challenge for a country like Kenya which already had a National ID is that digital ID is coming and it is targeted at those who already have identity documents. And then anybody who doesn’t have identity documents is totally excluded from the new system. So that’s one really big challenge.</p>
<p>And then when you think about digital ID generally, for a fact, almost all African countries are implementing a digital ID and by this I mean state digital ID – the state wants to issue a legal digital identity to everybody. But for sure Africans are not largely participating in that economy, in that digital ID industry. So you find that for most of the countries everything from the idea, to the software that is used, to the even algorithms for the identification, everything is imported.</p>
<p>I think the only one case we’ve seen is in Ghana where the cards are printed locally but generally there’s a lot of importation which is, if you think about it holistically is quite dangerous because it means that for a while these countries will be dependent on the suppliers of this technology. And it’s even worse for countries that don’t even insist on the companies coming to set up in their own countries so that there can be some local content. It means that people are not learning about making digital ID. We are not producers of digital ID. We are consumers of digital ID technologies which would really be a pity because it means that a lot of countries will miss out on the economic– on the whole value chain and will just be consumers and spending money on digital ID.</p>
<p>Oscar: That’s true. The first challenge you mentioned is that moving to digital ID made by the government is mostly targeted to the ones who already have a – let’s say the physical ID. So question here is how much of the Kenyan population doesn’t have an ID and what’s the reason why they don’t have it?</p>
<p>Grace: I don’t have the numbers of those who do not have but should have, but for sure some of the most problematic areas are border districts, because as you know most of the borders in Africa were drawn during the colonial period and they cut across the separated communities that had the same cultural or linguistic traditions. So you find that for example in Kenya at the southern border you find that there’s a tribe called Maasai – some are in Kenya and others are in Tanzania. Same with at the northern border with Somalia, we have Somalis from Kenya and Somalis from Somalia, same with the border with Uganda and so on.</p>
<p>So the other thing that happened for example with Kenya is that development has been largely concentrated in the centre which is very far from the borders and these communities for a long time did not get identity documents. There has been a lot of underdevelopment and so even registration of births is least in those areas. So now, the first issue that is always contested is their nationality. Because these communities just move across the border, just the same way this wildebeest migration which happens between Kenya and Tanzania. It’s the same way a pastoralist community like the Masai would move across the border depending on the economic reasons and so on.</p>
<p>So now with this digital ID you know it’s being tied to access to government services. That if somebody wants to get a passport they first have to get a digital ID. But to get a digital ID you need to have gotten either a birth certificate, which is a kind of record of where you were born, or a national ID, which is proof of your citizenship. So those historical problems like how the borders were drawn and also underdevelopment in areas that are far from the capital are some of the problems that have led to these communities not having those identity documents.</p>
<p>We also have communities that have peculiar cases. One of the communities in Kenya that has a problem accessing national ID, and is not a border community, is the Nubian community. This is a community whose ancestors are found in South Sudan but the Nubian community in Kenya – their ancestors were settled there by the British after the world wars. Their ancestors were servicemen and women in the world wars. So administration after administration just denied them or put barriers to them accessing ID and so we have generations of people who can trace their ancestry over 100 years in Kenya but they have difficulty getting those documents.</p>
<p>There are also Arabs at the coast who have most of the problems are historical and most of the problems are tied to citizenship and nationality. And that probably just goes to show us that we need to think about identity before thinking about application of digital technologies because the digital technologies are marketed as this magic bullet that will solve problems of identity in Africa. But from Kenya, for example, you can see that this is not the case. That the historical issues on citizenship and nationality that need to be sorted before digital identities is adopted.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I can get a feeling of this situation, especially for these minorities that are in the in the borders. So yeah, you already started mentioning the digital ID that is being run in Kenya – already for a project that is being already executed for a while. It’s called Huduma Namba ID. Could you tell us about that project?</p>
<p>Grace: Yeah. So, the project has been marketed as Huduma Namba. Huduma Namba is Swahili for service number. So the idea is to collate all identity information in the different government databases, to harmonise all those databases and then to have a central identity database from which ­­everybody is authenticated whenever they need to receive a government service. So the idea is that, for example, if you need to access the hospital using your national health insurance that when you present yourself, you’ll be authenticated by the national health insurance people sending a request to the central database which is being called the foundational database.</p>
<p>The design, from what we heard during the court case, is that every password would be issued with the card that has a unique number, before a password is issued with the card they would be enrolled, their biometrics would be enrolled in the system. Whenever they needed to access a service, they would provide their card and it would be authenticated in the foundational database.</p>
<p>So, for the case, there were three petitions that were consolidated into one. Their contestations in that case– the first contestation is exclusion. And exclusion is two-fold. First, there are those communities I’ve told you about – the border communities and the minorities who have a problem accessing paper documents, paper identity documents. So there’s low birth registrations in those areas, most of them don’t have the paper ID, the national ID. Therefore, they cannot be enrolled in the system. So that excludes them because the system will be a mandatory– it will be mandatory to be authenticated before you can receive a government service.</p>
<p>And then the other exclusion is that it wasn’t well thought out, this issue of biometrics. For example, the standard biometrics, they wanted to– or they have been collecting is fingerprints and iris and of course the face photograph for facial recognition, which really would work very well for maybe the middle class but it wasn’t properly thought out. And there’s evidence from a previous system, the one for elections, where a lot of people who do like casual laborers, people who work in the mines, women who plait hair, women who wash clothes all day, people who work in the coffee farms, a lot of those people their biometrics are not as legible and so it was difficult to use biometric identification to verify them during the voter registration exercise. And so, yeah, that was one of the contentions, exclusion for those lacking identity documents and then for those lacking proper biometrics.</p>
<p>And then of course, the other big contestation was privacy and data protection because at the time when this system was rolled out, we did not even have a Data Protection Act, so the Data Protection Law was enacted as the case was going on but still the law has not been operationalised. We don’t yet have the office that is supposed to oversee the law. We don’t yet have that office in place. We don’t yet have regulations that give further details on the law. We don’t have regulations on how data processes are going to register. We don’t have regulations on how government is going to handle digital ID data.</p>
<p>One other thing that was a privacy concern was the privacy of children because it was argued that children do not access services by themselves. And so collecting biometrics of children at six years – why would there be a need to authenticate children while they don’t have legal capacity? And then another big contention, I think the biggest one, was collection of DNA data because the scheme also wanted to have a digital DNA data bank. Well, the court found that this quite invasive and it could not be allowed.</p>
<p>So, in a nutshell, that is what brought about the case, basically, the issue of exclusion and also the issue of privacy. One other issue was participation, the people felt that this was such a substantive change in the governance of people that there was need to have a lot of information and a really good space for contestation and negotiation before the system was rolled out in full. Yeah, so that was the other argument, or the other ground, for that petition.</p>
<p>Yeah, the courts agreed on the issue of privacy. It ruled out collection of DNA and GPS data. And it also asked that the government first enacts a framework for digital ID, a comprehensive and sufficient framework before collecting the data and processing it. That is where the process will be, will be going to next. The government has already started drafting regulations. The petitioners are reviewing the judgment to also see how to engage with it and engage the government further. And we are waiting to see and waiting for even operationalisation of the data protection framework so that all the pieces can be in place before the system is fully rolled out.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah it sounds like this system has been somehow quite complex and ambitious. Sounds like there have been some problems of design. Since when this was started being designed? So how was supposed to start rolling out taking the identity of people without having all these data protection regulation? So when it started, it was very– some years ago or was done just recently?</p>
<p>Grace: Well, for digital ID, it started a while back. By 2015, the government had already created a platform called IPRS, Integrated Population Registry Services, that collates identity information from all the – or at least a lot of the – government databases that is on one hand. And then on the other hand, it’s also used to authenticate people using their national ID number because like I told you, we’ve had national ID for a long time and it’s very normalised. It’s a normalised thing to identify yourself as you access services.</p>
<p>However, it’s not been universal in the sense of collecting data also from children. And as you know, Kenya is one of those countries like many African countries where the majority of the population is children. And so, one of the rationales for having this Huduma Namba was to actually have identity information on everybody, including children, including those whose births are not registered.</p>
<p>And so, IPRS has been like the umbrella thing but also there have been piecemeal policies and legislations that kind of force people to acquire some sort of digital ID. For example, a lot of government services are only accessible online and through another part of IPRS called eCitizen, which is now like the portal through which people can access services. So services like application for passport or application for a driver’s license or application for a visa for foreigners – all those things are done from that portal. Even business registration is done from that portal. So the last I checked there are around 250 services offered by government that are now exclusively online.</p>
<p>A while back, we also started a policy that for children to access school, they have to produce a birth certificate. And this was kind of meant to make sure that everybody now registers the birth of their child even if you’re doing a late registration so that they can be able to access education. So yeah, those are examples of the piecemeal policies that were aimed at getting everybody to get some sort of identity document. While people are going to get this identity documents, what the government had done is that it had migrated all its services to digital. So, they were creating digital ID, the only piece that was missing in a very universal way across the country was biometrics. This system was being implemented to collect biometric data on everybody.</p>
<p>Oscar: There were already a number of e-government services already running by different institutions, and that’s one of the reasons that was pushed to have this collection of personal data on during last year. So could you tell us also what was your specific involvement during this case in the last months?</p>
<p>Grace: I was supporting the petitioners, providing some research and so on. I also gave testimony on the issue of children and digital identity. I’m of the view that there needs to be more special protection for children because once their data is collected, it’s very difficult to un-digify it or un-digitise it. Once the data is collected, it becomes re-sharable. It becomes very interesting even for analysis. They are still developing their capacity to interact with the law. Yet, when so much information about them, or data about them, is being collected it could be used to make decisions that have legal effect.</p>
<p>For example, the education system. The idea – it’s called National Education Management Information System – the idea is to keep recording the child’s journey at every step and so there was space to collect some objective, factual information like the age of the child, whether the child proceeds from one class to another. But then there’s also space for subjective information like the performance of the child, the reasons for good or bad performance.</p>
<p>Oscar: So Grace, what would you say – what was the main lesson learned from this project?</p>
<p>Grace: I think one lesson learned is that digital ID is the new- or it’s like a way of organising society. And so, all other African countries that are in different points of their digital ID journey, definitely need to look at this case and understands some of the contestations that there were and avoid them if possible. Because if we think about digital ID in that way, as a sovereignty issue, sovereignty of the people, people deciding or people participating and making a decision on how they are going to be governed, it means that the questions of design even conceptualising and designing their digital ID system should be done in a participatory way. It should be done in the most open way. People should have as much information as possible about the new systems and their role in the new system. Once their data is collected, they should have as much agency as possible. They should still be able to view their data. They should still be able to know when their data is used, especially when used for other purposes than what it was collected for.</p>
<p>And also, if the same people also want to analyse their data, it should be possible for them to analyse their data because the design of these systems has an underlying assumption that the only entity that is interested in having collective data is the government, but there are also people or groups of people who may have an interest in such data. And so, a big lesson would be that it’s a high time we started thinking about the conditions under which groups who wanted to view such data would be able to view it, how we can democratise data so that it’s not such a valuable commodity that can only be accessed by the most elites, that it can become something as accessible as how statistical data is normally released to everybody who wants to use it to better understand their society.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, that’s correct. One of the things you say is they need more participation from everybody in the society because people who went to enrol were of course, they trust that it is for the good. They are going to have the digital identity.</p>
<p>Grace: Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: But it would depend how it was designed by the government and was maybe not the best way to do it. So, I will also like to hear from– this is mostly from the public sector. If there is something in the digital identity in the private sector that is working and something especially if there are some good successful cases, successful stories in digital identity in Kenya or in the region?</p>
<p>Grace: So in the private sector, I think they are generally further ahead than the government. In fact, in this government project one of the objectives of the government was also to centralise even private data. For example, one of the good examples I think is just the mobile phone number. Because that was some democratisation of a service that was very – was preserved for very few. Back in the day, when there were landlines, landlines was for such few people but now, mobile phones I think, I forget what the figures are but we are over 80%. We have an over 80% penetration rate of mobile phones in the country.</p>
<p>How it becomes like a – not like but a sort of digital ID is that the mobile phone is unique. And at the beginning it was just for communication purposes, but now– you know Kenya, we don’t have a national addressing system. You just have to depend on people to give you directions especially after you are off the main road.</p>
<p>But with the mobile phone, this has really changed because you can give somebody, maybe a delivery service, you just need to give them the general area and then also give them the mobile phone number of where you want it delivered and they’ll be able to contact that person until they get to that particular space. So that has been quite a good – and it’s become so normal that sometimes we forget that this is the use of digital identity.</p>
<p>And now, a farther use of that mobile phone has been in financial inclusion, people who are able to use that identity to send and receive money. And at the beginning, you did not even need a bank account, you did not even need a national ID in order to use mobile money. Now, it has changed with the involvement of the government. The policy’s changed and they require– they tied it to the national ID.</p>
<p>But even with that, I mean it’s such a revolutionary thing that people can send and receive money even then they don’t have bank accounts. And with the way our society is organised in Africa with the whole rural-urban migration, the reason why a service like M-Pesa is such a big deal because it enables people to still connect to their rural people when they’re in urban areas and vice versa.</p>
<p>Now, it has even moved to digital credit, people are getting loans through their mobile phones. It is not all positive. There are very many issues that need to be resolved in that area because the digital lending depends a lot on analysis of mobile data.</p>
<p>Oscar: Grace, any other successful story about digital identity in Kenya?</p>
<p>Grace: Well, I’d say e-government is something that could be a success story if well applied because it takes services closer to the people. It also creates employment. There’s a lot of people who access e-government services through intermediaries which is I think most of the people who don’t have the requisite digital literacy will access e-government services through intermediaries. So, if only these issues were being looked at holistically, for example, the government acknowledged that its intermediaries and their role and had mechanisms to ensure that for example, cost issues are looked into, then e-government makes way more sense than going physically to government offices to receive services. Especially thinking about the size of Kenya and the role of government in a lot of day-to-day services that everybody needs.</p>
<p>So there are things that need to be corrected but definitely e-government is a very good use case for digital ID. In fact, even in the Huduma Namba case, the contention was not about digital ID per se, the contention was on issues like centralising digital ID and how that creates capacity for surveillance. But as far as improving of services is concerned, that is something that everybody can see as something that will be beneficial to most of the society.</p>
<p>Oscar: Sure. I’m sure that in the future this project, Huduma Namba, will be able to meet the needs that Kenyans have today. So what would you say in the future, what is your prediction for Kenya’s digital identity in the years to come?</p>
<p>Grace: I think for sure, there will be a lot of contestations especially where race and nationality issues are concerned. Those ones have to be resolved so for sure there’ll be a lot of contestations. And then something else I predict is that as soon we have a critical mass of Kenyans with all the knowledge that is required, we’ll see a twist in digital ID that was unexpected from all the vendors and all the software dealers who are importing these things from somewhere.</p>
<p>So, I think we are likely to see something organic and homegrown that will surprise everybody who is so intent on forcing centralised digital ID down our throats. I say this because when mobile phones came to Kenya, I don’t think anybody had imagined that there would ever be a mobile money thing. But even when they started I remember like way before mobile money came, people would use mobile money airtime as a way to send money to each other. So you’d send mobile money airtime and then that person would be able to either sell that mobile money airtime to other people and therefore get money or something like that. And this is what eventually changed to become, OK, let’s even have mobile money where you can send money directly instead of sending airtime and then the person has to try and convert that airtime into money.</p>
<p>So, I foresee something similar to that happening. Kenyans for sure are very innovative and they’ll find a way to organically find digital ID being used in a different way that wasn’t anticipated and probably in a much better way that serves the people.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, looking forward to hearing in the future the innovation in digital identity that comes from Kenya. So I will ask you this question I ask to all our guests, if you can give us a tip, a practical advice for anybody to protect our digital identities?</p>
<p>Grace: For me, because I’m an activist I think I keep telling everybody that never imagine you have nothing to hide. So, as much as you may think that these privacy activists are being too noisy with their gospel of– that we need personal privacy and data protection, I keep saying, “No, they are not being too noisy. Never imagine, you have nothing to hide because even when you have nothing to hide there are people who are your type and you know yeah, digital ID is not only about personal identifiable information but it’s also about information of people who are like you.” I think the term they are using now is demographic identifiable information. So, the tip is to care about your privacy because your privacy is also other people’s privacy.</p>
<p>Oscar: Oh yes. Yeah, I couldn’t agree more. Thanks a lot for this interview, Grace. It has been truly enlightening because some people like us, many people are listening to this podcast who are working in digital identity data protection and building, many of us building products or systems is important to know how things work in– like in Kenya and other countries where we don’t hear too much about so it’s very, very useful, many reflections to know. Please let us know how we can find you on the net, what are the best ways for that.</p>
<p>Grace: On Twitter, I am @bomu. I’m also on the CIPIT website, CIPIT is CIPIT.org and we put out a lot of information about issues that are going on especially in the African technology scene and we have a whole section on digital ID and data protection.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Again, thanks a lot, Grace. It was a pleasure meeting you, talking with you and all the best.</p>
<p>Grace: Thank you so much. It was a pleasure too.</p>

 [Podcast transcript] 
<p>[Intro] Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thanks for joining. Today we are going to hear how mobile operators around the world have joined forces to build a standard which brings not only strong authentication but also other services that help us to protect our digital identity.</p>
<p>So my guest today is Niklas Bergvall. He is Chair of the Mobile Connect Interest Group at GSMA. He leads the international Mobile Connect community developing and commercialising new identity capabilities using Mobile Connect. The Mobile Connect community engages over 70 mobile operators in over 30 countries, countless service providers, reaching over half a billion people worldwide.</p>
<p>With over 20 years of experience in the mobile ecosystem, Niklas has an exceptional understanding of the key challenges being faced when launching products and services internationally. Prior to the GSMA, Niklas launched and managed a number of global business-to-business products and services in various roles at Vodafone, Oxford Instruments and Europolitan.</p>
<p>Hi, Niklas.</p>
<p>Niklas Bergvall: Hi, Oscar. Very nice to be here on this podcast and thank you for inviting me to talk a little bit more about the identity and Mobile Connect specifically.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thanks to you. It’s really great talking with you. We really want to know more about how Mobile Connect is doing right now, what are the things coming during this New Year and ahead. But first, I would like to hear from you, how did you join, or your journey to come to, this world of digital identity?</p>
<p>Niklas: From the GSMA, it was really looking at our members. And our members’ networks as you know really underpin and have drive the– of the digital economy and its associated services. I mean as we see these services bring new challenges for businesses to protect customer identities and customer data which is both complex and costly. So, that was really the background to digital identity becoming a strategic priority for the GSMA Board a while back. We believe then and we still do that network operators have unique insights and unique capabilities that can be brought about to make digital identity better.</p>
<p>If we go from a journey where we started thinking about this to today where we have more than 4.5 billion internet users globally, accessing services, transacting personal data and money, the digital identity market is estimated to reach a value of something like 30 Billion US dollars by 2024, in five– just four years time. So it’s clearly an opportunity for lots of organisations, not least for network operators and other GSMA members.</p>
<p>Oscar: When Mobile Connect was created and how this originated?</p>
<p>Niklas: And so, I mean if you look at the history, GSMA identity program and its participating operator partners started working together about five years ago to deliver Mobile Connect, a mobile identity-based service which works by matching users with their mobile phone numbers. And we really started with this notion, digital identity is really important. At the moment, we are not doing enough there so let’s start by building a standard that we can corral together as an industry. It now offers a wide range of practical use cases such as being able to easily register and login to websites and apps, to authorising transactions and sharing specific set of personal data with online services.</p>
<p>Over the years, for example, mobile operators here in the UK, where I’m now based, offer attribute-based identity services to some of the biggest financial mergers in the countries like American Express or HSBC. In the US, this autumn we saw mobile operators launched ZenKey to allow users to login into their apps with their smartphone. Also, in other countries such as Russia, India, Spain and Germany, mobile operators have all come together, working together to bring identity services to the ecosystem.</p>
<p>So that’s really where we started, we looked at that there is a strategic opportunity, we then created some standards around this and specification, which is Mobile Connect. And then over the years we see in adoption and so the manifestation or those strategies were being put into place and can be of great use to the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, as you already started mentioning there are several use cases and today different use cases have been implemented/deployed in different countries. Coming a little bit back on the concept itself, how would you describe Mobile Connect to an end user, to an individual?</p>
<p>Niklas: For an end user, if you look at some of the authentication services, and what service providers and end users are struggling with is the need to manage risk or prevent the wrong person to get hold of data or transact on your behalf, as well as create a simple and nice experience for you as a user, friction free is often mentioned. And if we look for instance, China Mobile, they are using a service from Mobile Connect called Verified MSISDN Share. Basically, China Mobile shares the MSISDN with the service provider of the devices connected to the service provider. And the SP then uses that MSISDN, that phone number, as an identifier to give access to the correct user account.</p>
<p>In this case, the user doesn’t really see Mobile Connect at all. All they are seeing is that they are being logged in and they get hold of the right data, and obviously they also take confidence that this data is not being given to someone else. But there you have a fiction free experience and we’ve seen some tremendous numbers in this over the last two years. China Mobile have grown transactions per day with over 800% and they’re now doing 1.1 billion daily transaction, powering an ecosystem in China with over 300 commercial partners, enabling over- secure authentication on over 3,000 applications including 82 of the top 200 apps and 6 out of the 10 top applications. So, clearly, great use for the ecosystem partners, great service from China Mobile. But as an end user, you don’t really see it or experience that this is Mobile Connect, all you’re seeing is that you’re being simply logged in.</p>
<p>In other countries, when you look at the authentication services, you might see a SIM applet, for instance the operators in Spain have launched a new click OK to login and so forth. So there it’s the clear user experience and it’s clear that there’s an authentication service called Mobile Connect provided by the operator.</p>
<p>Oscar: &nbsp;And now that you mentioned this in Spain, I have seen that one in Spain so it’s very, very simple. It’s no password so that’s one of the biggest benefits, authentication without passwords.</p>
<p>Niklas: Absolutely. Authentication without passwords and it’s really coming to what are we trying and what is everyone working really hard in the ecosystem, to create friction free journeys that allow for you to place the trust in service provider, to trust them with your data, with your money or whatever it is that you’re transacting as an end user.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. I can see a huge potential because mobile operators are big, you know the exact numbers but a huge number of billions of people already have a mobile subscription, something that many people don’t have like a bank account for instance, but they have a mobile subscription. And in this mobile subscription, the operator already has verified their identity, the personal identity and has some personal information that helps to do these services like strong authentication based on verified identity or the other services you mentioned – the one in China, for instance. Could you tell us now, how is the adoption worldwide nowadays, let’s say in terms of countries or continents, what would you say?</p>
<p>Niklas: So, at the moment, the numbers we’re tracking, we got about 70 mobile network operators that have implemented Mobile Connect residing in approximately 40 markets. Obviously, they’re at various stages in let’s say, maturity, a number of success stories are emerging. And I think there are a number of factors that are driving how quickly the operators are able to march in their individual market.</p>
<p>And one of the key things we’ve noted within the GSMA in order for these types of solution to really get traction in a particular market, it’s important for the operators, typically you would have three, four mobile operators in a country that also operators are working together so that for a service provider you were able to authenticate the entire user base in a consistent manner – otherwise it’s much harder to really drive adoption and a lot of usage.</p>
<p>Oscar: Is that a requirement, let’s say, if one mobile operator in one country wants to start using Mobile Connect, it’s a requirement that all the other operators in the country have to also use Mobile Connect or make agreements?</p>
<p>Niklas: No, I wouldn’t say it’s a requirement as such, but we see that typically in markets where you have, let’s say, competition between operators and they are about equal size, it helps if they are working in concert. Maybe not all of them have to launch on the same day but it there’s a roadmap to get to let’s say 60%, 70% of the users in that market up to a mobile authentication solution or an attribute service or something that helps to really create that marketplace.</p>
<p>But we have outliers like for instance Turkcell have been very successful with their Fast Connect implementation, Fast Login, based on Mobile Connect. And they are now processing transaction of well over 30 million per month. They are doing that across the ecosystem and they’ve opened it up for service providers. Turkcell as well, they are a very strong operator with outspoken ambition to become more than a mobile operator and a digital service provider. They have music services and digital services and so forth where they are using their Fast Login service as well, obviously driving transaction, training users and therefore creating more value for other service providers to take after Fast Login solution.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Sure. I understand that. It’s not required that all the operators have to agree to implement Mobile Connect. But yeah, I understand that it’s in their best interest of one operator that also some of the other operators at least also implement it, at least are in the roadmap. So the ecosystem, the market is significant in that country.</p>
<p>So, I would like to hear now more a bit more in detail some concrete examples in some countries how some operators in one country have implemented some other services, and how others in different countries, different service of Mobile Connect.</p>
<p>Niklas: OK. I mean I think I’ve already referenced China Mobile. I think that really something to pause for thought. The fact that a service such as Verified MSISDN Share can get up to 1.1 billion daily transactions and the growth that they’ve had 800% over the last two years to get to that stage and still growing. It just shows this need for friction free and secured user journeys. And what we’re seeing now that the European operators across a number of countries are looking to enable those types of services. And we can talk a little bit about what’s going to happen next later, but I think that’s a key success I think for just to proving the case for Mobile Connect.</p>
<p>I think another thing that’s very, very interesting and topical in Europe today and it relates to strong customer authentication and PSD2, some regulation that the European Union is driving in the financial services space where a number of banks now were looking at how can we harden or improve on SMS OTP. And that was then the UK operators have launched the service called Account Takeover Protection or ATP. In this service they share information when the lost SIM swap happen on that particular MSISDN so if you received a new SIM card basically.</p>
<p>Why is this important? I think across a number of countries not only in Europe but across the world, fraudsters through social engineering are tricking mobile operators to handout a SIM card to them and obviously with that SIM card and other information they are now able to transact on someone’s bank account and with the new SIM card they can then connect the SMS OTP and transfer money for that user illegitimately. Obviously for the bank to find out what the date of the lost SIM swap gives them an indication, is this high risk transaction or is it low risk transaction for that type of account takeover.</p>
<p>And the UK, we’re seeing promising signs and there and as I said the European operators are now looking to roll that type of attribute service out across the continent. And this in combination with the service that China Mobile has sold out Verified MSISDN Share or match those two services together, it can really I’d say tighten up on secure authentication when you’re looking at some ways to replace or harden SMS OTP.</p>
<p>Oscar: About the one in UK that you just mentioned this Mobile Connect, Account Takeover Protection, so who offer to whom? So, for instance, the operator offers this service to the financial institutions that is the…</p>
<p>Niklas: Yes. So, I mean the way you look at the ecosystem, obviously the banks are large enough to buy directly from the operators in the UK but typically they would go through some type of channel partner, not talking specifically about this solution or any particular bank but in the Mobile Connect Interest Group, we’ve got companies such as Payfone, Boku, BICS Telesign, Infobip who are all working to aggregate this type of attribute services from all operators and then as a single point provide this to a financial institution. And that’s typically what we’re seeing happening here in the UK in terms of how the banks and the financial services particularly is considering these services from the operators. It’s very similar to the messaging and how SMS is being consumed by banks for SMS OTP.</p>
<p>Oscar: Correct. Yes, other countries for instance?</p>
<p>Niklas: On the authentication side, I also touched on Turkcell before and I think that is really a case in just showing how an operator is saying you know, we want to be more than an operator and drive, let’s say, become a digital service player and that identity has a place in our strategy to become just that.</p>
<p>Another example I think again, I think I’ll come back to the UK, but Three here integrated with Boku to offer some fraud prevention capabilities to service providers such as MoneyGram, a money transfer service. And in this case, new customers that register to MoneyGram will check the information such as name and address with the records that the mobile operator Three has on file for that number. And this kind of case study has shown that the KYC data helped MoneyGram to comply with their own KYC regulations and prove identity with the customers. And at the same time, it proves the case for mobile attributes for Three.</p>
<p>Oscar: And in the case of using Mobile Connect for authentication you mentioned Turkcell as it seems to be one of the best implementations for Mobile Connect for authentication. In that case, is it because Turkey doesn’t have strong authentication methods or there are others competing in that country? So, how is the scenario in strong authentication in Turkey and how Turkcell found this niche?</p>
<p>Niklas: If you want to take that of users or consumers to start using your authentication service, it’s so important to have the services that are of interest to those consumers. And Turkcell working hard to become a digital service provider and having all of those services, music and TV and so forth, they were able to quickly connect their identity efforts with great services which users and consumers wanted to consume and needed to authenticate to consume. So they had that they– since they act as a service provider themselves and an identity provider and an operator, they had all of that in-house and then they were also able to attract external service providers to use their authentication service.</p>
<p>I think in some countries where you’re launching an operator identity service and the only thing that you’re being able to authenticate against is the operator’s internal portal for services, as an end user, as a consumer, you don’t go in often enough there to really warrant your learning and using in earnest a new authentication solution, so it’s much harder. And without consumers being trained to authenticate, it’s also much harder to attract service providers to add your authentication solution as one of the ways that they allow their consumers to authenticate on their sites.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. Yes. And now it’s clear at least to me that in the case of Turkcell, they invested a lot in creating services because that is what people really want are their buying services and they added the identity as part of the portfolio. So definitely a very good example.</p>
<p>Niklas: Yeah, I think you know Oscar, it may be that you and I and you know some of the listeners of this podcast, they are interested in identity. For most of the world, it’s just the necessary evil to get to the service you want to access and also to protect your data. But it’s not something that you just try out or play with. You simply just accept it’s there and you want it to be easy and reasonable.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. Most of the people are not trying, “OK, let’s try the 10 coolest authentication methods, right?” Nobody does that. People are trying apps. I guess a few guys will do it but not many. Yeah, that’s correct. Many people are trying all the time new services, new apps. That’s what majority people are doing. That’s true. It’s an excellent observation you have done.</p>
<p>What about for service providers who might be listening to these, organisations who are using some authentication methods, some strong, some not so strong, but might consider using Mobile Connect now they are listening to us. How in concrete organisations can benefit with having Mobile Connect as an authentication method?</p>
<p>Niklas: It really comes down to the chain of digital experience that you’re looking to create for your users and consumers. And what’s getting in the way of making those experiences amazing at the moment, and since we’re talking about Mobile Connect particularly when it comes to logging in and using and protecting the services and the data in there. So, I think you know I highlighted it with at least some of the success cases and examples. What some service providers have found really appealing with operator in network data is that services can be designed with little or no impact to the user experience as well as reduce the risk of fraud. So you have an ability to reduce friction and reduce the risk of fraudulent access to services. I think that’s really something to consider.</p>
<p>I mean in Europe now, we’re seeing a momentum amongst all of the operators across the continent to either launch or they are in the process or launching identity services such as a Verified MSISDN and ATP.</p>
<p>Again, just to make sure that it’s clear a Verified MSISDN, that’s a service provider request, operates to match the mobile number associated with the IP address of the SP’s users, the mobile number that the SP has on file. And once you have that matches an SP, you can then say, “Now, I know this user is browsing into my portal and can open up the services without the user having to do something.” So this can be used as the single authentication or it can used alongside the usual, or let’s say authentication ways that you have already put in place such as a password and username.</p>
<p>And you know ATP again to get the information of when the last SIM change took place to be able to assess the risk that this mobile number might have been taken over by a fraudster and then have a slightly different journey if you believe there might be a risk for that.</p>
<p>The ones who are in Europe, I would it’s worthwhile to discuss with your operators or potentially a channel partner such as Boku, Payfone, IDEMIA, Callsign and BICS Telesign about what are the new attributes that are coming out here that we should potentially be considering in the digital markets.</p>
<p>For your listeners in the US, who’re looking at this, you know these top services are Verified MSISDN and KYC and then Account Takeover Protection have been available in the States for some time. And I would now believe that you will be able to access similar type of services from them as here in Europe so that means that you can bring over some of those learnings and experiences created for emerging users over to Europe.</p>
<p>Oscar: And now, as you mentioned, how’s– not only the operators are the ones who offer these services because they are distributors, could you tell me what is the best way if someone is from some country where Mobile Connect is less developed where the operator is already working in that, may have some service but it’s difficult to find out about that. So what is the best way if maybe you are a service provider in a country where you haven’t heard so much about Mobile Connect? The best way is to contact to the operator or whom to contact?</p>
<p>Niklas: You can contact operators if you have a contact. If you are already using let’s say SMS services and you’re buying it from someone there, the channel partners, that is probably a quicker route to get access. Typically, where we’re seeing the operators, this kind of resides either in their business unit for corporate services or it resides in carrier services and either way it can be slightly difficult for a service provider to find the right contact and a lot of the operators are using channel partners and I mentioned a few of them – Payfone, Infobip, Boku and BICS and Telesign. They are probably the ones that are already selling SMS and other messaging services to you today so this could be where you need to extend that relationship and consume a little bit more from those players.</p>
<p>However, if you do end up not finding the right contact, you’re always welcome to browse into GSMA and you’ll find us there under Mobile Connect GSMA or Identity GSMA and you can send us a message and we’ll do our best to connect it to the relevant players in the countries where you have interest.</p>
<p>Oscar: All right. Yeah, thanks for that clarification. Yeah. But it make sense, the channel partners such as the one who provide SMS services or message services are of course, most likely good channels to find more information about Mobile Connect in every country. So, if you like to say something else about Mobile Connect…</p>
<p>Niklas: Well, I think you know it’s always worth plugging a little bit the Mobile Connect Interest Group that you introduced in the beginning of this call which I chair. And basically, it’s a forum which is open for all GSMA members, operators as well as associate members, to basically share, collaborate and learn about what the community is doing about in identity. We run our online collaboration, we have monthly calls and we organise two summits every year. So for those who are members in the GSMA feel free to contact us and join the group.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, excellent. Niklas, now could you finally give us a tip for anybody, how to protect our digital identities?</p>
<p>Niklas: The rule that I tried to live by is never to pick up unsolicited messages. If it’s not being initiated by myself, I simply don’t engage. That’s helped me to protect my identity so far, so that’s something that I would always encourage my family members and others to abide by.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I would be very suspicious about any unsolicited message whatever the channel it comes.</p>
<p>Niklas: Exactly Oscar. And do you have final questions, final thoughts?</p>
<p>Oscar: No, I think it has been very, very educational, the many things about Mobile Connect that I didn’t know and I know it’s interesting to share with us, with our audience. It’s a standard Ubisecure has been working together also for a few years. And yeah, I think they like to see how things are being implemented in other continents. So yeah, thanks a lot for sharing this with us. Could you finally tell us how we can find even more information about Mobile Connect?</p>
<p>Niklas: Yes. And thanks again Oscar for inviting us to talk about identity. I’ve really enjoyed our conversation. So, if you want to find out more about Mobile Connect and the identity efforts that the GSMA is driving, please put this in any search engine “GSMA identity” or “GSMA Mobile Connect” and you’ll find our pages, there you’ll contact details and a bit more information about our programme and how we work. And don’t be a stranger. Feel free to get in touch. We love to hear from the community and to help drive the digital identity agenda.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Well, thanks a lot Niklas for this every interesting conversation, for sharing everything that’s going on in Mobile Connect. And I wish you all the best.</p>
<p>Niklas: Thank you.</p>
<p>[Outro] Thanks for listening to this episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity produced by Ubisecure. Stay up to date with episode at ubisecure.com/podcast or join us on Twitter @ubisecure and use the #LTADI. Until next time.</p>

 Let’s talk about digital identity with Andy Milton, Head of Channels at Hitachi Digital Security. 
<p>In episode 15, Oscar talks to Andy about Hitachi’s pioneering finger-vein biometrics – VeinID Five. Hear about its use cases (present and future), the evolution of the product to its current form, comparison with other biometric and non-biometric authentication methods and, importantly, the relevant privacy and security risk mitigations.</p>
<p>[Scroll down for transcript]</p>
<blockquote><p>“I think it’s going to be an interesting time in the biometric world. I think we will start to see that one biometric is not necessarily the best at everything. So we are going to see lots of different applications of different technology and at different times. And what we will potentially start to see is also some of them start to become blended together as well.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Andy Milton is Head of Channels and Marketing for Hitachi Security Business Group. He joined Hitachi in November 2018 to lead and develop the channel strategy for the Hitachi Security Business Group in EMEA and North America.

 [Podcast transcript] 
<p>Intro: Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello, and thanks for joining. Today, we will hear about a very novel authentication method, multi-factor authentication method based on biometrics that you might not have heard before. My guest today is Andy Milton from Hitachi.</p>
<p>Andy Milton is Head of Channels and Marketing for Hitachi Security Business Group. He has more than 20 years of experience in cybersecurity across many companies.</p>
<p>Hello, Andy!</p>
<p>Andy Milton: Hello, Oscar. How are you?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good and very happy to talk with you today about what Hitachi is doing with this very interesting new authentication method. So I would like to hear first from you how your career, how life led you to this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Andy: OK. So just over 20 years ago now, I made a decision to move from engineering IT into security as it looked like it was becoming interesting and a hot market space, and that has proved to be very successful and a very good choice. So after working for several different vendors and partners and resellers, I’ve now found myself with the opportunity to join Hitachi with the addition of their new VeinID product, Five, which is very exciting for us all. I joined just over a year ago.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. Fabulous. So you joined cybersecurity really many years ago and you have been in this industry since then. And very recently as you said, you are in Hitachi with this very interesting product and technology that we are going to hear about today. So that’s the next thing that I would like to hear actually. What is Hitachi hand gesture technology?</p>
<p>Andy: OK. Hitachi has been using technology to read the Vein pattern within the centre section of someone’s finger for just over 20 years. Originally, it was developed to be used in cash points in Japan rather than having to type in a PIN number or if you were going to perform a higher-value transaction, they would want to really make sure that the person standing there wasn’t just the person with the card and a PIN, it was actually the person that is the owner of the account. So they started developing this technology to be used in cash points. We’ve deployed it in Japan, Poland, Turkey, and many other European countries.</p>
<p>The technology then evolved and we were able to put into more desktop type devices which enable us to do – operate payments with people like Barclays and other large banks, SocGen, and others. And what that then created is more of an interest in this type of technology. The accuracy of it, the speed at which it can read someone’s finger vein and the level we were able to manage so we then moved to doing some projects around things like pay by finger. Currently, we have an ongoing project with Copenhagen Business School where all the students can use their finger by inserting it into one of our readers to make a payment, which is very innovative and has been very well-accepted. And we are seeing several more of those start across Europe.</p>
<p>Now, one of our customers came to us. He moved from one of our existing customers to a new one and he approached us and said, “I cannot give somebody a device to carry around, so if you can find a way of enabling the accuracy and the speed of what you do with using a standard webcam on a normal laptop or a mobile device that then I would be really extremely interested”. And that process started about two years ago in Japan and we are now at the point where we are launching the product.</p>
<p>So all you need to do to authenticate yourself is simply raise your hand in a high-five like gesture to your laptop camera and it will log you into the system, so replacing your Windows password and removing the need for a password there. Also, as we continue to an iteration of this, and this is where we are working with Ubisecure is enabling someone to access a website or a third-party service simply by raising their hand to the camera.</p>
<p>And what this provides, as a differentiator I think, is the ability to uniquely identify someone with something that is part of them and can’t be borrowed or lent or given to somebody else.</p>
<p>Oscar: So this evolution of around 20 years, there was already some first product with this hand recognition. And now, this is a newer product based on as you said, some customer requirements to make things simpler, getting rid of the special reader.</p>
<p>Andy: Yes. Yes, and reducing costs. The physical readers were quite an expensive device that you certainly wouldn’t use them as something that was disposable. But now, we can use the standard camera technology within a laptop or a mobile. This is something that everybody already has so it’s simply a software license. So it becomes much more flexible and much easier to use. The real strength in our product is the user experience. It’s really much more pleasant than typing passwords, trying to remember passwords, especially if you are accessing a service or website that is not used for a couple of months, maybe when you come back to it, it becomes very difficult to remember for most people what password they’ve used.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. Could you explain this a bit more – how it works, this hand gesture recognition? What is the pattern that is taken, how, and why this is better than other biometric methods?</p>
<p>Andy: OK. The vein pattern within your finger as a human is totally unique, more unique than several of the other biometrics that people have used. But always with biometrics, there is a process that we are going to take, that capture is going to go through. So Hitachi, with the banking background, have developed a very secure method of capturing, processing, and storing that so that what we capture on the way out is a mathematical representation of the vein structure within your finger.</p>
<p>Now, we can detect that with a standard camera, with the normal light that’s around. We then take that capture because we can see the blood in someone’s finger, that that gives us proof of life which is always a challenge with some of the biometric solutions. We’ve probably all seen the films of Mission Impossible or some of the others, people taking fingerprints that have been left behind or wearing masks to fool facial identity, or an even more horrible one, they removed someone’s eye to do retina or iris scanning. It’s never particularly great and it’s quite a horrible thing to see.</p>
<p>But that for us is one of our benefits. What we are capturing on someone is actually hidden within their body. We are able to see that with the camera. We are able to take out that image and process it. Convert that into a mathematical template, store that somewhere safe. And what we take out to store as our template is not what is replayed when someone tries to authenticate. So the two templates are different. So that helps us ensure that we are not seeing a replay of someone’s enrolment template back to us as an attempt to spoof our system.</p>
<p>So you asked as part of the question, why are we better than other biometrics? I think it’s going to be an interesting time in the biometric world. I think we will start to see that one biometric is not necessarily the best at everything. So we are going to see lots of different applications of different technology and at different times. And what we will potentially start to see is also some of them start to become blended together as well. So maybe using facial with voice or other things because I think this is all about proving someone’s identity. So making sure that the person that you’re capturing that information from is really that person who is there. It becomes more important. And how we are going to do that, becomes the key to our success.</p>
<p>Now, our particular solution that we are doing now for laptops and mobile for password replacement is extremely secure and extremely fast. As I said before, really easy experience for the user. They’re simply just raising their hand to the camera, positioning it in our template and it’s authenticating them in less than a couple of seconds. So for a user, that’s so, so much easier than typing in complex passwords that they probably potentially forget.</p>
<p>But also, when we look at from a business point of view, on the receiving end of that template or managing that customer interaction, what companies are seeing is if they can look after a customer and keep them within their digital channels – so website, mobile phone apps, these types of things – then the cost to the company is very small on looking after that customer and giving them a good experience. But once that customer moves to other channels like phone or web help or other things, the cost of looking after that customer increases quite substantially.</p>
<p>So finding a way that they don’t have to constantly be resetting and managing people’s passwords, and also dealing with the frustration of customers in having to manage and look after and maintain their passwords, is also a huge benefit as well. Because customer frustration with a password, even though it’s the customer’s responsibility to look after and maintain and remember, their frustration is always directed at the website they are trying to authenticate to and ultimately the service they are trying to access.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it’s pretty impressive the way that this– you don’t need any special device, just a webcam or the camera from the mobile phone can recognise this pattern. It’s definitely pretty impressive and looking forward to seeing this in more and more applications. Well, now that I talk about applications, could you tell us– you mentioned already one example in Denmark but do you have other examples where this is being used today or where it’s– what is coming next?</p>
<p>Andy: Yes. So the applications for us are going to be very similar to the ones we’ve done with our physical readers. Time and attendance management for employees. We’ve seen quite a lot of interest in doing – working hours management in Spain, they’ve been introduced a law where they specifically specify that an employee needs to track and the company needs to track the hours the employees worked, so we’ve seen quite a lot of interest in places like that.</p>
<p>Access to hospitality venues. We’ve got projects going with Wembley Stadium, Lord’s Cricket Ground, Ascot Racecourse, Henley-on-Thames for the rowing – so some very prestigious venues in the UK already working with us.</p>
<p>But I think specifically for this VeinID Five product, I think we’re going to see more applications around online services and around payments and banking and accessing certain services for users. So we are working with a mobile telco operator that has recognised they have a big problem with people forgetting and not remembering their passwords, as most of the time they access their services on their mobile device and if they then have to move to the website to do something more complicated, invariably, they don’t remember their password.</p>
<p>We also have seen in insurance and financial services, where companies have multiple different portals for different solutions and products that they’ve either bought or developed over time, combining that with the solution that Ubisecure’s has enabled us to do a single sign-on process for them simply by raising their hand and then they get access to all the services.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. Well, there are definitely – as you say, there are many possibilities of where to apply this technology. It’s mostly a second factor authentication, right? There will be always or most of the time one – let’s say, username-password or some method and the hand gesture the second.</p>
<p>Andy: Yeah. We would envisage that someone would enter a username and that then enables them to pull the template for that person to the machine and then they’re authenticating against that template. That is how we see this working most efficiently and effectively for both the customer and for the supplier.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. And I’m sure someone listening to this might start thinking of the privacy about getting this – the pattern, where it is stored, etc. So, what would you say about privacy? This pattern that you are– there is an enrolment as a first process when you enrolled your hand. I think you have to do both hands? You enrol the both hands. Where are these patterns stored and how are they processed after that?</p>
<p>Andy: Yeah. So we often get the common misconception that we are capturing a picture of someone’s hand and that might be able to– we’ve captured a picture of the hand, then people can steal that and use it in other places. But that’s absolutely not the case. No point in our capture process do we capture an image of the hand. What we are doing is – the data from the camera we analyse in real time, create a mathematical representation or a template, however you want to describe that, of what we’ve done that looks like someone’s vein pattern. And that we then encrypt and is stored in an encrypted database as well.</p>
<p>And what we capture is not what we then replay back to the device. So we actually run a sophisticated process where we mix the template with some other information that means that the template going out is not the same as the template coming back. So the solution is very, very secure. And it has been built this way because of the projects we’ve had working in the banking industry. We’ve approached this market from, as I said, 20 years’ experience in working with banking, banks don’t use insecure solutions.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. The fact that you just explained that this pattern or templates or however you call it, when you enrol, when you capture for the first time the vein pattern that it’s never the photo so it’s just a set of data points, mathematical pattern of that. Well, that’s already a security measure for not being able to copy that and use it later.</p>
<p>And then where is this pattern stored? Is it locally on the mobile phone or laptop or is it on your servers? Where is that stored?</p>
<p>Andy: There are a couple of different solutions depending on how we do this. We’re either storing it in a cloud-based server or we can store it locally on the machine. So the user is in control of where their template is. Typically with most of the services we are talking with you, we are going to be storing them in the cloud and then deliver it at the time that the user authenticates, because we envisage that we may see occasions where somebody has lost their mobile phone and needs to go on a laptop that they’ve never used before so we need to be able to deliver the template to that device at the time they are trying to get access.</p>
<p>Oscar: So there is a possibility of both, stored locally or stored in the servers, in the cloud.</p>
<p>Andy: Yes.</p>
<p>Oscar: And that leads to another question that comes from there – is that Hitachi provides this as a service or as their customer, let’s say the bank, the bank will install your hand gesture system in their server. So which one – or both?</p>
<p>Andy: It actually could be both. The customer would need to install a small application on their laptop or on their phone but that would actually only be triggered by an external service making the call to start the process. So for example, you were trying to access your bank website. The bank website, type in your username, it says, “Yup, this is Andy. OK. Here’s Andy’s template.” Send it to the machine and the machine then loads that for you to match against within our application.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. Yes. So both are possible. Also, that makes a very flexible solution of course for any organisation that is considering doing this.</p>
<p>Andy: Yes. So the bank or the finance company or the service provider also has control of the identities that are on their system. So helping them reduce that risk.</p>
<p>A couple of other things we’ve seen that start to help with this is a substantial reduction in the risk of someone being subjected to a phishing attack because if you are no longer entering a username and a password, these emails that you get asking you to click on here and enter your username and your password, still is accounting for a huge amount of the issues we see. So removing the password typing in piece and it’s literally, raise your hand. That removes that problem and that saves that issue for the user.</p>
<p>As well, the other problem we see this really addressing is password stuffing where it might not be the website that you’ve got this password on but that you’ve used the same password on another website. You see a hacker find that password and that username and then they try that username and password on lots of different associated websites. We are seeing this take place a lot. And the removal of passwords will really slow that process down and remove it and provide a much greater level of security for both the end user and the supplier.</p>
<p>And obviously, the suppliers to the customers, more and more they are going to– under things like GDPR, they have to prove that they’re doing everything they can to protect the users.</p>
<p>Oscar: You said that the technology was using – some time ago when it was created, this hand gesture technology was using physical readers and it moved to this method without readers, just using a webcam. So this new portfolio of products that we are talking about is only about using the webcam, correct?</p>
<p>Andy: Yeah, it’s only about using the webcam- or the webcam solution is pretty well-finished and ready and commercially available. The mobile phone version comes within the next few months as well. So we will see more and more applications of this.</p>
<p>Oscar: And how compatible let’s say with all devices, all computers, all laptops or even all mobile phones?</p>
<p>Andy: Yup. OK. That’s a lot of questions in one go. A laptop, we are looking at a Windows-based device, Windows 10 and newer. We expect to see at least a 720p camera which is most reasonable business spec laptops of the last two, three years, and then a few other sort of bits and pieces after that. But predominantly, we expect this to be available on most standard laptops for people to use. We don’t need an extremely high-resolution camera and we certainly don’t need an infrared camera or anything else. We are able to read the vein pattern just with the ambient light that reflects through people’s skin. Your skin is actually much more transparent than you realise and we are able to capture enough information from that.</p>
<p>The mobile devices – they are still in testing at the moment. We are expecting it to be Android from the last but one version so I can’t remember the names of all the Android ones off the top of my head. But we were talking Samsung Galaxy S8, we’ve done testing on an S9 and then obviously the newer ones. When we look at Apple phones, we were iPhone X and onwards, that there is some parameters we are working on with some of the devices. But actually, the great thing about all the modern cameras is they have a flash in the back so they actually enable us to create a very stable lighting environment. The cameras on mobiles are actually higher quality than they are in your laptop.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, that’s true. Yeah, interesting. So yeah, actually it means that it’s going to fit most of the laptops and webcams that exist today. Of course, I will always say, if someone wants to use any system in a let’s say unsupported version of Windows, that’s already making their system unsecure no matter what is the authentication method they plan to use. So it makes sense that it’s compatible with Windows 10 which is available already for many years.</p>
<p>Andy: Yes.</p>
<p>Oscar: So how do you foresee more in the future this technology that is now being deployed in these last two years and then this year as there are many projects coming? How do you see a bit more in the future of how this technology will be used?</p>
<p>Andy: I have to be careful. I’ll get told off here if I talk too much about futures. But we will see it used across a lot more different platforms. So at the moment, we talk about laptops and mobiles, but actually as we start to move forward, we think about televisions – and can a television have a webcam on it these days? Absolutely. Could that track enable you to authenticate to your TV service? This is all potential.</p>
<p>And then we talk about boxes that are attached to TVs, gaming consoles, just about anything that would have a camera attached to it that there is potential.</p>
<p>We’ve had someone approached us about asking whether we would be interested in doing something for access control on domestic property. We’ve had somebody else approach us just asking if we’re interested in looking at automotive applications of the technology. And all the things that we are doing, we will look at. There’s going to be lots of other different applications of our technology that we’re going to see over the next few years I think.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, right. I haven’t thought that but yeah, TV certainly and game consoles already are some of the next candidates of course for this as they already have some cameras on it, good enough camera, more than good enough cameras for this technology for sure.</p>
<p>Andy: Yeah. And it’s interesting, your car today has cameras on it. And actually it’s about how we could potentially use those to do things – to remove the need for keys and other stuff.</p>
<p>Oscar: Andy, could you now give us a tip for anybody, how we can protect our digital identities?</p>
<p>Andy: As not everybody will have a VeinID Five today and it’s not rolled out to everywhere yet, the tip I always used to use was try to build something that’s not a dictionary word to use as a password. So we typically use a specific phrase, so it would be something like “England won the World Cup in 1966”. And then we would take the first letters of all of those and that would be what would make the foundation of the password. And then to add some uniqueness, I would always then add a couple of letters from the website from the first few letters of the website into the string at some point so that it creates something that’s truly unique and can’t be- as I said one of the issues with passwords is not only to keep making them very complex is hard, but also making them not be able to be reused across lots of different websites.</p>
<p>So yeah, think of a particular phrase that means something specific to you and then insert some letters out of the name of the website that you’re accessing into that string, and that then lets you create a unique password each time.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it sounds like that’s a good method because even though things like- thanks to technologies like Hitachi hand gesture, we still need a few passwords for the next years so I think we don’t get rid of them completely, in the short term at least. So yeah, that’s a good method. Thanks for sharing that.</p>
<p>And if you have something else to tell us about the Hitachi hand gesture technology that we haven’t covered…?</p>
<p>Andy: I think we pretty well-covered everything that someone would need to know. We are currently as I said, working with you guys [Ubisecure] to integrate into your platform and several other applications. So I guess if people are keen and interested to learn more, they can contact us through the Hitachi Digital Security, so it’s <a href="http://www.digitalsecurity.hitachi.eu">www.digitalsecurity.hitachi.eu</a>. Through that website if they’d like to find out more information or contact me directly and we will happily find a way talk about what we are doing and how we might be able to help them and work with them.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. Thanks a lot for this very interesting conversation and learning more about this unique technology that I really hope to see in the next months and be able to try myself in some application. Hopefully, services will start enabling that.</p>
<p>Andy: Good. Yup. I’m looking forward to it, Oscar. I’m excited about the partnership with you guys [Ubisecure] because I think it makes the application or the technology much more effective than we’ve been doing just on Windows passwords.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. Yes, we are. Absolutely. And yeah, all the best on this endeavour for you, Andy, and Hitachi. And let’s keep in touch. So have a nice day.</p>
<p>Andy: Excellent. Thank you very much. Thanks, Oscar.</p>

 [Podcast transcript] 
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Hello! Thanks for joining today. We will have a conversation about eGovernment, a very interesting conference coming now in February, and many more things. So let me introduce to you our guest today, Rainer Hörbe. He graduated in Computer Science at the University of Vienna. Working as a software developer for some years, he then specialised in identity and access management starting in 2001. In roles as security and identity architect, he contributed to projects like the Austrian eGovernment identity federation and European framework projects, epSOS and MAPPING.</p>
<p>He is chair of the eGovernment Work Group at Kantara Initiative and contributor to standardisation activities in standards developing organisations like ISO SC27. He started the TIIME event, an annual identity conference in 2013.</p>
<p>Currently, he has the position of a Senior Manager at KPMG Austria, consulting clients in different sectors on the enterprise IAM topics.</p>
<p>Hi, Rainer.</p>
<p>Rainer Hörbe: Hi, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: Welcome. Very nice talking with you. So it’s starting now- just talking that we are in the middle of winter there, a little bit minus on your side, a little bit of sun.</p>
<p>Rainer: Yeah. Thank you for having me. It’s a good opportunity to start the year with identity management and eGovernment.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. So let’s get started. Let’s talk about digital identity. So I would like to hear first from you how you entered this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Rainer: So well, I think in 2020, a 40-year professional anniversary. And around half of that time, so almost 20 years ago, after working mostly as a software engineer, I came into identity and access management. So before that, I was exposed to topics like PKI and the host mainframe identity management tool, RACF, Lotus Notes, directories, etc. And I obviously as a developer had to do authentication, etc.</p>
<p>But I would say from today’s point of view, I was living in blissful ignorance because I didn’t understand identity management. Well, today still, if I could cite a Game of Thrones character, Ygritte, she was always saying to Jon Snow, “You know nothing.” Identity management is such a vast topic that I still think there are many, many things to be learned.</p>
<p>So just to make it short, after my first project in the Austrian government, the Central Residency Database, I had the opportunity to move into a project to federate government-to-government authentication and authorisation. And this was a project that I was accompanying for almost 16 years. And the interesting thing about this project was that the Central Citizen Registry was kind of a killer application at that time for establishing a government federation which is today almost 100% pervasive.</p>
<p>And beyond that, I did the usual things in IAM, some role manager, two factor authentication, data-clearing jobs. So I’ve been writing policies. I’ve been working on SAML profiles with open-source products. What I find interesting in general that people in my profession, identity and access management experts, usually have a pretty strong background with some commercial product, and this I don’t have. So I have been doing projects in various areas without commercial products, developing from scratch or using open source products up until recently.</p>
<p>Oscar: So half of your career so far is dedicated to digital identity. And one of the main things you’ve been doing in the last years is eGovernment as you mentioned. So, how do you define eGovernment?</p>
<p>Rainer: So eGovernment is the digitisation of processes between the government and citizens, businesses, other government entities, or different levels of government from municipal to state, national, EU, United Nations, whatever. So there are different concerns in government like social, economic, legal, organisational, ethical data protection. And this also applies to this subtopic of identity within eGovernment. Again here, it’s a multilevel problem which if you don’t get the legal stuff right, you can have implemented lots of technology and you will suffer.</p>
<p>Just to cite one example would be the Indian Aadhaar System. So they started 10 years ago implementing it with lots of use cases and penetration. But they have been plagued by people who sued the government and the Supreme Court has been deciding that some features are not constitutional, etc.</p>
<p>So identity is really not only a legal, not only a technical thing, and not only a commercial thing. And this makes this really interesting.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. So what would you say were the main reasons why this project, well, not failed, but had this setback?</p>
<p>I mean in the design most probably, yes.</p>
<p>Rainer: Yeah. But maybe just to give you a little background because in the identity vault, those people you frequently meet on international conferences – we have a little bit of kind of Euro-centric view in the sense of history sciences. So we know quite well what’s going on in North America and in Europe but we have less experience with India, China, Indonesia, Africa, etc. So, bear with me for a second.</p>
<p>So Aadhaar is a project to obtain or to assign a number, an identifier, to each Indian resident being connected with a biometric authentication, so fingerprint and iris scan. And there were a lot of expectations to what that project should deliver. So what was being expected internally and what was being sold to the public obviously was also not 100% coherent because there were early notes that this was used to differentiate between citizens and noncitizens in critical regions. Also, officially was a residential registry.</p>
<p>So this is one of the patterns I found frequently in project that you’re targeting different groups and the use cases are slightly different. So whether it’s a residential registry or a citizen, it’s a vast difference. Also, if you think 99% or more of the cases, it’s identical, but the French cases did hurt. And as an example, if you have the sex, the gender being male or female, and then some people sue you because they say, “Well, I’m transgender” and in this country it’s constitutional to have it registered, these small things might bite back because it occurs once you have started and already a lot of data in the system and it’s operational and changes are very, very hard later on.</p>
 
 So back to Aadhaar, they didn’t consider the legal aspects enough. So they didn’t have a legal foundation until 2016. So they started the project without a law which is, not only in India but also in India, unconstitutional because the government must act on the basis of law. 
 
<p>And then there is the problem of exclusion. The government must not force usually to use digital access methods to government use cases, government processes. Again, they didn’t consider that. People sued them. The Supreme Court ruled, it’s not allowed to make the digital access or this Aadhaar number mandatory.</p>
<p>So I think the second largest eID project in the vault after the Chinese and it’s amazingly complex and they are I think still quite well-underway to provide food subsidies and registering SIM cards and they have many use cases. But they are really plagued by legal issues, by security breaches, and all these things. So it’s really interesting to watch such a project in the large scale because all the same things happen on the smallest case in European projects as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, thanks for sharing. I haven’t heard about this Aadhaar project from India. It’s very interesting and I imagine as you said, the second biggest in the world, it had to be a very complex project of course.</p>
<p>Rainer: Right. Right.</p>
<p>Oscar: And tell me in your country, your country in Austria, how is today eGovernment in Austria? What do you have there?</p>
<p>Rainer: So, Austria has started in around 2000 to have, actually in the time when I was involved in the project, to integrate eGovernment processes and identity management. So this was a very interesting time. The idea was to use digital signatures as a legal basis to identify citizens. And so, Austria was one of the first European countries to introduce a citizen card, an ID which was not related to a passport or other kind of government ID. It was a separate smart card.</p>
<p>And the idea was to have frequent use of this card in many use cases. Everybody would have it and government processes would then be automated and so you would have faster, better delivery of government services to the public.</p>
<p>And the idea was within 5 years to have electronic delivery, electronic single sign-on, and all government, all major government services integrated on the platform. And this was a severe miscalculation.</p>
<p>I think at the time people just – well, we didn’t know better. So there were a number of interesting lessons to be learned. First, there was a little bit of confirmation bias because any government process looked like a use case for identity management. So what could be better than to have a high quality or high assurance authentication and attributes delivery for any use case? And that wasn’t the case.</p>
<p>Actually, the vast majority of government use cases works without electronic authentication quite well. For example, in many countries, filing tax returns in the electronic way is cited as a major online activity, which is true. It’s not necessary to have a high-quality assurance because people are anxious of lying to the Tax Office, or maybe the numbers may be optimised in some cases. I don’t know.</p>
<p>But in general, stating identities etc. is just not an issue. So if you just, let’s say, file a PDF, some numbers, and after two weeks, you receive a letter with your tax statement which is not a registered letter, which is just a plain letter, this is good enough.</p>
<p>The same is true if you have a speeding ticket. So this kind of transaction, people don’t want to authorise to authenticate to pay their, or to get access to, their speeding tickets. They want to – maybe in case they want to complain about it, but then usually, you just pay it and try not to think about it.</p>
<p>So there were some studies and they found roughly 90% of the state level, kind of more local use cases, you don’t need authentication. Either you have some letter, back office letter, or some payment, there is no need to care.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, 90% is something quite high. And it’s really interesting that– about making the assumption that external authentication is always needed and it’s something that one could assume but it’s not the case.</p>
<p>Rainer: And on the other side, obviously, there are use cases where it’s very usual to have authentication with all the bells and whistles you expect nowadays like delegation and single sign-on and there is security and adaptive authentication. And it’s so hard to implement because of the different technology than 10 years ago roughly. Mobile access became so pervasive that you got a complete new technology platform or technologies that were just hard again.</p>
<p>And so it’s pretty messy. And you run into the economic problem of the network defects or if you don’t have enough use cases, people don’t use it. If people don’t use it, the IT projects don’t pick up the authentication services, so the usual problem. So it was really hard to get to that point.</p>
<p>To sum it up, it took I would say 15 years to get into a region where you can say the majority of citizens facing and business facing use cases are accessible online with an eID and you have a serious coverage of electronic delivery and solid authentication methods. So the good news is we are there. It just took much longer.</p>
<p>Oscar: Wow, it sounds like a long journey and bumpy road. And so now, the main authentication method is the ID card?</p>
<p>Rainer: No. Well, because the pick-up of the smart card was so difficult particularly for tech and support reasons, so I know Estonia did much better in that case but it just wasn’t feasible in Austria. So they implemented within the same type of interfaces mobile and thumb-based authentication alternative. And some legal tricks to assign the same assurance level to SMS-based authentication as it was with a smart card signature, which is difficult to understand for an engineer but lawyer can do miracles.</p>
<p>And actually, this approach was then copied in quite a number of European countries. And from today’s perspective, I think as a provisional measure, probably it was worth the risk because it’s just quite simple to implement SMS-based authentication.</p>
<p>Now, with PSD2 from the European Central Bank banning SMS, more and more, more sophisticated and strong authentication method will slowly trickle into the public.</p>
<p>Oscar: Sure. And tell us now about the work you do in Kantara Initiative. You are one of the leaders in the eGovernment Work Group.</p>
<p>Rainer: Yes. So Kantara is a professional network and the eGovernment Work Group used to be fairly technical for standardisation. So the SAML 2.0 eGovernment profile was used as a blueprint in many countries for national SAML profiles log-in, in Austria as well.</p>
<p>And in the meantime, Kantara has moved upwards more to the governance side on trust frameworks and assurance, which is a more tricky thing. And the eGovernment Work Group has changed as well. So it became much smaller and specific on topics. It’s kind of a resource pool for governments who are doing framework policies.</p>
<p>And so people throw some papers into it and get some feedback from people who are interested and also learning from that. And so the actual work on technical profiles in Kantara moved to other work groups like the Federation Interoperability Work Group which did recently a very modern SAML interoperability and deployment profile with best practices collecting in the last 10 years of movement to then your document.</p>
<p>And so again, that has been circulated on this mailing list where we have users and lots of vendors and consultants in the group. But in general, the eGovernment Work Group is now a fairly small group for occasional projects and keeping the network and the connections up.</p>
<p>Oscar: And what had been the highlights, the best achievements, what would you say for the Work Group?</p>
<p>Rainer: Yeah. Well, historically, what I said, this interoperability thing, if I see the different published government profiles, you see the templates and the profiles from Kantara. Also, I would have wished that the quality would have been better. But it was the experience of 2008 and 2009, it just wasn’t better to have more specific profiles.</p>
<p>And recently, yes, I think it’s nice to see that people ask for the profiles to the group, ask questions, and present their ideas. And then we have useful feedback for them. And you see their documents changed.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, these are the best ways that someone in some government in some country can benefit or contribute. So they could bring their, you say, papers or what they are working on, and you would give them feedback with the network that is active. Excellent.</p>
<p>And overall, as you are definitely an expert in eGovernment, you mentioned the project in India. You mentioned also– I asked you about Austria. What other interesting projects or eGovernment you could mention, some experience anywhere in the world?</p>
<p>Rainer: Well, the biggest project is obviously the China’s residential identity card. So you see the history of that card. So they started fairly early. I don’t remember exactly. But I think in the ‘80s or ‘90s. It was a very simple card, which didn’t have a lot of security features. And as I understand, it was – the main purpose was physical validation of identity, not online.</p>
<p>And some 15 years ago I think, the second generation of their card already was for online verification but they were– they didn’t use the standard smart card technology so it kind of […indiscernible]. And this one is still in use and they have been plagued by counterfeit and fraud of this card so there are still markets on the internet where you can buy your identity card for a few dollars. And it’s interesting to see how they adapt to that.</p>
<p>So the Chinese government decided to completely move to online. So WeChat is the Chinese – the major online community. And they use it for payment and communication and purchasing and many things. So the government will be– I think a year ago, they started to pilot WeChat as an identity system. So they are going mobile and commercial or somehow commercial or PPP you would say in the West. And replacing this somehow flawed smart card completely with an online system.</p>
<p>So with a lot of technology and fixing the problem that they had there, for example, their previous cards had the problem that they didn’t have a separate card number but the citizen ID on the card. So you couldn’t reissue the card if there was an identity theft. The card was stolen. So you couldn’t make a difference between a stolen and the reissued card. So many interesting things, which I see when I do assessments of enterprise systems. Sometimes you see similar patterns in applications or legacy systems.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about eGovernment is in some sense, usually more diverse and complex than a typically enterprise system because there are in governments usually thousands of processes to very different user groups and a lot of legal obligations, etc. So what works in the government usually you can say to some extent also works in the private sector.</p>
<p>And after the Chinese example, the resident’s information card was I think 1.5 billion users or so. Obviously, the eIDAS, the EU-driven cross identity government eID system is a very interesting one.</p>
<p>An interesting pattern here – and this is kind of an essential difference to the Chinese or even the Indian one – is that the government in the West usually doesn’t have a mandate to structure IT processes in the private sector. It can do– so regulators for regulators industries, utilities and finances, etc, can require certain security things to some extent.</p>
<p>But in general, it’s very difficult for the government to establish standards. And this is really the difficult point of many eGovernment systems including eIDAS, or in particular eIDAS, because eIDAS is an interoperability project for eGovernment services. And so, you will see I would say given some time that government services will converge to use eIDAS, and that makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>But the usual citizen has very few government interactions. People work with their bank, with their employer, or with many systems, but the government is not present in everyday life. And so, it’s really hard for the government to offer a system that is very attractive for the public.</p>
<p>So quite interesting in the Scandinavian countries, bank ID has been quite successful because it was used from – both for online banking and for the government. And in other countries, this wasn’t the case. And the number of transactions done in the eGovernment systems is dwarfed by what’s being done in any other commercial system where people authenticate.</p>
<p>So this is really a problem. And so, [?] applications are really essential to get into the network to effect those authentications or identification systems, and it’s very hard for the eGovernment. And so, China, it’s easy. The government has a much longer lever to integrate essential services into their system. But for a variety of reasons, we don’t want that, Western societies.</p>
<p>Oscar: Right. Yeah, very interesting cases you’re describing and what the differences are. And tell us now about the TIIME, the conference that is coming now in February.</p>
<p>Rainer: Yes. So the Trust and Internet Identity Meeting Europe as its named, so the acronym is TIIME, is an annual event since 2013. And actually, a brainchild of the IIW Events or the IIW, the Internet Identity Workshop, that happens two times a year in San Francisco is an unconference on internet identity. So a lot of technologists head there for the meetings there like OAuth and OpenID Connect and many other interesting things.</p>
<p>And when I talked to Kaliya who is facilitating this conference if she wanted to bring it to Europe, she said, “Well, no.” She doesn’t have the resources but she will help me to set up something like that in Vienna. And actually, we did that.</p>
<p>So the key feature of TIIME is to bring together different communities like the eGovernment but predominantly, the higher education and research community, which is running large scale, very large scale federations and they had a lot of technical experience in that area, but also private sector companies and banks, etc. So it’s pretty much free of any member pitches and sales talk. So people meet here to talk on subject matter things like technology and architecture and policy. So people like it.</p>
<p>Oscar: And this is going to happen exactly from …</p>
<p>Rainer: It’s in February, in the week from February 17th to 20th. The first day will be user group meetings for various research federations and open-source user groups. The second day is a programmed experience. We have track on open source and another track on identity governance and administration.</p>
<p>And then we have two days of unconferencing. This is in my experience, the most effective things because it allows people to bring their own topics and customise their own sessions to get out the knowledge or to share experience about their projects. And so, having these kind of formats proved to be very, very effective.</p>
<p>Oscar: So what is the best way to find more about TIIME conference?</p>
<p>Rainer: So the easiest way is to go to tiimeworkshop.eu and there is a website explaining the concept, showing the results of previous conferences and obviously there’s a link to register and to get the ticket for the conference.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. Sounds very good. And it’s coming now in February. Thanks for this. And before I let you go, I would like to ask you a final tip for anybody to protect their own digital identity.</p>
<p>Rainer: So if you’re a developer or a software architect, I ask you to don’t implement any local identity management in your applications. Even if you don’t have services somewhere, push it to a container like a Tomcat or Apache or whatever application server. But don’t code it into the application. So whenever later on you need to integrate/change anything, it can be done without touching the application, because this is really a pain in access management later on. The same would be true for any provisioning interface. So maintaining users and their access rights always should be done via an API. Never, never locally.</p>
<p>If you’re an expert on identity management, please reserve some time in your project to minimise data, to privacy by design. This really helps to reduce headaches later on.</p>
<p>And for the majority of users who have different objectives and just don’t want to be bothered with technical and legal details of identity and privacy, there are different levels of protection. The basic one is to minimise your data. So if you don’t use anything online, move it to an archive. If you don’t need it in the archive, delete it. This is the first point of how you can reduce your exposure.</p>
<p>The second one is, don’t use services which you really don’t need. Delete your accounts. So again, reduce your attack surface.</p>
<p>Then if you have done that, try to use brand name, trusted sources. So where you authenticate, where you keep your data, keep your identities, what you use for authenticating to other services, like you might be using your government or a social account like Twitter, LinkedIn, Google, or whatever, don’t use too many. Manage those ones carefully and look for whom you can trust.</p>
<p>Finally, because this is not good enough, the Google and etc. accounts are not as trustworthy as they appear. They are on the technical level but not on a policy level. What’s really protecting is regulation and law and so engaging in net politics and democratic processes and transparency is the ultimate help in protecting society.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I couldn’t agree more. So, thanks a lot for these tips and for this very interesting interview. Please let us know, Rainer, how we can find you on the net. What are the best ways?</p>
<p>Rainer: Yes. So there is an imprint on the TIIME Workshop homepage and otherwise, my name is so unique that Googling Rainer Hörbe will find you to the right places.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. Perfect. We will find you there. OK, Rainer, it was a pleasure talking with you and all the best.</p>
<p>Rainer: Thank you, Oscar. Thank you for having me.</p>

 [Podcast transcript] 
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Hello and thanks for joining today. We are starting the New Year 2020 and I hope you had a nice time in 2019. Now we are back and we have a fabulous guest to start this year – a guest who has an amazing career in technology, in cybersecurity and today she has embarked a lot on projects for combined technology with social impact, and a lot of that is also related to digital identity.</p>
<p>Monique Morrow is President and Co-Founder of the Humanized Internet, a non-profit organisation focused on addressing the need to control our identities as well as providing digital identity for those individuals most underserved. The belief in the social good of technology with embedded ethics has guided Monique’s extensive work with blockchain, especially its applicability to education and credentialing as well as other industries including healthcare, insurance, and Internet of Things.</p>
<p>Monique is also President of the VETRI Foundation in Switzerland. Among other accolades, Monique has been recognised in the industry for her tireless focus on social good. Monique was selected as one of the Top Digital Shapers 2018 in Switzerland. In this year, One World Identity recognised Monique as one of the top 100 influencers in identity for 2019.</p>
<p>Hi Monique.</p>
<p>Monique Morrow: Hello Oscar. It’s a pleasure to be here, to talk about an important topic.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thanks a lot. The pleasure is mine truly and I really want to hear this latest project you have. I told a bit about you but that’s not enough so I would like to hear more. So tell me a bit of your journey, how your career led you to this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Monique: Sure. I mean look, first of all, I should say a Happy New Year and 2020 to everyone because I do believe 2020 is going to be the year for digital identity and even more so, self-sovereign identity.</p>
<p>So the journey is the following where I got very much involved in the space and it goes into how I got involved in terms of blockchain and credentialing.</p>
<p>What we were finding is that identity is a very important component especially if you’re talking about people who don’t have one maybe because of a crisis, maybe because of war, whatever the situation is, and they don’t have their papers anymore.</p>
<p>Identity is a very multifaceted theme because it also pertains to culture but it also pertains to how you are perceived and what rights you have when you come into a country or into an organisation or wherever.</p>
<p>So the issue around digital identity is really around what happens, what is digital, what is acceptable? What are the exact components of that? I think what really fostered that journey which we will discuss during – the actual components which we will discuss during the course of this interview was in fact when I first established and co-founded the Humanized Internet, which is a Swiss-based non-profit in Switzerland. And I have a co-founder based in Toronto, Canada and a co-founder who is really the heart of the story who is a former refugee and ‘refugee’ is just illegal status.</p>
<p>He’s a person, an individual who happen to come from the Middle East and particularly Syria and was studying in Greece and literally lost his passport. Literally lost his passport and although he could be seen in the system as a student, he wasn’t in the system.</p>
<p>It didn’t matter that he had documents that were on Google Drive. They just simply were not going to be accepted and there was no way for him to go back to a war situation, to go back to a country that is at war, in this particular case Syria. He would have his life in peril.</p>
<p>So it really fostered the story about how can we actually have a world where we can have and be in control of our digital identity such that they could be accepted by other organisations. And that’s what got me very much involved in identity overall, digital identity, self-sovereign identity and I have colleagues who have been working in the space for many, many years. So it has been a journey. But now we’re looking at, you know, how do we deal with credentialing.</p>
<p>So it has become something of – you know, I don’t talk about it at a theoretical perspective. I talk about it in really concrete examples and concrete examples working with people who are the centre of the stories that – and narratives that we read about every day.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, this is a very concrete example and it’s hard to believe that someone – you just lose your passport and you don’t have an identity. That it’s really hard to believe that.</p>
<p>Monique: You know, it’s incredible because it’s just like a scene out of a movie. We actually published a book called The Humanized Internet and the tenets around The Humanized Internet is not only around digital identity as an end control, but it’s also around the notion of ethics and technology and the whole issue about how do we actually put some governance model around it.</p>
<p>But it was like a movie for him and he couldn’t go to a consulate or an embassy because there is none. It’s a country at war. So he was extremely in a very stressful situation. It is a situation – now he’s living in Germany. He’s living in Berlin and I think that he’s contributing to society in that sense. He’s a software engineer in development.</p>
<p>But that journey he represents is a story of many. We have to think about questions. What happens if there’s a terrible earthquake? What happens if there’s a fire? What happens if your organisation no longer exists? How do you actually credential but also how do you actually get a component of digital identity such that it carries a weight and that you are under control?</p>
<p>So digital identity as a topic has several components here. One is where you have some level of control. I will put that in quotes. The other is what is being profiled about you. This gets into the story of companies actually making money and profits out of your identity or your presence on the internet where you’re not involved in that exchange.</p>
<p>The only exchange, the involvement that you have is that you’re given “free services” which really aren’t free at the end. So your presence is being – and over the net is being sort of profiled or used and used for – could be used for marketing purposes and it could be used for nefarious purposes.</p>
<p>So we have several aspects of this notion of digital identity that moves to self-sovereign identity, that moves to some point of how do we now go into the 21st century and beyond and look at what does control look like. What does a digital apostille mean and how is it going to be accepted by many countries and organisations?</p>
<p>So if I take a step farther Oscar, which gets – you know, because I’m in the blockchain world and we talk about that a little more. But credentialing is an opportunity here. How do you have universities, maybe in Helsinki or so on, that actually used this technology to actually provide you with a hash or a key which is referenceable on the public blockchain by the validating organisation, in this particular case the university, forever there? Because in case something happens, at least you can reference it.</p>
<p>If you’re a refugee or if you’re somebody in– a person that happens to be stuck in a humanitarian crisis, what you want to be able to do, even though you can use certain technologies like artificial intelligence to actually have predictability, a predictor exam. We think, oh, let’s go study computer science and then have a certification, credential given that is by the validating organisation, a new organisation that is referenceable at the blockchain.</p>
<p>But having said that, if you are resettling, which is a legal language, and you’re moving for example from Jordan or from whatever country to a receiving country, let’s say Sweden for example, you want the receiving organisation to accept your credentials so that you can work.</p>
<p>The problem is when it’s no longer acceptable by the receiving organisation, it takes– people spend quite a bit of money, 50,000, 60,000, 90,000 euros or more to recertify and credential. That weighs on the social system because what happens is they end up trying to get help from the social system and it plays out to – unfortunately to a negative political narrative.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. How big is it probably in terms of how many people worldwide are affected or potentially affected by this lack?</p>
<p>Monique: I mean, you know, the numbers are going up and I think if we look at UNHCR report, it has gone from 65 million to 73 million, thereabouts – I mean circa – displaced people. We can make a correlation to certain things that are happening to this displacement. It’s not just for – you know, the climate crisis is one example. People have – or migrating this. There’s a migration component of it. There’s also displacement overall because of these crises and people are seeking humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>The thing of it is, is that with that, it gives – people have a human right to work. In most cases, they really want to work. They want a “better” life. So you’re dealing with all – it’s a very complex situation. But I think that an example that’s often cited is the Rohingya tragedy and crisis.</p>
<p>So people are stuck in these horrific camps and they want to be recognised as a people. They don’t want to be called a refugee. By the way, people don’t like that term. They are people who want to contribute to some extent to society.</p>
<p>What happens in a case like this – and this is why technology can be an enabler for digital identity and looking at provenance of where you’re coming from etc., is that they – because there’s no recognition, because there – you don’t have – maybe you have some level of recognition from UNHCR. You’re in somebody’s database. You’re subjected to human trafficking and human trafficking is a huge humanitarian crisis that we have to – you know, it’s at all levels and it happens – it’s happening in our own backyard because people – what happens is any kind of whatever identity that they have, even if they don’t have any, when they don’t have any, they’re even more vulnerable.</p>
<p>So it is incumbent upon us as a society and a group of technologists to actually work together with governments and organisations to actually see how we can take the issue at a level where we can have recognition digitally, right?</p>
<p>And it will be forever with us. So with an example that I get – I think 2020 is going to be a year of self-sovereign identity, SSI. There you are in the middle. It’s portable. Your credentials are portable. You have the right to selectively disclose parts of what you want to disclose about yourself and actually look at where that data is going. It gets into privacy. That gets into how the data is being used and so on.</p>
<p>I think that we’re going to see more and more of selective disclosure, the notion of self-sovereign identity becoming more of a mainstream at the end of the day and especially for 2020 moving forward.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, definitely. It’s a really big problem as you described it pretty well. So what about The Humanized Internet as a project. You already of course said something about that. But tell us the – what is the status?</p>
<p>Monique: Yeah. So we started out as – we are three people and as an association, it’s an association as recognised in Switzerland. It’s non-profit and fundamentally what we have been doing from the perspective – one of the big projects is really amplifying some of the issues we’ve been amplifying based in medium and actually in our forthcoming publication.</p>
<p>Having said that, the other issue is we’re looking, you know, for example in wanting to work with some universities here in Switzerland to look at how we solve for the issue of storage of our credentials. Not an essential database. It’s something that should be distributed. And how do we have this notion of digital keys or what we call lock boxes?</p>
<p>That’s something that I think that is still – it’s a very hard computer science problem to solve for. But I think it’s something that we’re very interested in solving for because everything can be – if I have a trace in a bank or a vault, but that gets destroyed, at least I have some notion of where I hold certain data or certain credentials or something about my not only identity but about values or something that I store in a digital format such that they – it’s distributed such that I may have something of a notion of digital keys that I can go with, members of my family, so if there is an incident that occurs, there would be – let’s say an event flag that’s sent out and there would be a lock, right?</p>
<p>And I think that we need to solve for something that is at that level. It’s something that we’ve been thinking about for some time as a project. We have been looking at the notion of could we make having some sort of an identifier if you will, decentralised identifier as a Humanized Internet. But more importantly within the context of self-sovereign identity as let’s say a standard. That would be fantastic.</p>
<p>We realised that there are a lot of organisations, and I should say quite a bit of organisations, involved in some level of identity or digital identity. It’s crowded space but it also means that there’s an opportunity here.</p>
<p>So for us, we’re looking at the next level of problems that need to be solved. So in summary, it’s really about what does a digital box look like and how do I distribute digital keys to close members of family and friends?</p>
<p>Oscar: So at this point, the project is designing this platform.</p>
<p>Monique: Yes.</p>
<p>Oscar: So the goal is to have in a few years.</p>
<p>Monique: Yes. It’s a process to design it and work with an ecosystem of organisations, but particularly universities, to look at how we can do that together.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. And in the – how do you envision at the time this platform is already operational? Who will be the main actors that somehow maintain that – let’s say government or universities, can be also companies? How do you see it?</p>
<p>Monique: I would say that the ecosystem would involve universities. I mean we want this to be a standard globally, right? You cannot do it in the absence of government and the organisations. It’s something that you have to take government organisations along a journey. You know, this gets into regulatory tech and how they have to understand what it is they regulate.</p>
<p>But they have to be involved to some extent because if they’re – you’re talking about digital keys. They have to recognise them. Something has to be recognised. That which is portable has to be recognised by an authority.</p>
<p>So you have to have something that’s hybrid in there and I think also public, private or – I mean so you’re getting into what I will call multilateral relationships here or an ecosystem that gets built out. What we’re trying to avoid is an over-centralisation that breaks the model that we’re talking about in terms of self-sovereign identity. You want it to be absolutely to some extent decentralised or hybrid decentralised where you don’t have an over-centralisation that occurs, because here’s the thing. This is very important from a development perspective, from a platform and principle perspective.</p>
<p>So that’s what we’re looking at. It should be for – even though you think it’s B2B. But I think at the end of the day, it’s going to be CB2B. You know, it’s consumer, a business to business to consumer and the consumer actually is going to be in the middle at the end. I think the consumer is going to be. I believe strongly – the consumer, the citizen, the person should be in the middle of that.</p>
<p>Oscar: So there will be some actors building components of this platform and then it becomes available for everybody. So for instance, what will be the – from the end user point of view, there will be an application or just a web service? So what would the individual interact?</p>
<p>Monique: Well, I mean you can download an API. I think that’s what it’s going to be. I mean it has got to be usable. We know that people to some extent have smartphones or mobile phones, even folks who have been displaced. They do have some level of technology, at basic level. So I think it’s going to be something that they can – should be able to download from an app store and be able to use. That would be from the user experience perspective and they will put these security knobs that they want to have on it.</p>
<p>They will put what they want to disclose on this, et cetera. That’s the way I would envisage and what we’re envisaging. Then we will have certain keys where they want to store the keys, how they want to store the keys and how they want to share it with what members of their friends, family, organisation.</p>
<p>Then of course we get into this whole lock box type of model. But from my perspective and from the perspective that we’re looking at from the design, it’s really at an app level.</p>
<p>The thing of it is, it’s easy to use, complexity is hidden and it’s portable. You know, when you talk to people who have been pleading terrible situations, they always had a mobile phone with them. That was their GPS. That’s everything for them, you know. So a mobile phone is like the basic tool that people should have. Well, you know, that we will be using and in some cases, there have been studies to suggest out of – particularly out of Germany that mobile phone for people in the refugee community were considered extensions of their bodies. They couldn’t do anything without it.</p>
<p>Oscar: And once this platform is operational again, how will it self-sustain? Because this has a cost of running all this platform.</p>
<p>Monique: Yes. I mean – and I think the funding. I think that you’re getting actually to funding and the business model itself which is a fair question. You know, we’ve been thinking about how that could be because it has to be something that people will want. So they will desire it and I think the funding is going to be something that we have to look at whether or not it’s public/private funding. You know, whether you – if we’re in the EU, is this something that the EU would be interested in funding or having a funding model for it?</p>
<p>Would it be a World Bank opportunity? So because you’re talking about one part of it is humanitarian. Would it be that? We’re looking at different models for actual funding and continued funding, right? The thing of it is, is that what we would like to have is a community working.</p>
<p>You know, it’s just – I think it’s a model that’s very interesting is if you look at the way Hyperledger is developed, right? In the world of technology sets and specifically around identity, et cetera, Hyperledger Aries and so on. I think when you have a community actually contributing to it and actually making sure that there is a continued contribution – it’s sort of self-funds itself. It sort of self-feeds, right? And that’s where we want to be able to go to where it becomes a standard at the end of the day. But I think the models of funding would depend and I think that you will see we can envisage multifaceted funding models.</p>
<p>World Bank as an example is one that comes up immediately and also some of the European Union types of projects, especially when you think about H2020 or beyond. You know, those examples. Those become interesting funding models too.</p>
<p>Oscar: The book The Humanized Internet is already published, correct?</p>
<p>Monique: No, no. It’s about to be published. So we’ve been working on the draft itself and we’re looking at – we have also – it has been a contributor. So we are about to publish it and we expect that to be – we had it noted for the end of this year. But it would probably be the first quarter of next year for sure because there’s quite a bit that we’ve had to actually make sure that we’ve updated it. Plus we want to have somebody very, very special to write the foreword for the book.</p>
<p>The book is actually – it’s a reflection of quite a bit of the conversations that we’re having and with personal journeys and it spawns between what’s – we have an example with folks who have been working with the – especially when we’re talking about e-government as a service. We have a colleague who’s in the entertainment space and talking about the role of let’s say ethics and also privacy particularly that which you are in control of in that space. You know, what’s happening with when – we have algorithms, when we have actually – we go out of control or not within a control. We don’t have any what I will call framework of governance in place.</p>
<p>So we have a – from an all multifaceted perspective and we have examples about how to use blockchain for credentialing. I mean, you know, I believe in knowing what I don’t know. I don’t know – I went off and got a degree in the space and my degree is actually potential in the blockchain.</p>
<p>So it’s very multifaceted and we’re very excited about it coming out.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. So it’s coming in these first months of the New Year. Yeah, fabulous. Really looking forward to see that release and spread the word about that.</p>
<p>Monique: Thank you.</p>
<p>Oscar: I know one of the other projects you are involved in today is this VETRI Foundation. Could you tell us something?</p>
<p>Monique: VETRI Foundation. So I’m the President of the VETRI Foundation. So let me – this is one where you can actually look at how you download the app. This is something that exists today.</p>
<p>The VETRI Foundation was born out of a – we had actually gone through an entire compliance. We had cryptocurrency which are valid coins that were created. We are the non-profit arm of what is VETRI and what has been also procivis.ch. Very strict compliance that had gone through – at least two years ago.</p>
<p>The foundation was born literally December of a year ago. So as a foundation, what we have now is you have a phone. We have a mobile app and the tenet is you should be the person actually selectively disclosing how you want to share your data or if you’re a company, how you deal with market research and surveys. By the way, you are incentivised with valid coins. Valid is traded on the internet. I mean you can go look at valid cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>So what it is, is that rather than you being sort of the – which is something we hear about – the “product” of big companies, you are actually the middle. You are selectively disclosing and/or if you’re a company or an organisation, you’re very interested in market data and that becomes a research. That becomes very, very compelling for companies as well as consumers and you’re incentivised through the use of this token or this coin. They’re both valid.</p>
<p>As the foundation, we are a non-profit. We don’t take any percentage of the proceeds per se, depending if you’re a business. That is something that we negotiate. But as a consumer, we don’t and we don’t hold your data. Your data is actually – it’s frictionless. You are selectively disclosing. It’s what you are wanting to care about. Do I care about healthcare? Am I going to be willing to fill out a survey about healthcare? Do I want to know where my data is going to go from that survey?</p>
<p>And it’s nice to be able to receive a valid token on, or the attention that I – you know, for a minute of my time and oh, by the way, I am choosing to look at what categories of topics I’m interested in. So it’s very targeted for you.</p>
<p>Oscar: And for these, the organisations have to agree to use this service or …?</p>
<p>Monique: Well, no. I mean the organisation, the thing of it is, is you’re – it’s gamified, right? So if you download the app – I mean you can go and look at the app. You can look at it – by the way, it’s either on your phone or you can have it on a desktop.</p>
<p>You can see how it goes. You can see the entire video about what we’re – the foundation is about. What is very critical is we are a non-profit. So we will look attention to projects that are within – you know, looking at how we grow the VETRI ecosystem and that’s very important. We want to grow that VETRI ecosystem to spawn the use of the valid token and also to spawn the use of this engagement between let’s say data owner and let’s say data provider and/or if you’re a business, you could look at – because people want that targeted data, how clean that data is because also if the data source is not clean, the data source means nothing. So this goes down to market research at a business level.</p>
<p>But for the consumer, it’s very, very valuable and we believe that this is the direction, the strategic direction that the market wants to move to and certain consumers want to move to.</p>
<p>Here’s a thesis too. I think this is something that we always quote as part of VETRI and even when we’re talking about the Humanized Internet. The problem you have, when you have centralised data stores is that they are open for hack. We don’t see a day that has gone by where data hasn’t been just stolen.</p>
<p>So we have to look at ways to mitigate one centralisation of data such that – because it is valuable, that it’s stolen. So that’s where we have to look at distributing models where there is not very minor I would say hybrid decentralisation.</p>
<p>We would like see full decentralisation at some point in time, a distributed model at some point in time. Secondly is big companies are certainly profiting from you. So why can’t you get a share of that profit? And why can’t it be you getting not only the share but you actually controlling where your data goes?</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, great. Definitely strong reasons to have to check it out is this model as well.</p>
<p>As many people listening to this podcast are also in the business, running e-services or implementing for others, from the ideas of having sharing today, what’s something that people who are building e-services, maintaining e-services should keep in mind?</p>
<p>Monique: Yeah, that’s a great question Oscar. I think that we should have an industry model around the fair treatment of data as businesses. And of course, this is something I had spoken about in Berlin a couple of months ago, in &nbsp;October about how do we as an industry come together and standardise on fair treatment of data.</p>
<p>Of course that assumes that the source of that data is also fairly “clean”. I will put that in quotes because the problem we have is where metadata of metadata – you know, we’re just metadata.</p>
<p>So we as businesses – I mean especially in the business community – is looking at do we have a standard now on fair treatment of data and it’s not about reading a bunch of legal documents on GDPR or privacy laws, et cetera, such that community members and consumers and – sometimes business people just don’t have the time of day. Their attention to go through that because it’s sort of this legalese.</p>
<p>However, it’s looking at how do you have fair treatment of data just as you have fair trade, right? Fair treatment of data and I think having that is very important.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing is that it’s not about here we changed our privacy laws and you have to kind of sort of agree. It’s really getting people to have an interactive model with consumers and citizens. I think that’s more important. They need to be part of it rather than being sort of a subject. They need to be in the centre of it. I think that’s more important.</p>
<p>So businesses need to be careful. They need to self-state it and they need to say, “Look, we want you to be part of the fair treatment of data programme, which I think needs to be standardised as an industry,” and this is not about you being sort of the subject. It’s about you actually controlling the narrative. That I think will be very palatable for consumers and citizens at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fair treatment data, yes.</p>
<p>Monique: Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely excellent idea to – for anybody who is building e-services and platforms to consider. Monique, now I would like to ask you something for anybody, individuals, anybody how they can protect their digital identity. Could you share some tip?</p>
<p>Monique: Yeah. I mean that’s a great – you know, once again Oscar, you’re full of wonderful questions and I enjoy the dialogue and discussion thus far.</p>
<p>I think it’s very important that – be careful about your presence on the internet. It’s forever there. You leave a forensic that’s forever there. We have communities that love the – you know, it’s Instagram and it’s selfies and so on and so forth. But we have to make sure that you can never – you know, you have to be careful about how you’re presenting your digital self over the internet.</p>
<p>I do believe and I always quote this that if you go and get a driver’s license, you have to have so many tests and examinations. But I do believe that it’s important for companies and organisations even down to buying a mobile phone. That they walk you through the privacy. How do you protect yourself? Various privacy examples and be responsible.</p>
<p>I think it’s an ecosystem of accountability and responsibility. They sell you a product. They should be able to say, “Here, let us walk you through some of the basic privacy that you have to care about.”</p>
<p>Having dialogues like this is very, very important. I think going to just hygienics are very key. Having everything open on your phone is something that we have to be concerned about because your phone is everything. I mean it’s hackable and we’re hackable. So we have to take very care – it’s raised awareness and ask the questions around what are the basic things that we should turn – you know, where we have privacy. The two-factor authentication is an example, you know, getting into that would be an example where you start to set your security knobs in place and make sure that you have some level of the two-factor authentication. That’s very basic. These are the things that I think we need to do as an industry.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. It’s an excellent point, the first thing you said, especially when you said that the manufacturers who sell you a mobile phone, they somehow assume that you know how to protect yourself and have some basics about data protection, which is not true. And actually some of these companies are somehow accomplices with the internet services who are misusing everybody’s data. That’s an excellent point.</p>
<p>Monique: Yeah, that is correct.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, thanks a lot Monique for this conversation. As you have very interesting projects that are very worthy to follow and keep going, please tell us how we can find more about these projects and about yourself.</p>
<p>Monique: Sure. I mean look, I have a personal website at <a href="https://www.MoniqueMorrow.com">www.MoniqueMorrow.com</a>. You can also reach us at the Humanized Internet website and also at the VETRI Global website. So there are multiple websites where you can see a common pattern of what I have just discussed. You know, I do have a Twitter feed at @moniquejmorrow and also certainly just engaging actively in the conversation through these websites would be great.</p>
<p>Oscar: Again thanks a lot Monique. I will be following your projects in this new year and hope that they really crystalise, go mainstream and – because they are really solving very important problems today.</p>
<p>Monique: Thank you Oscar and I can’t stress more that 2020 is the year of really cool projects that are going to come up and in terms of self-sovereign identity, it’s the time now. And I thank you for the opportunity to have a wonderful dialogue and look forward – we know this is an ecosystem play. We look forward to working with many organisations and companies and governments along the way.</p>
<p>Oscar: It was a pleasure. All the best.</p>
<p>Monique: Thank you Oscar.</p>

 [Podcast transcript] 
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Hello. More and more we hear phrases like “reclaim your identity”. Some people care, some people don’t, but reclaiming identity from who? Who owns my identity today? And there are better ways we can do this. For that, we have a very special guest today, Diane Joyce.</p>
<p>Diane has provided thought leadership, vision and innovation in the digital transformation of financial institutions. Diane has worked with blue chip corporations to implement the technology and service architectures required to become certified identity providers as part of the GOV.UK Verify identity scheme. Diane has worked with government departments setting up a pan government identity community and work with leading IDAM vendors to address the need for secure and scalable identity federation to enable collaboration between public and private sector organisations. Diane champions technology innovation to provide users with a frictionless and safe digital experience.</p>
<p>Hello Diane.</p>
<p>Diane Joyce: Hi Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s great talking with you, Diane.</p>
<p>Diane: Thank you.</p>
<p>Oscar: I know you do many things and you have done many things, very interesting things. But I would like to hear first from you, what was your journey, your personal journey, to this work of digital identity?</p>
<p>Diane: I’ve worked in technology, I started as a programmer many, many years ago. I’ve worked in identity for some time now but I started out in integration and security. And I saw two catalysts that I thought were going to change the technology world. And alongside those, the problem with identity needed solving.</p>
<p>So the first was the internet. Suddenly we could connect to anyone, anywhere, but we didn’t really know who we were connected to and how do we know it’s them the next time we connected. And when you added to that the .com boom and the subsequent e-commerce boom it has become even more important to understand who it is we’re speaking to.</p>
<p>And second thing is cloud computing. Following the internet and e-commerce, cloud computing solved a problem that I don’t think most organisations knew that they had. Their identity model was within the walled fortress of the data centre and so therefore they control all the identity there. Cloud computing changed that and made the evolution of technology and services even faster. But now, identity had B2B and B2C and they were outside the control of the organisation at times. So that was quite a paradigm shift.</p>
<p>So, again, these are the two catalysts that I saw that needed some sort of identity providing. And not just for people but also for devices and of course the third one would be the internet of things. So, I spend a lot of time researching, reading, aligning with the emerging identity thought leaders before getting my first break at the UK Post Office, who were bidding to provide identity for a major government department. And this later moved into GOV.UK Verify.</p>
<p>And we were at the beginning of bringing together federated identity, so all the way through that I guess we were kind of making it up as we went along as technology has emerged, as threats emerged, as the way that consumers behave changed we started to get something more robust. But primarily, as I think you said on the beginning, I’m a technologist and I want to use technology as the enabler to make a safe and frictionless journey. I don’t want to put technology in because it’s fun.</p>
<p>Oscar: Sure. Yeah, I see you have seen the evolution of the internet and the services that came gradually, e-commerce you mentioned, and you mentioned the cloud services. In which moment there were already some tools for managing somewhere or another the identity, you felt that there were not enough tools or technology at some point. How you get involved in the identity?</p>
<p>Diane: Well, I think the way we solved identity was that we did it within the walled fortress. So each organisation managed its own identities and it tended to put you through a bit of a stringent process and you had to log in and be recognised and so each organisation did that independently.</p>
<p>Now when they push their services to the clouds, they could no longer do that in the same way. And I think technology did evolve where single sign-on and federated identity started to enable that but along with that came the threats. So, the identity management – that I set up an identity and I start to proliferate that among a number of organisations – the moment someone gets my identity they’ve now got access to all sorts of things. So, I think the model changed from the organisation keeping it within their fortress to suddenly the identity moved more towards the individual. Not quite there yet but we’re moving that way.</p>
<p>Oscar: Right. Yeah, as you said, very long time ago, the organisations could just build a database and have all the identities they needed inside, in-house build their own systems etc., that was possible long time ago. But when the services were exposed outside especially with the cloud services as you said, yeah, that’s a completely different story. You started already mentioning that the identity becoming more for the individual so and that is one of the things we want to discuss today is who owns your identity? Who owns my identity? And what would you say if the question is just who owns my identity?</p>
<p>Diane: Well, for me, actually it’s a really easy answer. I think the individual always owns their identity, digital or otherwise, because it uniquely identifies them. But I think owning their identity is different from managing their identity. And I think that’s what the real question is – who manages my identity? And who do I trust to be able to help me manage my identity? Because I don’t think most people really care about owning their identity. I think they realise they have to log on and identify themselves in order to do something. I want to buy the shoes. And if I really want those shoes, I’m pretty much going to do anything I need to get those shoes. So, I think the management of the identity is the real question here.</p>
<p>And I think the individual still owns that and that’s a big change from the data fortress model where each organisation owned my identity. They owned my credentials. They owned my assurances, all of that. But I had to do that with every single organisation. So now, all of my data is out there in multiple places.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. So the individual owns their own identity but many organisations, and also the individual, are managing the identity.</p>
<p>Diane: I think there’s a little bit of a– we are moving a little bit to a hybrid model. And I think at the moment we’re not in a place where the individual really understands the value of their identity. But it’s getting more so, the more breaches we have and the more the individual is inconvenienced, the more they’ll start to value and protect their identity. But I’ve never ever heard anyone say “I’ve got to get myself a digital identity. You know I’ve got to get shoes, I’ve got to get on a plane, I’ve got to do these things. And I know I have to do things to do that.” So, I don’t think they really understand it at the moment. And I think this is where technology can enable things.</p>
<p>At the moment, as I say, we’ve moved from the walled garden where everyone has their own database. We morphed into a little bit into a federated service where we had identity providers. And that’s very much the space we played in, in some of the organisations I’ve worked in. So you could do a single sign-on, an identity provider would do all the assurance against your identity and say, “I’m certain to this level that it’s Diane and I’m certain that it’s actually Diane that’s come back again and again.” Because I think there’s one thing about establishing the identity. I think the second thing is really about is it the same person who owns the identity when they come back. So, the whole authentication in account takeover scenarios.</p>
<p>And I think we’re starting to morph into more of a hybrid model, particularly when I look at the mobile technologies, the digital wallets that I can have where I could carry a little credential that’s being minted by a trusted source that says “I know that Diane is over 18.” And if I could give that – if you think about it as a little digital card that I could give to someone and they go, “Oh yes, Diane was checked as over 18 by Post Office on this date”. That’s really what we want to be doing. I’m not giving my date of birth. I’m not giving any information about me but that relying party will go back to the assuring party and say, “Yes, it’s Diane”. But this is in my digital wallet so I can reuse this in multiple digital wallets in multiple places. So I think we’re morphing more to giving more responsibility to the individual but allowing them to choose who manages it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Also to clarify because the concept itself of ‘my identity’ and ‘I own my identity’ is that my identity relatively abstract because, for instance, the government might have a lot about myself more than just let’s say the movie theatre web shop that has some information about myself. So, what are all these identities that I have in the social media, I have in this web shop, I have in the government, each of them are my identity or what each of those are?</p>
<p>Diane: I think that’s an interesting– I see my identity as ‘I am Diane’ but I have multiple personas. And I think this is the model that having these little tokens that we can give is I can have a persona when I would interact with government. They need to know a little bit more about me and maybe I do exchange a little bit of data with them and they’re probably one of the greatest holders of data about me. But then I also have a healthcare persona who wants different information about me.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes.</p>
<p>Diane: I have a banking and financial services [identity] and then I have a social profile where maybe I don’t want everyone really to know where I live, what my address is. And again, that’s the model of not having to have all of these identities managed by different people where I have to different credentials for every single identity. I would like one or more credentials that uniquely identify me. And then I can decide which persona I’m going to be for who I’m interacting with. So, if I’m buying alcohol in a bar, they just want to know I’m 18. They actually don’t really care that my name as Diane or anything about me but they just want to know that I’m 18. And that’s all I want them to know.</p>
<p>Oscar: Right. OK. And you also mentioned earlier about the breaches for instance, reasons to manage the identity and protect their identities in an appropriate way. Do you think that today the majority of people really care about protecting and owning their own identity? How do you feel about that?</p>
<p>Diane: Not yet. But I do think it’s starting to inconvenience people, so no. It was interesting I was at a fraud and payments conference recently and I asked everyone in the room how many people had reused passwords. And 50% said yes they reused passwords. And then I asked them how many use password managers and generators. And 50% of the room indicated they did. And these are people who understand fraud, people who understand how credential stuffing, all the attack vectors work and yet these are the people 50% of them are breaking some of the fundamental rules that we’re trying to get out there. So, I don’t know how we can expect the individual to really be able to respond in any other way either.</p>
<p>So, I think they’re not inconvenienced enough yet but as fraud rises, you’re going to find more and more of the organisations are going to push back to the consumer and say, “Actually you did this wrong or you didn’t follow our terms and conditions by having the appropriate software on your devices, you know, your device health”. And as they start to push back more and more, it’s going to hurt. And that’s when it’s going to start to become more and more the individual will start to look at different ways of doing things. And we in the industry need to be in a position where we can help them because I’m not sure at the moment we are.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, actually that’s an interesting point you said, you asked your audience in a conference and half respond- half of people really don’t care or are very careless and the other yeah definite use password managers or really care about that. Do you think that in– there are already some organisations in which their terms and conditions tell explicitly you should use a password manager?</p>
<p>Diane: Not yet but I do see terms and conditions coming up where they say you can’t reuse passwords.</p>
<p>Oscar: Right. Right.</p>
<p>Diane: And the industry, it was interesting we had a big debate on if we need to move from the passwords. And I’m like of course we do but that’s some time off. So we need to solve the problem today because the amount of account takeover has really grown exponentially. And organisations can’t sustain the cost for much longer, I don’t think. And in fact some of the banking is already pushing back same or like you gave your credentials to someone, what can I do?</p>
<p>So, it is interesting that people are starting to become more aware and if you look at some of the campaigns particular in the UK, we’ve had a lot of campaigns about banking, about banks will never ask you for information. They will never do all of these things. So, we’re doing a lot of campaigning out there. However, the other day, I did an unusual transaction and my bank phoned me. And I asked them to authenticate themselves because I’m like “I have no idea who you are”.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes.</p>
<p>Diane: And they said, “Well, we rang you about a transaction.” I said, “I understand that but you have to authenticate yourself to me because I don’t know who you are.” I said, “I’m going to hang up and I’m going to ring the bank back.” And I knew I had actually done the transaction that they said but ringing me up and asking me to authenticate myself and provide information. And I actually said to them, I said, “You just sent out an email saying we will never ask you for information and you’re asking me for information.” And so, I did actually send that back to the bank and said, “You sent me this email and then immediately you did this.” And I said, “If you put a safe and secure word there, something that you could tell me, I would have talked to you. But instead I had to go away and find another device to call back on so that I could be sure that it was you.” And we had quite a big discussion with it because I actually knew some of the security people in there. And I said, “Your literature needs to change but so does- organisations need to authenticate themselves as well because this is the biggest threat at the moment – the social engineering.”</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes.</p>
<p>Diane: And I’m really good at it. I could probably get password out of most people. So yeah, the threats are changing, it’s not all technology.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, that’s also very good example, that the bank is advocating something that is in the right direction but the process are not aligned completely yet.</p>
<p>Diane: Yes.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah.</p>
<p>Diane: And then I do have a safe word on that bank for when I log in they show me it or they show me a picture so they could have easily used that.</p>
<p>Oscar: Right. Still a lot work to do in many organisations then definitely. But also, is this good what you said and it’s very interesting perspective that the companies, the organisation are pushing back towards the users and now the user should have more responsibility and more active in protecting the identity. And that’s also– because it’s in their organisation’s own interest, it’s actually a business value for them, for the organisations to keep the right ways for the individuals, for their users to protect their identity.</p>
<p>Diane: We’re in a much better position to help the users protect their identity. In cyber, we tend to understand some of the threat models and we are in the best position to do that but I think it just takes time and investment.</p>
<p>Oscar: And what about the idea of the ultimate responsibility for the individual to control their own identity and thinking of the self-sovereign identity for instance, what do you think?</p>
<p>Diane: I think long-term that would be the case and I think this is where technology does actually come in. So, I think, as I said I think there’s a halfway house where we have these verifiable credentials and an individual asks one or more organisations whether their identity providers, wallet providers to provide that for them. Because I think at the moment it’s a bit of a big leap and what we really need to educate consumers in is ‘don’t give your data away all the time because the more data you give away the number of breaches that are coming out there, we’re starting to see the rise of identity theft but also synthetic identities where they’re partially true and they may start to generate identities that it’s no longer their sure to come where they just go to and steal some like immediately. They’re building these identities for longer term use.’</p>
<p>So, I think that’s perhaps where we can help instead of having every organisation saying, you need to give me your name, your address, your date of birth, a picture of your passport and all of this so every organisation is holding this. We do need to go more into this – I’ll have those credentials in a trusted place. It’s a little bit like a federated model but with the technology you don’t always have to go to the identity provider to do the credentialing because I think most organisations want to do the credentialing themselves but they just need the assurance that it’s the right person on the end of the line.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes.</p>
<p>Diane: So, I don’t think we can push that much onto the consumer. As I said, at a fraud seminar, half the room knew they were doing something wrong. And again, it comes down to the risk models. I also think that technology’s moved on so much that really the authentication space has really taken off and we have so much ability now to actually understand who’s on the end of the line by using the technology that we should be doing that. You know risk-based models, we should be collecting data. We know enough from the mobile phone devices to know is it the same device we’ve seen before. Is it on a network we recognise? Is it in a place that we recognise? What’s the health of the device? Is there any apps on the device that have just been loaded recently and what does that mean?</p>
<p>So we have enough to build up a picture of that individual. And if something is slightly wrong then let’s ask them to do something slightly differently. And maybe we take them through a couple of steps but don’t put the friction in place all the time, put it in when normal behaviour is- there’s something not quite right. And it may be quite valid that it’s not right. I maybe on a totally different network that no one’s seen. I have two SIMs on my phone so I swap one of the SIM cards out on a regular basis. And so, of course, I get the SIM swap which means I have to step up my authentication. So I think the authentication, the devices, the technology is there to take that friction from the user and we can do all of that in the background.</p>
<p>Oscar: That’s definitely good news that that has evolved so much.</p>
<p>Diane: Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: What about regulations such as the GDPR, how much are these helping?</p>
<p>Diane: I think GDPR is a great step in the right direction. And I think initially we’re all interested to see how much bite it would have. And I think the British Airways breach fines showed that it really does have teeth. But I think it possibly needs a few tweaks or maybe it’s just the initial processes. So, the 72-hour notification and engagement with the regulator is quite tough. When an organisation is breached, it really needs to focus on finding out what happened, how and fixing it. And I think maybe perhaps a lighter touch within the reporting 72 hours say, “Hey, we’ve been breached. We don’t know what it is yet.” And it takes generally more than 72 hours but the organisation should be focused on fixing it not preparing something for the regulator so that they can tell then regulator what happened. And I think it’s great because it does focus them on protecting data.</p>
<p>But if you think about a breach, an organisation has been breached and they’ve already incurred brand damage. And that’s quite a big one because we do tend to move away from breached organisations. They’ve obviously often incurred substantial cost to identify and fix the problem. And then they’ve also got the financial loss from the actual breach. So, they’re also a victim of crime. So, I’m not sure how the massive fines work. And maybe we need a little bit more leniency in some situations or you know your first strike, unless you’ve done something clearly really badly, that it’s a bit more lenient. Because I think if my house was broken into and someone stole belongings belonging to someone else, would the police then fine me because my house had been broken into? Because the organisations are actually a victim of crime. But the really great thing I think with GDPR is it has helped organisations move from the model where data has value and therefore we gather as much as we possibly can just in case we have some need in the future to use this.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes.</p>
<p>Diane: Lots of organisations were building these enormous data lakes of information which they probably really didn’t have much idea how they were going to use them. Others of course did monetise the data lakes and understand how to use them. So the great thing is the explicit reason for capturing data and the fines for using that data in another way I think are great. So, I think that’s a great step towards privacy.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, yes, I agree organisations now they need really compelling reasons to collect unnecessary data.</p>
<p>Diane: Yes. I think so. And I think that’s part of you know what I talked before about the individual doesn’t need to get all the data away.</p>
<p>Oscar: What about CIAM, Customer Identity and Access Management, how this also help?</p>
<p>Diane: I’m kind of in two minds on this. Because when I think of CIAM, I tend to think of them as each organisation captures and manages an identity. So they capture all the customer information and they have different credentials although they can actually use single sign-on across the CIAMs. Again, I think it’s more burdensome for the customer. It’s almost a little bit backed down to the data fortress model where everyone had their identity systems. So I’d like to see it evolve into a more distributed model with the individual more in control. So, my ideal CIAM would be the ability to use one or more digital wallets and one or more different credentialing systems to access multiple organisations. So, that would be my ideal CIAM.</p>
<p>Oscar: What are today examples of wallets or are there already today?</p>
<p>Diane: They’re evolving and as self-sovereign is starting to come more to the front yes. But we’ve got new verifiable credential standards which have just been agreed which- those are the tokens, the little cards that I talked about we can pass around. So, organisations are starting to build wallets towards that. What we haven’t yet got as organisations that are sharing across the wallets yet. But I think that is the next evolution because no one is going to stick to a single digital wallet. I’m going to have – again, I might have different wallets according to my persona but I want to be able to share that one piece of information across all of them. I don’t want to have to prove myself time and time again. So I think we’re moving that way and that’s particularly where the self-sovereign model works. And I think with the concepts of verifiable credentials, self-sovereign, it’s starting to take shape and the big players like the Microsofts, the Mastercards are all moving in this direction at the moment as are Google. So, it’s starting.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, definitely great to know that is many, many companies, technology vendors and organisations are working on that today and so we are going to see more and more tools and resources. Yeah, very interesting discussion about who owns my identity and how to protect it. Changing a little bit off topic, I know you spend lately a lot of time on this organisation, Women in Identity, could you tell us a bit what are you doing there lately?</p>
<p>Diane: Yes, so Women on Identity is not-for-profit organisation. We’re looking at diversity and inclusion in the digital identity space. So, the name of our organisation is Women in Identity. It started as a bunch of women in identity but it’s about everyone. It’s about inclusion. So, we launched in June last year and we’re just getting the organisation set up now. So I’m the Events and Country Manager for Women in Identity so that means a lot of organisations or conferences come to us because they want diversity not only in their audiences but also in their speakers. So we’re starting to put together a speaker bank of women who can speak. And we also go out and we explain what Women in Identity is about. And it really is about making our industry think about diversity and avoiding bias and making sure that everyone can have an identity.</p>
<p>And the second thing I’m doing is setting the country chapters for that. So we have organisations in different countries at the moment. We’ve got the US, we’ve got Canada, we’ve got Germany, Netherland, UK and just starting up in Australia. So again, we can start to build a big community about making sure our industry recognises that we need that diversity. And it’s partially about supporting women in the industry and helping them but it’s also making sure that software vendors are building for diversity so you know there’s been quite a few issues recently with bias in AI and also bias in facial recognition. So the more the diverse our actual industry is the more we can bring that into the software so that it can work for everyone and we want it to work for everyone anywhere. So, it’s really exciting. It’s a not-for-profit and I’m a volunteer but we’ve got an amazing team of women who are just passionate about making this work.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. And I can hear your passion.</p>
<p>Diane: Yeah. Well, I love it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, fabulous. My last question is a question for anybody, not only for people who are in the digital identity community. For anybody, give us a tip to protect our own digital identity.</p>
<p>Diane: I’m going to do two if I may.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes.</p>
<p>Diane: The first one is passwords are not dead – we would love them to be but they’re not – use a password manager. And generate passwords. There are a number of great password managers out there now. They go across all your devices, so you’re never without your password and let it generate a password. If you can’t do that with your passwords, make them longer sentences that you will remember. Don’t reuse them. It takes two minutes for a credential stuffing to take a password and run it across the major organisations that you probably interact with.</p>
<p>And I think the second one is more UK-focused. And it’s more about identity theft. Sign up for a credit file service, there are a number of them that are free. And on a regular basis, have a look at your credit file and see who has pinged your credit file. So every time you do something in a financial institution, take out a credit card, give insurance, do something, you’ll end up with a marker against your credit file. If you see markers that you don’t know about, it tends to be that someone has got your identity and often what they do is they go to an insurance comparison website to see if they’ve got all the details right. And yes it comes back and yes they can get insurance. And then they tend to go to financial services products. All credit files have a list of your financial instruments. Check your bank account’s credit cards and make sure that you know them all and that they are balances are approximately what you would expect. And the third thing is check your addresses, make sure you recognise all the addresses that are against your credit file because again, change of address if I create a new credit card on your behalf I’ll probably send it to a new address. So, that I think in the UK and maybe in other countries, the States definitely, these are things you should do on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I’m not familiar with this way of doing. So, who manages this credit files? It’s the bank?</p>
<p>Diane: No. We have data aggregators called credit reference agencies, so Experian, Equifax, TransUnion, they all absorb all the information from the financial services and various organisations and bring it in as a data aggregator. And so when you open a bank account they tend to call a credit reference agency, first of all to check that it’s really you and are you credit worthy. And so, anyone who calls them leaves a marker against your account. And so, there are free services and there are paid for services as well, where you can actually go and look to see who has been looking at your credit file.</p>
<p>So, it’s quite valuable. And if you see something on your credit file you don’t recognise, the credit reference agencies can then help you by- you mark it as “I don’t know this” they’ll then investigate it further. That’s a great service in the UK and in the US. I’m not sure about other countries how the data aggregators work. But yeah, I’ve actually given that advice to someone and then they came back and say they’ve got five extra credit cards. I’m like, “Oh, you need to ping them.” So, and her identity had been compromised.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. Yeah, definitely it’s a good advice where these systems are very widely used like you say in UK and US. Yeah. So this is very good that you share this advice.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot Diane. It was great talking with you. Please let us know how we can find you and also the organisations you work for.</p>
<p>Diane: So, my Twitter handle is @kiwiIDgal, also on LinkedIn as Diane Joyce. At the moment, I’m working for Women in Identity.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Again, thanks a lot Diane and all the best.</p>
<p>Diane: Thanks very much, Oscar.</p>

 [Podcast transcript] 
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Hi and thanks for joining. Today you can virtually make business with companies that are from any continent. But how would you know without this face-to-face contact that you can trust the person that is behind this digital service?</p>
<p>Today we are going to hear about a European project that has built a global trust infrastructure and for that today, we have two guests. So let’s introduce you.</p>
<p>My first guest is Rachelle Sellung. She’s a Senior Scientist in the competence team of Identity Management at the IAT University of Stuttgart. Within this interdisciplinary team with an array of skill sets, she provides the Economic perspective for not only Identity Management, but a variety of IT Security related technologies.</p>
<p>She contributed a socio-economic perspective in the large-scale EU FP7 project, FutureID, which developed an identity management infrastructure for Europe. Currently, she is the lead for the University of Stuttgart in the EU Horizon2020 project, LIGHTest.</p>
<p>Hello Rachelle.</p>
<p>Rachelle Sellung: Hi. Thank you for having me.</p>
<p>Oscar: And our second guest is Alberto Miranda García. He is a Senior Business Consultant at Atos. Coming from the financial industry sector, such as Barclays Bank in the UK, later in 2017 Alberto joined the Financial Services sector of the Atos Research and Innovation unit, committed to business consultancy and exploitation management for European level projects, mainly related to cybersecurity and identity. Hello Alberto.</p>
<p>Alberto Miranda García: Hello. Hello all.</p>
<p>Oscar: Great to have you both Rachelle and Alberto. Thanks for having your time. I know that it’s the very last days of this project. Everybody in the team is extremely busy. We appreciate that. We would like to know how this project, LIGHTest, was originated. How was the original idea? What was the problem that needed to be solved?</p>
<p>Alberto: Yeah. So initially, the idea behind this project, how it started, it is the issues that we have in our daily life. So the number of transactions that are virtually conducted through the internet are increasing exponentially. So we are impacted on our daily activities with all those huge number of transactions.</p>
<p>There is a need for assistance from authorities to certificate those electronic identities in the transactions. The question that we have in mind is when you are conducting one of those transactions with a third party, you have a counterpart there. Are you sure that you are doing the transaction with that person? And even if you answered that question, is that person a trustworthy counterpart in the transaction?</p>
<p>So this is the aim of the project. The idea was to build a global trust infrastructure. Global because it is beyond the European Union. At least it was the initial idea, based on enhancing the existing internet domain name system, the DNS. So just some tips about how it was initiated.</p>
<p>Oscar: And this came from a previous European project. Is it the continuation of another?</p>
<p>Rachelle: I could say that there are many people who are working on the project that have been working together in other aspects of LIGHTest to be put together. But it’s not a direct successor of a previous project to my understanding.</p>
<p>Alberto: There are some related projects – that is not effectively an extension of a previous one. So the foreground of the project came from a related one. So that is not a second part, let’s say.</p>
<p>Oscar: Right. OK. Please tell us what is LIGHTest all about.</p>
<p>Rachelle: Well, basically these last three years we’ve had the goal of developing a tool that would help to [automate] the verification and translation of different trust schemes and other trust services components. I wanted to make sure, like Alberto already said, that it could be used globally, which is part of the reason why we chose to incorporate the DNS.</p>
<p>However, the DNS is basically only used as a search function. So don’t worry so much, security people out there. We’re not storing anything on the DNS. Basically a search function to find these different trust schemes or components, our trust lists to be able to verify or translate these documents. From a more general perspective, it’s basically a tool that helps verify certified documents that are under a new trust scheme format.</p>
<p>Oscar: So it’s a tool in the sense that end users can use but it’s also an infrastructure that has to be maintained by some- by a number of organisations, correct?</p>
<p>Rachelle: The goal of the project was to basically come up with two different pilots or prototypes to how this kind of infrastructure could work, which we have successfully done. That’s always an achievement of a research project.</p>
<p>However, the integration of the tool is largely used from the backend to make these kind of verification processes more efficient and to be able to have more options of trust schemes, because right now there’s not another tool that is automatically verifying these trust schemes.</p>
<p>From the front end, it largely depends on which way it’s integrated. We have one pilot that has a user interface but the other pilot is being integrated into an already existing infrastructure called Peppol.</p>
<p>Oscar: Right. It can have a direct user interface so it can be integrated with other existing services. Could you give us a couple of concrete use cases to illustrate how it works?</p>
<p>Rachelle: Basically LIGHTest is ultimately going to be very important for cross-border trust services – the cross-border trust services market so to say – especially in relation to cross-border banking, cross-border health or education. One of the most interesting use cases, at least from my perspective or that I’ve been fortunate enough to work with, is the education use case where we were contacted by the UNHCR to kind of help them create a demonstrator to how they could help refugees in getting into schools.</p>
<p>So basically, how LIGHTest is incorporated into this use case is that they always get these refugees who come and they have their documents and of course they’re coming from very complicated situations or maybe they’re not able to get the notaries that we could get in our everyday life as easily.</p>
<p>But the UNHCR, they have more knowledge about it to really accept these documents and if they accept these documents and put them in the trust scheme, then this could help universities to be able to accept this document that was already checked by the UNHCR saying, “Hey, I trust that the UNHCR did a good job on checking this document and we might not have all of the information ourselves. But we trust this document. Therefore, we will accept them into this programme,” if they have all the other requirements of course. That’s one of my favourite use cases that we’ve actually created or demonstrated for.</p>
<p>Oscar: So what is the institution? Sorry, is there a Red Cross?</p>
<p>Rachelle: UNHCR. So United Nations for Refugees.</p>
<p>Alberto: Yeah, it’s the Refugees Agency.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, OK, great. Yeah, it’s definitely an excellent use case and this is very clear that it can be applied globally.</p>
<p>Rachelle: For sure and our other use cases related to cross-border banking or cross-border health. So banking. I’m from the US but now I’m living in Germany. So I had to go and prove all these different things about me from the US. But of course in Germany, they have different standards to how to approve of these documents so I had to go get a handful of different notaries in the US to be able to prove my identity here or my history, my credit history, to be able to open up certain bank accounts. Or also when I studied here in Germany, I had to get four different notaries to prove that my university degree was actually a real degree. That’s just coming from the US to Germany where you have really good relations and yeah, it’s still very complex. So LIGHTest could help simplify this process quite a bit by being like “OK, so we accept all documents that are certified or underneath the US Department of Education accredited list”.</p>
<p>So as long as you would have a document, electronic document that has this kind of signature or attribute, then this would be automatically approved, that this would be a real document, instead of going through the chain of notaries.</p>
<p>Oscar: So the process today is still quite manual.</p>
<p>Rachelle: Oh, for sure. I mean at least my experience here in Germany and what a lot of people have told me. The next big thing was to get my grades translated from the US to Germany, where in the US if you have like a 3.8 or what not, that’s pretty good because 4.0 is the highest grade you can get. But in Germany, it’s an inverted scale so 4.0 is almost failing. They have to of course manually do this. So there’s like a university in Germany that takes on this task of translating all of the grades individually for each course and this of course takes quite a bit of time. There are even databases existing that could make this quicker. But they’re just not used efficiently. Hopefully in the future LIGHTest could help them.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, sounds good. So you already have illustrated some examples and combining several countries, what can be achieved, what are trust or identity documents in that case as well. What would be needed in every country for LIGHTest to succeed?</p>
<p>Rachelle: I would say that a lot of – at least from a governmental point of view – there are already a lot of governmental trust schemes like eIDAS or [unclear]. I guess it would just be to bring up the awareness for other companies, or on a private level, to be able to have this kind of standardised way to do these kinds of transactions. Alberto, do you have anything to add to that?</p>
<p>Alberto: I agree with that, yes. Awareness creation – so part of the project has invested a lot of effort doing dissemination and communication activities, participating in a lot of workshops and forums. We have been approached by interested end users, private and public, related to the benefits that LIGHTest can provide them once implemented or once they are using the infrastructure.</p>
<p>Oscar: But for instance eIDAS, to my understanding it’s only in the European Union scope.</p>
<p>Rachelle: Yeah, eIDAS is part of the EU or the member states. But there are actually a lot of people who are interested in making sure that there are certificates or already valid documents are up to the eIDAS standards especially when working with Europe. There’s a lot of potential there.</p>
<p>Oscar: Countries that are also outside of the European Union?</p>
<p>Rachelle: For sure, yeah. We’re living in a global society and a globalised world at the moment. Europe definitely plays a large role and not just within Europe but also the US, China…</p>
<p>Oscar: Also related to this, I’m trying to think of what are the – let’s say the obstacles or the things that still need to be built beside awareness as you said. And the other countries – like how many countries are in the world? Like almost 200? It depends how you count them. How many countries have you managed to get some collaboration in this project?</p>
<p>Alberto: You mean participants in the project?</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, some – not necessarily very active but some – well, the specific use cases. How many countries have you touched in total?</p>
<p>Rachelle: So another fun thing about LIGHTest is that we’ve had an international forum which is basically underneath our initiative to go global, right? So that was one of our main goals of the project, to make sure that we always have this global insight to this very European project.</p>
<p>So the international forum is basically a workshop that we held periodically throughout the project that was all around the world. So in the US, in Singapore, all over the EU of course, but also Azerbaijan and Egypt. We didn’t manage in Egypt but we did present there. But just to get an insight from experts from all these different regions of the world, from both people from the governments or from the public sector and private to make sure that we were able to incorporate the insights outside of the EU.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if that has helped you. So I can’t give you a direct number of how many countries we worked with. But I would say that we have done a pretty good job for our resources and of course the scope of the project, trying to make sure that we incorporate multiple regions of the world at least.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Sounds like an excellent job you have been doing. If you could tell me in these three years the project is ending, to my understanding, now in November.</p>
<p>Rachelle: Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: After these three years, what are the main achievements that the project has had?</p>
<p>Alberto: Yeah. As you say, we are almost there. We have to submit our last documents by the end of November. The aim of LIGHTest, as we mentioned at the very beginning, it was to have a direct impact at the global states. So it’s not only here in Europe but globally.</p>
<p>But also – and I think this is also quite important to mention. It is part of the project aim to have a direct impact or to transfer to the society, not only at the big institutions or big companies, but also to the small and medium enterprises that at the end of the day, they’re the ones that suffer the most the lack of this trustworthiness issues that we are having in the day-to-day transaction in the internet.</p>
<p>One of the key aspects of LIGHTest has been the focus on transferring these developments and these impacts to the market and then focus on the SMEs. We can say that we finished the project with a high level of maturity now we’re in the components we committed to develop. I don’t know if all of them, majority of them– at least the key ones are all ready to go to production environment.</p>
<p>They are based on open source approach. So they are on the Apache license. That means that technically anybody can use those results using the user manuals we are providing in the internet. There is also a cookbook about high level explanations on the technical stuff just to see the benefits of LIGHTest.</p>
<p>In theory, anybody can use all the developments of the project on their own. They need some technical knowledge base in their organisations but there is no need for them to have a heavy financial impact in their balances to get the developments of the project.</p>
<p>This is on one side and on the other one, talking about the global impact, we can say now that one of the action lines that we were working and Rachelle mentioned before, it was related to the Azerbaijan Ministry of Transport and Communication and High Technologies. They are part of the advisory board of the project and they just confirmed us a few weeks ago that they are going to deploy one of the components in their systems.</p>
<p>They have a data processing centre in Azerbaijan and they are going to use part of the technology of LIGHTest to enhance the capabilities. This will address the global impact that we aim. We think this is part of the achievements that we have done during these three years that materialises specifically in some specific topics.</p>
<p>Rachelle: For sure and I think also we’ve had some very fruitful collaboration during the project. We worked with a German research project, Industrial Data Space, to create – demonstrated how LIGHTest could be incorporated also in industry 4.0, use cases and predictive maintenance and then of course also the demonstrator that we’ve built, proof of concept for the DAFI programme, the scholarship programme for refugees with UNHCR. I think we’ve definitely done a lot for three years. It’s nice.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. I think this example from Azerbaijan says a lot here. It’s an achievement and an impact in a country outside the European Union where all of you, the creators of this project have been working. What will come next now that the project is finishing? What will come next?</p>
<p>Alberto: OK. Just to make it short because there are quite a few things going here and there. In our last general assembly in Stuttgart a month ago, that question was on the table. What are we doing now? We just close things and that’s it, or we are going to extend the impact in the trust ecosystem? Majority of partners have a commitment to continue with the activities that we are doing. Not in the same way because obviously the project has finished. There is no budget behind and the organisations have their own interest and they have to invest it therefore in different things.</p>
<p>There is an intention to continue with the activities we have been doing during the project. For example, some partners will continue attending workshops and providing information and communication and disseminating the benefits of LIGHTest in the workshops they attend.</p>
<p>There will be a single point of contact for any end user or any person interested that would ask about LIGHTest developments. How can they use it? Who can help them? This spokesman or this single point of contact will redistribute to the rest of the partners that want to continue with their activities those questions and they will be addressed at some point. For example, if someone needs to deploy one of the components, it would be referred to the consulting partners or to the technical ones that can provide support at that moment.</p>
<p>There will be a [unclear] to continue with the activities and to prove the impacts of the development. So all those things will be extended for a limited time beyond the project then, one, two years, depending on the commitment of the partners.</p>
<p>Alongside with that, the extension of the activities of the project, there are some action lines initiated during the project not finished, but we will be willing to continue investigating and providing support. As Rachelle mentioned, the UNHCR for refugees programme, it is ongoing. If there is any need for extension or for analysis or for technical support partners will be there to continue with that.</p>
<p>Alongside with this, there is another initiative in the Haiti identity- (Haiti is the country in the Caribbean) identity initiative that one of our advisory board members bring to us that some faith-based organisations are interested in providing. Again trust verification to the refugees in that specific community in Haiti. It is just initiated, the engagement and the questions. But as I mentioned, we will continue providing support on that.</p>
<p>Of course – and it is also important to remind the two pilots we have. It is related to the emailing post and the e-procurement that have been deployed during the project. They have been financially audited in the project. So they are viable from a financial point of view. And the developments of LIGHTest can be implemented in the business as usual of those organisations. There will be a direct impact on what they are providing to their customers because LIGHTest enhanced their functionalities. Even the project won’t be directly involved in that, the results will be extended in time. I think those tips just can give you an idea of how we can extend after we finish in three weeks.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. You have lots of examples. It sounds like a real business, a real service.</p>
<p>Alberto: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah.</p>
<p>Rachelle: We definitely try to make sure that we have a lot of different venues progressing because I mean it’s not just like in research. We want to be able to ensure that there’s this future for LIGHTest that’s not just in research but also in a more applied sense and across sectors. So in the private sector, public sector and also non-governmental.</p>
<p>Oscar: Just also to know what you completed in these three years. There’s a lot of components in the technical side. Alberto mentioned there’s open source components that are ready, that people can – are using them. What about in the legal side? There were supposed to be legal instruments that become – enforceable law in some countries or that was not the objective?</p>
<p>Rachelle: So LIGHTest, it doesn’t really deal so much with the legal aspect of it only because like that is up to the user using LIGHTest. However, during the project, we do have a legal partner, Time-Lex, where they have created some tools and guides for users of LIGHTest to try to help get them aware of what to consider and what to think about. While we don’t accept any liability or responsibility for the legal side, we have tried to help prepare users.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Anything else you would like to highlight about the project?</p>
<p>Rachelle: I think that this project has achieved a lot in its time, especially being such a large project. There’s so many different partners from all over Europe with different backgrounds, different disciplines, private, public sector, the legal side, the tech side. I think that everyone has harmonised in a really nice way and I think that it’s coming to a really good end that everybody can be proud of. I know this is probably very American of me to say but I think we did well.</p>
<p>Alberto: Yeah. At the end of the day, what really makes the difference is how all partners interact between them in the project because you can be an expert that if you are dependent on another party and they are not responding, things don’t work. What I really think is that we have then this interaction between partners in the best way we could do it because at the end of the day, the results are there.</p>
<p>So the components are up and running and we have, let’s say, officially no delays because everything is ready to go before the end. I fully agree with Rachelle that the interaction between partners is the key aspect of the success of the project.</p>
<p>Oscar: Great. I would like to ask a final question I ask to all our guests, to give us a tip for anybody to protect our digital identities. What would you say?</p>
<p>Alberto: OK. So just to make it very easy, probably you already received that answer before, that typical case that all of us are doing on a daily basis. In our internet browser, when you try to access a webpage, one of the basic things you can do is to verify that the service provider is a legitimate one. You can check the certificate if it’s an HTTPS or a trusted authority just to verify the authenticity of the source you are connecting.</p>
<p>This is for the individuals and also for the organisations. When we are – a story now where identity in service provider. We need to know that it is a trustworthy third party. There should be legal mechanisms to request those providers to prevent the leak of our data. So there are some legal restrictions and legal bindings for them to fulfil some characteristics or it has to prevent the leakage of the information stored in their systems.</p>
<p>Rachelle: From my side, I would just say beware of who you trust and value your ability to make trust decisions regarding your digital identity.</p>
<p>Oscar: So always take some extra second and think twice.</p>
<p>Alberto: Yeah, and read it.</p>
<p>Rachelle: Exactly, yeah. And to value that you have a decision and to make sure that you keep it.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. Thanks, thanks for that. Thanks for your tips also. It’s great to hear. I have this good feeling that the project has finished successfully and will still continue. There are entities across the world that are gradually knowing about it and getting in contact. So please let us know how – anybody who can be listening to this podcast either now, next year, how they can be in touch. The best way to get in touch with LIGHTest.</p>
<p>Rachelle: We have two websites. So one of them is <a href="https://www.lightest-community.org/">www.lightest-community.[org]</a> and then the other one is <a href="https://www.lightest.eu/">lightest.eu</a> I believe. If you look up “EU LIGHTest research project”, you will find those two websites. We also have a Twitter and we’re on LinkedIn. We’re trying to be connected.</p>
<p>Alberto: Those two websites will be up and running after the project ends. So if anybody wants to contact, those are the main channels or this is one at least.</p>
<p>Rachelle: We have a correction. It’s <a href="https://www.lightest-community.org/">lightest-community.org</a>. Sorry.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, excellent. So there are ways to get in touch with LIGHTest now and in the future. So again, congratulations for your achievements, to you and to everybody in this large team that has been working. Thanks a lot and all the best.</p>
<p>Rachelle: Thank you for having us and giving us this opportunity to get some more dissemination and it’s definitely good to reach out to the identity world through your podcast. So thank you.</p>
<p>Alberto: Thank you Oscar.</p>

 [Podcast transcript] 
<p>Let’s talk about digital identity. The podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thanks for joining today. Today we’re going to discuss a situation in which many people who have to sign documents and are given a digital version of signing might be aware that is this really safer, more secure than the old way? Or, if you are one of these persons who are signing documents not occasionally but many times per day and you think there will be a more modern way to do this. So we’re going to talk about digital signatures. And for that we have our guest today.</p>
<p>Let me introduce you to Robin von Post. He has a deep interest and experience in the IT-security domain. He has for the last 20 years been involved in the development and deployment of high assurance encryption systems for European government and defence customers, with the last year’s focus on securing national civilian critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>Last year, Robin took on a role at Cybercom Secure as the Head of IAM Solutions, including advanced electronic signature services, directory administration and governance, and other IAM and security related services.</p>
<p>On a private note, he weekly curates a newsletter called The von Post covering IT-security related events. He is also a private pilot and a passionate photographer.</p>
<p>Hello Robin.</p>
<p>Robin von Post: Hello Oscar. Nice to be online talking to you here on this podcast.</p>
<p>Oscar: Great talking with you, Robin. Welcome. Please tell us what was your journey to this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Robin: Yeah. The digital identities and the digital signatures, I think it’s one of the most basic platform or building blocks that you need to have in order to make a good transition into pure digital. I mean there’s a lot of systems where you just add up services and so on, but the problem is always how can you prove that you have the right person in front of the computer, or that you have received the correct information from the right person. And that’s where– my experience tells me that we need to solve this in a good way.</p>
<p>And we have been doing this now for quite some time. As you mentioned in my bio there, I only have been here for almost two years now but we have been doing this for almost 10 years at Cybercom and we have a good experience in solving these kinds of problems. And I think that a lot of the times there will be gaps in the digital flows. There’ll be gaps where you need to print out stuff, sign it by hand, put in an envelope, go to the post office and send it. Someone needs to receive it. It needs to be scanned and it needs to be archived. So these un-digital gaps that we see in a lot of the digital solutions today, I think there is a strong need to get rid of those. So that’s why I’m so interested in yes the digital signatures and then electronic identities that we see today.</p>
<p>Oscar: Sure. And what other challenges do you see today in digital identity?</p>
<p>Robin: Well, the challenge is of course also how to trust between organisations or between nations. There is a lot of issues where you have one solution on one side, and another solution on another side. And the problem is that since this is a quite new field to trust digital signatures and identities there is a lot of different solutions. They are trying to enforce standards and I mean the European Union has set this eIDAS standard and enforced that in several steps. And that’s a really good thing.</p>
<p>I mean they have the greatest ambitions of bringing the EU together on this on a standard note, and also on the interoperability between countries and how that should work both in– I mean in all the digital services that we see coming in the– yeah, coming 10 to 20 years for the European departments and countries and organisations that are involved. Because I mean if you get a document from Finland that has been digitally signed by you, and sends it over to me and I need a way to trust how is this keeping together? Can I trust that it’s from you? Can I trust that it is not altered in a way?</p>
<p>And the big advantage I would say of a good electronic signature then is that you can actually trust the data that you get. You could actually start working on the data with a computer, not with the person that needs to scroll through and check that it’s reasonable stuff. You can say, “OK Oscar, here, you actually signed this. You signed this information that I get. So I can trust that it’s you that’s behind this information.” And that’s something that will really expedite or make digital flows more efficient.</p>
<p>And we see a lot of the challenges today that we have both in companies and in the public sector and other governmental institutions, that we have inefficient ways of working because some of these basic ‘puzzle pieces’ so to speak are not there yet. But it’s getting there and I see that in a lot of our customers that we have now delivered this to, there is actually making great progress in actually tying together.</p>
<p>I mean we’re working to you with Ubisecure with external customer identities and bringing together not only the external identities and signatures but also to internal identities and signatures. So it’s both the internal core administration flows that need to go digital and the external ones, and tie these together because it shouldn’t be hard. And it’s not really that hard if you go for a solution that’s trusted and where you keep to the standards that there are. So that’s also a big advantage I would say.</p>
<p>Oscar: Sure. Sure. There are many– what you have said shows many scenarios in which digital signatures can be used. If we keep a little bit back to the basics for people who are not familiar with what digital signature is, how would you define what is a digital signature? And also, some maybe misconceptions that you usually hear about that.</p>
<p>Robin: Yeah, that’s a really good question I would say because there is a lot of things that people consider a good signature or not a good signature and so on. And I think that there is a good definition of course. And it also depends on the use case where you need it. Some things that you sign should be valid for maybe 50 years, some things is just something that you sign because you buy something and then it’s over in like half a year it’s not relevant. So we’re talking a lot about the level of assurance that you have. And in some electronic way, you need to tie this assured identity with the right level to the document or the information part that you want to sign. And we are working both with PDF versions of information and XML versions. So there are some standards for that, of course. Not going into much of the technical details but I mean we need to tie this information to you.</p>
<p>So, if I get a good view that I’m talking with Oscar here, you have made that probable on some level, maybe I called you up at the correct number and you give me the secret password or something and then I know, “OK, Oscar is on the other side”. And then we can tie this information to you. You will actually– like you when you do the hand written signature on the paper, you will also tie in a technical way in a hash or a fingerprint of the document that we enclose with your signature.</p>
<p>And I think that’s one common misconception that we see several solutions today that some company has a stamp and they make you go into their website and you log in to that website, and you load your document there. Then they put a digital stamp on it. So let’s say that the name of the company is Signatures Inc., maybe there is one that’s that name. Yes. Pretend that it was made up.</p>
<p>So Signature Inc. sets its stamp on the digital document and also as information in the document says Oscar was actually logged into our system and said that he wanted to sign this document. But then to document is actually not signed by you. It’s signed by Signature Inc. And they need to be there to prove that you actually signed the document. And what happens in 20 years when they’re not there anymore? How about the logs? How about the traceability? How about the accountability? Can you say, “No, I didn’t sign that”. How can they track your assurance of your identity to that document? Can you go to the other party where they say, “Oh, Oscar, you signed this?” And you say, “No, I didn’t sign that.” So you will be in a legal process, right? To try to convince them that you didn’t. Then you need to be also involving Signature Inc. because they put a stamp on this.</p>
<p>But I think that there is a good level in the standardisation that’s going on in EU today that is actually good advanced electronic signature where you are the one signing the document. So Oscar signed the document. We create an individual certificate that proves that you are logged in and then we embed that in to the document itself. And then you can email this, you can send it up to some file share, you can do anything with it and you will actually be liable for what you signed. So that’s one important part.</p>
<p>Another, misconception is not the right term but the, challenge is of course how do we prove in the future that you signed this? 50 years from now there is new algorithms, there is new policies for how to create signatures and so on, so there needs to be some way in this process on how to re-evaluate the signature to re-address the new policies that might be enforced in like five years. So you take your side document and then you have to seal it in the best practice way that will hold in 2025 so to speak. So, it also needs to be a futureproof solution in that sense to be- follow along with the lines of the standardisation that will actually go on.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, one question that came to mind is that you said that I should be the one signing the document instead of the provider, but does it mean that I sign it? Is that the cryptographic signature done on side, on my device or what exactly means that I sign it?</p>
<p>Robin: Yeah. That’s a really good question. I think that the cryptographic signature that you create should be unique for your signature and for that document. It should not be a signature that’s made just by Signature Inc. on that document. It should be also tied to you in some way. And, yeah, that’s where the difference will happen.</p>
<p>Oscar: Right. Exactly that’s the difference. OK. What would you say are the top reasons why people and organisations should move to signing documents digitally already today? So why now?</p>
<p>Robin: Yeah, coming back to that I think that it’s actually available now. There are standards. There are ways of doing it. And there are proven ways of how it works. So there’s no reason to wait.</p>
<p>There is also, as I said, the wave of digitalisation that you have now in this era of going digital, there is a lot of possible places where you will actually put a digital signature in the flow. It should be internal or it could be internal, it could be external or it could be a mix. Someone internally makes a document, signs this to and provide this document to an external part where they want to sign as well. And that shouldn’t be two different systems. It shouldn’t be two different ways of signing this. It should be according to how the best of brand electronic signatures are done today, I think. So, it’s no reason to wait because it’s there. And it’s no reason to wait because it’s one of the foundations that you’re putting into– in order to enable efficient digital processes.</p>
<p>Oscar: Mm-hmm. And there is no excuse that is it’s difficult.</p>
<p>Robin: No, actually I would say that creating the signature and handling the security around it, the processes and et cetera and all these, that’s something that is quite advanced. But from a customer perspective, it’s simple. And I would say from an end user perspective also it’s simple. But the rest we will take care of at Cybercom.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, that was my question from the end user perspective. Now, some people might still feel or have this conception that it’s difficult. But I believe too that at this point in time when there are great tools, like <a href="https://www.cybercom.com/sv/vad-vi-gor/secure-connectivity/identity--access-management/iam-assets/digital-underskriftstjanst/">SignPort by Cybercom</a>, that are doing things right and make it easy for customers.</p>
<p>So another thing that usually discuss about digital signatures are the types, the types that refer to the levels. Some are more strict, it depends also what’s required on a legal basis. Could you tell us these types of digital signatures?</p>
<p>Robin: Yeah, I mean that there is some levels. I mean on the basic level it’s just an email that you sent to someone which says, “Hey, I’m Oscar… sell me stuff”. That’s one kind of a signature, right? That assurance is really basic and almost zero. It was easy to spoof. Then you have next level where you can create your own account on some Facebook or Google and you could actually involve that in the signature.</p>
<p>The next level is of course that you have some kind of electronic ID that some system will hold together -that you actually went to the bank or to some kind of a person to actually prove together with some identity papers or identity proof that you are you. And then will tie that electronic identity to you. So like in Sweden we have BankID or Freja eID. I know in Finland you have some other ways of doing it. And there’s a system that will actually catch if there’s someone trying to fraud or fool the systems and that’s of course the level of assurance you will actually get on the signature as well then with that kind of identity.</p>
<p>Then on the highest level, you will actually, as you mentioned, make the signature in your own physical device on your phone or on your smart card or whatever. That’s something that would be highest level. Then, of course, you always have the problem of visibility, I mean if you get a document, how do you know that it’s actually that document that you send down to the smart card and tie that to the signature? So you always have the problem of availability and ease of use. And the level described as the advanced electronic to your signature is actually the one that that is spreading across borders now in Europe I would say because it’s a good mix and level of assurance for that signatures.</p>
<p>Oscar: Good. And what about the business benefits because we talk about digital identity in this podcast but we focus also what is the– what are the business opportunities about digital signatures. What would you say are these business opportunities and if you can mention some used cases to illustrate that?</p>
<p>Robin: Well, I see it from several angle points so to speak, several angles. From the public perspective, it’s a way of the accountability that you will get as a citizen in a country. I think that it’s- given the standardisations that’s going on we also have a possibility that I will come to Finland and my electronic signature holds.</p>
<p>So I mean if you’re starting your business, or I mean yeah from a legal perspective, you’re obliged to accept eIDAS signatures today in the public sector in Sweden and in whole of Europe actually. But I’m not sure how they do it in all countries yet. I haven’t seen the widespread deployment. And I know that in some countries digital identities are not really widespread so that will of course a limit the use of electronic signatures as well. But I mean if you look specifically in the Nordics, and some like Estonia or Spain and Portugal, that’s widely deployed there.</p>
<p>So that I think from a market perspective, you have those markets to address. But if you have a good electronic identity system, and acceptance maybe from citizens and acceptance from people working in the organisations for electronic IDs, then you’ll also have a good business case for electronic signatures. Because I think from a business perspective there’s a lot of processes that would actually benefit from- what you do is actually that you take the data and you stamp it with a quality mark. You will say that this information here holds quality. You can trust it, right. And a lot of business is actually based upon trust in a lot of levels. And given the threat level of stuff happening from people spoofing phone calls and et cetera, people spoofing emails targeting CEOs to make money transfers to strange addresses et cetera, I think that we need to strengthen the trust in the information we have both internally and externally.</p>
<p>Oscar: Mm-hmm. Yeah, that’s definitely an excellent point what you said and you have convinced me. I hope you convinced also others that yeah, digital signatures are today are ready, they are good solutions and we should embrace them.</p>
<p>Robin: Absolutely.</p>
<p>Oscar: How do you foresee the future? How do you think this is going to evolve?</p>
<p>Robin: I think which actually are only in the beginning right now. As I see it both from a national and a European perspective, there are not all countries or not all organisations that have actually adopted the electronic ID, electronic signature. So organisations and the departments that have actually went into this now are the ones going first. And I think there is a lot more to follow.</p>
<p>And I think that’s when the interesting part starts to happen. Because you and I, if we are only sending documents back and forth to us, that’s of course easy to solve. But the more parts we involve in this the more benefit, because if you send information or documents to 5 or 10 or different organisations, you as an organisation, if one of them can’t really accept or handle a digitally signed document or information parts that will of course be a not a problem today because there’s a lot of organisations that can’t handle it. So you always need to have fallback for all situations.</p>
<p>But if we get an adoption throughout organisations where you can actually send the documents from one department to another or from one company to another and there is not a problem- So I think actually we see the start now, the early adopters are there and doing it. And actually when the early majority will follow on these early adopters to actually go into embracing, we trust information that has been signed according to this way, I think we will see it will be like a tornado effect. And we can save so much time. Time is the only thing that we have that’s equal throughout to every citizen Europe, right? There’s 24 hours a day and we can’t make up more time so we have to take care of the time we have, not printing stuff, sending it, archiving.</p>
<p>Oscar: Right.</p>
<p>Robin: I see a lot of possibilities of people working in organisations that could actually work with things that humans are fit for, instead of systems or computers. And that’s one key to that is adopting, trusting and involving digital IDs and digital signatures.</p>
<p>Oscar: Mm-hmm. Yeah, excellent. So, yeah, we are – we are still in the beginning so there are still a lot more to come.</p>
<p>Robin: Yeah, that’s cool. Let’s have a talk again in like 5, 10 years and see where we are then.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, sounds good so we can absolutely compare that and actually be…</p>
<p>Robin: Yeah, let’s book that in our electronic calendars. I can sign a document where I will promise that I will make the next interview with you.</p>
<p>Oscar: Let’s sign a promise digitally.</p>
<p>Robin: No problem.</p>
<p>Oscar: That sounds pretty cool, huh.</p>
<p>Robin: Let’s do it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Now, please, well, it’s almost the end. I would like you to leave us with a practical tip that anybody, not only experts, can do right away or start doing to improve to protect their digital identities.</p>
<p>Robin: In Sweden, there are a lot of people that have digital identities. If you have it and you use it every day, start requiring that you could also sign documents with your digital ID because there are a lot of places where you can actually go to a website, you can fill out the form and the PDF, and in the end, why can’t you sign the document with your digital identity? And just start to question that because that’s not the way it should be. So, for everyone, I would urge everyone to start requiring a possibility to digitally sign information that they enter, not being forced to print and sign by hand. That I would suggest to everyone listening to this podcast.</p>
<p>Oscar: Mm-hmm. And should we demand that to the services?</p>
<p>Robin: I think there is no reason for people – for systems not to introduce this possibility. I think actually we tell everyone that’s listening to require that and we should also tell all the service providers that they should start implementing a possibility to have a digital signature in their solutions.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. Let’s do that. It is very important. Yes. Well, thanks a lot Robin. It was great talking with you. Please let us know how we can find you on the net.</p>
<p>Robin: OK, no problem. I’m on Twitter with @rvonpost handle. I’m on LinkedIn, just search for Robin von Post or you can actually also subscribe to that weekly newsletter that I curate every Friday morning – the latest IT-security news. It’s like a one-pager just to keep everyone updated on if there have been any things they shouldn’t miss in this domain. So, please feel free to sign up for that one.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, that’s very nice you have this newsletter, I have to follow it. Thanks for sharing that. That’s going to be in the show notes of this episode. And again, it’s been a pleasure talking with you Robin and all the best!</p>

 [Podcast transcript] 
<p>Let’s talk about digital identity. The podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thanks for joining. Today we will have a conversation with a man who has led, and today leads, very influential organisations in this realm of digital identity.</p>
<p>Don Thibeau is Executive Director of the OpenID Foundation, a non-profit international standards development organisation of individuals and companies committed to enabling, promoting and protecting OpenID technologies.</p>
<p>The foundation’s membership includes leaders from across industry sectors and governments that collaborate on the development, adoption and deployment of open identity standards.</p>
<p>Don is also the Co-Chair of the OASIS Electronic Identity Credential Trust Elevation Methods (Trust Elevation) Technical Committee and Don was the founder of the Open Identity Exchange and serves on its board.</p>
<p>Hello Don.</p>
<p>Don Thibeau: Hello Oscar. I’ve been looking forward to this conversation for some time.</p>
<p>Oscar: Same on our side. It’s great talking with you today. So let’s talk about digital identity. I would like to ask you first, what was your journey to this world of digital identity?</p>
<p>Don: Yes. Most of my career has been involved in the identity data business. The companies that I’ve been part of and the companies that I’ve founded have all in one form or fashion been concerned with how identity is expressed online, both in code and in governance.</p>
<p>So the work that I’ve been doing for the last 10 years has really been focused on digital identity on a global basis. I’ve had an opportunity to lead two organisations in the space and if I can, I will just briefly summarise for your audience what the OpenID Foundation is and the Open Identity Exchange is.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, please.</p>
<p>Don: So in short, it’s really a focus on the rules and tools of identity. By tools I mean how identity is expressed in code, in machine-readable language online and specifically how that code is expressed in open identity standards. Most recently the OpenID Connect standard, which has been adopted by most large and small companies worldwide, and building on top of OpenID Connect is the financial grade API standard. I’m sure we will talk about that more later.</p>
<p>But the OpenID Foundation really has a focus exclusively on providing these open standards for adoption on a global basis. So that’s the toolset. But increasingly important, and certainly for European audience, is that technology is not enough. We need to have a rule set, a governance framework, a trust framework if you will.</p>
<p>So the Open Identity Exchange was really born in the White House, in the early days of the Obama administration. President Obama had a very personal and substantial interest in online identity and protecting citizen services. So he gathered the leaders of the industry in the White House and asked them to organise a partnership so that there would be a public-private conversation over the course of his administration about digital identity, its technical standards and its governance.</p>
<p>So the OIX has focused on building trust frameworks and best practices in digital identity at scale and we’ve had a lot of work done in the US throughout the Obama administration and over the last many years, in the UK with the UK cabinet office and their government digital service. These two efforts, like others throughout the globe, represents the challenges of government delivering services to its citizens and citizens being able to reliably and securely and easily sign into government services.</p>
<p>So there has been not without friction and challenge in both those efforts. The reason that I am interested in talking to you and your audience is because in the Nordics, there’s now a ten-year history of success in this collaboration between government agencies and private sector companies. And that success comes from when you add open standards, technical requirements, with governance, rules and the sum of those two parts is what many call a trust framework or a scheme as the Brits say.</p>
<p>So if you look in the Nordics, certainly in Norway and Sweden, you can see the power of trust frameworks at work and that power results in better services to government by- for its citizens and also an expansion of economic development in the private sector, all based on having a common trust framework around knowing that that person online is in fact who they say they are and that company that you’re doing business with is in fact a company that is authentically your partner.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, very interesting and you have put in a very simple way. You know, the OpenID Foundation is about the toolset, the technical side of these standards that we need and we use like OpenID Connect and OIX, the Open Identity Exchange. The rule sets, how to scale this globally, and you mentioned that started in the US, in the White House you said. Also now it’s used in the UK. What else is Open Identity Exchange today focused on?</p>
<p>Don: Open Identity Exchange really has been working hard on building new institutions, new instantiations of this public-private partnership. Again this has been a matter of success over time in the Nordics, but still is a challenge for countries like the US and UK, and Australia as well, as we culturally and legally have an aversion to identity cards for example.</p>
<p>We culturally and in our common law don’t have a provision for a specific government role in online digital identity. So the struggles that continue in my country and elsewhere really speak not to the technology problems. We’ve got great technology tools. But we in many countries haven’t found the way of aligning technical tools and governance rules.</p>
<p>What I find interesting about the Nordics and the experience there is that it really represents a third way for this public-private partnership to occur. And that third way I think is best expressed by Francois Macron who said the state of identity on the internet is really two polar opposites.</p>
<p>Macron talked about the Chinese model of state-sponsored identity and surveillance, and the California model, which is anything goes and the monetisation of personally-identifying information.</p>
<p>So it’s with great interest I think that this global audience has turned to the experience in the Nordics, the challenges that we now have in taking identity into payment processing and banking and the regulatory environment under construction in the EU, through the eIDAS&nbsp;and PSD2 and other regulations that are founded on a strong authentication and Good Identity verification model.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, very interesting these – you mentioned two poles, right? Very state-governed identity and one that is monetisation of a very open market.</p>
<p>Don: I should also add the good work that’s being done by the DIACC group in Canada. I have a lot of respect for Joni Brennan’s leadership, which has resulted in what’s now known as the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework and through the work of DIACC and Joni’s leadership, they’ve been able to have the full participation of not only the banks in Canada but the telcos as well as the provincial and federal government.</p>
<p>So the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework, like the work being done in Nordics, represent this third way or middle ground that accounts for the economic power that we’re discovering in data in general and identity data in particular, but also provides a proper and appropriate regulatory environment for those transactions to occur.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, we talked also with Joni Brennan.</p>
<p>Don: Yes, I listened to all of your podcasts – with Joni and most recently with my friend Cameron at One World Identity.</p>
<p>Oscar: Oh, yes, that was the last one before this conversation. Yes, she mentioned exactly some – one thing that you said that bringing identity– digital identity opens more opportunities for more business. You know, that’s business growth. So that’s excellent. Now that you –</p>
<p>Don: We can see that in real time. Facebook makes $16 billion a month with a product and social network that has as its basis digital identity.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Well, big numbers, exactly. Yes. You already mentioned CDIAC. What about comparing how is the modus operandi of – especially OIX with DIACS and also Kantara Initiative that we talked earlier during this podcast. How would you compare- how it’s different to OIX?</p>
<p>Don: Yeah. OIX is taking a global approach and Joni and DIACC are really focused again on a Pan-Canadian model. So I think that we have to work locally but we have to think globally. A good example of that is working in this current disruption, in the global financial services sector where new regulations associated with open banking in Europe, PSD2 regulations, really require financial institutions that we know well like banks and new innovators in the FinTech space, and payment processing space, to really begin to rethink their understanding and their deployments that at its very core require a deep understanding of digital identity technology and governance.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. And what would you say that for an organisation that is hearing about OIX for the first time, how– what are the best ways that an organisation can collaborate, cooperate or benefit with doing something with OIX?</p>
<p>Don: Well, the great benefit of OIX is our work product, white papers. We have over 10 years been able to receive very substantial funding from companies like Google and Microsoft and others, but also government or funds both from the EU through the LIGHTest programme and also the UK government.</p>
<p>All of this work has been delivered in terms of white papers. Those white papers can be found at Open Identity Exchange’s website, <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/">openidentityexchange.org</a>. But importantly, each of those white papers takes a very laser-like focus on particular problem sets or particular use cases that are involved in identity systems at scale.</p>
<p>So for example we have a lot of white papers on, ‘what is a trust framework?’, ‘how do trust frameworks operate?’ and ‘how is liability associated in these trust frameworks?’</p>
<p>So the white papers range from legal treatises on the interaction of liability and law and identity systems. Also the inclusions of marginalised populations in identity systems as well as how biometrics and trust marks are to be added into these identity systems.</p>
<p>So we would like to think that OIX made a contribution to the community at large by offering these white papers freely available to anyone at any time through its website.</p>
<p>Oscar: Wow, that sounds excellent. That’s like in here very specific real case examples. OK. So it’s …</p>
<p>Don: You know, we wanted to avoid the problem that many identity professionals get into where they want to boil the ocean. We boiled a few ponds and have tried to report the progress and the challenges of different pilots that have occurred in Scotland and the State of Jersey and the UK and the US. So we’ve got some interesting work on attribute exchange models that was very early days that are now being adopted globally.</p>
<p>So we hope that by sharing the benefit of this work experience and these practical white papers, that other companies, organisations and governments can build on what has been built.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. It sounds like really valuable resources available there. Yeah, being – talking a bit more about OIX. You are the founder. But now to my understanding, my understanding is that you are now more focused in OpenID Foundation as an Executive Director. So please tell me what is your work there currently.</p>
<p>Don: My work at OpenID Foundation really has taken on a specific focus around Open Banking. And the reason I mentioned Open Banking is that a deep understanding of Open Banking takes you into the world of open identity. So if you think about the Venn Diagram of Open Banking and Open Identity, where those two circles meet is where I think the real action is, the real dynamism is in the global ecosystem that we are part of.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is that in the work that the OpenID Foundation has been doing with respect to PSD2, Open Banking regulations in the US and UK, Australia and Japan, what we’re trying to do is meet a burning business problem. And the burning business problem of Open Banking is expressed in two ways. We will go bottom up and top down.</p>
<p>Bottom up, what is at the core of Open Banking and its related regulations in Europe, Australia and elsewhere is giving the user, giving the bank customer agency over the data about them being held by a financial services institution.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is expressed in terms of data portability. What governments around the world are pushing for is greater agency or greater control by a user of the financial data that that user generates about his life, the mortgages that he takes, the credit card statements that represent his transactions, the loans, etc.</p>
<p>That information, that very rich identity data is very powerful. So giving greater agency and protecting the privacy of the user and making a user experience that’s easy to understand, with the appropriate consent, is the largest challenge that we have in financial services and really the north star of those of us that are in the identity business.</p>
<p>So Open Banking is a disruptor in the identity ecosystem and I think its disruption is being felt again from the bottom up for all of us as citizens, as customers as users of these online financial services, but also top down. What I mean by top down is that global players in financial services, large banks, start-ups, FinTechs, payment processors all have to be concerned with two things. Being in compliance with government regulations in each country, in each region, and at the same time, being in conformance with technical standards.</p>
<p>Because we live in a global world, it’s not enough to have a proposition for your customers that only works in one country. We have to understand that both business organisations, governments as well as citizens are increasingly participating in a global economy. So what that means from a top-down perspective is that it’s very difficult and very problematic for an organisation that wants to do business internationally to have to comply- to be in compliance with a different set of regulations in each country.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of opportunity cost. That’s a lot of complications from a technology platform point of view and that’s confusing for the businesspeople that are trying to sell goods and services on a global stage.</p>
<p>So what we’ve been trying to do at the OpenID Foundation is to make that simpler, to make that more secure. So we built a new standard on top of OpenID Connect called the “financial grade API”. And what this new standard is all about is having a higher level of assurance, a step-up if you will, from verification to authentication and to do it in an open and standardised way.</p>
<p>That allows banks and other financial institutions to be able to be in compliance both from a regulatory point of view as well as in conformance from a technical point of view on a global basis. So for example, the FAPI standard has been adopted by the UK Open Banking Implementation Entity, which is a group of the nine major banks in the UK and we continue to have a very vigorous dialogue with our colleagues in the Berlin group so that we can make this approach consistent with the objectives of the PSD2 regulations and the way that the European Union has organised its eIDAS programme.</p>
<p>So what we’re trying to do and what we’ve got some great success in doing is having different jurisdictions and different global players adopt the FAPI standard, so that they can be assured of compliance on a global basis, so that they are more secure as institutions and can provide more secure and privacy-protecting services to citizens on a global basis.</p>
<p>Oscar: So is FAPI, financial grade API, already in production in the UK?</p>
<p>Don: It has been adopted by UK banks and let me tell you a quick story about FAPI. It’s always interesting to look at the names of things. So about midway through the course of the work group’s development, the three leaders of the work group decided to make a change in its name. Originally the financial grade API was intended to serve financial services business sectors. But the more experience and the more adoption that took place with that standard is- a very simple thing occurred, which is a global open authentication standard good enough for the banks, would be good enough for other high assurance applications and other sectors, like airlines and transportation, health insurance, healthcare or others. So we have the promise of FAPI. We’re still in the early days. That we can have a global high assurance standard that not only FinTechs can use but other industry can use as they build out their identity infrastructure.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. And the other standard that is to my understanding connected to this effort is CIBA, correct?</p>
<p>Don: Yes, indeed. So if you begin to think about what I’m calling this disruption in Open Banking, it requires not only the orchestration of standards for authentication but we have to be mindful of the platform of choice, and of course the platform of choice is the smartphone. The mobile device is the place where increasingly people are doing banking.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes.</p>
<p>Don: So that requires a really careful synchronisation, if you will, with the evolving standards in the mobile platform world, standards developed by GSMA and others in an OpenID Foundation working group called MODRNA.</p>
<p>So orchestrating standards on the platform of choice in the mobile platform with these high authentication– with the FAPI standard is really challenging, both from a technical point of view and the varying interest and often conflicting or overlapping interest of business models. So we’ve been modestly successful in the development of OpenID Connect, of FAPI and on the mobile device and that development is expressed in a new standard, a new profile, if you will, called CIBA. Now hasten to say that good, open standards are beneficial. But a standard is only as good as its adoption.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly.</p>
<p>Don: And its adoption is only as good as its trustworthiness. So how do we trust an organisation, a government, a small fintech that we’ve never interacted with? How do we trust that they’ve implemented the standard correctly? We see in the case of the SAML standards how brittle it has become over its 25 years of use.</p>
<p>So what we want to do is to have a robust standard that is highly trustworthy. So what the OpenID Foundation has done over the last several years is to create, alongside of the new standard, a certification suite. And this is called “self-certification” which is a new concept for many people. Most associate certification with the high cost of auditing, the careful and often time-consuming work that auditors do on a third-party certification and that’s certainly an important option for trust-building.</p>
<p>But the problem is it doesn’t scale. The problem is it takes time. So self-certification is a way of having a low-cost, low-opportunity investment but highly trustworthy way of building trust and it operates like this. In very simply terms, any organisation at any time at no cost can go to the OpenID Foundation website and take the self-certification test for compliance to OpenID Connect, to FAPI, to CIBA.</p>
<p>Many companies and organisations are now doing this. They frankly use it as a way of a QA-QC to make sure that their software code is in fact providing the benefits of the standard and is in conformance with the standard.</p>
<p>But at the time of their choosing, for a very low cost, an organisation can submit a package of information to the OpenID Foundation which demonstrates in very technical terms how their deployment of software or a service is in conformance with the spec, OpenID Connect, CIBA, FAPI, etc.</p>
<p>So they submit their logs and demonstrate in code their conformance. Now what that does is triggers three things. One, you can be sure that when Google self-certified its implementation of OpenID Connect, that its competitors went through that code with a fine-toothed comb. So it triggers a peer review by competitors to make sure that that code from that vendor does what it says it does.</p>
<p>The second thing it triggers is a kind of global outsourcing where any individual at any time can look at the OpenID Foundation site and look at that code.</p>
<p>So we have a crowd-sourced review alongside of the peer review. So from a technical point of view, that gives us great fidelity. It allows us to trust that implementation. But that’s not enough. We ask a third thing of any company that seeks self-certification. We ask them to put the most important asset they have at risk.</p>
<p>We want an officer of that company to make a legal declaration that that code, that that deployment is in fact representative of their company. That puts their brand at risk. So you can imagine that companies are very careful in their self-certification process and the care that they take both from a legal brand point of view as well as a technical point of view produces the result we want, which is that companies that claim conformance can be trusted. They can be trusted because of the peer review, the crowdsourcing and that legal assertion.</p>
<p>What this self-certification does is it builds trust and trust is a thing that is most important in today’s world in general but certainly in identity systems.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, I can see completely – quite impressive these three layers of – for self-certification and so an excellent job that you are doing.</p>
<p>Don: Well, speaking of the jobs that we are doing, one of the early adopters of FAPI and of – and early contributors of this CIBA code base has come from the Nordic community and Ubisecure in particular.</p>
<p>So one of the things that the OpenID Foundation is committed to is, in collaboration with our colleagues at Ubisecure and other Nordic banks and financial institutions, is sometime soon to have a workshop in Finland or Sweden so that we can demonstrate not only how CIBA, FAPI, OpenID Connect work but also how the self-certification mechanism provides the kind of trust that is the basis for trusted transactions at very high volumes, at a very high velocity, with a variety of use cases in mind.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well that will be fabulous.</p>
<p>Don: Well it’s important that we have global adoption. From a standards point of view, we need global contribution for these standards in identity.</p>
<p>Oscar: So how much – also on a global basis as you mentioned – how much is the activity in– especially in these new profiles? You know, FAPI and CIBA. How is right now – are many companies currently doing this, implementing, contributing and doing those sort of self-certification?</p>
<p>Don: That’s a great question and it’s great because it goes to the heart of the burning business problem we share, which is trust. So the contributors, those individuals and those organisations, do so publicly. So one could go right now to the OpenID Foundation website, go to the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI working group</a> and they could see specifically who is contributing to the development of the standard, what organisations are investing in human capital, which is an important thing in the technology world, in the development of these standards.</p>
<p>So it’s fully transparent again at any time, at no cost by anyone to see who’s participating in the working group, what the working groups are working on, the challenges that they have, the fights that they have over different implementations and different points of view.</p>
<p>So the who and the what is publicly available as is the end result, which is the open standard. Also, and importantly, one could right now go to the OpenID Foundation website in the certification section and they can see what organisation self-certified what service or deployment, when they did it and who was the person that assigned that certification on behalf of that organisation.</p>
<p>So that transparency is very intentional because we want it to be a trusted process, both in terms of how the process was developed, how the standard was organised, who contributed and, importantly, who has self-certified their conformance to that standard. So it’s all about trust and the contribution that the OpenID Foundation is making is to build this plumbing, this infrastructure for the global identity ecosystem in a very trusted and transparent way.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. So the answer is going to the OpenID Foundation and seeing the results. So this …</p>
<p>Don: Yes, <a href="https://openid.net/certification/">oidf.net</a>.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent and very early in this interview, you started talking about the efforts here in the Nordics with experience with national IDs that have been already for more than 10 years in most of our countries here and more evolved than other regions in the world. How do you see this evolution similar in other regions in the world? Where do you see that are going to be the next ones?</p>
<p>Don: Well, I think I often associate the experience in Nordics has what I call the courage of the first draft. Which is to say that 10 years ago, the Nordics developed and deployed the first trust framework based on identity standards that allowed, importantly, not only government services to be delivered but that same level of trust that one has with government as the root of trust, it’s now extended to include banks and airlines, etc.</p>
<p>So as companies like yours are expanding to international markets, they bring that experience with them, allowing other organisations and other governments to build on what they Nordics have done and the kind of expertise that exists in companies like Ubisecure and others.</p>
<p>So I think that’s important. I think it’s necessary for us to find a way of having the rightful role of government in these complex transnational identity systems.</p>
<p>Now that’s easier said than done because culturally we have disconnects between the role of the government in these systems. Historically and culturally the US population trusts the private sector and tends to distrust the public sector.</p>
<p>There is just the reverse in the Nordics and the EU. Now that’s all being tested currently. But again it’s this notion of how do we have trusted transactions online when we’re increasingly living our lives and doing our banking, paying our taxes online. And I mentioned online because the experience of identity cards has shown that the true value of a government-issued identity, it goes beyond simply paying your taxes or voting. It goes to how again this economic development can occur when you have a trusted infrastructure that relies on knowing that the person that you’re interacting with is in fact that person and that the organisation you’re interacting with is that person.</p>
<p>It’s what I call the holy trinity of identity, which is to say the identity ecosystem is often bounded by AML, KYC and LEI, anti-money laundering regulations, Know Your Customer regulations and this third and increasingly important legal entity identity. Who is that company? Who owns that company? Where is that company located? Those three things are the real drivers of identity, particularly in the financial services marketplace and importantly for companies that are transacting on an international basis.</p>
<p>Oscar: The trinity of identity.</p>
<p>Don: Well, it’s one lens, not the only one. But it’s a lens that I think is important because those are the guardrails if you will for the enormous disruption that we’re seeing in the identity ecosystem and that can be seen in traditional credit card companies like Visa and MasterCard, announcing very substantial investment and initiatives in identity, as well as traditional credit bureaus and credit reference agencies moving into identity, and companies like Google who have applied and been granted licenses to be payment processors, and of course our friends at Facebook through their Libra program seeking to be not only a payment processor but creating a whole new monetary system through the Libra Blockchain approach. All this disruption is occurring within the context of AML, KYC and LEI.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. Yeah, very well-illustrated as well. I will ask you a final question. It’s for everybody who is listening to this. If you could give us with your experience what are practical ways to protect our own digital identities?</p>
<p>Don: Now we have to talk about passwords. I think of passwords as the cockroaches of our industry. No matter how we try and stomp them and eliminate them, they keep popping up. I hate passwords. I hate passwords because it gives a false sense of security. I hate passwords because if you look at the very substantial and very harmful breaches that have occurred in large companies and small, in governments and banks, more often than not, it’s not that someone has breached the firewall. It’s that someone has gained access to a password in a social account.</p>
<p>Our disruption in the US election occurred because a campaign staffer had his email password stolen and thus that was the breach for the political system and has had cascading effects. To say nothing of the enormous financial damage done in breaches and financial institutions, all because password is the weak link in the chain.</p>
<p>Now increasingly, leading companies like Amazon and others use the password in very minimal ways. They use artificial intelligence, machine learning and other signals from your cell phone to establish that that is in fact you.</p>
<p>But passwords are harmful because for a small company or a medium-sized company that doesn’t have access to AI expertise, doesn’t have a substantial security infrastructure, it’s easy to deploy passwords. So they are the cockroaches of our system. They’re not going away. But they’re becoming less and less important.</p>
<p>Now having said that, as my friend Cameron said in your last podcast, get a password manager. Do the best kind of protection you can by using one of the many products on the marketplace for password management. So I wish I had a silver bullet. I wish I could report great success in securing identity systems. But the fact of the matter is that passwords are increasingly ineffective. The fact of the matter is that the security infrastructure of our identity industry is not improving. The sophistication of the attackers, the lack of joined-up security systems has given us the world that we have today, which is increasingly distrustful and disruptive of banking online, voting online and having a community meeting online.</p>
<p>But that’s why identity is important and that’s why the work that you’re doing in this podcast and that others are doing of sharing the experiences with new and distant audiences is a really important part of the work.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thanks a lot for your words and yes of course important to talk with experts like you. Thanks a lot for this very enlightening interview and tell us how people can find more about you and the organisation that you are leading.</p>
<p>Don: I’m easy to find and I would be happy to answer questions or queries from your audience. It’s <a href="mailto:don@oidf.org">don@oidf.org</a> and I’m happy to talk more with you and others about this very important work of identity and invite others to join in.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Again, thanks a lot Don and all the best.</p>

 [Podcast transcript] 
<p>Let’s talk about digital identity. The podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thanks for joining. Today we will hear about the work of One World Identity and also we will hear the voice of another podcast host in the digital identity industry.</p>
<p>Cameron D’Ambrosi is a Principal at One World Identity, and host of the&nbsp;State of Identity&nbsp;podcast. In his role, Cameron is responsible for supporting One World Identity’s advisory services platform by offering clients key insights into the companies and technologies shaping digital identity today.</p>
<p>Prior to joining One World Identity, Cameron was a Manager with Deloitte, focused on helping financial services clients complete digital transformations of their AML and KYC programs.</p>
<p>A long-time resident of New York City, in his spare time Cameron can be found somewhere in the five boroughs hunting down something delicious, or in his apartment tinkering with gadgets.</p>
<p>Hello Cameron.</p>
<p>Cameron D’Ambrosi: Hey Oscar. Thanks for inviting me. This is great and I’m very excited to be here.</p>
<p>Oscar: Same. It’s very nice talking with you today Cameron and please, the first thing I want to know is how was your journey to this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Cameron: That’s a great question. So I’ve kind of danced around the topic of digital identity for a large part of my career. Even before I was with Deloitte, I actually started my career with the New York Stock Exchange’s regulatory arm, NYSE Regulation, which is now defunct. It’s part of FINRA still I believe but that’s neither here nor there.</p>
<p>But I started off at the New York Stock Exchange in trade surveillance looking at how the specialists at the time were conducting themselves and if they were comporting with New York Stock Exchange rules, specifically around the time stamping and audit trail of orders, which at that point had basically become automated as well. There was a man in the loop but it was largely computer systems making those decisions. And in hindsight, that was kind of my first exposure to digital identity because a lot of what my job entailed was looking at essentially the digital signatures and timing of transactions and those signatures were essentially in many cases the digital identity of the entity conducting those trades.</p>
<p>Now it was a bit more simplified because it’s the Stock Exchange so it’s kind of a closed loop system where you obviously could not be trading on the platform directly unless you were a member of the exchange. So some guide rails there that made it a bit less complex than some of the broader challenges in digital identity.</p>
<p>But I think it’s interesting to think back and realise that I was kind of in digital identity then. But after that, I moved to a Japanese broker dealer here in the city, which is kind of where I got my feet wet with anti-money laundering and Know Your Customer and from there, I moved to Deloitte. And I think that at Deloitte is where I really caught the digital identity bug and really that happened when I started really getting under the hood at some of the major financial institutions of both this country here in the States and the globe and saw that despite, I guess, a consumer reputation for banking being very advanced and very serious, that many of the institutions that you know and love were really quite primitive when it came to the processes in place around how they captured identities, how they verified them, how they stored them and how consumers were able to interact with their bank and with their money in a digital sense.</p>
<p>That really got me hooked. I really realised that this is kind of the way of the future and that I know it’s a cliché but identity being the original sin of the Internet really kind of clicked with me once I entered financial services. And Deloitte is actually where I then hooked up with our founder and CEO Travis Jarae. So when he started this firm, OWI, focused around digital identity. I was one of his first calls to join the firm and I leapt at the opportunity because I had really bought in on Travis’ thesis of digital identity as the next big field.</p>
<p>Oscar: So during which years you were in the Stock Exchange? When was that?</p>
<p>Cameron: So this was 2007 to 2010. I actually joined right before the financial crisis. Quite an interesting time to be at the Stock Exchange. I was there on the floor for the flash crash and a few other kind of big milestone days for financial services history I guess you would say. So it was quite an interesting time.</p>
<p>Oscar: Wow. Yes, I can imagine. So you’re already more than 10 years in, altogether in digital identity.</p>
<p>Cameron: Yes.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. Well, fabulous. Now that you mentioned, you already started talking about that from your job in Deloitte is where everything started, One World Identity. Let’s talk about that. Tell us what is One World Identity.</p>
<p>Cameron: Sure. So we are a market strategy research and events firm with a laser-like focus on the market of digital identity. We really – as an organisation, we’re founded on the thesis first put forward by our founder Travis Jarae that digital identity is the future of the economy and that it is really an area that is lacking collaboration across industries specifically.</p>
<p>You know, the creation myth, if you will, in many ways of our company traces back to Google. Travis was working there at the time, heading up a team, tackling digital identity challenges for Google payments on the Google Wallet products specifically and the team of his was tasked with figuring out how to bring the next billion users on board the Google platform with regards to digital identity in developing markets, such as India.</p>
<p>Once they started digging around the challenges that were in place around identity, they kind of had recognised that one of the major barriers was a complete lack of communication both within organisations like Google and then necessarily outside of organisations like that between organisations.</p>
<p>We’ve come to referring to these breaks in communication as silos, industry silos. So you have financial services and their silo, thinking about financial services identity. You have the healthcare folks in their silo, thinking about healthcare identity. You have the government folks in their silo thinking about government identity. You have the ecommerce payments folks in their silos thinking about their digital identities and they really weren’t coming together to share war stories, use a common vernacular, share standards and technologies and more important, collaborate at a meaningful level on how to break down these silos and really drive the types of digital identity solutions that were going to make a meaningful impact into people’s lives.</p>
<p>So while Travis was at Google, he recognised the possibility for bringing folks together in a conference, focused around identity specifically. That is the conference that became the KNOW Identity Conference, which we still hold today. We started off in 2017 in Washington DC and now we have moved that conference to Las Vegas.</p>
<p>So shameless plug, April 5th through 8th of 2020 at the MGM Grand: KNOW Identity 2020. If you’re listening to this podcast and you care about digital identity, I think you should definitely be there.</p>
<p>But all of that is to say we really strongly believed in fomenting this conversation around digital identity and that this was as much of a people challenge as it was a technology challenge, which I think at the time was a bit of unique perspective. I think folks felt that we could just keep throwing technology at the problem, that it would solve itself and our kind of foundational thesis was that we needed more than technology. We needed a real and meaningful industry collaboration between those industry silos to really crack this nut and solve this challenge.</p>
<p>Oscar: And how would you define the One World Identity vision?</p>
<p>Cameron: That’s a great question. I don’t want to speak for the entire company but I think overall my vision for digital identity is one of low friction, high security and most importantly user control. I think that people in many ways don’t trust consumers as much as they should and I think a lot of the prevailing wisdom around how governments and other folks have treated consumers with regard to digital identity is a bit with “kid gloves”. I don’t know if that expression kind of translates away from American English.</p>
<p>But essentially we’ve been kind of – we’ve been babying users. We’ve not been trusting them to do what’s in their own self-interest. We’ve not been presenting them with meaningful information, meaningful choices and meaningful control over their digital identities. And I think that’s a mistake. I think that by and large, people understand these issues. They’re concerned with these issues and we have been in many ways pooh-poohing their ability to make rational and meaningful choices around their digital identity and I think we can return that control to those users and it’s going to be beneficial for everyone, most specifically the enterprises.</p>
<p>I think you are witnessing this tidal shift in how enterprises think about digital identity and we’re finally seeing an end to the era of so-called “data lakes” where businesses just kind of indiscriminately hoovered up as much data as they could because they felt well, you know, storage is cheap, data is essentially free in many ways and we’re going to just grab as much as we can and hold on to it for as long as we can, regardless of whether we have a good plan for securing it or a good idea of what to do with it and I think enterprises are now recognising that that approach creates more risk than it does value for their enterprise and they’re taking the concept of Privacy by Design a little bit more seriously and they’re taking user-centric identity a little bit more seriously as well and I think that’s in alignment with our vision here at OWI for what we see as the future of digital identity.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, it’s correct what you’re saying that the users now are more – also more aware about the problems that are happening because some – unfortunately some companies have been letting them down because of leaks, because of misuse of the personal information. That’s why, yeah, so customers are more demanding that they have more control of their own digital identity.</p>
<p>Cameron: I think so. I think there’s a number of factors at play. I think you’re definitely writing, calling out data breaches. You know, as we’ve seen for the past few years, it’s almost expected that there’s a new mega scale data breach that occurs either in the US or at a global level. You know, just a few days ago, the entire country of Ecuador had a massive data breach I believe. We’ve seen another few enterprises in the US mishandle millions and millions of records.</p>
<p>I think that trend is going to continue sadly. There’s just too much information floating around and these systems are so complex that even with the best of intentions, with the way our current digital identity systems are designed, there’s just too much opportunity for data to be intercepted, whether that’s in transit or at rest.</p>
<p>So I think you’re going to continue to see this trend continue until more robust action is taken across industries to really secure all this identity data.</p>
<p>And I think to your other point, consumers are getting more savvy. I think as you’re seeing this next generation between I guess millennials and then the ones behind them known as Gen Z or the Zoomers I believe is what they’re being called colloquially. These are digital natives and I think more than anybody else, the Zoomers and the Millennials have seen what it’s like to suffer the consequences of a data breach first-hand and they also have seen what it’s like to really be exposed on the internet completely.</p>
<p>I have cousins for example who are kind of straddling that line between the Millennial and the Zoomer generation and they grew up and spent their entire lives from essentially not infancy but since they were very young kids, having Facebook, having their parents be on Facebook and Instagram, sharing pictures of them since before they could even really consent to having all of their information put online.</p>
<p>I think that experience has really coloured how they view data and cyber security. It’s I guess a bit cliché to talk about this trend. But we don’t really know as people who make products and put them out into the world. You think you have a good idea of how consumers are going to use them. But you don’t really know. And I think a prime example of that with regard to Instagram and digital identity is the concept that a lot of Gen Z essentially maintains two different Instagram presences. They have their so-called real Instagram and their fake Instagram and they have an Instagram account that’s intended to be public-facing, that has their real name attached to it, that’s discoverable and this is the one that’s almost whitewashed or sanitised.</p>
<p>This is you putting forth the version of yourself that you’re comfortable with the public world seeing with your potential college, seeing because that’s you know, checking your social media is part of the applications process now. With your potential employer seeing, with strangers seeing. And then in many cases they also have another Instagram account that just is private and just their friends have access to and that’s the one that is typically what you think of folks using Instagram for, which is more candid things about their life, more personal things.</p>
<p>I think it’s really interesting to see that at a fundamental level, when this product Instagram didn’t give these kids the granular controls that they wanted for controlling how and where their information was being shared, they essentially hacked the system and created their own method for identity management that was privacy-preserving.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. Quite interesting. I haven’t thought of that. Yeah. Could you tell us more in concrete terms the work that One World Identity does with the customers? What kind of job you do and maybe a couple of examples?</p>
<p>Cameron: Sure, that’s a great question. We work with companies across sectors. So as I alluded to before, we’re big believers in breaking down these silos of identity. We work with organisations kind of across these silos who are really looking to either fundamentally rethink how they think about digital identity or engage in new ways with players in the space.</p>
<p>Right now I would say our main areas of focus in terms of clients are around some of the industries that really have already taken digital identity seriously and those industries are regulated financial services or money transmitters.</p>
<p>So folks like banks, folks like digital money platforms, fintechs and then also folks that are – because of the way US regulatory regimes have been put together, many types of sharing economy players are also regulated as money transmitters because of the nature of how they conduct their business and the fact that they may be essentially sending money between state lines digitally. That means they fall under the money transmitter definition put together by FinCEN and therefore are subject to USA Patriot Act Know Your Customer requirements.</p>
<p>So we work with those folks who kind of need to care about digital identity from a regulatory sense. And then the other folks we work with who are sharing economy platforms that might not fall under that designation we work with because they have what we call a trust and safety mandate. So thinking to a company like Uber for example.</p>
<p>If they can’t guarantee your safety when you get into a car, you’re not going to do business with them. If you as a consumer don’t have the trust that your driver is a vetted and safe individual, you’re not going to get into the car of a stranger who you met on the internet because it’s not going to be safe.</p>
<p>So companies like that, that really have a trust and safety mandate, is another industry group that we really have been working closely with. I’m not at liberty to share the names of any of our clients in that space. But we’ve worked with some of the larger names in the sharing economy and the type of work we do, we do traditional kind of project-based consulting work. So current state assessment, risk assessments, vendor assessments for someone like- you want to bring on a new identity verification vendor. We can help you make that decision and we also have what we call our advisory services platform, which is a bit more freeform and for a monthly fee, you get continual access to our team of analysts, the research reports, our research team rights. You get discounts on the events that we throw. So in addition to the KNOW Identity Forum that takes place every year in Las Vegas, we also throw monthly regional executive networking forums in cities around the globe.</p>
<p>I was just out in San Francisco yesterday hosting a forum on the future of digital identity platforms. So that was really, really exciting and we invite our advisory services clients to those events. Then as a member of the Advisory Services Platform, you also have access to ad hoc consulting work.</p>
<p>So if you do want to layer in a vendor assessment or fundamentally rethink some of your processes, your onboarding flows, we can help you do all that as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: So you said regulated industries such as financial-related industries and the sharing economy. So those are some of your biggest sectors who you are working with. For instance in – you mentioned in the financial bigger companies and also the fintechs that are relatively smaller and newer – are there requirements between this one too different in – regarding digital identity?</p>
<p>Cameron: They are not. You know, if you’re looking at the letter and text of the law, the fintechs are kind of bound by exactly the same regulatory requirements as the big giants. But where I think they have an advantage is that in many cases, they are getting to rethink these challenges from the ground up and they can build their digital identity infrastructure from a clean slate without any legacy systems and without any legacy customers. That really frees you up to be a bit more creative with regard to how you think about digital identity, some of the systems and processes that you use and some of the ways in which you can interact with your customers.</p>
<p>Oscar: Right. Yes, that makes a lot of sense. OK. Tell us now about the podcast, State of Identity Podcast. So when did you start it?</p>
<p>Cameron: So that’s a great question. I started that all the way back in 2017, towards the end of 2017. We’ve been going strong for a few years now. We’re on episode – I believe episode 134 just aired this past Thursday and when we started digital identity, that was one of the first things that I launched was the State of Identity Podcast. You know, Travis our CEO came to me and said, “Cameron, everyone keeps asking us about a podcast. We should have a podcast and I think you’re the guy to host it.”</p>
<p>So I said, “That’s great”, learned about podcasting, learned what – you know, all the digital and fun backend stuff that it entailed and got out there into the ecosystem with a microphone in my hand and a notepad full of questions and I think it has been one of the most exciting parts of my career. You know, just the breadth of folks that I’ve had the pleasure of meeting. Everyone from CEOs of companies to revolutionary thinkers like Doc Searls, Tim Ruff, Phil Windley.</p>
<p>I just had Dr. Ann Cavoukian, the creator of Privacy by Design on the podcast. We did a live recording in Toronto at one of our KNOW Identity Forums with her. So it has been really, really fantastic getting to meet all of these – you know, I guess for lack of a better word – heroes of mine when it comes to digital identity. But more importantly for my own career, it has been really, really insightful to just hear the stories of all these folks working on digital identity from all these different sectors, the challenges they’re facing and, you know, what their pain points are and where we still have work to do to kind of bridge these divides.</p>
<p>You know, I think 2019 has been a banner year for digital identity, digital identity standards, digital identity technologies. But we still have a lot of work left to do because I think just from a financial inclusion perspective, there are still far too many people across the globe who lack meaningful digital identities that allow them to enter the world’s financial systems to transact. But beyond that, the amount of data breach is just still too high to your earlier point of the amount of identity data that’s at risk. In my opinion, it’s still too high and I think most importantly, the way that this is going to change people’s lives is just knocking down these barriers to transact.</p>
<p>You know, I really am a big believer that there’s tremendous value to be unlocked in the economy by making it easier for folks to prove who they are in a meaningful way and really initiate a lot of transactions that I think they want to be initiating and in many cases are just giving up on because it’s too hard and too complicated and I think in many cases folks just kind of throw up their hands and they say, “Ah, I was going to do this thing. I was going to sign up for a new account. I was going to buy this thing”, and they can’t do it because of some existing challenges in the space, whether it’s friction, lack of ability to get their identity proofed. And rather than banging their head against the wall, in many cases, I think folks just throw their hands up and give up and find another channel to complete that transaction that might be lesser.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, we definitely – I’ve been personally listening to your podcast since last year already and I really like it. You’re an excellent host on that. So a great achievement on your side and we are just starting. We are not even in the tenth episode of this Let’s Talk About Digital Identity podcast. So we have a lot to learn from you and keep following you.</p>
<p>So for anybody who still hasn’t listened to State of Identity podcast, it’s your time to check it out.</p>
<p>Cameron: Yes, thank you and just to jump on that plug opportunity, you can check us out wherever you download your podcasts. We’re on the iTunes Store, Google Play Store. We’re on the web at <a href="https://www.OneWorldIdentity.com">www.OneWorldIdentity.com</a> and also on Twitter at the @1WorldIdentity.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. Any story you would like to share about your experience with the podcast?</p>
<p>Cameron: That’s a great question. I’m trying to think if anything really stands out in the back of my mind. You know, from a personal perspective, I think one of my favourite episodes, quite frankly, is my episode with Dr. Ann Cavoukian. She was just so, so fantastic and the interview was everything that I hoped it would be.</p>
<p>For those who aren’t familiar, she is the creator of the concept of Privacy by Design and she also I guess was most recently more well-known for her work with Sidewalk Labs. And when she felt that they weren’t necessarily holding up their end of the bargain with how they’re going to protect users’ data on the platform that they were building, she kind of withdrew from the position and kind of publicly took them to task for how they were going to be capturing folks’ data who are using the smart city. I think it’s really, really admirable that she stood up for what she believed in and really put her foot down at personal cost I would say.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. So yeah, I have to listen to that one. I haven’t and I believe this podcast, State of Identity, is one of the big achievements that One World Identity has had so far. Could you tell me other main achievements that the organisation has had?</p>
<p>Oscar: Sure. So I think the biggest achievement we’ve had is really the tremendous growth we’ve seen of the KNOW Identity Conference. We were able to take it from Washington DC to Las Vegas in just three years, which was a tremendous growth curve and from the – starting off the Ronald Reagan building year one, to selling out the Ronald Reagan building year two, to Vegas in year three has been great and really the response we’ve gotten from folks across the industry about what has come out of the conference, whether it’s in terms of product pilots, contributions to open standards, platforms, the growth and acceptance of self-sovereign identity platforms. All of this – you know, I don’t want to take organisational or personal credit for these developments. But I do think the conversation that we have been driving with KNOW Identity has been quite meaningful and impactful with regard to changing the digital identity landscape for the better.</p>
<p>So I hope we can continue to keep that up with the 2020 show and beyond because I alluded to this earlier but, you know, from a personal perspective, I really do believe that digital identity right now has ceased in many ways to be a technology problem and it is – it’s a people problem.</p>
<p>It is getting the stakeholders who need to agree into a room to actually hash out how they’re going to work together because between smartphones that we have, modern cryptography, self-sovereign identity platforms and the underlying open ledger technology that’s powering those, I really do think that there is not a technological hurdle to building user-centric, privacy-preserving and more importantly low friction for the user digital identity platforms that allow folks more sovereignty over their personal data without sacrificing the ability to use that identity in a meaningful way and open the accounts, share their information when it needs to be shared. And most importantly I think from an institutional perspective, driving the costs down associated with identity, so that businesses are not having to spend $50 a check to bring individuals on board in a regulatorily compliant way.</p>
<p>So I think that more than anything else, I think it’s our crowning achievement which is really driving this conversation forward because I do think that conversation and strategic partnerships and business development is how we’re going to solve this challenge. It’s not going to be some magic technological silver bullet.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah, true. It’s more about what we do with the users. Excellent. So we are almost at the end of this conversation. Could you tell us – could you give us a tip for anybody to protect our digital identity?</p>
<p>Cameron: Yes, and I will try not to rant too long here. But I have a pretty good spiel that I’m into because I feel like when I get at a cocktail party and people ask me what I do and I say digital identity, the first thing that comes up typically is all these crazy data breaches. What should I do to protect myself?</p>
<p>So I have a few things that I like to rattle off. You know, first and foremost, get a password manager. You have too many passwords to remember. The password managers are integrated both with Android and iOS so well now and it’s so easy to make sure that you’re using strong and robust passwords across all of your accounts, that I would highly recommend that everybody use one, whether it’s the system password manager that comes with Android or iOS. I’m a big fan of 1Password but Dashlane, OnePass, LastPass, they’re all fantastic products.</p>
<p>So definitely recommend using one of those. If you don’t want to use one of those, at the very least make sure that your email address has a secure password and is not shared across any of your other accounts because as folks are probably familiar, if your email address password gets compromised and then your email gets compromised, everything ties back to that.</p>
<p>So I don’t need to know your bank password if I know your email password because I’m just going to reset the password because I control your email and I will just change it there to something that I know.</p>
<p>Now the second piece of advice that I would give is your cell phone remains a very vulnerable fraud vector depending on how you have your account set up with the telcos. Your listeners very well may be familiar with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey having tweeted out a bunch of violent, offensive things because his Twitter account got taken over. How did they do it? A SIM swap attack. It is tremendously easy to socially engineer access to someone’s cell phone account by convincing the customer service reps to do a SIM swap.</p>
<p>The number one way you can protect against that is by calling your cell phone operator up right now and saying, “Please allow me to set a secondary passcode on my account, one that is not the last four of my Social Security number”. I think everyone at this point should basically assume that their Social Security number can be easily discoverable by bad actors whether for free or for a very nominal amount of money. So that should not be considered to be secure in really any way, shape or form.</p>
<p>So put a secondary passcode on your cell phone account because that’s going to allow you to ensure that it’s much, much harder to get that SIM card swapped out. And I would recommend – you know, this is maybe an advanced technique but every time I call my cell phone company up to do something like make sure a bill payment went through or order an upgrade, I test them.</p>
<p>You know, I attempt to socially engineer my way into my own account by saying, “Hey, will you let me in? I don’t know if I remember the passcode. Can you please just let me in with the last four of the Social? You know, it’s definitely me. You guys know me”. Much to my surprise, the first two times I tried that, after I thought I had had the secondary passcode set up, my cell phone carrier had actually not set that password up as they claimed.</p>
<p>So after they tell you that they’ve set the secondary passcode up, I definitely think it doesn’t hurt to test them on that and try and see if you can get in without that passcode. That’s maybe a bit overkill for the average folks, but I think it’s really the only way to make sure that you’re not vulnerable to SIM swap because sadly, especially around banking, two-factor authentication via an SMS pin code remains one of the main ways that folks’ accounts are secured with multifactor authentication and it remains very, very vulnerable.</p>
<p>So definitely close that loop off. And then third I would say, you know, evaluate your overall cybersecurity posture. Make sure your Wi-Fi network has a passcode on it. Think twice about conducting banking or other sensitive transactions on a public Wi-Fi network because that’s not necessarily as secure as you think it is.</p>
<p>But if you do nothing else, making sure you’re not using shared passwords and taking advantage of password managers and making sure that your cell phone isn’t vulnerable to a SIM swap I think it’s really going to protect you from all but the most targeted of cybersecurity malicious actors.</p>
<p>Oscar: Oh, thanks a lot for the three, especially the second. I think it’s very important to protect your – the account of your own mobile phone subscription. It’s hard to believe that even Jack Dorsey, the creator of Twitter, was hacked. So everything can happen.</p>
<p>Cameron: Yeah. I think again the degree to which it’s easy to socially engineer information out of customer service representatives can’t be underestimated, especially when it’s somebody who has time and resources and folks don’t realise, they don’t necessarily give up. You call back five, ten times until you get somebody who maybe doesn’t care or they can be bribed or the other thing they do is they go to random retail store workers who are like making in some cases minimum wage or not that much money in a city like New York.</p>
<p>They offer them 5, 10, 20 bucks an account to say, “Hey, help me SIM swap these accounts and I will pay you cash”, and folks are vulnerable. Everybody has weaknesses and it’s up to you as a consumer to protect yourself because sadly the cell phone companies have not really put that much effort into securing your account for you. You got to take that responsibility on yourself sadly.</p>
<p>Oscar: Wow. Well, thanks a lot Cameron for sharing all this information about the tips and also the great work that you are doing there at One World Identity. Please let us know how can we find you on the internet.</p>

 [Podcast transcript] 
<p>Let’s talk about digital identity. The podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thanks for joining. Today we will hear about a very important aspect of our digital lives, which is privacy, and for that we have an expert in the topic. So let me introduce you Julian Hayes. He’s an expert in data privacy with more than 20 years of experience, which includes working for telecommunications big players, such as Vodafone and Nokia.</p>
<p>Today he’s the Managing Director of Veneto Privacy Services, a consulting company based in Dublin, Ireland. Hello, Julian.</p>
<p>Julian Hayes: Hello Oscar, thank you for having me.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it’s a pleasure having you and talking with you Julian and yeah, please tell us a bit more what is – has been your journey until today. You have your own consulting company Veneto.</p>
<p>Julian: Great. It’s a pleasure to talk to you and I know that today’s subject on Brexit, GDPR and digital privacy generally should be an interesting discussion and listening material for your subscribers.</p>
<p>So Veneto Privacy is in business now three years. So prior to its establishment, I was a Data Protection Officer for Vodafone in the UK and in Ireland predominantly. So really I guess I was working in data privacy before it became such an issue of concern in terms of how personal information is obtained and processed. So it’s kind of – it grew – from my own kind of professional experience, it grew from about 2004 and then in 2010 it reached off as a major issue.</p>
<p>So data protection laws have been in place for decades, so it’s not that there was any type of new realisation. But there has been an increased focus I think from 2010 on data privacy and the importance of respecting personal information from a customer perspective.</p>
<p>So yeah, so we’re based in Dublin and we service companies in Europe and the US and we work basically a 24/7 type of operation, working in multiple time zones. Still a small consultancy business and we’re very much specialised in commerce-related personal data processing and GDPR obligations. As we’ve seen, there are many regions within the world that are implementing similar types of data protection law in the style of GDPR which is seen as kind of the best in practice operation.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, very interesting. You have a 24/7 operation it sounds like. Pretty challenging. And tell us a bit the experience you have today with working in Veneto, your own company. What are the main challenges customers you have today have?</p>
<p>Julian: With the anticipation of the 25th of May 2018, there was a huge focus from companies to get compliant with GDPR and I remember often there were customers who would say, “Well, you know, is it just another Y2K? Is it just another type of hype situation?”</p>
<p>But the difference between Y2K and GDPR is that GDPR is actually law – and Y2K was a theory in the world. So I think that’s the major kind of challenge is, you know, preparations for establishing the basics of good e-processing operations, whether you’re a data controller or a data processor.</p>
<p>So that’s really important to be able to nail that down and we spent a lot of time actually clearing up a lot of bad advice. So there were a lot of newcomers to the market from a consultancy perspective that maybe didn’t have the kind of experience or skills to be able to really effectively operate in a concise way to be able to deliver on proper advice for companies as to what the basic steps were to implement the necessary changes to meet the regulation.</p>
<p>So yeah, so I think there was a lot of kind of handholding and reassurance especially when it comes to the establishment of your risk strategy. So if you’re a pharmaceutical business processing medical data or pension business, processing more sensitive data, then the risks are probably different to you than they would for – say if you’re a retainer with CCTV or other kind of not-so-invasive data processing operations.</p>
<p>So there’s kind of a recalibration exercise that you need to go through with customers to say these are the risks you face. Sure, you know, the fines are very punitive and eye-wateringly high. But at the same time, you need to be able to realise what the best necessary steps are for you to kind of meet those basic requirements from a compliance perspective.</p>
<p>Oscar: And have you worked with customers who already got fines or it’s too early for that?</p>
<p>Julian: Well, I’ve worked professionally. So I’ve obviously been working as a data privacy professional internally in organisations and sure, you’re faced with fines. But I think predominantly the biggest risk from a GDPR perspective is the pending investigation or interference from a regulator into your data processing activities which they’re fully entitled to do and people often talk about the two and four percent of your turnover as being the big kind of scare factors in terms of what could go wrong.</p>
<p>But at the same time, if you think about it, there are other powers under data protection law in terms of cease processing order, which basically is a bar on data processing if a regulator thinks that the processing is illegal. So there’s a major case ongoing in Ireland at the moment in relation to the public services card. So that will be similar to the Kela type of operation in Finland.</p>
<p>So there was basically an introduction of an identification card but the Data Protection Commission found that there was no real legal basis on the nature of the data processing and there was in fact kind of scope creep across what the card could be used for from its initial conception.</p>
<p>So they’re the kind of challenges that are faced but I think businesses, big and small, need to take reasonable measures. In Veneto, we’re kind of in the solutions mode. So we have statutory obligations where we provide data protection or services for businesses, which we must meet. But at the same time, if you’re providing then advice to other businesses, you’d need to give real practical solutions as to what basic measures are needed.</p>
<p>I think that’s one of the challenges of GDPR, that it’s not necessarily specified. It talks about security measures, organisational and technical measures. But it doesn’t tell you what kind of grade of security organisational measures are required. So again, there’s a degree of kind of determination from a controller or a processor as to what would be adequate to be able to meet that requirement of GDPR.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, something that I want to ask you because you are very into privacy. You know very well this topic. Something I heard and I read a few times is that people say that privacy is dead. Particularly it makes me cringe. What is your take on this?</p>
<p>Julian: Yeah. So it’s the old “I have nothing to hide” here. I think it’s all the more clear that people don’t necessarily – they might be happy to be signed up for social media services and understand that there’s a degree of sharing between their personal information and the free service. I think that’s OK but you might have nothing to hide but you have everything to lose.</p>
<p>So like if we saw just the other day, so Jack Dorsey in Twitter, he got his Twitter account hacked and that was via his phone number. So everything is fine and hunky-dory as long as nothing is going wrong. But as soon as something happens, then people go, “Well, that’s my private information. That shouldn’t be requested of me and it should be kept safe”.</p>
<p>Even just today, I saw another Facebook incident. One of a multitude where the telephone numbers are freely available on the server that could be accessed via the web. So these are really kind of terrifying scenarios and I’ve worked in data breaches where it might be some information is compromised but it leads to – you might think it’s kind of not too important if your Twitter password is compromised. But there’s a lead-in then and it’s a bridge to other information that can be gleaned from that account, which will then lead to a subsequent major data breach. So it might be a banking fraud. It might be downloading of your passport to make it an illegal passport copy of your information.</p>
<p>So there are serious consequences. So people kind of see privacy as – you know, well, it’s one matter. But privacy and security go hand in hand and they’re self-supporting with each other. So they reinforce each other and I think that if you look at ‘privacy by design’, even just when you’re designing products, is the server secure? Is it safe? So there’s a marriage between privacy and security, which is really important.</p>
<p>Just because data is kept secure, it doesn’t mean that the processing is legal. So if a school asks for a child’s blood type in addition to their registration details for the school year, that data might be stored securely in a military grade type of environment, but its processing in itself may be illegal. So there are serious implications for that.</p>
<p>I think that’s why identity management, especially now in the era of phishing and SIM swap frauds and other type of exploits involving personally identifiable data are really key to managing the customer experiences from a security perspective and that assurance that there is proper validation and verification as to who the user is regardless of the services that they’re using.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. So digital identity and privacy also go hand in hand.</p>
<p>Julian: I think GDPR is probably 40 percent security and 60 percent privacy. So I think if I’m offering any services that are offered throughout the European Union, there needs to be a degree of validation that I can identify myself as a user.</p>
<p>So I’m sure you’ve kind of had it before. So what do you know? I’ve travelled quite a lot for work. I see the kind of grade of customer validation within Germany and Hungary and other countries around there is probably at a higher standard than it would be in some of the more poor nations. Like that enables fraud and it enables customer exploit information to be had.</p>
<p>The problem is, right, so these guys, this is their job. Like they’re pros. If you’re a hacker or an information exploiter, they treat it as a fulltime job and it pays well. So you’re not necessarily dealing with opportunistic types of individuals. They are dedicated professionals who know how to scam and that’s really important.</p>
<p>So I think identity management enables a single type of authentication that this is the user that I’m dealing with. I think it actually goes hand in hand with like some of the ecommerce-driven benefits of GDPR. So as I said, I’m in Germany quite a lot at the moment traveling and the data portability requirement of GDPR to be able to transfer your data from one provider to another.</p>
<p>So you might be moving from bank A to bank B and you can simply download your data and then provide that to the new banks. So you’re not actually providing new information. There’s a transit of information between the two data controllers, which enables your identification and your account creation. So that’s really kind of a beneficial thing as well. It’s an ecommerce-driven requirement of GDPR but it’s also like highly beneficial for customers.</p>
<p>Oscar: You’ve been already discussing several aspects of GDPR and what are the challenges and what are the advantages of that already in practice. GDPR is this general data protection regulation that it’s for the European Union. It affects the European Union and you are based in Ireland and we’ve been talking about contrasting continental Europe. But in the middle is the United Kingdom that’s still in the European Union.</p>
<p>But we have this new phenomenon that we don’t know what’s going to happen but it’s called Brexit. How has all this landscape of privacy been affected by Brexit?</p>
<p>Julian: Yeah, it’s especially an important issue for Ireland. So, you know, having – I’ve worked in the UK and obviously lived at the UK. So very sorry to see our neighbours on the trajectory that they’re on. At the same time, I think it’s kind of ironic. You know, I think that probably one of the best, if not the best supervisory authorities in the EU is the ICO, the Information Commission based in the UK, who are extremely diligent in enforcement and also in consultation with data controllers and data processers as to what their obligations are and like this is dating back I think probably 15, 20 years. This is all prior to GDPR. So I think it’s sorry to see one of our leading European regulators not being a member of the EU any further potentially if and when – or when and if Brexit happens. So that’s a real sad story.</p>
<p>But I think for – front of mind for UK businesses, they’re obviously concerned that essentially UK is going to become a third party country. So a third party country means that you’re not on the list of obviously being a European member. So you’re kind of starting from scratch from – in the context of how adequate your controls are. So that’s a real challenge. Whether you’re a controller or a processor based in the UK, you’re not meeting the same kind of standard or you will need to prove that you will meet the same sort of standard either via an adequacy decision from the European Commission which is difficult to come by and takes many years of negotiation often.</p>
<p>So Japan is the latest country to be recognised but that took years of negotiation that they would meet the same kind of standards. Farther than the Privacy Shield, so it has its challenges in itself in terms of its effectiveness but it is something that was negotiated between the United States and the European Commission of Switzerland to say that these US businesses will meet European standard type of data privacy regime and now the UK is no longer a member of those new member states potentially in the coming months.</p>
<p>So it won’t be able to benefit from having – if there is data processing and transfers happening to the US, then it won’t be able to hold that] as a party of the EU to say that it’s a Privacy Shield member. So that’s the key issues.</p>
<p>So there’s probably a flurry of contract lawyers who are rolling out new controls. So there are solutions in place. So whether it’s standard contractual clauses and to be deployed into data processing agreements or binding corporate rules which would be legally binding and then would at least afford some protection.</p>
<p>So you will find that many EU controllers already established these types of agreements with – you know, if they’re trading in China or in Russia or somewhere else. That they would implement these types of contractual controls to be able to meet GDPR requirements for processing in that region.</p>
<p>Oscar: So for businesses that are let’s say in the European Union, in the case that the United Kingdom leaves the European Union, the businesses that do business with the UK, how they will be affected in this case. Just European Union and the UK in the case that they’re out.</p>
<p>Julian: So if controllers – if you’re a business that has let’s say outsourced business processing operations that are supported from the UK and you don’t have the proper contractual controls in place, then basically that processing would become illegal under GDPR. So it’s also important to remember the ICO and the UK government have been steadfast in saying that it will implement GDPR style controls in any case whether they’re in the European Union or not.</p>
<p>The Data Protection Act 2018 is already in place and protects the rights of UK individuals in terms of how their data is processed. So that’s really key. So I think there’s so much kind of cloud movement I guess predominantly, AWS, Amazon and Microsoft pretty much have the cloud business sewn up. So a lot of it is kind of EU, US-based data processing in any case.</p>
<p>But I think from a UK business perspective, if you’re a processor that is based in the UK that is providing services for an EU company, then you need to be able to make sure that the controller has the appropriate contractual clauses in place with you and like it’s kind of a mutual responsibility.</p>
<p>So the controller is in charge of how the data is processed but the processor is still – needs to be able to make sure that they inform the controller that there are adequate protections in place.</p>
<p>So I think that’s really important. So any processing that’s happening in the UK, whether you’re a controller or processor, if you’re offering services in the EU, then you must meet the EU obligations in terms of GDPR.</p>
<p>Again so if you’re looking at big UK-based businesses, so let’s take for example – if you’re a bank, HSBC for example offering services in the EU, you’re a UK-based controller and you will have EU customers across your base. You will need to have a Data Protection Officer and appointed representative for those operations in addition to your UK registration. So that’s really, really, really key.</p>
<p>Oscar: Sounds a bit complicated, yes. Well, let’s move now to the opportunities. What are the opportunities that organisations have today by taking privacy and digital identity seriously?</p>
<p>Julian: Yeah, that’s a good question. So I recently worked on projects outside the EU. Where it is often the case, there’s no data protection law at all. So there’s no kind of a floor in terms of compliance that needs to be dealt with, right?</p>
<p>So what kind of protections and measures need to be implemented if you have no legal obligation to do so? If you think about it from a business processing perspective, right, so it’s a bit like the cease processing order where you’re told to stop processing.</p>
<p>So if you have a service which suffers a major outage from a security- so say you lose it, you lose your entire CRM database, your customer relationship management database, and you can’t market anymore and you can’t build customers. That has much probably larger implications than any type of potential fine.</p>
<p>So if you look at it through the lens of business integrity and resilience in terms of being able to provide services, that’s probably more of a concern than any compliance cycle.</p>
<p>So – and then it’s win-win. So if you’ve got good, secure and data minimisation strategy, then if there is an outage or if there is an issue, at least you know, it has been contained within – the best it can be. So again like security and privacy go hand in hand and sometimes the stick is not always the law. The stick is actually – well, you know, we need to be able to maintain and keep these services operational or else we don’t have a business.</p>
<p>So privacy can just be a spin-off from that. Privacy and security can be a spin-off from that. So I think that’s the major upshot because if you’re a company even heavily dependent on an investment or on some type of funding and you have a major accident. So if you look at British Airways, public knowledge, major issue with their website which was outsourced to a development agency which then brought along the challenges and problems from the information compromise of its customers, one of whom- I was affected.</p>
<p>So that in itself, regardless of any kind of GDPR or other type of data protection regime, the maintenance, security and resilience of the service is kind of key to kind of building customer trust, maintaining your shareholder value, maintaining your integrity as a responsible business when it comes to security and privacy.</p>
<p>Oscar: So the fact that you have to take care of the key business. You mentioned one CRM, customer relationship database in one company and in the second case, you mentioned that the user data was compromised in this case, which is the key business beyond the GDPR fine, etc. So that’s already an incentive for companies to take privacy very seriously.</p>
<p>Julian: Absolutely. If you think of like British Airways, so they’re a multichannel business. So you can – British Airways, they’re not the only airline that obviously suffers from challenges. But they offer services via an app, via a website, via broker agencies, via codeshare agreements with other airlines so they’re multifaceted in terms of their channel and their vector opportunity of attack from a malicious standpoint.</p>
<p>But if you’re say an app provider, so you provide the latest app which is popular. You’ve got the best security, you’ve got the best privacy notice. You’ve got data minimisation. You’ve got the whole thing locked down. You’ve got paying users. Things are looking good.</p>
<p>But then you – as part of your cost strategy, you decide to outsource the app development to a third party development agency in some in the far corner of the world.</p>
<p>You don’t have a data protection agreement with them and they implement a change in the app. So while it might be secure, perhaps they change one of the permissions linked to access camera or GPS information on the device and that’s not reflective of the privacy notice. That’s a privacy failure.</p>
<p>So dealing with it – one customer recently, I said, look, if I was a European-based regulator, I could operate and conduct my investigation from my desktop and I could get a slam dunk fine in terms of an infringement of GDPR without even having to do an investigation or go and visit the premises to do a raid or anything like that.</p>
<p>So especially having the front face of your services, they need to be crystal clear in terms of privacy and security and then you need to maintain your supply chain to make sure that they are providing quality services for you in terms of your expectations of them as a controller and what they deliver as a processor.</p>
<p>So that’s – I think app development is a key feature of that from a risk perspective that when things go wrong and you’re not really in charge of the controls or you’re not doing your privacy and security assurance of the controls from that app developer or that CRM database administrator, then it can land you on the hook for an infringement of privacy regulation.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, agree. That’s another great example. Julian, now we’re towards the end of this conversation with you, could you leave us with a practical tip, some actionable advice that we – anybody can use – not only experts in privacy and identity. Anybody can use to protect their privacy.</p>
<p>Julian: Sure. Like I think from a user perspective, I think I’ve got two points. Like basically from a user perspective, always be careful of what you share. You know, good password management is really key. There’s a lot of data breaches that happen because of poor user password management.</p>
<p>So you might be compromised from one app or one service but you’ve used that password on another service. So – and they will have a go. So they will shop around. They go, “I will try Microsoft or I will try Facebook or I will try Google and see if that’s the same password.”</p>
<p>The other one – I think your primary email. So like I use – obviously mail clients as well. But if I have access to your primary email, it’s the gateway to all your services, right?</p>
<p>So – and this goes back to the identity management piece that if I’m in your Gmail, then I can reset your password for any of the other services that I can search for. I think that’s really, really key.</p>
<p>Then from a controller perspective, so as a business, I think being able to build and record a proper data management register as to what data do we process? Where do we process it? Is there a duplication? Is it costing us extra money to store it further? What savings can we make? That’s kind of the number one. It’s a key requirement to GDPR from personally identifiable data. But it’s also kind of a good insight into your business operations and reduction in duplication or wasted effort in data processing. So I think that’s – again privacy might be the compliance floor. The actual initiative in itself will have beneficial spin-offs in terms of getting a greater understanding of your business.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Thanks a lot Julian for this very insightful conversation about privacy. Please let us know how we can find you on the internet. What are the best ways to get in touch with you?</p>
<p>Julian: Our website is Veneto Privacy Services. So you can Google it, it will come up straight away. And my email address is julian@venetoprivacy.ie.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, excellent. Well, thanks a lot Julian and all the best.</p>

<p>Let’s talk about digital identity. The podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thank you for joining. Today we will talk about Canada, Canada’s strategic collaboration for securing identity and build economic good growth. And for that, we have a very special guest who is Joni Brennan.</p>
<p>Joni Brennan is President of the Digital ID &amp; Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC).

<p>Hello Joni.</p>
<p>Joni Brennan: Hello Oscar. Thank you for having me today.</p>
<p>Oscar: It is great talking with you Joni. Yes, I’m really excited to hear more about what you are doing in DIACC. So let’s talk about digital identity. And I read a bit about yourself and it’s truly impressive, what you have been doing and you are doing now. But I would like to hear more how everything started, how you joined this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Joni: Well, thank you so much for having me in the podcast, Oscar. It’s really – it’s an honour to be part of this series so thank you. And about kind of how I began in the identity space and the industry, it was really when I was in university. My university was in – at Rutgers in New Jersey in the US and the university was located directly next door to the IEEE. So the engineering society.</p>
<p>This was quite fortuitous and so it was part of our learning in university. We learned a lot about standards and what standards mean and how important they are for the world that we live in. Kind of the invisible work that helps to make the technology work together and helps us to have a better and safer experience. So we learned a lot about standards and from there, I started to have an internship at the IEEE and particularly inside of the IEEE, there was an organisation that was focused on software and technology standards that had to move faster than the hardware standards had moved in the past. So as we know, software moves much faster than hardware. So there was an entire organisation that was focused on this particular kind of faster-moving standards.</p>
<p>In that group, there was one organisation that was called the “Liberty Alliance”. I was working for a number of organisations but particularly the Liberty Alliance caught my attention because it was focused on standards for identity. And in the world of standards, of course there’s a lot of technology and math and engineering and one thing that’s all very different about standards that had to do with identity was that the human element was very visible.</p>
<p>So you could see right away how these particular standards, while they have all of the qualities from an academic and from an engineering perspective of other standards, they’re also slightly different in that they are attaching to a concept of what we’ll call identity which is very human and very personal.</p>
<p>So that work specifically with the organisation, with the Liberty Alliance, I found it to be very interesting. So I spent more and more time supporting that organisation and then from there was kind of fully embedded into the identity standards world where much of the early work to develop SAML was happening and really kind of a formative space around identity federation. Kind of the first views on identity federation and how that landscape may shape out.</p>
<p>So that’s – it was really a journey, a focus on standards, and then that led me into the identity space and the identity space has been so intriguing and so challenging. However has so much opportunity that it’s a space that I have stayed in from that point forward. So I stayed with Liberty Alliance and then with Kantara Initiative and now we’re focusing specifically here on the Canadian ecosystem and then kind of the Canadian solutions and how they intersect with the culture and the practices and the governance of what we see here in Canada.</p>
<p>So my career has primarily – actually my entire career has been in standards development with not for profit organisations and for me that has been a wonderful experience and has enabled me to have the opportunity to work with different orders of governments, different governments from different countries, as well as different sectors within industry, whether that is the technology sector, strategy and services providers, risk management, information technology, telecommunications, financial sector.</p>
<p>So I’ve really been blessed in the sense that by working in the standards, you’re really working in the middle or at the front of the action in terms of innovation.</p>
<p>So I’ve been very lucky to be able to work with so many different kinds of companies and organisations who may have different priorities. However, they all share typically some common goals in terms of wanting to move a better way to solve identity challenges and take advantage of opportunities with security and privacy and good usability for all. So that has been great.</p>
<p>Oscar: So you started when you were a student at university. So it’s quite an early entry into this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Joni: Uh-huh, yes.</p>
<p>Oscar: So you studied electronic engineering I guess.</p>
<p>Joni: I studied information technology and informatics. And so my study was specifically at a time – it was the first time that that study was offered at a university. Prior to that – that particular study had to be specifically at a technical school and also it was a field of study that was created very specifically to have people who could connect the language and the experience of engineers to the language and the experience of sales or marketing or – so really there was a need in the workforce for people who could kind of speak both sides of the equation. They could speak from an engineering perspective but also from a policy and marketing perspective as well.</p>
<p>So kind of a connector with a little bit of study in each of those fields, so that I’m able to have basic understanding of what’s happening in each of those fields and then enable the different parties from those fields to connect and better communicate with each other and work together.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, very interesting and as you said, you started studying in the United States and then at some point, you were working with many organisations there and then you moved to Canada and now you’re in Canada leading DIACC.</p>
<p>If you could tell me what are the main challenges in digital identity you see and let’s try to focus a bit from a Canadian point of view, what would you say?</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah, yeah, definitely. I think that some of the main challenges that we see here in Canada regarding digital identity, I think there is actually a lot of commonality with some of the challenges that we see also in other places in the world.</p>
<p>So what we see here in Canada for example, the legal root of your identity, you have 14 possibilities inside of Canada. So the legal root for your identity comes from the provinces, the province that you were born in or it can come from the federal government if you’re an immigrant.</p>
<p>So there are 13 provinces and territories and then one federal government. So we have 14 different possibilities of where your identity can originate from in Canada. So if you think about it that way, we’re kind of like a – maybe a mini European Union. Maybe not quite the range of established cultures but it is a small federation and the governance of Canada is formed through what we call confederation. So basically Canada exists as a country because these 13 provinces and territories agreed to cooperate with each other. So it’s a federation and an identity is established through this federation.</p>
<p>And so for example, it is the responsibility of the provinces to report to the federal government that you exist, that you’ve been born. So inside of our government, our different governments of – you know, in that case for example, the federal government is actually a relying party, your relying party to the provinces and again if you’re an immigrant, that is your origination in the federal government.</p>
<p>So we have that. That’s kind of the groundwork here in Canada and so we have some of the same, I think, challenges as other places may as well and I think primarily, the area of challenge that we focus on as well as the opportunity is how do we identify what are the best capabilities in terms of identity of the public sector. And how do we identify what are the best capabilities of the private sector. And how do we help the public sector and the private sector to speak to each other, to understand their priorities, to work together, to actually solve identity through the eyes of a federation, through the eyes of a village.</p>
<p>How do we enable those different partners to work together? So I think that that challenge is something that’s kind of common around the world that I hear. You know, that’s a common challenge everywhere. And in terms of other challenges, we also have challenges in terms of bringing more of the consumers of identity, the beneficiaries of identity.</p>
<p>So what I mean by that are bringing more of those types of voices into the development. So what I mean by that is typically it’s very challenging to get diversity of relying parties participating or sharing their views, those who would consume identity, those who would benefit from it.</p>
<p>They’re not necessarily the same organisations that necessarily should be sitting at the table to decide how the interoperability works. But they are the ones at the end of the day who should be benefitting from the work that we’re doing.</p>
<p>So it’s also a challenge to get those voices into the room and so that’s something that we’re working on as well. I think that common challenges as well are around also liability models and also funding in business models.</p>
<p>So for example, some of these technologies that – and some of the models that are coming forward have the potential to be very disruptive. So understanding what business models will look like as the ecosystem moves forward, what kinds of jobs can and will be created and what is the right entry point for different types of organisations. So those types of understandings I think kind of what – where disruption may lead and how we can be prepared for that and take advantage of that disruption.</p>
<p>So I think those are challenges that we see here in Canada. We have some benefits. We are – while we’re the second largest land mass country, the population is quite reasonable, so roughly 38 million people. A large percent of those 38 million people are within – are very close to the US border. So most of the people are kind of in certain regions, meaning that we also have to make sure that the solutions that we have can actually get out to the very far, remote areas too. They should be beneficiaries. But that said, we do have a – kind of a reasonable number of people that we’re working with and a reasonable number of organisations. Remember, you know, 14 different roots. That’s a reasonable number to work with.</p>
<p>So we still have work to do continually to ensure that we’re connecting across those different 14 roots of identity as well as across the different private sector industries here within Canada.</p>
<p>So I think that those challenges are Canadian. I think that they’re also universal. I think maybe something that we see here in Canada and I don’t know if this is something we see in other countries, but sometimes we see people who are kind of looking outward to see if someone else may have the answer to solving identity.</p>
<p>So there’s a lot of kind of outward-looking in terms of what’s happening and so one thing I like to remind people as well is that we all learn when we look outward. So that’s an important piece of the – of how we move forward.</p>
<p>This said, we have many great opportunities here in Canada that are being developed and are being worked on. So we sometimes remind people it’s important to look out and learn what’s happening around the world. It’s also to focus inward as well and we can do both of those things at the same time and remember what pieces we have and how we can work better together.</p>
<p>So I think those are some – just some challenges. Maybe some unique but I think in fact have quite a bit of commonality with identity initiatives around the world as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, sure. Some of these challenges you mentioned are elsewhere and yeah, the one that caught my attention was the – yeah, it’s the second biggest country in the world. It’s a really big country. It’s split in 13 regions you said and plus there’s the federal government. That’s of course very, very challenging, very interesting how – I would like to hear more how you are solving these challenges and that – one question is that DIACC is independent from these 13 regions or federal government or it’s part of the federal government or is independent?</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah, very good question. So a little bit about the DIACC. When the global financial crash happened, 2008, 2009, there was a – inside of Canada, the Minister of Finance called for a review of Canada’s payment system to make sure that the payment system was robust and secure and could withstand ideally the type of crash that was happening in 2008, 2009.</p>
<p>They created what was called an Electronic Payments Task Force. This task force had members of it from the public sector and from the private sector. The task force made a number of recommendations and one of those recommendations a number of years later, one of those recommendations was that Canada needed a digital identity and authentication framework as part of an underpinning for our payment network.</p>
<p>Now of course we need a digital identification and authentication scheme for almost every industry and every sector, whether you’re looking at healthcare, government or payments or otherwise. So this was a very important finding and that finding was really the seed for the creation of DIACC.</p>
<p>One of the other recommendations in this report was that Canada needed a self-governing body to develop that framework and to bring the public sector and the private sector together to develop that framework.</p>
<p>So that recommendation led to the formation of the DIACC. So the DIACC is an independent not for profit organisation. It has the benefit of members who are from the federal government, who are from provincial governments as well as different industries across Canada as well as entities, businesses and organisations who are not Canadian.</p>
<p>So we are I would say not – we are not – we are independent from government and we are representative of the intersection between the government needs and the private sector needs, the government capabilities and the private sector capabilities.</p>
<p>So we represent both the public and the private sector as an independent not for profit association.</p>
<p>Oscar: And so DIACC also does – for instance with specification standards right?</p>
<p>Joni: Correct. So we are developing what we are calling the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework and this is – the trust framework is actually a collection of industry standards and best practices. Largely this collection of industry standards and best practices is what I would call – it is a framework and it is specifying certain processes and certain practices in the context of technology specification. Largely this framework points out to existing technology specifications.</p>
<p>So for example the framework could point to FIDO or it could point to OpenID Connect. So we are not at this time developing a technical specification. Rather we’re developing a framework that helps to define how to put the pieces together, which kinds of technologies are better for which types of risk profiles and gives that kind of guidance, so yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: So for instance, you gave this example that Pan-Canadian Trust Framework – so this framework is – when you have it ready is – the fact that DIACC is independent means that the federal government is going to adopt it or how is that?</p>
<p>Joni: So we have a phrase that we use inside of DIACC and that phrase is that we are a “willing coalition” and so what that means is that those who find the value in the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework will be those that adopt the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework. So there is no forcing factor to say one must adopt the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework.</p>
<p>Rather those entities that are invested in interoperability and believe that the public and the private sector should be interoperable together, it’s a willing coalition of adopters.</p>
<p>So the framework is authoritative of those who will adopt it. Now the sad part of the reason for having members that are a diversity of membership from the public and the private sector is that by having their insights and their requirements and their guidance and their views, our vision is that they will adopt this framework, whether they are in the government or whether they are in the private sector.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. And what else about DIACC? What is right now the vision of DIACC if you see not only the present, what you’re doing now, but what comes in the future for Canada?</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah. So the vision of DIACC and if you will – and, you know, from the last question. In the last question, we talked a little bit about how did DIACC begin and we talked about the beginnings where – around reviewing the payment system and in the context of the global financial crash.</p>
<p>So DIACC, because it comes from this origin, this history, our vision is actually an economic vision. Our vision is for economic opportunity, economic growth and so we are an economic growth, economic opportunity vision organisation that believes that the way that we will grow the economy is through interoperability of identity solutions and services.</p>
<p>So I think that makes DIACC a little bit unique. Perhaps others are starting to adopt that same kind of economic approach, which we applaud. Also to give an idea here, you know, our formation, we’re approximately five years old now.</p>
<p>In the last year in January, there was a McKinsey and Company study that – in January of this year – that identified approximately three to six percent growth of GDP that could be realised by addressing the identity challenges and opportunities.</p>
<p>So in Canadian terms, three to six percent growth of GDP looks like between $57 billion and $114 billion that can come back into the Canadian economy.</p>
<p>So our vision is to bring those funds back to the Canadian economy, create jobs, create opportunities and enable small businesses, whether they’re in the large urban city centres or the more quiet rural landscapes of Canada to be able to take advantage of the global digital economy and evolve the opportunities within.</p>
<p>So what we see coming forward in our vision, we will continue to develop and deliver the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework. We do so with many public reviews that people from all around the world are encouraged to participate in.</p>
<p>And so we want to ensure that we have global interoperability as well. Our vision is to deliver the framework. Our vision is to instantiate a scalable certification program that is tailored to meet the needs of the market and provide value to the market, and our vision is to continue to educate and help to build the workforce that Canada needs to fulfil, needs with regard to an identity professional’s – the demand for identity professionals and so we see also creating that path from the student in the classroom to the next job. That’s in our vision as far as our next – from now until our five-year goals, our five-year plan.</p>
<p>Oscar: Sure, sounds good. And as you said is – is it’s unique is the way that DIACC has this vision focused on economic growth and I believe it’s a good incentive for both businesses and like regional governments because everybody wants growth.</p>
<p>Joni: That’s right, that’s right. The economic focus I say sometimes it’s the North Star. The economic focus is the thing that is important for everyone whether you’re in the public sector or the private sector. And what we want to make sure is that that growth and opportunity can get to every Canadian and so we think that would make the impact that will grow the economy by that three to six percent from that McKinsey and Co. study.</p>
<p>Oscar: Can you now tell us a bit of the main achievements so far you mentioned already? You know, the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework. Can you mention some other projects, some achievements?</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah. So in terms of achievements, I mean I will be a bit humble. But I would say – I would like to say that the fact that we have a digital identity forum in Canada where the public and the private sector come together, the fact that we have a DIACC, I think that that’s a – that’s one achievement. So I think we benefit from that achievement from the – and then in terms of other achievements, moving the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework forward. We’ve been publishing and releasing drafts out for the world to comment on for the last year.</p>
<p>We have in our roadmap to continue to release more drafts through December and then we will continue to release and iterate those drafts through June of 2020. So in our vision, we should have our full stack available, our full framework available in a well-vetted form by June of 2020.</p>
<p>In terms of the ecosystem in Canada and some of the work that the collaborative of DIACC has done has helped to support or has been built upon, I think a big achievement here in Canada that actually predates DIACC would be the British Columbia Service Card. This is actually a smart card that enables a British Columbian to – it’s a provincial identity that enables a British Columbian to have one card where they keep both their driving credential as well as their healthcare credential into one card. Those credentials are cryptographically separated.</p>
<p>I think the achievement there with the BC Service Card, the card itself is exciting. But actually it’s the policy work and the linkages inside of government that were done behind the scenes that are very exciting, that position British Columbia to be ready to issue a claim or a credential that does not have to be a card. It could be in the phone or a network.</p>
<p>So that’s an achievement. I would say there was an initial proof of concept within DIACC to focus on – to understand if blockchain technology could provide a more efficient path forward for corporate registries. So one of the things in our view in DIACC, we’re looking at the verification of people but also of the verification of organisations, entities, corporations.</p>
<p>So the proof of concept that we worked with British Columbia and IBM at the time in the DIACC has actually led to the instantiation of a service called the “Org Book” which is the British Columbia’s version of their corporate registry that they’re doing in the – with the blockchain approach. So that – I think that’s an exciting piece of the puzzle for the corporate side of the work.</p>
<p>Another achievement here in Canada that has been, I would say, supported by the collaboration, however it’s not a DIACC-specific achievement though, I would say it’s the Verified.Me network. So part of – which is comprised of many of our DIACC members and their own consortia. So Verified.Me is a network that also uses Hyperledger Fabric and has the participation of the major banks and is working to grow out with some participation as well from insurance providers and ideally moving forward to potentially public sector credentials as well.</p>
<p>So this is a network for identity that is a built-in Canada solution that focuses on kind of the Canadian ecosystem, I would say, but has application outside of the Canadian ecosystem for interoperability around the world.</p>
<p>So some of those achievements are purely DIACC achievements while others are achievements of our members that I think are inspirational and something that we can look toward and conceptually again because the players who are moving these achievements forward are contributing into the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework, the vision is that the framework will build and the value and those systems and those solutions will be the initial adopters of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework.</p>
<p>So there’s a lot of exciting movements and we know that there’s going to be more to come.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I can see that. For instance this digital card that is from British Columbia. Tell me a bit more what a citizen can do with that card.</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah. So that card is getting more adoption. They’ve in fact now instantiated a mobile application where that card – you could – that card can be loaded into. The usage on the card – I would say the official usage on the card at this point is for some exciting use cases like grants for education. So use cases that are focused in on what kinds of benefits I can access from the British Columbia government.</p>
<p>One thing that we are very excited in Canada to see is how can that card be used in use cases that cross sectors. So would we be able to load that credential into another network and present that card let’s say for what we call ‘age of consent’ to purchase liquor? Will we be able to soon use the digital representation of that card which has the data minimised, so, you know, it doesn’t need to have your address or things of that nature? Will we be able to also use that card in in-person scenarios to get discounts at movie theatres or to board a plane or to enter a bar? So there are some interesting – there’s progress with the usage of that card to access services. You can use that card today to visit the doctor.</p>
<p>So there’s progress in terms of where that card is actually used today inside the government, citizen’s government use cases, and what we’re very interested in the DIACC now is where can we see the value of that card extend out to be used in the private sector. And I was speaking with one of the leaders to help to instantiate that card – I think it was probably around the 2006, 2007 timeframe – and one of the things that they were talking about was that the card was always envisioned to be able to be used the way that a driver’s license is used but used digitally. So what that means is that even though we know that a driver’s license is not – it’s not an identity card, we also know that a driver’s license is continually presented as an identity card. And anytime we’re in person, they ask for a government-issued ID, we show them our driver’s license.</p>
<p>So there’s this mismatch in policy that exists where a driver’s license is not an identity card but it’s accepted and asked for as an identity card all the time.</p>
<p>So we know that this BC Service Card, the vision was that it would be able to be used just the way that a driver’s license would be used and that means out in the economy as well. So in DIACC, we’re very interested in how that kind of next journey will be made and how that digital credential that has the confidence that governments have the capability to offer, how that card will then be used in scenarios where I might want to present it digitally to a bank or to some trusted provider or potentially for something like Airbnb and house sharing, things of that nature.</p>
<p>So that’s where the next level of exploration is and we’re working to put some proofs of concept together, particularly to explore and learn fast and understand what that means in real time.</p>
<p>This is an area we know that we have seen some other regions around the world doing very interesting work around mobile driver’s license and where that’s being accepted and where that’s being used and definitely in the Scandinavian countries are also quite advanced in that space. So of course we’re looking out to many places around the world as to what we can learn and what lessons we can bring back and then apply and adjust for our governance and culture here in Canada.</p>
<p>Oscar: Sure, sure. But also I can see many good, interesting applications with that. You mentioned more than once in this interview that DIACC makes collaborations with – outside Canada and so I would like to know what – if you can give some example, a bit more concrete, and especially telling us what is the benefit of an entity from outside Canada to participate in DIACC projects.</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah. We’re very interested in collaborations that are also outside of Canada. So we’ve not yet released, but one of the collaborations that we were working on was understanding if – through the DIACC is understanding if a Canadian bank could accept a digital identity from another country.</p>
<p>Oscar: Right.</p>
<p>Joni: So we &nbsp;should soon release some materials about that, that we’re working through. Some of the things that we found was there was some issues in regulation where they’re calling for a Canadian digital identity when you get in the digital space. However, in the physical world, it’s good enough to provide a passport from another country.</p>
<p>So we’re finding some areas where the regulations are being interpreted in a way that may be prohibitive. So we found that to be very interesting and we should have some information to share there soon.</p>
<p>One of the collaborations that we’re very proud of as well is we have been working with the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate and particularly Anil John in that space, understanding where and how we have common agendas from our perspective here in Canada as well as their perspective in the US.</p>
<p>So we had a number of projects that were funded that were able to gain funding through a collaboration of the DIACC and the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate and those projects included some directed funding through that DHS Program to help explore and better understand the landscape of distributed ledger technology and identity systems that would use distributed ledger technologies and blockchain.</p>
<p>We were also able to fund – and those papers are available in <a href="https://www.diacc.ca">www.diacc.ca</a>. We’re also very pleased that a project could be funded to explore alternatives to KBA and KBV and that project funded a comprehensive study on kind of what those alternatives can look like and what some of the business models and opportunities can look like around them.</p>
<p>So in the case of the distributed ledger technology and understanding privacy and identity and those types of networks, the organisation that was funded through this program was SecureKey so that was exciting. That was before the launch of the Verified.Me service and then the project that was funded through that program as well was developed by a collaboration of two DIACC members, one being Digidentity and the other being the ID Crowd. So Digidentity is a Netherlands-based company and ID Crowd is based in the UK.</p>
<p>So through this programme, we’re able to identify shared commonalities in terms of agenda and then also to enable connectors to paths for funding, to enable those organisations to further develop and to more importantly I think – or just as importantly – to share their findings with the world. So we’re all able to benefit.</p>
<p>So that’s – so one of the agenda items that we have moving forward for this year is looking for more opportunities with connecting more organisations with more opportunities, who are interested to help drive roadmaps of small to medium-sized organisations and start-ups and help to fund and invest in the next solutions that will come out to address the needs around digital identity.</p>
<p>So we’re very interested in identifying other organisations who would like to direct funding or who would like to be kind of at the frontline of seeing where start-ups are going and helping to influence those roadmaps.</p>
<p>So we want to kind of do – help with some matchmaking of funding opportunities and organisations that need some funding to move to the next round.</p>
<p>Oscar: Wow, so many projects. Wow.</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: I was wondering, how many people work in DIACC?</p>
<p>Joni: DIACC is a small and mighty organisation similar to Canada, smaller population that punches above its weight or we try to at least. So in any case, we have a team of about 10 and then we have a – that team expands and they may deploy different resources to different specific projects, so yeah, yeah. We can be between – anywhere between 10 and 15 or 20, depending on kind of – which projects we’re working on and who we have helping to support us.</p>
<p>Oscar: Wow, quite impressive. I would like to ask a final question – if you can give us, to anybody, a practical tip, how we can protect our digital identity?</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah, definitely. I have two thoughts here. So – and I don’t want to cheat. I know it’s one tip but I would say first of all, I use a password vault, a password manager that goes across my phone and my laptop and my tablet. So I find that – I don’t believe that the password manager is the ultimate solution. But I do believe that it’s a solution that anyone can implement today.</p>
<p>And I would say specifically if you do decide to implement a password manager, I would also recommend sharing access with that, one that can share access, whether it’s your husband or a family member, your partner because having that, not only the ability to manage your own passwords – I probably have over 500 of them – but also if there’s ever an emergency having someone else to be able to access those passwords will be something that I think you will be glad that you did if you find yourself in that situation.</p>
<p>So I think that’s very, very important. And then more broadly, while this industry is working to make the space better from a systematic level, I would also just like to encourage people to just think of it more before they click, before they post.</p>
<p>I would suspect that people listening to this podcast actually do think quite a bit. But if you are participating in social media or being asked to take a quiz or something shows up that looks fun, just think a little bit before you actually participate in that activity about what data they may be trying to take from you or how they might use that data and is that worth the participation in that quiz or that game online. So just try to think before you post and before you click. So get a password manager and be thoughtful and mindful about your behaviour and what you’re sharing on the internet.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent, excellent tips. Thanks a lot Joni for this fascinating interview and finally tell us how we can find more information about DIACC on the net or to find more about yourself.</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah, thank you so much Oscar. As I’ve said, it has been a real pleasure to speak with you today. Thank you for the invitation and the opportunity to share and to learn from your questions.</p>

 [Podcast transcript] 
<p>Let’s talk about digital identity. The podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thanks for joining. Today we are going to hear about the importance of Women in Identity and for that, I would like to introduce Emma Lindley. She’s an adviser on digital identity and co-founder of Women in Identity, a not for profit organisation focused on developing diversity in the identity industry.</p>
<p>Over her career of 16 years in identity, Emma has held various roles, most recently as Head of Identity and Risk at Visa, with previous board level roles at Confyrm, Innovate Identity and The Open Identity Exchange, and was instrumental in the commercial development of GB Group’s position in the identity market back in 2003.</p>
<p>She has been recognised in the KNOW Identity Top 100 leaders in Identity in 2017, 2018 and 2019, the Innovate Finance Powerlist for Women 2016 and 2017, and was voted CEO of the year at the KNOW Identity Awards. She has an MBA from Manchester Business School and completed her thesis in Competitive Strategy in the Identity Market.</p>
<p>Hello Emma.</p>
<p>Emma Lindley: Hi Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s very nice talking with you Emma and I really want to hear more about Women in Identity and what you have been doing there. So let’s start. Let’s talk about digital identity.</p>
<p>Emma: For sure.</p>
<p>Oscar: So please tell me a bit about your journey, how you entered into this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Emma: Sure. So I mean I started in the identity industry back in 2003 and it’s interesting actually, I kind of didn’t intentionally move into this industry. I was working at a company based in the UK and we had some data about kind of UK citizens, things like the electoral roll and some telephone records.</p>
<p>And the CEO at the time had quite a lot of kind of, you know, foresight into the future and he said I think this problem with kind of online identity is – it’s going to become a thing and he asked a small team of us to get together. There were six of us at the time, asked to get together and develop a product proposition around using some of the data that we had about UK people to help with this kind of problem that he foresaw in the future around identity and online identity.</p>
<p>And the product that we put together replicated the process that banks have to go through, the KYC, know-your-customer process that banks had to go through at the time to check people’s identities. And the way that the banks in the UK did that at the time was looking at paper-based processes, looking at passports, looking at driving licenses. Often people had to go into a branch to do that process. You know, that was more often than not. There were some electronic databases around at the time but not many and so we set about building a process that directly replicated the manual process that the banks had to do.</p>
<p>The first product, minimum viable product, that we put together was on a CD-ROM which I think always kind of makes people laugh now and then we took that proposition now to a few companies and we got some really good feedback and then we did a kind of joint venture with British Telecom to put that into a web services environment.</p>
<p>So we effectively kind of built the product and BT did all of the secure hosting for us. But that meant that we could serve the service 24/7 and it meant that all the banks could use an API, use web services and use the service 24/7. It was a real game changer for the industry in the UK and we sold it to all the banks and a whole bunch of other companies, telecoms companies, online gambling companies in 2005 when the gambling market in the UK regulated.</p>
<p>And yeah, that’s how I kind of got into the industry. So it wasn’t intentional but it certainly has kept me interested over this time. You know, there has been a huge amount of change and I’ve done a whole variety of roles since then. Once of those roles was developing that kind of electronic identification service out globally.</p>
<p>I ran my own consulting firm and most recently I was Head of Identity and Risk at Visa. So yeah, it has certainly kept me interested and over time I think people, particularly my family, have become more familiar with what I do. You know, and I think that’s an unfortunate thing because you know, we have a lot more stuff in the press about people’s identities being stolen. We obviously have a lot more data breaches, which have been in the press but it does now mean that my family now know what I do. So that’s a good thing.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. So you were actually creating one of the earliest identity products in – for the UK. So that’s excellent. So what was your original role in this original position you entered into this company?</p>
<p>Emma: Yeah. So I started out and I started out life as more kind of like business development. So understanding market needs and then helping feed back into the product proposition and then going out and getting early stage feedback from organisations.</p>
<p>You know, I started out life in business development, sales and then I’ve moved in through a number of different roles. I’ve run product teams. I’ve run professional services implementation teams. So it’s interesting because I haven’t necessarily come from a technical background.</p>
<p>Oscar: Right.</p>
<p>Emma: And I think that’s the – one of the beauties about the identity industry. Even though a lot of the things – you know, the way that we look at solving digital identity is using technology. It’s very much a problem that I think non-technical and technical people have a very valid voice in and I think it’s important for us to have non-technical people in the area of identity because it involves humans and that’s an incredibly diverse topic. Humans are – we’re not a piece of technology. So I think it’s important to have non-technical and technical people working in the field. So I think it’s a great and interesting field and something that anybody can join.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. I couldn’t agree more. We need people from all backgrounds and you are a great example of that and today from your perspective, from the experience that you have been in identity already for 16 years, correct?</p>
<p>Emma: Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: And could you tell me what do you think – in your opinion, what are the main challenges today in digital identity?</p>
<p>Emma: Yeah. I mean I think there are a number of challenges around – and I will try and kind of cut it down. You know, for the identity industry, I think there were a number of challenges. But I also think just for the general kind of population, if we focus on identity around people rather than IoT devices at the moment, I think there are kind of three things from a user perspective.</p>
<p>One of those is we have –and this is well-documented – 1.1 billion people that are unable to get –cannot be identified because they don’t have the basic feeder documents to get even – you know, have a legal identity. And it’s interesting because we hook a lot of the identification processes around government-issued documents and not necessarily everybody has those – that kind of documentation.</p>
<p>You know, there are even segments of the UK population that don’t have passports and don’t have driving licenses. And often they are the most disadvantaged people. So I will use a UK example. You know, a passport in the UK costs 70 pounds to apply for. If you’re going to get a passport and pay the 70 pounds, that probably means that you’re thinking about going, traveling abroad and if you don’t have a lot of money, you probably haven’t got the 70 pounds and you probably haven’t got the money to go abroad.</p>
<p>Then the other thing, so people then kind of – you know, perhaps who have less money don’t tend to get passports and then if we think about the other document that we use in the UK, that’s the driving license. Again the process for that, you don’t have to pay for a driving license but you need to be thinking about well, I might be getting driving lessons to learn to drive. Those cost a lot of money and then you might be thinking, well, I need to buy a car and again those things cost money.</p>
<p>I think if people don’t have money – and I have seen this in a number of projects that I’ve run in areas of the UK where there is more poverty – people don’t have passports and driving licenses. So what we find is that people that are already disadvantaged are then unable to get perhaps bank accounts. They’re unable to get into the financial services products. They’re unable to make the savings. They’re unable to move into the digital world and we’ve got all these – you know, the people – that people talk about in countries like in Africa, who don’t have a lot of these feeder documents.</p>
<p>But it’s not just a ‘third world’ problem. It’s also a first world problem. So I think that’s one of the key issues for people. I think the other thing about – that we have around digital identity and authentication and all that type of thing and keeping people’s data safe online is people just –it’s getting so much more complex and people I don’t think really understand how to keep their data safe.</p>
<p>You know, they don’t know how to –passwords are fraught with problems. You know, people trying to remember their passwords is really challenging and I think that’s also a real challenge. It’s getting more complex. The fraudsters are getting more sophisticated and I think that’s a challenge for people.</p>
<p>And I think the other thing around digital identity is people just understanding what it is. You know, and I think, there are countries particularly in the Scandis where they’ve done particularly well around digital identity. You know, the BankID. In Finland, obviously they’ve had TUPAS and I know that that’s changing in September.</p>
<p>But I think there are some examples where we could see that the kind of digital identity infrastructure has done well and has – you know, Estonia for example. But in a lot of countries, I don’t think people understand what it is and so the UK for example is incredibly fragmented. We’ve got lots of different types of solutions.</p>
<p>The government have had GOV.UK Verify. But that hasn’t had the uptake that was needed. There are some private sector solutions but the uptake again is in the millions, not in the tens of millions. So I think it’s really challenging for people to understand what a digital identity is.</p>
<p>You know, a lot of people think, well, that’s my Facebook login and it’s not. So I think that kind of leaves us with issues. And I think from an industry perspective, we have some challenges as well. I think one of the main challenges we have is interoperability. Now in Europe we’ve got this framework which is eIDAS but that has taken a long time for people to kind of get into that framework and then we don’t have interoperability across the markets.</p>
<p>You don’t have interoperability between Canada and Australia for example. So I think that’s one of the challenges and we as an industry have so many different solutions. You know, we’ve got –and everyone is kind of commercially competing and I don’t think there’s enough collaboration.</p>
<p>And I think that the other thing – and this kind of ties back with what I was saying about people – I think as an industry, we tend to be too technically-focused. I know I’m making a bit of a generalising, sweeping statement there. But I tend to see that there’s not enough user experience testing done for users and that helping people understand like how they keep things secure and what a digital identity is and how they can use it, what it means and you know, all of those types of things, I think that’s a challenge for us as an industry because we tend to come at solutions perhaps from our own view point and if we are – you know, perhaps all quite technically-savvy, all that type of thing, then we will come at things with that view point and not everybody is particularly technically-savvy.</p>
<p>You know, I’ve sat in on a lot of user testing and people don’t know how to use things like FaceTime, you know, and so I think we’re kind of – when we start talking about cryptographic keys and all of those type of stuff, as an industry we need to be making things more simple for people to understand and we need to be doing user testing and we need to be iterating our solutions around the user.</p>
<p>So those are the biggest challenges I think that are in identity today. So there’s quite a lot. But I think that some of those are quite interlinked.</p>
<p>Oscar: Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely. You have mentioned quite a few and it’s true. It feels like digital identity is not so connected to people. One of the reasons you mentioned is it’s expensive, right? Billions of people who don’t have at all and also the ones who might be closer find it difficult because it’s very technical. So yeah, we have many challenges to solve.</p>
<p>Emma: Many challenges, many challenges.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. The ones who – like you and me who are working in this industry.</p>
<p>Emma: Exactly.</p>
<p>Oscar: So now let’s go to what I would like to discuss in more detail with you. This project, very interesting project, Women in Identity. Start telling us a bit how it started, about the history.</p>
<p>Emma: Sure. So around two years ago, there was a few of us in – who have been in the industry for quite a long time and we kind of ended up having a conversation with each other around two years ago and we were all kind of thinking the same thing. We were like, hey, we don’t have – there’s lots of ‘women in’ groups, women in tech groups, women in fin-tech groups, in other industries.</p>
<p>We don’t have one in our industry and we were kind of discussing and saying, “Do we think that this is even a thing? Do we think people will be interested?”</p>
<p>And so we decided to test it out and two years ago, the Identiverse Conference said, “Well OK, I will tell you what we will do. We will give you a room at our conference and over the lunch time, we will send some lunch to that room. We will advertise that you’re going to have a – kind of Women in Identity meet-up and just see how it goes.”</p>
<p>So there were a few of us there and we put together a kind of slide deck and we were like – you know, this is kind of what we’re thinking about a Women in Identity group might be and we were at the lunch and we were thinking well, you know, only 10 people might turn up and that kind of might be it.</p>
<p>But we were really, really pleasantly surprised. There was standing room only. There wasn’t even enough seats for people to sit down. We ran out of lunch because there wasn’t enough food for people and, you know, it was just amazing to see the turnout at the conference.</p>
<p>So we were really encouraged by that and we thought well, hey, this kind of feels like it’s a thing. So what we decided to do was just to test the proposition and over the sort of last two years, we’ve been running meet-ups globally in kind of various different countries just to get feedback from different people and from industry to understand what a Women in Identity group might be.</p>
<p>Over that time, we’ve just taken lots of feedback from people but we’ve also looked at research that’s coming out of places like MIT, around some of the issues around technology and the lack of diversity in technology.</p>
<p>And I think what that has led us to really is the group is called Women in Identity and it is a not for profit organisation, membership organisation that we have formed. But it’s not just about women. It is absolutely about all diversity in our industry and ensuring that we are an industry-facing organisation. We’re shining a light on the industry and we’re saying to the industry we need to make sure that we have diverse teams thinking about these solutions, these identity solutions, building these solutions, testing these solutions because if we don’t have that kind of level of diversity – and I was talking earlier on about technical and non-technical. That’s just one element of diversity.</p>
<p>You know, people from different backgrounds. You know, gender diversity, racial diversity, sexual orientation in terms of diversity. It’s really, really important that we have that kind of diversity because what we have started to see is evidence of bias being developed into the technologies that sit in the identity industry. So there’s actually a piece of research done by a lady called Joy Buolamwini. She’s from MIT and she found that when they looked at just a number of facial recognition systems, that the error rate for a white male face was below one percent and when it got to a female face, that increased to around 20 percent and when it got to a female face of colour, that error rate went to around 37 percent.</p>
<p>Oscar: Wow.</p>
<p>Emma: So if we think about the types of technologies – so I usually give this example. You know, if you think about the types of technologies that the banks are starting to use now, where, you know, you can use facial recognition to access services, perhaps taking up a picture of your identity card or your driving license or your passport and then using facial recognition. If you’re a white male, you’re more likely to get access to that service than if you’re a female face of colour by an enormous error rate.</p>
<p>So what we’re starting to do – you know, inadvertently, I think nobody is saying that this is happening deliberately. But inadvertently as an industry, we’re starting to take some of the biases that we have in the real world and starting to develop those into the systems in the virtual world.</p>
<p>And that means that we’re actually going to end up with systems that are less inclusive, not more inclusive. When I go back to one of the biggest problems that we’ve got in identity, is, you know, these people, these 1.1 billion people that don’t have an identity and that’s because they don’t have the kind of basic documents.</p>
<p>But if you think about people that – you know, we talked about diversity. They’re not – people might not be particularly technical, technologically-savvy. We’re then saying, well actually, we’re also potentially going to have systems that are going to further exclude people.</p>
<p>So as an industry, we – if our aim is to take everybody into the digital world and be able to have a digital identity and be able to get access to services and healthcare and all of you know education, all these amazing things that people cannot get access to with a digital identity, we have to be thinking about, you know, bias within our – you know, inadvertent bias that we might be developing into our systems and the ways in which we can prevent that. And one of the ways in which we can do that is ensure that we have a level of diversity in our organisations, in our teams, in the people that are thinking about and building these solutions.</p>
<p>Oscar: Definitely. We need not only women but also as you say, diversity for many reasons, for how this bias comes into the products that we are using and the ones that are coming.</p>
<p>So it was excellent to hear that from the very first, you had the very first meet-up you had in this conference it was a huge success. So a lot of interest and yeah, I mean even if I were in this conference, I would be interested to – just for curiosity go and see because this is – I feel is very important. So what’s now the vision of Women in Identity, now that we – it has already two years, right? So a bit more established. So …</p>
<p>Emma: Yeah. So we are now registered as a not for profit organisation. We’re a membership organisation. We are open to anybody. Anybody can join at all, irrespective of kind of background or gender or anything else. It is – the way that we have made it completely inclusive is that it is also free to join.</p>
<p>So anybody can join. All you need to do is go to <a href="https://www.womeninidentity.org">www.womeninidentity.org</a> and you can join there. In terms of our vision, our vision is that digital identity solutions built for everyone are built by everyone, and our mission is to inspire, elevate and support a more diverse workforce in the digital identity industry.</p>
<p>Now we’ve held lots of meet-ups as I said over the last couple of years. We are going to be holding more meet-ups and I was just talking to some people yesterday. I think we put about seven or eight scheduled before the end of the year. We are going to be holding meet-ups in New Zealand, our first one the other side of the world later on this year, which is really exciting.</p>
<p>We’re going to have our first meet-up in the Netherlands. We’re going to have another one in Germany. We’re going to be having one in Seattle and next year, really excitingly, we’re going to be having our first one around the ID4Africa&nbsp;conference and that’s going to be in Morocco in June.</p>
<p>So we really are starting to develop these meet-ups and that is where anybody can go to our meet-ups, meet other people in the identity industry who are interested in diversity within our industry.</p>
<p>We also have forums on the website. So when you go and you join up, you can then access geographical forums, also vertical sector forums. We have newsletters. So there’s a real reason for people to join. We also collaborate with conference organisers. So we have lots of conference organisers who offer us discount codes for our membership. So if you join, you can get access to all of those discount codes.</p>
<p>So if you want to go to the Gartner Conference for example in Las Vegas in December, we have a discount code for that. Gartner have a conference next year. We’re going to have a discount code for ID4Africa. So that’s what our members get and that’s the value they get. So they get the network. They get the forums. They get access to conferences. So there’s a huge amount of value there.</p>
<p>We’re also going to be setting up a kind of mentorship scheme. And the other thing that we do is around grassroots development. So trying to bring new people into the industry through mentoring but also internships as well.</p>
<p>The way that the organisation is funded, is funded through sponsorship. So we are looking for sponsors for Women in Identity. So I mean again if anybody wants to contact us around sponsorship, the email address is <a href="mailto:info@womeninidentity.org">info@womeninidentity.org</a>. We would be really grateful for any organisations who are interested in sponsoring us. And there are different ways in which organisations can sponsor us. But obviously there’s reciprocal benefit for doing that.</p>
<p>You know, we will help market those organisations and everything else as well. The organisation is run by volunteers and the board and the leadership team, it’s all voluntary. So again if anybody wants to join Women in Identity and thinks that they could give up some of their free time and help the organisation, we are also looking for volunteers as well from the industry.</p>
<p>So that’s the aim. That’s the mission. As I say, we’re going to have more meet-ups over the next 12 months and I would just encourage anybody to join.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, excellent. Actually it’s impressive how much you are already achieving. Next year, you are already in Africa as you mentioned. New Zealand very soon and wow, it’s excellent. What about for women or people from different backgrounds who are listening to this and saying, “OK, well, it sounds like a great cause but I’m not really interested in digital identity. I’m not sure if I should join this industry”? What are some examples or reasons you can tell us why you think that this is important, that diversity in the industry is really important?</p>
<p>Emma: Yeah. I mean I think we’ve kind of touched on it but I think just having more diverse voices and more viewpoints in this industry will be really important for the development of the products that we produce. I mean if we look at some of the evidence around diverse teams and McKinsey and Boston Consulting have done a huge amount of research around diversity and how that improves products and how they’re developed and also it actually improves the bottom line and the profitability of a business.</p>
<p>So, you know, I think that there are really good business reasons for us to have diverse teams in the organisations. But also I think diversity increases the possibilities and the solutions and the ideas that are considered.</p>
<p>Now interestingly, the evidence shows that that actually slows down decision-making in organisations and causes friction because you’ve got more diverse voices.</p>
<p>But it actually creates more solutions and a standard number of solutions and I think for our industry, that is so important. It’s so important that we have a wide range of potential solutions to the problems that we’re facing because humanity is incredibly diverse and therefore we are going to need diverse solutions to solve the problems and the challenges that we have facing us as an industry. So we need to have diverse teams and diverse thinking to do that.</p>
<p>So I would just encourage anybody to join. You know, whether you come from a technical background or not, you know, whatever your background, it’s a super exciting industry to join.</p>
<p>Oscar: For the ones who are not yet in digital identity, go into the Women in Identity website and get in touch with Emma and the others. It’s a great way to start for sure.</p>
<p>Emma: Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: So finally, can you tell us – you have told us already a bit what is coming. Anything else that is coming next from Women in Identity that you haven’t mentioned, you would like to say?</p>
<p>Emma: I think – I mean I think the thing I would say is just go to the website, <a href="https://www.womeninidentity.org">www.womeninidentity.org</a> and join up. You know, join up as a member and you will get access to – I mean all of the events are going to be on there.</p>
<p>We have some already on there but we’re going to be putting some more on over the next couple of weeks and just come to one of the meet-ups. You know, come to one of the meet-ups. As I said, we’re now going to start running those in lots of geographical locations before the end of the year. We’ve got ones in the Netherlands. We’re going to have one in the UK. We’re going to have one in the US. We are going to have one in New Zealand and next year, as I said, we’re going to be expanding out to places like Africa.</p>
<p>So I think just come to a meet-up near you. Find out more about the organisation and see if you want to get involved and how you want to get involved.</p>
<p>Oscar: And I guess it’s also possible if someone is not in this location you just mentioned can start their own meet-up I guess. By contacting you.</p>
<p>Emma: Absolutely. Yes, for sure. They can – if you’re based in a country that we don’t have meet-ups at the moment, then just let us know and we will be happy to provide you with kind of the – almost like the pack, the deck and the slides and all those types of things to start your own meet-up. Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. OK. So I would like to ask you now just to finalise- one final question is some practical tip for anybody to protect our digital identity.</p>
<p>Emma: I think I’m going to go for a really, really, really simple one, which is, you know, don’t reuse passwords across websites. You know, don’t – yeah, don’t reuse a password across different websites. I think that’s one way in which certainly people can protect their data and also kind of different types of services that they log into. That’s my simplest one and the reason for that is I’ve actually had a friend this week who has been busy texting me because she has had her password compromised and yeah – and she just had some real challenges this week because she’s worried about her data and she’s worried about perhaps more information being socially-engineered.</p>
<p>There is a really good website that people can go to. It’s <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">haveibeenpwned.com</a> and you can check whether your email address has been part of a data breach. And I think that will be my kind of practical advice is don’t reuse your passwords across different websites and also just keep on checking whether your email address has been part of a breach.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, many of the ones who never go – never go into this website haveibeenpwned.com will find surprises. The first time they put their emails, yeah.</p>
<p>Emma: Yeah, I know, I know, I know. People just don’t check and they don’t check if their email address has been part of a breach and this friend of mine this week, she went on to <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">haveibeenpwned</a> and she was like, “It has been part of seven breaches,” you know, and I was like, “That’s probably why they’ve got your password.”</p>
<p>Yeah, and she actually got an email from somebody who is trying to get bitcoin out of her. Even though she doesn’t have any bitcoin and they were like we’ve got your password and your password is this and then she was like, “I’ve been reusing it across all these websites”. So I think that would be just my really, really kind of baseline level of keep checking whether your email address has been part of a breach and don’t reuse your passwords.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I couldn’t agree more. Please finally remind us how we can find Women in Identity and how we can contact you. What are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Emma: Sure. So a number of different ways. The website which is <a href="https://www.womeninidentity.org">www.womeninidentity.org</a>. You could also go to Twitter. Our Twitter handle is @WomeninID. We’re also on Instagram as WomeninID. There is a LinkedIn group. So just search for Women in Identity on LinkedIn. We’re also on LinkedIn and if you want to email the team directly, it’s <a href="mailto:info@womeninidentity.org">info@womeninidentity.org</a>.</p>
<p>Oscar: Perfect. Thanks Emma. It has been a pleasure talking with you and hearing about this excellent project Women in Identity that we definitely are supporting a lot. So thank you and all the best.</p>
<p>Emma: Thanks so much Oscar.</p>

 [Podcast transcript] 
<p>Let’s talk about digital identity. The podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thanks for joining today. Today we’re going to hear about Telia, what Telia is doing specifically in identification, as a broker service.</p>
<p>For that, we have two guests today. So let me introduce you to them. Lauri Immonen has held various positions within Telia Company for the last 17 years and now leads the commercial security and digital identity portfolio on a group level.</p>
<p>Then we have Joni Rapanen. He’s a global product manager for identity services in Telia Company. He has 15 years of experience in the identity and digital signing area, from national ID cards to private B2B identity, and he’s driving strong authentication attributes in identity federation to support more secure overall digitalisation of thousands of different services.</p>
<p>Hi Lauri and Joni. Welcome.</p>
<p>Lauri Immonen: Hello. Thanks for having us.</p>
<p>Joni Rapanen: Yeah, thanks.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s great talking with you. So Lauri and Joni, let’s talk about digital identity and I would like to hear first how you entered into this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Lauri: Yeah. Maybe I will start. So I’ve been working in the company for 17 years like you mentioned and during that time, I’ve also worked as a product manager for identity services on a group level and that I think it was around the time when the eIDAS Regulation started to arise. GSMA work for a global authentication of Mobile Connect started to be developed and I got really interested in this – basically the problem statement of strong authentication of identities in Europe and of course in a global context as well. And how it is really morphing ourselves.</p>
<p>When we enter into different contexts and roles, we are still the same person. But how do you prove that online? And I think it’s an extremely interesting development and changes our way of working but also our normal individual selves.</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah. So personally I started as a software engineer in a software company, smaller one that did encryption-related software and after that I was an information security consultant for companies.</p>
<p>As an IT security consultant and with the wide area of that, I got more and more of these ID-related tasks, maybe based on the encryption background and related to that, here we are still. So basically it has continued to the more like wider identity area and tied into the services because when we look now compared to 15 years ago, there is a lot more e-IDs and e-services used. So – and I think it’s still a growing area.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, I agree with what you say Joni that now you guys have much more experience than I do in digital identity and we have seen how things have changed in 15 years around the – in this world. And it’s true, today digital identity is much wider. So we’re going to talk today about something much more specific. It’s about – it is called identity broker and specifically because Telia has been awarded recently – in the European Identity and Cloud Awards 2019 – as the best consumer identity project and this project was Telia Identification Broker Service. So please tell us about this project.</p>
<p>Lauri: Sure, I will start. So Telia has been in the identity field or market for a long time. And specifically in the Nordics, the countries are formed by post-paid subscriptions which by default requires that we know exactly who the end customer is.</p>
<p>And at the same time, there’s other movements in these markets and every country is different and there’s the predominantly – it’s three types of players. It’s governments, banks and telcos.</p>
<p>This is not the same all over the world but in the Nordics, it looks pretty much like that and without going into smaller details, this creates a situation where there are multiple authentication methods used by the people, with the exception of Sweden where the BankID predominates the strong authentication market.</p>
<p>But this creates a situation where in the pan-Baltic Sea region, we as citizens are authenticating ourselves in various different ways provided by these solution providers. And this creates complexity but it also creates a position where people are used to authenticating themselves online for various reasons, for public and private sector services and also within B2B.</p>
<p>And this is both a blessing and a curse in a sense that when you have enterprises operating in this region, for example, they don’t have a unique solution that roams or crosses the country boundaries.</p>
<p>But at the same time also digital service providers like e-commerce and what have you, they need to be – a way of integrating with this, all of these multiple sources of authentication.</p>
<p>Then you have also regulations around it. Like how can you re-enrol different types of identities across the platforms? But maybe Joni can go into more specifically into our winning identity brokering service.</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah. So basically in Finland, there are about 18 different strong e-ID solutions that you can use to fill your tax declarations and basically whatever. And as an online service provider, to provide this e-services, you had to integrate all of these 18 different like e-ID vendors, individual APIs and make your commercial negotiations and make your like agreements and data privacy agreements with them.</p>
<p>So it’s quite a hassle as a one-time task for the service provider. But it’s not only as like a hard one-time task but more of a bigger issue is actually in life cycle management because then you have to follow all of these 18 different vendors and how their APIs are changing and now when the world – at least in Finland – has gone to the mode that almost any companies have their own software developers but they are outsourced to big integrators and that means that always when there is a small change in the – one of the APIs, you will need to have a new project basically with the outsourced integrator and then between those times, no one is actually following all of those 18 different vendors and how their services keep changing.</p>
<p>So you usually find out by your customers that have complained that for some reason they cannot access the service and of course it’s too late at that phase. So basically we are buying those ID transactions from all of the legal, strong e-e-ID vendors in Finland and we are federating them behind one Telia Identity Brokering Service API where you have easily – easy to integrate standards-based APIs that a service provider can choose a couple of options that best fits their need. And then you can only make one commercial contract and agreement with us and get all of those different solutions, behind one solution basically. So that’s the main thing for the service.</p>
<p>Oscar: And what makes it difficult to have this cross-border identification?</p>
<p>Lauri: Well, in the Nordic countries, the people have been used- and both on a cultural but also governmental aspect that every single citizen has a social security number that is provided by the government and it uniquely identifies who you are as a legal person.</p>
<p>And this also relates then also from – like I mentioned, about the post-paid subscriptions but also to any type of public contract that you want to create. However, these do not roam. So the cross-border authentication does not work in that way.</p>
<p>But this is also wider European context. Like the European Union Commission has published, or basically regulated, the eIDAS regulation that aims exactly to harmonise the cross-border authentication of citizens to enable business but also transparency between the public organisations and individual citizens. And we have been working along that with our trust services and also the ID brokering service across Nordics and Baltics where our company’s footprint exists and we are trying to solve this problem.</p>
<p>But I think it also goes back to where different players, the banks, governments and telcos have had a different market position, market share, and also maturity in that particular country, whatever we are talking about.</p>
<p>So that has created a situation where in some countries, banks are predominant. In some countries, like Estonia, the governments are very progressive in issuing digital identities. And in some countries, it’s telcos and in some countries, it’s a mix of this.</p>
<p>Then to create a solution like the ID brokering service that basically tries to solve the complexity is our answer to try to solve that particular customer problem. But I think to answer why is it difficult, it’s a mixed bag of, like Joni mentioned, 18 different solutions in Finland alone and it’s just a question of maturity.</p>
<p>Then going back to the eIDAS regulation, that is a regulatory approach to try to harmonise. And across Nordic countries also, there is Pan-Nordic government activities to harmonise the national e-IDs, so that we could – just like today, we can move to any country and register ourselves to live in that particular Nordic country as a Nordic citizen. But also we want to – or they want to -digitalise that.</p>
<p>But I think this complexity is really the question – that different players moving at different times in different countries and also the consumption of our– or cultural even, the aspect of like in some Central European countries, there is no government-issued identification number or social security number that can be traced and is used in many different transactions.</p>
<p>But in Nordic countries, we have these and everybody is accustomed to give that personal ID number or social security number when you are performing especially commercial transactions with any type of way. So not only for public sector use cases.</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah. So I would like to add that we are also driving as Telia and with GSMA. GSMA, the standardised global mobile ID solution called Mobile Connect that actually has standardised the APIs to our service providers and also provides this kind of global discovery service that you could actually get many mobile operators, mobile ID services with one global interface as well. And we are currently going towards that one and also to support these kind of public global cloud services that are growing all the time.</p>
<p>Oscar: So for instance Mobile Connect would be part of your – the same product, the same Telia Identification Broker Service. It will be part of that.</p>
<p>Joni: Yes. So the Mobile Connect is part of the whole offering and it’s one of the APIs that a service provider could integrate. But with Mobile Connect the main advantage comes from that you can actually get the Spanish Mobile Connect enabled users from their local operators to your service with the single standardised integrations and with less commercial contracts as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, and Lauri, you mentioned that eIDAS, the standard, is going to help somehow this challenge. How is it going to help?</p>
<p>Lauri: Well, what I’ve understood that it really points into is to increase the so-called fluidity between commercial transactions by private citizens towards enterprises or between each other. So like I could buy a car from Germany online without going there and trust that the other person is who he or she claims to be.</p>
<p>It cannot happen today. There is no digital passport, which I’m really looking forward to having. Instead I have to carry my passport wherever I go, but it’s a standardised way of proving who I am wherever you go. And I think in the future, maybe long or short term, we will progressively move into the digital passport era so to speak and the public sector or governments are progressively driving this. I mean it’s not only regulatory issues, it’s also the – you know -governments want to know who is where so to speak. And Mobile Connect is – and GSMA, for those who don’t know it, is basically a federation of mobile network operators around the world.</p>
<p>Like the Mobile World Congress for example in Barcelona yearly is what GSMA hosts and so on. And it also drives the standardisation of 5G and among others and Mobile Connect is one of the products that we co-develop within that community. And Mobile Connect can operate as a replacement so to speak on social log-ins that are very popular today but then you’re basically trading your privacy against the usability.</p>
<p>With Mobile Connect, you can prevent that. You have a secret pin code that you authenticate yourself with the application on a mobile phone and you log into the service. So it’s also a two-factor security add and very usable in that sense.</p>
<p>And another thing that it can help is the cloud services that Joni pointed out. Like Office 365 phishing and CEO fraud are one of the biggest practical threats that are actually happening right now as we speak when it’s the holiday season.</p>
<p>So phishing emails are being sent and fake invoices and if you lose your Office 365 password, somebody can log in from anywhere to your account and so on. And the Cybersecurity Centre of Finland has published warnings in the past regarding this, so it’s a very real topic.</p>
<p>By using a two-factor authentication, such as Mobile Connect or mobile ID service, you get a unique way of securing your account and we look very much forward to publishing this.</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah, and it actually goes a little bit backwards here security-wise because if you look a couple of years ago, there was no way that big companies would allow you to access your corporate email and your corporate document storage by only using username and password. Like basically many of these global B2B cloud services are working today.</p>
<p>So you needed to have a VPN and you needed to have a strong authenticator, two-factor authenticator for that. But now the transition has happened in the way that most of the big companies nowadays use these kind of cloud services for document storage and emails and such, and there will be really big issues with those and I think that’s only kind of a question of time that when we can start to see those happening.</p>
<p>Lauri: Yeah, and it’s – as always it’s a balance between usability and security in a sense. But nowadays, you really need to use – look into the usability aspect because everything needs to be easy and I think that is a good transition and a trend.</p>
<p>But in order to support the mega trends of hybrid cloud transition, mobility and overall digitalisation, and especially in zero trust environments, the two factor – or in our case, we believe in the Mobile Connect, the mobile factor authentication as a two-factor. That is our bet on how do you secure the digital identity of the user and that is for sure required in the future because like Joni said, when everything is accessible and you have a zero trust framework, then that by definition needs a strong authentication of who is actually accessing what and when, if not where.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. Coming back to the service you have, the Telia Identification Broker Service, Joni mentioned about the APIs. You have to maintain and integrate many APIs that are changing at different times and there’s always technical complexity I see. But what else would you say are the behind-the-scenes elements that have to work very well in order to have this service?</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah. Well, the identity brokering service is like a true real time service as we don’t actually, as Telia, get to use or get those user social security numbers accessing the tax office for example to – or FILI] or some kind of government things.</p>
<p>So it has to work in real time between the actual original e-ID vendors and the online services that the actual transactions are going to. So we don’t store any information in the identity proxy of the users and that’s why it’s very important that all the different parts and connections are working 24/7 and that there is no cuts because it instantly destroy the function of the whole service. So at least by now we have everything running 24/7 without breaks.</p>
<p>Oscar: Oh, excellent. And what are the type of companies or organisations that would benefit the most by taking a service like Telia Identification Broker Service? So what companies need it?</p>
<p>Lauri: All the companies [laughs] because as we are looking into the – well again, the mega trends around us, I mean physical brick and mortar shops are closing down, especially in banking. We still have the reality of those – all those multiple e-IDs around. So you need to be able to support them as a service provider, whatever service you provide.</p>
<p>So I think this is the useful way of enabling strong identities in your business. We could also elaborate into what we have done in Telia Company which is that our internal VPN for example, is only accessible by authenticating yourself with your mobile ID service that we provide externally.</p>
<p>So we use that internally instead of having a let’s say third party authentication method, multiple factor authentication method. So we use our own service to provide that. At the same time, actually it’s based on your social security number.</p>
<p>So you are actually identifying yourself at work for our internal tools by providing information that who you are as a real person, as a citizen of that particular country. So that evolves into a situation where you actually bring your own identity into work and also as a private person. And going back to the ID brokering service, we combine all of these availabilities and those can be then used in whatever use case you have, as an enterprise service provider business. So ecommerce is definitely one of the biggest industries.</p>
<p>Oscar: So you have many customers in ecommerce for instance.</p>
<p>Lauri: And public sector also. And for example and Joni can actually maybe elaborate a bit on our Finland public registration centre that provides, well, public sector services from the government to the citizens and that, by definition, needs strong authentication of your citizenship and maybe Joni can say a couple of words about it.</p>
<p>Joni: Yes. So we have lately won the – or almost a year ago now – won the biggest public bidding in Finland to provide this e-ID transaction and that means that we are basically providing all the e-ID transactions for all the government-based public services. And today we currently have more than 3000 services you can actually use behind our service.</p>
<p>So there is quite a lot of different industries. So I can tell for an example that I just bought a house and I actually made that bid for the salesperson with my mobile ID and signing digitally the bidding document online. And then I made registration for the land registry online and the declaration of the property tax in Finland and your water subscription and electricity subscription.</p>
<p>And then I rented a van online to move my stuff from the old house to the new one and it was completely done online with my mobile. So I also used my mobile ID to rent the van and I picked it up actually from the local IKEA’s parking lot where they have left the van, as the van rental company, and then when you access it with the website with your mobile and authenticate with your mobile ID to that one and sign the renting contract, it actually opens remotely the doors to the van and you can start it and so on.</p>
<p>And there is not a single person involved in this kind of car rental as well. So the whole kind of thing is done online nowadays and based on this kind of services. So basically it’s – let’s say quite advanced but also quite reliable to the service and dependant on those online like e-ID solutions work or otherwise any of the solutions that will not work.</p>
<p>Lauri: And that they can be trusted and that they are trusted by all the parties involved. So you need to fulfil the regulatory things but you also need to fulfil kind of like a global internet community standard if you will. And basically for this reason, what Joni explained from this personal life, we as Telia, we are the only telecom company in Europe that has a root certificate authority platform and we used that as the base of the digital identities of humans and machines into solutions that we provide, such as signing and archiving and time stamping so that who you are, what you want to do can be trusted and traced back essentially.</p>
<p>But also of course we sell like SSL certificates as well for websites. But the certificate authority-based digital certificates are required in order to fulfil this kind of use case that Joni went through and we believe that the paperless transactions are of course the future.</p>
<p>We like to say that as an enterprise, you – the more you deal with paper, then 99 percent you can save in costs when you move into the digitalisation of the trust-based services that you need.</p>
<p>Oscar: That was a very, very good example and quite impressed that you have done – bought a house plus every single other service that you need from your mobile phone. And who is running this service? It’s some real estate company or who has integrated all this?</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah. So these are mostly like individual services. So it’s not a single place but you can handle all of those from those services’ websites. And like I said, this kind of – it’s very important that these services are running 24/7 because if you are like running a car rental company, that doesn’t have any like physical locations for employees to fill this paper with you, it basically means that your business is dead if that …</p>
<p>Lauri: There is no room for downtime in this kind of services.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. Then I would like to hear about the future. You already– I also want to ask about Mobile Connect. You already mentioned that Mobile Connect is already integrated on your service. What are your future plans about this service or in general in Telia in terms of digital identity?</p>
<p>Lauri: I would say that the user centricity becomes more of the need of the future in the digital and mobile world as contra the B2C customer-centric. So we have GDPR. Of course everybody knows about that. And this kind of user-centric, consent-driven utilisation of your identity online, this will become the issue, and who facilitates that the best will win.</p>
<p>And the race is to get rid of passwords and the competitors are the governments, banks, telcos and social media login providers – who by the way will steal your privacy. [Laughing] But I think this is really the future. We start to get more and more rid of physical transactions, signing papers and so on because it’s so costly. Archiving, we can elaborate on public ledgers or that technology. It might be one of the solutions for these future platforms. But the trend is definitely in this – well, mobility, cloud transition and digitalisation overall and who facilitates the digital identity of you as a user will win.</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah. We can also provide some additional attributes to the transactions. So like your physical address and such. So it doesn’t only bring added security because if someone has like stolen your identity and tries to use it to order some sofa or whatever online, it would actually still come to you. So – and these are of course done with the user’s explicit consent. But this is a very good example of the service that’s not only adding security but also usability for the end user because at least in the mobile business, when you are a lot harder to type this kind of things to the shopping carts and whatever you need. So it also makes our life easier in that sense.</p>
<p>Lauri: Yeah. There is something around 70 – depending on the research, about 70 to 80 percent of mobile-driven shopping carts are abandoned, as you would say, for the sake of usability. It’s not easy enough to – unless you populate it once and then you have a profile that is maybe a constant log-in or something. But still maturity of the mobile-initiated shopping carts are abandoned. So there is also a business opportunity there to facilitate things more easily in a secure way.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. I would like to finalise asking both of you some tips that you can give us to anybody for protecting our digital identities.</p>
<p>Lauri: Yeah. Well, two-factor authentication is something that you really should enable. Bear in mind when you get those notifications to your email box that there is an initiated log-in from a previously untrusted device for example. Don’t reset your passwords.</p>
<p>One practical example is from Sweden. In Sweden the e-ID market is pretty dominated by BankID. It is a consortium company that is used and owned by multiple Swedish banks, that has created into a solution that there is a predominant position of BankID and nowadays on a mobile device, that is used as a strong authentication method of public and private sector authentications and signing.</p>
<p>This has led to a situation where when you have a big and predominant position of one single e-ID in the whole market, that criminals are starting to try to phish out your identity and today in the gross numbers, in Sweden there is more reported identity thefts than bicycle thefts and I think that’s quite interesting and the modus operandi of the criminals is basically that they find out – and this goes back to also like in the Nordic countries where you have a publicly-given unique social security number It is not so difficult to find out what is my social security number.</p>
<p>Then as a criminal – or somebody else’s. And then as a criminal, you would phish out in some way the information that what is your bank. You would initiate the log-in online and then you would call to that person, claiming that you are from the security department of that particular bank and in order to secure your digital identity, please authorise yourself on your mobile device and I can initiate that request to your phone by entering the social security number onto the web or online bank.</p>
<p>And then if you believe me and you authenticate yourself on a mobile device, the criminal actually logs into your bank account and immediately starts to transfer money away and this is the predominant way of stealing your identity online.</p>
<p>And when you do this 1000 times and you succeed sometimes, then it becomes a profitable business. And the Swedish police authorities are constantly warning people not to – never give – not to give out your secrets or basically in this case a pin code or to anybody calling you. Banks are warning constantly that they never call and ask for authentication. It still happens but I would say that that is the number one way to protect your identity online. Don’t believe those people who call you and want you to authenticate yourself.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, because in the past, the bank used to call you or some – or an organisation called you to …</p>
<p>Lauri: Some of them, yes.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah.</p>
<p>Lauri: Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: But the norm is today …</p>
<p>Lauri: Never.</p>
<p>Oscar: Never. OK.</p>
<p>Lauri: That is the norm today. But it still happens so much and this is of course, you know, when – in Finland, if you have 18 different authentication methods, it’s much more difficult to try to find out what is the authentication method that you are using actually. But when you have only one predominant, then it becomes more of a – let’s say a criminal business opportunity.</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah. So maybe I should add please don’t do the same password between different services online and if you don’t do that, at least use a different one for your email with the password reset function that you use between the services, as we still wait to get the two-factor authentication for wider service base online.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. It’s going to take a bit of time, yeah. We have to deal a bit more with this. Well, thanks a lot both Lauri and Joni for telling us about the service, Telia Identification Broker Service and what are the challenges. Very interesting and how you’re working to help all of us. Let us know how we can find more information about the service from yourselves.</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah. So you can find the identity services in your local corresponding Telia country’s websites. So we have the B2B as well as B2C services in the ID area and you could also use Google to find those or directly from the Telia website as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. Again, thank you very much.</p>
<p>Lauri: Yeah, thanks for having us and let’s make passwords the thing of the past.</p>
<p>Joni: Yes, thanks.</p>
<p>Oscar: All right, thank you. Bye-bye.</p>
