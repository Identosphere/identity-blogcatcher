It has, as usual, been hot and cold here in Texas between the third Sunday of Advent and Epiphany.  You could literally have given yourself a heatstroke while jogging at noon on December 17 and frozen your tongue to a metal pole at noon the next day, if you didn't have much sense in any kind of weather.

Having managed one post all year in 2016 (albeit a post periodically updated behind its link), I’m going to try to pick up the pace in 2017, with a Dickensian serialization of a set of meditations on a theme.

To introduce the theme, I’ll point you to this recent bit of reporting by Amelia Tate of the New Statesman. Go ahead: click the link and read it. I’ll wait.

OK, you’re back?  That was pretty interesting, right?  What really caught my attention in Amelia’s story was this sentence:

First SQLite, now DuckDB: options for running database engines in the browser using WebAssembly keep on growing.

AWS Lambda added support for Docker containers last year, but with a very weird shape: you can run anything on Lambda that fits in a Docker container, but unlike Google Cloud Run your application doesn&#x27;t get to speak HTTP: it needs to run code that listens for proprietary AWS lambda events instead. The obvious way to fix this is to run some kind of custom proxy inside the container which turns AWS runtime events into HTTP calls to a regular web application.

While GraphQL has generally made my life easier, especially as I&rsquo;ve been building and consuming more data-heavy APIs, there is still one extremely annoying problem I&rsquo;ve run into over and over again: lack of GraphQL support for third-party APIs I need to consume.

Time is valuable. In fact, time is the single most valuable thing any of us have. That&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s so important not to waste time if you don&rsquo;t have to. Every second you waste working on something unnecessary is literally cannibalizing your life.

Over the span of my professional career, I&rsquo;ve spent the vast majority of my time building developer services at small companies (including my own). I&rsquo;ve also had the opportunity to meet, work with, and advise other'>Don't Waste Time Getting Feedback</a>

I enjoyed reading The Code of Capital by Katharina Pistor.  I liked this book because it provides what seems like a rare perspective that is required to reveal the DNA of capitalism rather than the more common unintended obfuscation from books that are lacking.  A benefit is that emerging technologies related to assets can be considered in a more coherent way and we can see that issues which seem new often resemble those of the past.

For instance, Pistor asks the genesis question:

My mother Betty passed away Friday night and her service is Saturday at 2pm at the Kingwood Funeral Home.  This is one of my favorite pictures of her with her mother and my brother David in downtown San Francisco.

Growing up, I always remember that there was a set of golf clubs in the garage but it seemed like they were never used.  Luckily, this week, I listened to a Christmas audio message from 1971 that my parents had sent to my grandparents.  My mom said that the day before, Baxter had tak'>Betty's Funeral Service</a>
