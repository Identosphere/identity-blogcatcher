I’ve always been the sort of person who works with music in the background. Ever since I was a little kid writing code in my bedroom, I’d routinely listen to my favorite music while programming.

Over the last 12 years, as my responsibilities have shifted from purely writing code to writing articles, recording videos, and participating in meetings, my habits have changed.

Doing it this way the pool is not reachable from clients that are not on your local machine.

You can now build the libindy libraries for Android by just running a script. Yeah!
If you want to spare that building process you can download the libraries from Evernym. Thanks!

Now what? You have a libindy.so for arm, arm64 and x86, but how do you use it?

So there is a wall with height h, which has the distance a from a very high "building" and your task, should you accept it, is to find the shortest ladder over the wall that touches the ground and the "building".

♦


So the function to minimize is L = sqrt((x+a)^2+(h+y)^2).
Because we know that y/a = h/x it follows that y = ah/x.
Using this the length become L = sqrt((x+a)^2+(h+ah/x)^2)

It is a mix of English and Spanish. &nbsp;I hope that we can find some resources for subtitling. &nbsp;

We did have simultaneous translation for the audience, but that did not get recorded unfortunately.



The presentations are also available for download.

A consequence of the time I spend in the world of electrons - motionless, more or less, except for my fingers and my eyes - is that protons tend to congregate around my waist.&nbsp; I try to fight this with exercise, but it's clear that I've got to cut down on the supply of these protons, too.

It has, as usual, been hot and cold here in Texas between the third Sunday of Advent and Epiphany.

Having managed one post all year in 2016 (albeit a post periodically updated behind its link), I’m going to try to pick up the pace in 2017, with a Dickensian serialization of a set of meditations on a theme.

To introduce the theme, I’ll point you to this recent bit of reporting by Amelia Tate of the New Statesman. Go ahead: click the link and read it. I’ll wait.

OK, you’re back?  That was pretty interesting, right?  What really caught my attention in Amelia’s story was this sentence:

Solution
The solution to this problem is quite simple. Since MIM is not using any search capabilities of the underlying Sharepoint engine, we can just remove the search component. You can do this either via the Central Administration or via Powershell.

Although FIM allows you to filter objects on import in the connector configuration, it does not allow you to filter attribute values for a certain population. An example use case could be: "Import all mobile numbers from HR, but not the mobile numbers for person X, Y and Z". Reason for this could be that the X, Y and Z's numbers should not occur in the global address list or some other system where they can be viewed by others.

This problem can be solved by manipulating the import attribu'>FIM2010: Selective Import Attribute Flow</a>

Enterprise movement towards the Clouds is a given. As digitization is transforming all enterprises in all industries, whether you are HDO (health delivery org line Stanford Medical), Payee (health insurance co., like Aetna), Manufactures (like Amgen or Biogen) or a distributor (like AmerisourceBergen or McKesson) within the health care industry (and this is true in banking/finance, retail, government, education and all industrial sectors), you are impacted by massive digitization (see my exam'>Systemic Security Services as a Competitive Cloud Advantage</a>

♦Recently
I authored a paper and presented a "brighttalk"
on the same topic: "Threat Centric IAM". Both the paper and the tech
talk was well received by at least 12+ CISO's I had met. Quite often they came
back to me with more people, process and governance related questions to this approach,
hence this blog entry.

years is a CISO organization that is folding the IAM resources under the CISO

To me Compliance Centric Security offers a baseline which is a solid baseline and a must for todays Cloud offerings, such as Google Clouds which has achieved an impressive list of compliance certifications including;

&nbsp;

1). comprehensive ISO 27001 ( for the systems,              applications, people, technology, processes and data centers serving Google Cloud Platform )

2). ISO 27017 specific for cloud services

3). ISO 27018 specific for cloud privacy

4). SOC 2

For large enterprises evaluating next generation Threat Intelligence (Incident of Compromise detection tools) platforms such as Fireye, Fidelis and Sourcefire, one of the KEY evaluation criteria is how much of this Threat Intelligence generated can act as Actionable Intelligence.
