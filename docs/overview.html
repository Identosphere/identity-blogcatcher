In March of 2021, I almost died due to a gastrointestinal bleed (a freak accident caused by a routine procedure). Luckily, I survived the incident due to my amazing wife calling 911 at the right time and the fantastic paramedics and doctors at my local hospital, but it was a terrifying ordeal.

So there is a wall with height h, which has the distance a from a very high "building" and your task, should you accept it, is to find the shortest ladder over the wall that touches the ground and the "building".

♦


So the function to minimize is L = sqrt((x+a)^2+(h+y)^2).
Because we know that y/a = h/x it follows that y = ah/x.
Using this the length become L = sqrt((x+a)^2+(h+ah/x)^2)

Last month, I performed a 30-minute show called "Knowledge Worker" for the incredible audience at Gene Kim's ETLS in Las Vegas.
The show included 7 songs about the past, present, and future of "knowledge work" - or, more specifically, how it's affecting us, the humans between keyboard and chair. I poured everything I've been thinking and feeling about AI for the last 2+ years into this show, and I feel a great sense of peace at having said what I meant to say.'>Knowledge Worker</a>

Having managed one post all year in 2016 (albeit a post periodically updated behind its link), I’m going to try to pick up the pace in 2017, with a Dickensian serialization of a set of meditations on a theme.

To introduce the theme, I’ll point you to this recent bit of reporting by Amelia Tate of the New Statesman. Go ahead: click the link and read it. I’ll wait.

OK, you’re back?  That was pretty interesting, right?  What really caught my attention in Amelia’s story was this sentence:

Solution
The solution to this problem is quite simple. Since MIM is not using any search capabilities of the underlying Sharepoint engine, we can just remove the search component. You can do this either via the Central Administration or via Powershell.

Although FIM allows you to filter objects on import in the connector configuration, it does not allow you to filter attribute values for a certain population. An example use case could be: "Import all mobile numbers from HR, but not the mobile numbers for person X, Y and Z". Reason for this could be that the X, Y and Z's numbers should not occur in the global address list or some other system where they can be viewed by others.
