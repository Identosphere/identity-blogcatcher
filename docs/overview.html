A consequence of the time I spend in the world of electrons - motionless, more or less, except for my fingers and my eyes - is that protons tend to congregate around my waist.&nbsp; I try to fight this with exercise, but it's clear that I've got to cut down on the supply of these protons, too.

It has, as usual, been hot and cold here in Texas between the third Sunday of Advent and Epiphany.  You could literally have given yourself a heatstroke while jogging at noon on December 17 and frozen your tongue to a metal pole at noon the next day, if you didn't have much sense in any kind of weather.

To introduce the theme, I’ll point you to this recent bit of reporting by Amelia Tate of the New Statesman. Go ahead: click the link and read it. I’ll wait.

OK, you’re back?  That was pretty interesting, right?  What really caught my attention in Amelia’s story was this sentence:

It turns out there is a neat trick for doing exactly that. I've been experimenting with it using my Datasette web application as a rapid prototyping platform for trying out new AI techniques using custom SQL functions.
Here's how to do this:

I learned so much practical stuff from this post by Julia Evans. There are no 32-bit floating point numbers between 262144.0 and 262144.03125, which breaks code that attempts to keep incrementing by 0.01. I knew about the JavaScript tweet ID problem (JavaScript can&#x27;t handle numbers like 1612850010110005250) but I didn&#x27;t realize it affected jq as well. Lots more great examples in here.

Over the last 12 years, as my responsibilities have shifted from purely writing code to writing articles, recording videos, and participating in meetings, my habits have changed.

In March of 2021, I almost died due to a gastrointestinal bleed (a freak accident caused by a routine procedure). Luckily, I survived the incident due to my amazing wife calling 911 at the right time and the fantastic paramedics and doctors at my local hospital, but it was a terrifying ordeal.
