Doing it this way the pool is not reachable from clients that are not on your local machine.

You can now build the libindy libraries for Android by just running a script. Yeah!
If you want to spare that building process you can download the libraries from Evernym. Thanks!

Now what? You have a libindy.so for arm, arm64 and x86, but how do you use it?

So there is a wall with height h, which has the distance a from a very high "building" and your task, should you accept it, is to find the shortest ladder over the wall that touches the ground and the "building".

♦


So the function to minimize is L = sqrt((x+a)^2+(h+y)^2).
Because we know that y/a = h/x it follows that y = ah/x.
Using this the length become L = sqrt((x+a)^2+(h+ah/x)^2)

We did have simultaneous translation for the audience, but that did not get recorded unfortunately.



The presentations are also available for download.

Having managed one post all year in 2016 (albeit a post periodically updated behind its link), I’m going to try to pick up the pace in 2017, with a Dickensian serialization of a set of meditations on a theme.

To introduce the theme, I’ll point you to this recent bit of reporting by Amelia Tate of the New Statesman. Go ahead: click the link and read it. I’ll wait.

OK, you’re back?  That was pretty interesting, right?  What really caught my attention in Amelia’s story was this sentence:

Solution
The solution to this problem is quite simple. Since MIM is not using any search capabilities of the underlying Sharepoint engine, we can just remove the search component. You can do this either via the Central Administration or via Powershell.

Although FIM allows you to filter objects on import in the connector configuration, it does not allow you to filter attribute values for a certain population. An example use case could be: "Import all mobile numbers from HR, but not the mobile numbers for person X, Y and Z". Reason for this could be that the X, Y and Z's numbers should not occur in the global address list or some other system where they can be viewed by others.

I authored a paper and presented a "brighttalk"
on the same topic: "Threat Centric IAM". Both the paper and the tech
talk was well received by at least 12+ CISO's I had met. Quite often they came
back to me with more people, process and governance related questions to this approach,
hence this blog entry.
