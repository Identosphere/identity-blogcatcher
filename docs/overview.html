This looks incredibly useful. Run &quot;python -m trustme&quot; and it will create three files for you: server.pem, server.key and a client.pem client certificate, providing a certificate for &quot;localhost&quot; (or another host you spefict) using a fake certificate authority. Looks like it should be the easiest way to test TLS locally.

Litestream is a really exciting new piece of technology by Ben Johnson, who previously built BoltDB, the key-value store written in Go that is used by etcd. It adds replication to SQLite by running a process that converts the SQLite WAL log into a stream that can be saved to another folder or pushed to S3. The S3 option is particularly exciting - Ben estimates that keeping a full point-in-time recovery log of a high write SQLite database should cost in the order of a few do'>Why I Built Litestream</a>

Today, I&rsquo;d like to explain what the feature snowball method is, why you may (or may not) want to adopt it yourself, and how it&rsquo;s worked out for me in my own life.

Time is valuable. In fact, time is the single most valuable thing any of us have. That&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s so important not to waste time if you don&rsquo;t have to. Every second you waste working on something unnecessary is literally cannibalizing your life.

I love API services. It still feels magical each time I query an endpoint and get back some interesting data or cause some complicated functionality to occur.

I&rsquo;ve built my entire career (and hobbies) around API services. I&rsquo;ve only ever had one job (which only lasted several months) that wasn&rsquo;t focused on building or working with API services for other developers. To say I am heavily invested in developer services would be an understatement; it&rsquo;s essentially all I do.'>The Only Type of API Services I'll Use</a>

It has, as usual, been hot and cold here in Texas between the third Sunday of Advent and Epiphany.

To introduce the theme, I’ll point you to this recent bit of reporting by Amelia Tate of the New Statesman. Go ahead: click the link and read it. I’ll wait.

OK, you’re back?  That was pretty interesting, right?  What really caught my attention in Amelia’s story was this sentence:
