The &ldquo;feature snowball&rdquo;, as I like to call it, is a product and time management technique I&rsquo;ve been successfully implementing for the last 10 years or so. I&rsquo;ve used it across many personal projects, work projects, and consulting projects with great success.

Today, I&rsquo;d like to explain what the feature snowball method is, why you may (or may not) want to adopt it yourself, and how it&rsquo;s worked out for me in my own life.

But first, let me tell you a little bit'>The Feature Snowball</a>

I live in the bay area of the United States in a suburb of San Francisco. At the time of writing, I&rsquo;ve been in isolation from the world for roughly 3 weeks, with no clear end in sight.

And while the stock market is currently doing unusually well, there&rsquo;s no question in my mind that the coronavirus pandemic is going to cause a lot of financial hardship for just about everyone over these next few years.

Millions of Americans have already lost their jobs, many businesses have alread'>Defensive Finance in a Downturn</a>

Time is valuable. In fact, time is the single most valuable thing any of us have. That&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s so important not to waste time if you don&rsquo;t have to. Every second you waste working on something unnecessary is literally cannibalizing your life.

Over the span of my professional career, I&rsquo;ve spent the vast majority of my time building developer services at small companies (including my own). I&rsquo;ve also had the opportunity to meet, work with, and advise other'>Don't Waste Time Getting Feedback</a>

I love API services. It still feels magical each time I query an endpoint and get back some interesting data or cause some complicated functionality to occur.

I&rsquo;ve built my entire career (and hobbies) around API services. I&rsquo;ve only ever had one job (which only lasted several months) that wasn&rsquo;t focused on building or working with API services for other developers. To say I am heavily invested in developer services would be an understatement; it&rsquo;s essentially all I do.'>The Only Type of API Services I'll Use</a>
