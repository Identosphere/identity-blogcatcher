This is such a good idea: keep a 8GB empty spacer.img file on any servers you operate, purely so that if the server runs out of space you can delete the file and get some breathing room for getting everything else working again. I&#x27;ve had servers run out of space in the past and it&#x27;s an absolute pain to sort out - this trick would have really helped.

The &ldquo;feature snowball&rdquo;, as I like to call it, is a product and time management technique I&rsquo;ve been successfully implementing for the last 10 years or so. I&rsquo;ve used it across many personal projects, work projects, and consulting projects with great success.

Today, I&rsquo;d like to explain what the feature snowball method is, why you may (or may not) want to adopt it yourself, and how it&rsquo;s worked out for me in my own life.

Time is valuable. In fact, time is the single most valuable thing any of us have. That&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s so important not to waste time if you don&rsquo;t have to. Every second you waste working on something unnecessary is literally cannibalizing your life.

I love API services. It still feels magical each time I query an endpoint and get back some interesting data or cause some complicated functionality to occur.

I&rsquo;ve built my entire career (and hobbies) around API services. I&rsquo;ve only ever had one job (which only lasted several months) that wasn&rsquo;t focused on building or working with API services for other developers. To say I am heavily invested in developer services would be an understatement; it&rsquo;s essentially all I do.'>The Only Type of API Services I'll Use</a>
