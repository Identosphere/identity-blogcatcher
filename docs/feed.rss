      <link>https://damienbod.com/2025/05/26/revisiting-using-a-content-security-policy-csp-nonce-in-blazor/</link>
      <description>This blog looks at implementing a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) in web applications implemented using Blazor and ASP.NET Core. When implementing CSP, I always recommend using a CSP nonce or at least CSP hashes. If a technical stack does not support CSP nonces, you should probably avoid using this solution when implementing secure and […]</description>

      <description> AI Hallucination Cases 
Damien Charlotin maintains this database of cases around the world where a legal decision has been made that confirms hallucinated content from generative AI was presented by a lawyer. 
 That's an important distinction: this isn't just cases where AI may have been used, it's cases where a lawyer was caught in the act and (usually) disciplined for it.

      <description>Ten years ago this week, in May 2015, the JSON Web Token (JWT) became RFC 7519. This was the culmination of a 4.5 year journey to create a simple JSON-based security token format and underlying JSON-based cryptographic standards. The full set of RFCs published together was: RFC 7515: JSON Web Signature (JWS) RFC 7516: JSON […]</description>

      <description> Anthropic publish most of the system prompts for their chat models as part of their release notes. They recently shared the new prompts for both Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4. I enjoyed digging through the prompts, since they act as a sort of unofficial manual for how best to use these tools. Here are my highlights, including a dive into the leaked tool prompts that Anthropic didn't publish th</description>

Direct link to a PDF on Anthropic's CDN because they don't appear to have a landing page anywhere for this document. 
 Anthropic's system cards are always worth a look, and this one for the new Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 has some particularly spicy notes. It's also 120 pages long - nearly three times the length of the system card for Claude 3.7 Sonnet!

Really neat CLI tool for bulk renaming of files and directories by Ayooluwa Isaiah, written in Go and designed to work cross-platform. 
 There's a lot of great design in this. Basic usage is intuitive - here's how to rename all .svg files to .tmp.svg in the current directory: 
 f2 -f '.svg' -r '.tmp.svg' path/to/dir
 
 f2 defaults to a dry run which looks like this:

      <description> I published 🔗 Why Design Matters a few days ago tying the Ives/Collinson interview to some of the stuff I rattle on about. 
 I also referenced hesitations I have about Altman. 
 Today I watched the Ives/Altman video after that multi-billion … 
 
 acquisition (as Altman calls it) 
 merger (as Ives calls it) 
 
 As I added to that piece just this morning:

      <description> If your library doesn't have any documentation, it can't have any bugs. 
 Documentation specifies what your code is supposed to do. Your tests specify what it actually does. 
 Bugs exist when your test-enforced implementation fails to match the behavior described in your documentation.  Without documentation a bug is just undefined behavior. 
 If you aim to follow semantic versioning you bump your</description>

      <description> llm-pdf-to-images 
Inspired by my previous llm-video-frames plugin, I thought it would be neat to have a plugin for LLM that can take a PDF and turn that into an image-per-page so you can feed PDFs into models that support image inputs but don't yet support PDFs. 
 This should now do exactly that: 
  llm install llm-pdf-to-images
llm -f pdf-to-images:path/to/document.pdf 'Summarize this document' </description>

      <description> Activitypub addresses the problem of participating in a decentralized social network with a low barrier to entry. You participate through the server you have joined but often times the people you want to interact with reside on other servers. For instance, if you want to follow a friend, visiting that friend’s url does not provide a simple follow button.  That simple follow button is on your own s</description>

Ollama announced a complete overhaul of their vision support the other day. Here's the first new model they've shipped since then - a packaged version of Qwen 2.5 VL which was first released on January 26th 2025. Here are my notes from that release.

 The Vatican has had more Popes than the total number of years that ‘Merica has even existed .. Finally? 
 About 20% of ‘Merica refer to themselves as Catholics .. Finally? 
 It’s close to 1,000 years since a Pope hailed from the UK … Finally?

 [Patricia Cohen in The New York Times]  This was inevitable:   &quot;As President Trump cuts billions of federal dollars from science institutes and universities, restricts what can be studied and pushes out immigrants, rival nations are hoping to pick up talent that has been cast aside or become disenchanted.&quot;   Salaries are lower in Europe, but quality of life is far higher - and,</description>

 [Joint Subreddit statement posted on r/AskHistorians]  30 or so Reddit communities have joined together to make a joint statement in defense of US research.

One of the things that most people in the Identity field know about
me is that I am a huge fan of Virtual Directory Services (VDS). But
it’s possible this is starting to

 [Toby Buckle at LiberalCurrents]  This resonates for me too.

 I earn 5-10X what I did when I lived in the UK, but my quality of life is markedly worse. My whole thing boils down to: how can America have the same standard of living I grew up with?  For a lot of people, the idea of prosperity boils down to, “I can buy what I want,” not, “I can live how I want.” The latter is the one that matters: that’s what freedom actually is.

      <description>Permit.io just published the results of a survey they conducted with over 200 developers on access control. There's lots of good data there, but one thing that struck me is that over 50% of developers said that they've never used any of the popular policy languages. I was wondering why that could be and came up with a few reasons why policy languages often feel foreign and frustrating:</description>

      <description>This post looks at customizing the sign-in UI and the sign-in options in an ASP.NET Core application using Duende IdentityServer and ASP.NET Core Identity. There are multiple ways of changing the look and feel of the UI for different OpenID Connect clients or different client flows. Code: https://github.com/damienbod/duende-multi-tenant Blogs in the series Setup The solution […]</description>

      <description>Kim Cameron first told me what Digital Identity is on February 1, 2005. He said that the Internet was created without an identity layer. He encouraged me “You should come help build it with me.” I’ve been at it ever since! What I wrote about digital identity a decade ago remains as true today: An […]</description>

 Deadly D.C. Plane Crash Comes Months After Congress Ignored Warning About Traffic at Reagan Airport 

 As the new administration is playing stupid games, yesterday morning, prior to yesterday’s aviation disaster, professor Thomas Schaller cautioned:
 

 
   An FAA employee I know confirms agency already lacks sufficient air traffic controllers. The so-called “buyouts” and other attacks on federa</description>

      <description> My first attempt at building a decentralized app in this day and age will use Solid Pods and DIDs. The goal? A super simple “BooksWeLike” app—a place where I can review books and see what my friends are reading and enjoying.     What makes this app different is how it handles data. Unlike traditional apps where data lives in a centralized database, my app will let users store their own data in Sol</description>

      <description>I took notes on Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz’s post-election discussion of their Fairshake pro-crypto Pac and the coming Trump presidency about two months ago, but set them aside and other topics took precedence. Given the rising craziness in the crypto space around the inauguration, I thought it was a good time to put them [...]</description>

      <description>In this video I draw connections between Gestalt theory and organizational development as applied to digital groupthink in the context of Christiana Figueres, a leader in the development of carbon trading, who trained at the Gestalt Institute of Cleveland. As a young woman, she attended Swarthmore College, a Quaker institution. The first wife of her [...]</description>

      <description>Perhaps, even though they are not themselves explainable, AIs can help us engineer explainable systems. But I’m not optimistic. It feels like we’re on a path to keep making systems harder for humans to configure, and we keep expanding our reliance on superhuman intelligence to do that for us.

      <description> Part 2: Issuing&amp;nbsp;Badges  In part one of this series, we discussed how the trust model of Open Badges 3.0 differs from earlier versions.

      <description> In this post, I cover using LlamaIndex LlamaParse in auto mode to parse a PDF page containing a table, using a Hugging Face local embedding model, and using local Llama 3.1 8b via Ollama to perform naive Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

 As I just registered for a new season of beer league hockey starting this weekend, I thought about an episode of C’est comme ça que je t’aime I recently watched which is set in 1974 Sainte-Foy, Quebec City.  Nearly all the 1974 Quebec cultural references are new to me and in this episode, there is an adventure in a hockey arena and you can pause the video in a few places and see signage in the</description>
