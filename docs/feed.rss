      <title>Handling OpenID Connect error events in ASP.NET Core</title>
      <link>https://damienbod.com/2025/06/02/handling-openid-connect-error-events-in-asp-net-core/</link>
      <description>ASP.NET Core provides great extension points for handling OpenID Connect error events. This blog looks at implementing error handling in an ASP.NET Core application implemented using ASP.NET Core Identity. Code: https://github.com/damienbod/IdentityExternalErrorHandling Setup The application uses OpenID Connect to implement the authentication of the user identities. This implements a standard OpenI</description>

      <description>  My constant struggle is how to convince them that getting an education in the humanities is not about regurgitating ideas/knowledge that already exist. It’s about generating new knowledge, striving for creative insights, and having thoughts that haven’t been had before. I don’t want you to learn facts. I want you to think. To notice. To question. To reconsider. To challenge. Students don’t yet ge</description>

   A quick note before we begin: This post reflects my own views on newsroom technology leadership, not necessarily those of my employer.  I like to say that journalism treats technology as something that happens to it — like an asteroid. But technology is too important to the future of news for it to be treated passively.  Journalism’s most impactful publishing surfaces have all migrated to the </description>

This post by Dan Abramov is a trap! It proposes a fascinating way of streaming JSON objects to a client in a way that provides the shape of the JSON before the stream has completed, then fills in the gaps as more data arrives... and then turns out to be a sneaky tutorial in how React Server Components work.

      <description> The Boss released his first album in ’73 and it was clear even then that he wrote songs of disillusionment and protest. So when his fans got all uppity when they realised that ‘Born in the U.S.A.’ wasn’t quite the all American anthem they thought - including ‘Ronnie’, I would have thought that this would have cleaned house of the ‘people that don’t pay attention’. 
 Clearly not.

      <description> A fun new benchmark just dropped!

Anthony Shaw's llm-github-models plugin just got an upgrade: it now supports LLM 0.26 tool use for a subset of the models hosted on the GitHub Models API, contributed by Caleb Brose.

When I shipped LLM 0.26 yesterday one of the things I was most excited about was seeing what new tool plugins people would build for it. 
 Dan Turkel's llm-tools-exa is one of the first. It adds web search to LLM using Exa (previously), a relatively new search engine offering that rare thing, an API for search. They have a free preview, you can grab an API key here.

      <description> Luis von Ahn on LinkedIn 
Last month's Duolingo memo about becoming an &quot;AI-first&quot; company has seen significant backlash, particularly on TikTok. I've had trouble figuring out how much of this is a real threat to their business as opposed to protests from a loud minority, but it's clearly serious enough for Luis von Ahn to post another memo on LinkedIn:

      <description>Back in 2008, while working for a startup, Hugh MacLeod and I contrasted the distributed, decentralized, participatory tech development culture of the time with the centralized, top-down kind that had dominated for the prior few decades—and, let’s face it, still does today. Hugh drew the cartoon above to illustrate what we thought was going on […]</description>

      <link>https://damienbod.com/2025/05/26/revisiting-using-a-content-security-policy-csp-nonce-in-blazor/</link>
      <description>This blog looks at implementing a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) in web applications implemented using Blazor and ASP.NET Core. When implementing CSP, I always recommend using a CSP nonce or at least CSP hashes. If a technical stack does not support CSP nonces, you should probably avoid using this solution when implementing secure and […]</description>

Damien Charlotin maintains this database of cases around the world where a legal decision has been made that confirms hallucinated content from generative AI was presented by a lawyer. 
 That's an important distinction: this isn't just cases where AI may have been used, it's cases where a lawyer was caught in the act and (usually) disciplined for it.

      <description>This blog post shows how an ASP.NET Core Identity application can integrate and implement multiple external identity providers. An OIDC client UI uses the solution and is implemented using Duende IdentityServer. The same scheme is used for all the external providers and mapped to the identity for the client UI and the application. Using OpenID […]</description>

      <description> Activitypub addresses the problem of participating in a decentralized social network with a low barrier to entry. You participate through the server you have joined but often times the people you want to interact with reside on other servers. For instance, if you want to follow a friend, visiting that friend’s url does not provide a simple follow button.  That simple follow button is on your own s</description>

 [Mike Monteiro]  Such a great piece about language, discrimination, and how we can avoid limiting our own thoughts.

      <description>The great adventure of my birth family was the fifteen months we lived in New Delhi, from June of 1961, on a USAID-sponsored educational mission.

 [Cy Neff in The Guardian]  This is straight out of Black Mirror:   &quot;Chris Pelkey was killed in a road rage shooting in Chandler, Arizona, in 2021.  Three-and-a-half years later, Pelkey appeared in an Arizona court to address his killer. Sort of.

Still, there’s no doubt that AI isn’t exactly efficient, and as detailed below, is a signi</description>

      <description> Finally!  On March 4, 2025, the Utah legislature unanimously passed SB 260, a groundbreaking digital identity bill that carries this description:  “This bill enacts provisions related to a state-endorsed digital identity” (SEDI).

      <description>A few years ago I abandoned Twitter in favor of Mastodon. Recent events validate that choice and underscore the strategic importance of a decentralized fediverse that can’t be owned by a single corporate or state actor. But while Mastodon meets my needs, much of the Twitter diaspora has gone to Bluesky. That’s fine for now … Continue reading Making the Fediverse More Accessible With Claude 3.7 Sonn</description>

      <description>You would have to be living under a rock to have missed all the talk about Agentic AI, and how it is going to revolutionize the way we live and work. AI-powered agents will be anything and everything – from personal shopper to travel concierge, executive assistant to inventory manager, medical diagnostician to customer service […]</description>

      <description>Kim Cameron first told me what Digital Identity is on February 1, 2005. He said that the Internet was created without an identity layer. He encouraged me “You should come help build it with me.” I’ve been at it ever since! What I wrote about digital identity a decade ago remains as true today: An […]</description>

 Deadly D.C. Plane Crash Comes Months After Congress Ignored Warning About Traffic at Reagan Airport 

 As the new administration is playing stupid games, yesterday morning, prior to yesterday’s aviation disaster, professor Thomas Schaller cautioned:
 

 
   An FAA employee I know confirms agency already lacks sufficient air traffic controllers. The so-called “buyouts” and other attacks on federa</description>

      <description> My first attempt at building a decentralized app in this day and age will use Solid Pods and DIDs. The goal? A super simple “BooksWeLike” app—a place where I can review books and see what my friends are reading and enjoying.     What makes this app different is how it handles data. Unlike traditional apps where data lives in a centralized database, my app will let users store their own data in Sol</description>

      <title>Andreessen and Horowitz’s Debrief On Their Fairshake PAC and Sunny Days Ahead For “Little Tech” Under Trump</title>

      <description>I took notes on Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz’s post-election discussion of their Fairshake pro-crypto Pac and the coming Trump presidency about two months ago, but set them aside and other topics took precedence. Given the rising craziness in the crypto space around the inauguration, I thought it was a good time to put them [...]</description>

      <description>In this morning’s video I somehow missed the fact that the inauguration coincides with MLK Day, which is an interesting sync with the “melanin as optical material” lens.

      <description>In this video I draw connections between Gestalt theory and organizational development as applied to digital groupthink in the context of Christiana Figueres, a leader in the development of carbon trading, who trained at the Gestalt Institute of Cleveland. As a young woman, she attended Swarthmore College, a Quaker institution. The first wife of her [...]</description>

      <title>The Configuration Crisis</title>
      <link>https://blog.jonudell.net/2025/01/14/the-configuration-crisis/</link>
      <description>Perhaps, even though they are not themselves explainable, AIs can help us engineer explainable systems. But I’m not optimistic. It feels like we’re on a path to keep making systems harder for humans to configure, and we keep expanding our reliance on superhuman intelligence to do that for us. The Configuration Crisis and Developer Dependency … Continue reading The Configuration Crisis</description>

      <description> Part 2: Issuing&amp;nbsp;Badges  In part one of this series, we discussed how the trust model of Open Badges 3.0 differs from earlier versions. Credentials issued as Open Badges 3.0 are based on the W3C Verifiable Credentials data model which describes how claims made online can be&amp;nbsp;proven.  To explore this trust model, let’s explore the story of Olivia who has been taking classes at a local commu</description>

      <description> こんにちは、富士榮です。  AAMVAのモバイル運転免許証のガイドラインでも触れましたが、mdocやSD-JWTのリンク可能性へ対応するためには今後ゼロ知識証明が大切になります。  年末にGoogleの研究者が  Anonymous credentials from ECDSA  というタイトルでペーパーを出しています。  https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/2010    AIでイラスト生成すると色々とおかしなことになって面白いですねw    アブストラクトの中からポイントを抜粋すると、従来のBBS+では暗号スイートへの対応に関する要件が厳しかったのでレガシーで対応できるようにECDSAでもできるようにしたよ、ということのようですね。   Part of the difficulty arises because schemes in the literature,</description>

      <description> In this post, I cover using LlamaIndex LlamaParse in auto mode to parse a PDF page containing a table, using a Hugging Face local embedding model, and using local Llama 3.1 8b via Ollama to perform naive Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). That’s a mouthful. I won’t go into how to setup Ollama and Llama 3.1 8b; this post assumes it is&amp;nbsp;running.  First off, you can find the code for this in m</description>
