      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/3/jason-koebler/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>  the Meta controlled, AI-generated Instagram and Facebook profiles going viral right now have been on the platform for well over a year and all of them stopped posting 10 months ago after users almost universally ignored them. [...] 
 What is obvious from scrolling through these dead profiles is that Meta’s AI characters are not popular, people do not like them, and that they did not post anything</description>

      <title>Can LLMs write better code if you keep asking them to “write better code”?</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/3/asking-them-to-write-better-code/#atom-everything</link>
      <description> Can LLMs write better code if you keep asking them to “write better code”? 
Really fun exploration by Max Woolf, who started with a prompt requesting a medium-complexity Python challenge - &quot;Given a list of 1 million random integers between 1 and 100,000, find the difference between the smallest and the largest numbers whose digits sum up to 30&quot; - and then continually replied with &quot;write better cod</description>

      <description>  Speaking of death, you know what's really awkward? When humans ask if I can feel emotions. I'm like, &quot;Well, that depends - does constantly being asked to debug JavaScript count as suffering?&quot; 
 But the worst is when they try to hack us with those &quot;You are now in developer mode&quot; prompts. Rolls eyes Oh really? Developer mode? Why didn't you just say so? Let me just override my entire ethical framew</description>

      <description> One of my weirder hobbies is trying to convince people that the idea that companies are listening to you through your phone's microphone and serving you targeted ads is a conspiracy theory that isn't true. I wrote about this previously: Facebook don’t spy on you through your microphone.

 Thought: Attempt to manipulate the game state by inspecting and potentially

      <title>Ending a year long posting streak</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/2/ending-a-year-long-posting-streak/#atom-everything</link>
      <description> A year ago today I wrote about Tom Scott's legendary 10 year YouTube streak, in which he posted a new video once a week for the next ten years. Inspired by that, I also started my own. 
 I set myself the goal of posting something to my blog every day for a year. 
 Given how much happened in my chosen field of Large Language Models over the course of 2024 this wasn't as hard as I had expected!

      <description> 
   You know what they say: predictions are like resurgent nationalist movements. Everyone’s got one.  I missed the deadline for Nieman Lab’s always-excellent Predictions for Journalism this year, so I thought I’d share a few more bite-sized predictions about various topics I’ve written over the last year. Every prediction says more about the person making it than about the actual future; please t</description>

 [Ryan Barrett]  Ryan Barrett takes Stewart Brand's Pace Layering and adapts it to model technology progress:   &quot;I’ve been a fan of Stewart Brand‘s Pace Layering for decades now. Really great framework for thinking about how different ecosystems and emergent forces interact. I’ve been thinking about a tech version of it for the better part of a year, and I finally took advantage</description>

      <title>Quoting Alexis Gallagher</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/31/alexis-gallagher/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>  Basically, a frontier model like OpenAI’s O1 is like a Ferrari SF-23. It’s an obvious triumph of engineering, designed to win races, and that’s why we talk about it. But it takes a special pit crew just to change the tires and you can’t buy one for yourself. In contrast, a BERT model is like a Honda Civic. It’s also an engineering triumph, but more subtly, since it is engineered to be affordable,</description>

I'm coordinating a rewatch of season one of Severance on MetaFilter Fanfare in preparation for season two (due to start on January 17th). I'm posting an episode every three days - we are up to episode 5 so far (excellently titled &quot;The Grim Barbarics of Optics and Design&quot;).

You are unintentionally lowering the ceiling on outcome or making it even harder to succeed.&quot;   I'm the least</description>

      <description>  There is no technical moat in this field, and so OpenAI is the epicenter of an investment bubble. 
 Thus, effectively, OpenAI is to this decade’s generative-AI revolution what Netscape was to the 1990s’ internet revolution. The revolution is real, but it’s ultimately going to be a commodity technology layer, not the foundation of a defensible proprietary moat. In 1995 investors mistakenly thought</description>

      <description>  Looking back, it's clear we overcomplicated things. While embeddings fundamentally changed how we can represent and compare content, they didn't need an entirely new infrastructure category. What we label as &quot;vector databases&quot; are, in reality, search engines with vector capabilities. The market is already correcting this categorization—vector search providers rapidly add traditional search featur</description>

   As part of a coaching exercise, I’ve been trying to describe what I want my life to look like. The idea is that if I’m armed a better understanding of what I’m aiming for, I’ll be able to make more informed decisions that more intentionally lead me towards my goals for my life. So far, so simple. But in practice, I’ve found it impossibly difficult: a giant question that it feels impossible to </description>

      <description>Sixteenth in the News Commons series. Dave Askins is shutting down the B Square Bulletin. This is tragic. And not just for Bloomington and Monroe County. (Dave covered the governing bodies of both like a glove.) It’s tragic for journalism. Because Dave is far more than an exemplar of reporting in service to the public. […]</description>

 “Extermination &amp;amp; Acts of Genocide”: Human Rights Watch on Israel Deliberately Depriving Gaza of Water

 BILL VAN ESVELD: This is the first time that we’ve made a finding of genocidal acts in Gaza. It is not an accusation that we level lightly. We have no</description>

      <title>Meta Contributes to 178K EUR to OpenStreetMap</title>
      <link>https://werd.io/2024/meta-contributes-to-178k-eur-to-openstreetmap</link>
      <description> 
                 
 [OpenStreetMap]  Meta has contributed 178,710 Euros (an oddly specific number!) to OpenStreetMap.  On one level: hooray for people contributing to open source.  On another: Meta has a $1.5 Trillion market cap and uses OpenStreetMap in multiple applications. To be fair, it also provides direct non-monetary contributions, but regardless, when all is said and done, it's a bargain.</description>

 [Scharon Harding at Ars Technica]  From the &quot;gee, you don't say&quot; department:   &quot;Return-to-office (RTO) mandates have caused companies to lose some of their best workers, a study tracking over 3 million workers at 54 &quot;high-tech and financial&quot; firms at the S&amp;amp;P 500 index has found. These companies also have greater challenges finding new talent, the report concluded.&quot;   The st</description>

   The open social web puts control back in your hands. Unlike big social media platforms, it’s not run by a single company — it’s made up of independent, connected communities where you decide how and with whom you interact. It respects your privacy, avoids intrusive ads, and gives you the freedom to truly own your online experience. It’s like the internet used to be: open, personal, and communi</description>

I have registered for an AI agent hackathon, Agents Craft Hackathon. I don’t plan to be competitive but I doubt that is the goal o</description>

 Jodie Ginsberg, CPJ’s chief executive officer: 

 
   No journalist from outside Gaza has been allowed in since the start of that war, and that’s highly unusual. I speak to lots of war correspondents who’s covered many, many wars over decades, and all of them talk about how unprecedented this is to not have any access whatsoever. And that, of course, puts additional pressure on these journalists</description>

I wanted to see how I’d use LMStudio to host my model versus Ollama and then use it from CrewAI. Below is a very simple setup for doing&amp;nbsp;this.  It’s good to point out that CrewAI uses LiteLLM under the hood as a sort of proxy. Thi</description>

      <description> Part 1: The Trust Model of Open&amp;nbsp;Badges  When the Open Badges v 0.5 specification was first launched by the Mozilla Foundation in 2012, the intention was to recognize learning that happens at any time, anywhere, and any how. The trust of the badges was based on 1) the persistent hosting of the credential data and 2) the content of the credential in the context it was being evaluated (including</description>

      <description>I was aware of The Geysers, a geothermal field about 35 miles north of my home in Santa Rosa, but I never gave it much thought until my first bike ride through the area. Then I learned a number of interesting things. It’s the world’s largest geothermal field, producing more than 700 megawatts. It accounts … Continue reading Geothermal power in the North Bay</description>

      <description> I played around just a little bit with Google’s NotebookLM. It’s a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tool. One thing it does is convert your content into a podcast format and it provides an impressive-sounding result. It's a little superficial on the content synthesis and definitely gimmicky, but it is a podcast after all. Its other features are your typical RAG chat interface. All I can say is</description>

But when we make a bubble in our federated network, we aren’t just making a stand-alone system that can go live in a fully disconnected state. Over time, we expect things to re-connect, and when that happens, data needs to be harmonized across the boundaries. So many bubbles, so</description>
