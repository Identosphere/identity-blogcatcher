      <description> Vision Language Models (Better, Faster, Stronger) 
Extremely useful review of the last year in vision and multi-modal LLMs. 
 So much has happened! I'm particularly excited about the range of small open weight vision models that are now available. Models like gemma3-4b-it and Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct produce very impressive results and run happily on mid-range consumer hardware.

One of the things that most people in the Identity field know about
me is that I am a huge fan of Virtual Directory Services (VDS). But
it‚Äôs possible this is starting to
change. It‚Äôs also entirely
possible that working with the technologies at Ping Identity every

 [Toby Buckle at LiberalCurrents]  This resonates for me too.

 I earn 5-10X what I did when I lived in the UK, but my quality of life is markedly worse. My whole thing boils down to: how can America have the same standard of living I grew up with?  For a lot of people, the idea of prosperity boils down to, ‚ÄúI can buy what I want,‚Äù not, ‚ÄúI can live how I want.‚Äù The latter is the one that matters: that‚Äôs what freedom actually is.
