      <description> The many, many, many JavaScript runtimes of the last decade 
Extraordinary piece of writing by Jamie Birch who spent over a year putting together this comprehensive reference to JavaScript runtimes. It covers everything from Node.js, Deno, Electron, AWS Lambda, Cloudflare Workers and Bun all the way to much smaller projects idea like dukluv and txiki.js.

      <description> TIL: Exception.add_note 
Neat tip from Danny Roy Greenfeld: Python 3.11 added a .add_note(message: str) method to the BaseException class, which means you can add one or more extra notes to any Python exception and they'll be displayed in the stacktrace! 
 Here's PEP 678 – Enriching Exceptions with Notes by Zac Hatfield-Dodds proposing the new feature back in 2021.

In this post I reverse engineer Spark and explore its fascinating system prompt in detail.

      <description> Qwen3-Coder: Agentic Coding in the World 
It turns out that as I was typing up my notes on Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 the Qwen team were unleashing something much bigger: 
 
 Today, we’re announcing Qwen3-Coder, our most agentic code model to date. Qwen3-Coder is available in multiple sizes, but we’re excited to introduce its most powerful variant first: Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct — a 480B-</description>

      <description> Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 
Significant new model release from Qwen, published yesterday without much fanfare. (Update: probably because they were cooking the much larger Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct which they released just now.) 
 This is a follow-up to their April release of the full Qwen 3 model family, which included a Qwen3-235B-A22B model which could handle both reasoning and non-</description>

      <description> Subliminal Learning: Language Models Transmit Behavioral Traits via Hidden Signals in Data 
This new alignment paper from Anthropic wins my prize for best illustrative figure so far this year:

      <description>  An AI tool that gets gold on the IMO is obviously immensely impressive. Does it mean math is “solved”? Is an AI-generated proof of the Riemann hypothesis clearly on the horizon? Obviously not. 
 Worth keeping timescales in mind here: IMO competitors spend an average of 1.5 hrs on each problem. High-quality math research, by contrast, takes month or years.

Yet many of these new programmers are not even aware that programming communities and conferences exist.</description>

      <description>  There’s a bigger opportunity in computer science and programming (academically conveyed or self-taught) now than ever before, by far, in my opinion. The move to AI is like replacing shovels with bulldozers. Every business will benefit from this and they’ll need people to do it.

      <description>I’m making this brief post primarily as a placeholder for the photographs I took yesterday of the collection of Caddo pottery at Henderson State College in Arkadelphia, AR. The collection of artifacts, donated by the Hodges family to the school, is impressive and well worth a day trip. It contains powerful energies. Look to the [...]</description>

      <description>In the mid-1990s you could create useful software without being an ace coder. You had Visual Basic, you had a rich ecosystem of components, you could wire them together to create apps, standing on the shoulders of the coders who built those components. If you’re younger than 45 you may not know what that was … Continue reading Introducing XMLUI</description>

      <description> A few months ago I added a tool to my blog for bulk-applying tags to old content. It works as an extension to my existing search interface, letting me run searches and then quickly apply a tag to relevant results. 
 Since adding this I've been much more aggressive in categorizing my older content, including adding new tags when I spot an interesting trend that warrants its own page.

      <description>  So one of my favorite things to do is give my coding agents more and more permissions and freedom, just to see how far I can push their productivity without going too far off the rails. It's a delicate balance. I haven't given them direct access to my bank account yet. But I did give one access to my Google Cloud production instances and systems.

Fast forward just 7 years and ‘a chip’ company hitting 4 trillion barely registers surprise.

      <description> Making Open Badges Portable&amp;nbsp;Again  One of the advantages of credentials issued as W3C Verifiable Credentials and Open Badges 3.0 is their ability to allow individuals to choose where they store their credentials and exercise control over how they are shared and whether or not that sharing is tracked. To be Open Badges 3.0 compliant, platforms must make it possible for the credentials to be po</description>

      <description>If AI slop is the GIGO result from a model consuming the raw, unfiltered mess that is the Internet, then AI poisoning is what happens when someone or something slips poison into the mix. It intentionally corrupts an AI model's training data to control, disrupt, or degrade its performance.</description>

 “The Orb” is popping up in all sorts of places, most recently in
Time magazine’s “The Orb Will See You Now”.
It’s being heralded as everything from the one and final solution for privacy-protecting
digital identity online, to a civil liberties nightmare, to an indispensable tool for
preventing an AI takeover, to a quick way to make $42, and more. 
 But what it actually does and how it w</description>

      <description> Activitypub addresses the problem of participating in a decentralized social network with a low barrier to entry. You participate through the server you have joined but often times the people you want to interact with reside on other servers. For instance, if you want to follow a friend, visiting that friend’s url does not provide a simple follow button.  That simple follow button is on your own s</description>

of my preference for Identity Management Programs over one-off Projects.&amp;nbsp; The fact is, one might consider that a proper

      <description> Right now, many folks are excited about the prospect of agentic AI: intelligent computer systems that can access your stuff and do useful things for you, all without you having to program them to do it. But in order for that to happen, these bots need a way to actually go and do things. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) was recently proposed as a common interface for agents to get access to service</description>

      <description> Sometimes a situation is so absurd, or even so dangerous, you gotta make fun of it to keep from getting too bothered.  Unfortunately, surveillance-enabled digital identity systems are springing up around the world in societies that have traditionally shunned such privacy-invasive things, like the U.S., EU, U.K., and Australia. The biggest problem is the “phone home” that’s a standard capability — </description>

      <description>I’m thrilled to be able to report that, from now on, only fully-specified algorithms will be registered for JOSE and COSE. Furthermore, fully-specified signature algorithms are now registered to replace the previously registered polymorphic algorithms, which are now deprecated. For example, you can now use Ed25519 and Ed448 instead of the ambiguous EdDSA. The new […]</description>

The client credentials flow is an OAuth 2.0 authorization grant type used for machine-to-machine authentication. DPoP further strengthens the security by ensuring that the client possesses a specific key at the time of the request, forcing […]</description>

      <title>Why Do Policy Languages Feel So Hard?</title>
      <link>https://www.technometria.com/p/why-do-policy-languages-feel-so-hard</link>

      <link>https://damienbod.com/2025/03/03/implement-phone-verification-2fa-using-asp-net-core-identity/</link>
      <description>This post shows how to implement phone (SMS) verification and two-factor authentication (2FA) using ASP.NET Core Identity.
