Not bad - but the classics are definitely not improved .. like the original 🔗 🎵 Nothing Rhymed .. always a place in my heart for this one.

      <description> Building an automatically updating live blog in Django 
Here's an extended write-up of how I implemented the live blog feature I used for my coverage of OpenAI DevDay yesterday. I built the first version using Claude while waiting for the keynote to start, then upgraded it during the lunch break with the help of GPT-4o to add sort options and incremental fetching of new updates.

      <description>  I listened to the whole 15-minute podcast this morning. It was, indeed, surprisingly effective. It remains somewhere in the uncanny valley, but not at all in a creepy way. Just more in a “this is a bit vapid and phony” way. [...] But ultimately the conversation has all the flavor of a bowl of unseasoned white rice.   — John Gruber

      <description> Audio Overview is a fun new feature of Google's NotebookLM which is getting a lot of attention right now. It generates a one-off custom podcast against content you provide, where two AI hosts start up a “deep dive” discussion about the collected content. These last around ten minutes and are very podcast, with an astonishingly convincing audio back-and-forth conversation.

      <description> Ensuring a block is overridden in a Django template 
Neat Django trick by Tom Carrick: implement a Django template tag that raises a custom exception, then you can use this pattern in your templates: 
 {% block title %}{% ensure_overridden %}{% endblock %}
 
 To ensure you don't accidentally extend a base template but forget to fill out a critical block.

 We’ve been dealing with some intense family health events since Wednesday night, so I’m running on very little sleep and not updating much over here. I’ll be popping in from time to time, but probably not running on all cylinders for a little while.  There’s a lot to say — about WordPress, about the independent web, about media, about some of the conversations coming out of ONA — but they will n</description>

Julia Evans on writing small, self-contained web applications in Go:

 The hook only works for Django apps that are served using ASGI. It allows plugins to add their own wrapping ASGI middleware around the Django app itself, which means the</description>

      <description>こんにちは、富士榮です。    先日、「選択的情報開示とウォレットと本人確認書類」というタイトルで投稿しました。  https://idmlab.eidentity.jp/2024/08/blog-post_28.html        内容としては、本人確認書類をデジタル化するならば選択的情報開示を含めデジタル化をすることによるメリットがちゃんと見えるようにならないといけないよね〜という話だったわけですが、昨日も触れたGoogle Walletの記事には今後のロードマップが明示されています。     How we're working to make digital identity a reality for everyone  https://blog.google/products/google-pay/google-wallet-digital-id-privacy-securit</description>

      <description> Recently, I have been working on programming small modules for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using Open AI. Also recently, I did a Coursera class on advanced RAG and have taken in several videos and posts on it. I have used samples from those sources and tested using various LLMs to generate simple Python to perform RAG with Open AI. In general&amp;nbsp;, I have been disappointed with the outco</description>

      <title>Google Walletへ搭載できる証明書</title>
      <link>https://idmlab.eidentity.jp/2024/09/google-wallet.html</link>
      <description>こんにちは、富士榮です。    Gogole Walletへの米国パスポートの搭載が先日発表されましたね。  崎村さんがGoogleのアナウンスについてポストされているのでこちらを見ると良いと思います。  https://www.sakimura.org/2024/09/6359/     簡単にいうと、米国のパスポートをGoogle Walletへ格納することができるいう話で、現在はまだ紙のパスポートと併用、かつTSAチェックでしか使えないが、将来的にはもっと使える場所の拡大をしていこう、としているという話です。     日本でも早く使えるようになるといいですねぇ。  まだ、日本では決済以外だとイベントのチケットや航空券やポイントカードなどが搭載できるくらいですし。     日本で追加できるのは    支払いカード  ポイントカード  ギフトカード  写真   の４カテゴリ。       </description>

      <description>こんにちは、富士榮です。    昨日（US東海岸の時間で9/9）はSIDI HubのワシントンD.C.会合に参加してきました。  2024年のゴールである11月のリオデジャネイロに向けたワールドツアー（？）の3回目の会合です。そして、来月10月の東京会合に向けた諸々調整事項もあり参加必須ということで参加してきました。     そんなこんなでメインアジェンダとは別でサイドミーティングがてんこ盛りで充実した1日だったわけですが、軽く振り返ります。     アジェンダはこんな感じでした。     例によっていろんな人と話をしないといけないDinnerという名前でほぼ何も食べられない立ち話はありますが、それを含め充実した1日です。詰め込み過ぎなくらいです。     基本スタイルは各セッションオーナーが燃料投下として小ネタを話し、そこからフルでディスカッションという流れなので容赦ないです。     全</description>

      <description> こんにちは、富士榮です。  いよいよ今週はワシントンD.C.で今年3回目のSIDI Hubサミットが開催されます。  この次は10月の東京、そして最終ゴールであるG20会合に向けたリオデジャネイロ会合が11月に控えます。        そろそろケープタウン会合のレポートも読み終えておきたいところですので、進めていきます。今回は相互運用に向けた最低限の要求事項のセッションです。     まず、グローバルで相互運用性を確保するためには、もちろん世界中の全ての組織やシステムが統一された標準をサポートすることがベストなわけですが、現実はそう甘くはないわけです。そうなると、実装パターンは以下の3つに集約されることになる、とSIDI Hubでは仮説を立てています。    発行者とリライングパーティが複数のプロトコルを実装する  プロトコル変換を行うレイヤーを用意する  プロキシを配置する   2番目と</description>

But when we make a bubble in our federated network, we aren’t just making a stand-alone system that can go live in a fully disconnected state. Over time, we expect things to re-connect, and when that happens, data needs to be harmonized across the boundaries. So many bubbles, so</description>

      <description>“Communities that want to build comprehensive public calendars will be able to do so using a hybrid approach that blends existing iCalendar feeds with feeds synthesized from web calendars. It’s not a perfect solution, but with LLM assistance it’s a workable one. And who knows, maybe if people see what’s possible when information silos converge, … Continue reading Revisiting the Elm City project</description>

collaborator
Kaliya aka IdentityWoman and I ran a session titled: 
 “Envisioning the future: what if a single, decentralized, interoperable, open social network indeed emerges and wins over the proprietary platforms?” 
 We did something that, at least for me, was new. We started with:

      <description>When should a Postgres extension be pre-loaded and when should it not?
Should it be loaded in user sessions or at server startup? For the Tembo

      <description>A ChatGPT generated image I decided to do some retrieval augmented generation(RAG) with Llama 3.1 8B to see how it went. In short, it went pretty well with my limited testing. More interesting is probably how I set it up to perform the&amp;nbsp;RAG.  First, I didn’t want to reinvent the wheel. Not yet. I was looing for a way to provide RAG with Llama 3.1 without coding up a user interface for embedding</description>

 Several years back, I started a journaling habit, and since then, most of my writing energy has been redirected from my website to my private journal.

      <description> I started a load of Llama 3.1 8B onto my local machine. It’s not the beefiest model but is the model that I could support on my aging machine and GPU. I have not yet had time to play with it but this is step one of a multi step experiment.  It took me less than 30 minutes to get up and running and that is an estimate on the far end. The bulk of that time was deciding if a specific tool was support</description>

      <description> One of the key aspects to the bubbles model for federated identity systems is the fact that within the bubble, the account for each user is fully authoritative for that space. But since bubbles don’t exist in a vacuum, that same person probably has accounts that exist in other bubbles. In fact, the attributes in their account probably came from somewhere else to begin with. And of course, our bubb</description>
