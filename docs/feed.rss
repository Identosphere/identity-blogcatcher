Gail was a merchant mariner during World War II (when the casualty rate was one in twenty-six, higher than any U.S. military branch), at the end of which he met Bernadette […]</description>

 The full collection can be browsed on Hugging Face. The smallest available model is the 0.6B Q8 one, which is available as a 639MB GGUF. I tried it out using my llm-sentence-transformers plugin like this:

      <title>Comma v0.1 1T and 2T - 7B LLMs trained on openly licensed text</title>

      <description> It's been a long time coming, but we finally have some promising LLMs to try out which are trained entirely on openly licensed text! 
 EleutherAI released the Pile four and a half years ago: &quot;an 800GB dataset of diverse text for language modeling&quot;. It's been used as the basis for many LLMs since then, but much of the data in it came from Common Crawl - a crawl of the public web which mostly ignore</description>

      <description>  For [Natasha] Lyonne, the draw of AI isn’t speed or scale — it’s independence. “I’m not trying to run a tech company,” she told me. “It’s more that I’m a filmmaker who doesn’t want the tech people deciding the future of the medium.” She imagines a future in which indie filmmakers can use AI tools to reclaim authorship from studios and avoid the compromises that come with chasing funding in a brok</description>

      <title>The last six months in LLMs, illustrated by pelicans on bicycles</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/6/six-months-in-llms/#atom-everything</link>
      <description> I presented an invited keynote at the AI Engineer World's Fair in San Francisco this week. This is my third time speaking at the event - here are my talks from October 2023 and June 2024. My topic this time was &quot;The last six months in LLMs&quot; - originally planned as the last year, but so much has happened that I had to reduce my scope!

   I can’t help myself. I’ve loved every moment of the rebooted Doctor Who on Disney+, but it appears to have hit a bit of a pause while Disney considers whether to renew its co-production.

      <description> PR #537: Fix Markdown in og descriptions 
Since OpenAI Codex is now available to us ChatGPT Plus subscribers I decided to try it out against my blog. 
 It's a very nice implementation of the GitHub-connected coding &quot;agent&quot; pattern, as also seen in Google's Jules and Microsoft's Copilot Coding Agent. 
 First I had to configure an environment for it. My Django blog uses PostgreSQL which isn't part o</description>

Anthony Lewis published this neat, concise tutorial on using my LLM tool to run local models on your own machine, using llm-mlx. 
 An under-appreciated way to contribute to open source projects is to publish unofficial guides like this one. Always brightens my day when something like this shows up.

preventing an AI takeover, to a quick way to make $42, and more.

      <description>Finals thoughts. I'm a lifelong Knicks fan who felt that the Knicks and the Pacers are (or were) so evenly matched that the difference would be coaching. And that's why I thought the Knicks would win game six in Indianapolis last night, and close the series with game seven in New York. Tom Thibodeau did […]</description>

      <description> Progressive JSON 
This post by Dan Abramov is a trap! It proposes a fascinating way of streaming JSON objects to a client in a way that provides the shape of the JSON before the stream has completed, then fills in the gaps as more data arrives... and then turns out to be a sneaky tutorial in how React Server Components work. 
 Ignoring the sneakiness, the imaginary streaming JSON format it describ</description>

      <description> The Boss released his first album in ’73 and it was clear even then that he wrote songs of disillusionment and protest. So when his fans got all uppity when they realised that ‘Born in the U.S.A.’ wasn’t quite the all American anthem they thought - including ‘Ronnie’, I would have thought that this would have cleaned house of the ‘people that don’t pay attention’. 
 Clearly not.

      <description> A fun new benchmark just dropped!

      <link>https://damienbod.com/2025/05/26/revisiting-using-a-content-security-policy-csp-nonce-in-blazor/</link>
      <description>This blog looks at implementing a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) in web applications implemented using Blazor and ASP.NET Core. When implementing CSP, I always recommend using a CSP nonce or at least CSP hashes. If a technical stack does not support CSP nonces, you should probably avoid using this solution when implementing secure and […]</description>

 [Joshua Kaplan, Brett Murphy, Justin Elliott and Alex Mierjeski at ProPublica]  From my colleagues on the newsroom side at ProPublica, a story about how the State Department pressured Gambia on behalf of Elon Musk's starlink:   &quot;Starlink, Musk’s satellite internet company, had spent months trying to secure regulatory approval to sell internet access in the impoverished West Afr</description>

      <description> 
                 
 [Patricia Cohen in The New York Times]  This was inevitable:   &quot;As President Trump cuts billions of federal dollars from science institutes and universities, restricts what can be studied and pushes out immigrants, rival nations are hoping to pick up talent that has been cast aside or become disenchanted.&quot;   Salaries are lower in Europe, but quality of life is far higher - and,</description>

      <description>In my recap of RSAC 2025, I referenced the open letter that Patrick Opet, CISO of JPMorgan Chase, published in which he spoke about how essential security guardrails are being broken down by the lack of secure-by-design thinking in modern integration patterns within the SaaS world.

 [Erin In The Morning]  Unsurprisingly, there are major flaws with the Cass Report - and an expert report in Springer Nature's BMC Medical Research Methodology puts a fine point on it.   &quot;The BMC study reviewed seven different facets of the Cass Review, and found that all seven possessed “a high risk of bias due to methodological limitations and a failure to adequately address t</description>

Furthermore, fully-specified signature algorithms are now registered to replace the previously registered polymorphic algorithms, which are now deprecated. For example, you can now use Ed25519 and Ed448 instead of the ambiguous EdDSA. The new […]</description>

 [Shakeil Price at The Marshall Project]  The technology situation for incarcerated people in the United States is beyond bad:   &quot;Because prison telecom vendors tend to bundle their services, corrections systems often contract with a single provider, regardless of quality. And dozens of states make “commissions” from user fees. Within this context, incarcerated people become the</description>

The closely-related third version of the W3C Web Authentication (WebAuthn) specification is also nearing final status; this WebAuthn Level 3 working draft is currently going through the review steps to become a W3C Recommendation. So what’s new in the third versions? Changes between CTAP 2.1 and […]</description>

      <link>http://xditao.blogspot.com/2025/03/recognition-identity-and-ai-building.html</link>
      <description> My first love was self-sovereign distributed data, where each person owns and controls their data, hosting it wherever they choose and permissioning it under their own terms. But I got lost in the complexity of building a robust distributed identity infrastructure. How can you give permission to someone if you can’t 'name' them in a way that is verifiable and resistant to subversion? There's no po</description>

For that reason, I decided to take time off this spring to work on my garden and simply be with real people [...]</description>

      <title>Fully-Specified Algorithms Specification Addressing Area Director Feedback</title>
      <link>https://self-issued.info/?p=2627</link>
      <description>Orie Steele and I want to thank Deb Cooley for her Area Director review of the “Fully-Specified Algorithms for JOSE and COSE” specification. Addressing it simplified the exposition, while preserving the essence of what the draft accomplishes. Specifically, the resulting draft significantly simplified the fully-specified encryption description and removed the appendix on polymorphic ECDH algorithms.</description>

      <description> This post is a more technical follow-up to the post announcing the passing of SB 260 in Utah, establishing the principles for state-endorsed digital identity (SEDI). While SEDI does not mandate any particular technology, its mandated principles close the door for technologies that do not comply, and open the door for technologies that do.

      <description> Finally!  On March 4, 2025, the Utah legislature unanimously passed SB 260, a groundbreaking digital identity bill that carries this description:  “This bill enacts provisions related to a state-endorsed digital identity” (SEDI).  Now it’s off to the governor for signature, who has been publicly positive about it. Huge credit to Sen. Cullimore, the bill’s sponsor, and Christopher Bramwell, the sta</description>

      <description>A few years ago I abandoned Twitter in favor of Mastodon. Recent events validate that choice and underscore the strategic importance of a decentralized fediverse that can’t be owned by a single corporate or state actor. But while Mastodon meets my needs, much of the Twitter diaspora has gone to Bluesky. That’s fine for now … Continue reading Making the Fediverse More Accessible With Claude 3.7 Sonn</description>

      <description>I made a video today reflecting on how we manage (or don’t) our energy and how our engagement with digital information complicates our lives. I’m proposing that people consider dialing back their social media consumption to spend time reflecting on their thinking, what we have learned over the past five years, and how we can [...]</description>

      <description> My first attempt at building a decentralized app in this day and age will use Solid Pods and DIDs. The goal? A super simple “BooksWeLike” app—a place where I can review books and see what my friends are reading and enjoying.     What makes this app different is how it handles data. Unlike traditional apps where data lives in a centralized database, my app will let users store their own data in Sol</description>

      <description>I took notes on Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz’s post-election discussion of their Fairshake pro-crypto Pac and the coming Trump presidency about two months ago, but set them aside and other topics took precedence. Given the rising craziness in the crypto space around the inauguration, I thought it was a good time to put them [...]</description>

      <description>Perhaps, even though they are not themselves explainable, AIs can help us engineer explainable systems. But I’m not optimistic. It feels like we’re on a path to keep making systems harder for humans to configure, and we keep expanding our reliance on superhuman intelligence to do that for us.
