      <link>https://idm-thoughtplace.blogspot.com/2025/08/identity-management-just-isnt-what-it.html</link>
      <description> &amp;nbsp;  It feels like Identity Management, whether we are discussing
managing employee or customer identities, that it’s not just about managing user
names and passwords. Of course, this has been the case for several years. But those
of us in the industry are realizing there is a new paradigm where suspicion
is the new normal, and this means that everyone involved needs to find new
ways to manage </description>

      <description> Static Sites with Python, uv, Caddy, and Docker 
Nik Kantar documents his Docker-based setup for building and deploying mostly static web sites in line-by-line detail. 
 I found this really useful. The Dockerfile itself without comments is just 8 lines long:

      <description>What I like best about Keith Teare‘s latest essay, Who Owns The Front Door to AI?

      <description>&quot;Obviously, any campaign that used only that AI-generated data would miss the mark — instead of looking at the views of real respondents, it would be looking at a funhouse mirror reflection of a demographic cooked up by a language model with no access to actual data.&quot;</description>

Useful reminder from Geoffrey Huntley of the infrequently discussed significant token cost of using MCP. 
 Geoffrey estimate estimates that the usable context window something like Amp or Cursor is around 176,000 tokens - Claude 4's 200,000 minus around 24,000 for the system prompt for those tools.

      <description>  Most classical engineering fields deal with probabilistic system components all of the time. In fact I'd go as far as to say that inability to deal with probabilistic components is disqualifying from many engineering endeavors. 
 Process engineers for example have to account for human error rates. On a given production line with humans in a loop, the operators will sometimes screw up. Designing s</description>

This Reddit thread - with 279 replies - offers a neat targeted insight into the kinds of things people are using ChatGPT for. 
 Lots of variety here but two themes that stood out for me were ChatGPT for written negotiation - insurance claims, breaking rental leases - and ChatGPT for career and business advice.

      <description>This post looks at implementing a cookie reset in an ASP.NET Core application using Duende identity server which federates to Entra ID. Sometimes cookies need to be reset for end users due to size problems, or unknown remote authentication server errors. The cookies can be cleared and a new sign in can be forced.

      <description> TIL: Running a gpt-oss eval suite against LM Studio on a Mac 
The other day I learned that OpenAI published a set of evals as part of their gpt-oss model release, described in their cookbook on Verifying gpt-oss implementations. 
 I decided to try and run that eval suite on my own MacBook Pro, against gpt-oss-20b running inside of LM Studio. 
 TLDR: once I had the model running inside LM Studio wi</description>

Filippo Valsorda founded Geomys last year as an &quot;organization of professional open source maintainers&quot;, providing maintenance and support for critical packages in the Go language ecosystem backed by clients in retainer relationships.  
 This is an inspiring and optimistic shape for financially sustaining key open source projects, and it appears be working really well.

      <description> GPT-5 has a hidden system prompt 
It looks like GPT-5 when accessed via the OpenAI API may have its own hidden system prompt, independent from the system prompt you can specify in an API call. 
 At the very least it's getting sent the current date. I tried this just now: 
 llm -m gpt-5 'current date'
 
 That returned &quot;2025-08-15&quot;, confirming that the date has been fed to the model as part of a hid</description>

      <description> Client-side encryption in MongoDB offers a compelling way to protect sensitive data by ensuring encryption happens before the data leaves the client. This is particularly powerful for applications that handle PII, PHI, or financial information, as even database administrators can’t view the encrypted fields. However, in a multi-tenant environment, where the same database and its collections are sh</description>

      <description>Tuesday, June 24, 2025 Overnight, the Orion was repositioned off the coast of Corfu, an island near the northern part of Greece’s western coastline. With its strategic location, Corfu has considerable history, including a 6th-century fortress and a quaint Old Town. During our walking tour, we were treated to tastes of a local spirit, raki, […]</description>

 🔗 Transformation? Enough Already.. 
 
 
 The corporate obsession with transformation is outdated - and continues to fail.
Decades of data show most efforts don’t work, so rather than chasing grand, one-time overhauls, organisations must embrace continuous adaptation: flexible structures, people-first strategies, and real-time responses to shifting markets and needs. Change isn’t a ‘one-and-done’</description>

      <link>https://damienbod.com/2025/05/26/revisiting-using-a-content-security-policy-csp-nonce-in-blazor/</link>
      <description>This blog looks at implementing a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) in web applications implemented using Blazor and ASP.NET Core. When implementing CSP, I always recommend using a CSP nonce or at least CSP hashes. If a technical stack does not support CSP nonces, you should probably avoid using this solution when implementing secure and […]</description>

      <title>Recognition, Identity, and AI: Building Trust in Digital Agents</title>
      <link>http://xditao.blogspot.com/2025/03/recognition-identity-and-ai-building.html</link>
      <description> My first love was self-sovereign distributed data, where each person owns and controls their data, hosting it wherever they choose and permissioning it under their own terms. But I got lost in the complexity of building a robust distributed identity infrastructure. How can you give permission to someone if you can’t 'name' them in a way that is verifiable and resistant to subversion? There's no po</description>

      <title>On Hiatus – Look For Me In The Garden</title>
      <link>https://wrenchinthegears.com/2025/03/11/on-hiatus-look-for-me-in-the-garden/</link>
      <description>Today I realized that even though the Web3 program is ramping up as demonstrated by Silicon Valley’s plans to turn Argentina into a “network state,” few understand what is unfolding with cybernetic governance. For that reason, I decided to take time off this spring to work on my garden and simply be with real people [...]</description>

      <description> This post is a more technical follow-up to the post announcing the passing of SB 260 in Utah, establishing the principles for state-endorsed digital identity (SEDI). While SEDI does not mandate any particular technology, its mandated principles close the door for technologies that do not comply, and open the door for technologies that do. This article explores what SEDI makes technically possible,</description>

      <description> Finally!  On March 4, 2025, the Utah legislature unanimously passed SB 260, a groundbreaking digital identity bill that carries this description:  “This bill enacts provisions related to a state-endorsed digital identity” (SEDI).  Now it’s off to the governor for signature, who has been publicly positive about it. Huge credit to Sen. Cullimore, the bill’s sponsor, and Christopher Bramwell, the sta</description>

      <title>Making the Fediverse More Accessible With Claude 3.7 Sonnet</title>

      <description>A few years ago I abandoned Twitter in favor of Mastodon. Recent events validate that choice and underscore the strategic importance of a decentralized fediverse that can’t be owned by a single corporate or state actor. But while Mastodon meets my needs, much of the Twitter diaspora has gone to Bluesky. That’s fine for now … Continue reading Making the Fediverse More Accessible With Claude 3.7 Sonn</description>

      <description>Symbolic representation of Web Security applied to&amp;nbsp;SSI. Many children in Europe grew up with the tales of Baron Münchhausen, who claims to have lifted himself and his horse out of a mire by pulling his own hair. The image is so powerful because the problem of the circular dependency is so clearly visible. In real life, circular dependencies are often far less&amp;nbsp;obvious.  Which is why the fi</description>
