      <title>Quoting James Cham</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/12/james-cham/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>  Frankenstein is a terrific book partly based on how concerned people were about electricity. It captures our fears about the nature of being human but didn’t help anyone really come up with better policies for dealing with electricity. I worry that a lot of AI critics are doing the same thing.

 It’s this messianic belief in a vision that makes many entrepreneurs so quirky – and so interesting. It takes a unique personality to spend years saying “I’m right” when most around you say “That’s wrong.”

      <description> lm.rs: run inference on Language Models locally on the CPU with Rust 
Impressive new LLM inference implementation in Rust by Samuel Vitorino. I tried it just now on an M2 Mac with 64GB of RAM and got very snappy performance for this Q8 Llama 3.2 1B, with Activity Monitor reporting 980% CPU usage over 13 threads.

      <description> $2 H100s: How the GPU Bubble Burst 
Fascinating analysis from Eugene Cheah, founder of LLM hosting provider Featherless, discussing GPU economics over the past 12 months. 
 
 TLDR: Don’t buy H100s. The market has flipped from shortage ($8/hr) to oversupplied ($2/hr), because of reserved compute resales, open model finetuning, and decline in new foundation model co’s. Rent instead.

      <description> Forums are still alive, active, and a treasure trove of information 
Chris Person: 
 
 When I want information, like the real stuff, I go to forums. Over the years, forums did not really get smaller, so much as the rest of the internet just got bigger. Reddit, Discord and Facebook groups have filled a lot of that space, but there is just certain information that requires the dedication of adults w</description>

      <description> Free Threaded Python With Asyncio 
Jamie Chang expanded my free-threaded Python experiment from a few months ago to explore the interaction between Python's asyncio and the new GIL-free build of Python 3.13. 
 The results look really promising. Jamie says: 
 
 Generally when it comes to Asyncio, the discussion around it is always about the performance or lack there of. Whilst peroformance is certa</description>

      <description> After five years of standardization work, GNAP is now officially RFC9635! This long and intense process actually started a few years prior to that, when I was talking with a lot of folks in the security industry about some of the shortcomings of OAuth 2.0, and what we could do about them as an industry. These conversations led to the XYZ proposal (and implementations) which eventually led to the f</description>

      <description> Anthropic: Message Batches (beta) 
Anthropic now have a batch mode, allowing you to send prompts to Claude in batches which will be processed within 24 hours (though probably much faster than that) and come at a 50% price discount. 
 This matches the batch models offered by OpenAI and by Google Gemini, both of which also provide a 50% discount.

      <description> Datasette 0.65 
Python 3.13 was released today, which broke compatibility with the Datasette 0.x series due to an issue with an underlying dependency. I've fixed that problem by vendoring and fixing the dependency and the new 0.65 release works on Python 3.13 (but drops support for Python 3.8, which is EOL this month). Datasette 1.0a16 added support for Python 3.13 last month.

      <description> 
                 
 [Charles Duhigg at the New Yorker]   &quot;As the tech industry has become the planet’s dominant economic force, a coterie of specialists—led, in part, by the political operative who introduced the idea of “a vast right-wing conspiracy” decades ago—have taught Silicon Valley how to play the game of politics. Their aim is to help tech leaders become as powerful in Washington, D.C., a</description>

 [Karl Bode at TechDirt]   &quot;The Harris campaign has remained largely silent on whether Khan will be allowed to stick around. And it remains entirely unclear whether Harris will continue Biden’s support of something that, for once, at least vaguely resembles antitrust reform and a crackdown of concentrated corporate power.&quot;   Many tech leaders - the article calls out Reid Hoffman</description>

 The way it works is neat, inspired by rsync (hence the tool's name):

 [Andrew Schmelyun]  Following my piece about reading the news on paper, I came across this post from Anrew Schmelyun:   &quot;I recently purchased a dot matrix printer from eBay, and thought it would be a great excuse to have a custom &quot;front page&quot; printed out and ready for me each day. So, that's what I built!&quot;   What a neat idea: he's called a few APIs (the New York Times, Reddit, </description>

      <title>Is There Still a Place for Print in the Future of Media?</title>
      <link>https://werd.io/2024/is-there-still-a-place-for-print-in-the-future</link>
      <description> 
   I think there’s more work to be done to explore print as a modern product to support great writing and journalism. Lots has been said about its death — but comparatively little about its potential to live on in new forms.  I think print has a lot of life left in it: particularly if we overcome the idea of preserving the exact form it’s taken in the past and consider what a more modern, reconsi</description>

 [Molly Lempriere and Simon Evans in CarbonBrief]   &quot;Remarkably, the UK’s coal power phaseout – as well as the closure of some of the country’s few remaining blast furnaces at Port Talbot in Wales and Scunthorpe in Lincolnshire – will help push overall coal demand in 2024 to its lowest level since the 1600s.&quot;   The UK aims to fully decarbonize its power supplies by 2030.

      <description> Welcome to the inaugural “Ask a [cybersecurity] futurist column. This month’s question comes from Anna&amp;nbsp;Borg.  She asks:  How can we change the “rules in the game” and make it less interesting to use the internet for attacks on organisations and societies including democracy. We will never “win the game” if we are forced to play defence play 24/7, 365 days per year. How do we change the incent</description>

      <description> Recently, I have been working on programming small modules for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using Open AI. Also recently, I did a Coursera class on advanced RAG and have taken in several videos and posts on it. I have used samples from those sources and tested using various LLMs to generate simple Python to perform RAG with Open AI. In general&amp;nbsp;, I have been disappointed with the outco</description>

But when we make a bubble in our federated network, we aren’t just making a stand-alone system that can go live in a fully disconnected state. Over time, we expect things to re-connect, and when that happens, data needs to be harmonized across the boundaries. So many bubbles, so</description>

      <description>“Some argue that by aggregating knowledge drawn from human experience, LLMs aren’t sources of creativity, as the moniker “generative” implies, but rather purveyors of mediocrity. Yes and no. There really are very few genuinely novel ideas and methods, and I don’t expect LLMs to produce them. Most creative acts, though, entail novel recombinations of known … Continue reading How LLMs Guide Us to a H</description>
