      <description> Agentic IAM and IAM for AI&amp;nbsp;Agents  An AI agent is a software entity equipped with autonomy, adaptability, and often the ability to learn and reason in pursuit of specific goals. These agents can operate in complex environments, make context-aware decisions, and interact with users, APIs, or other agents. They span a wide range from simple task bots to sophisticated language models embedded in</description>

      <description>  So you can think really big thoughts and the leverage of having those big thoughts has just suddenly expanded enormously. I had this tweet two years ago where I said &quot;90% of my skills just went to zero dollars and 10% of my skills just went up 1000x&quot;. And this is exactly what I'm talking about - having a vision, being able to set milestones towards that vision, keeping track of a design to mainta</description>

      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/21/edit-is-now-open-source/#atom-everything</link>
      <description> Edit is now open source 
Microsoft released a new text editor! Edit is a terminal editor - similar to Vim or nano - that's designed to ship with Windows 11 but is open source, written in Rust and supported across other platforms as well. 
 
 Edit is a small, lightweight text editor. It is less than 250kB, which allows it to keep a small footprint in the Windows 11 image.

From their GitHub repo it looks like this effort quietly launched a couple of months ago, driven by the LM Studio team. Their goal is to specify an &quot;open standard for defining crossplatform, composable AI models&quot;. 
 A model can be defined using a YAML file that looks like this:

      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/21/faq-for-your-brain-on-chatgpt/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>  Is it safe to say that LLMs are, in essence, making us &quot;dumber&quot;? 
 No!  Please do not use the words like “stupid”, “dumb”, “brain rot”, &quot;harm&quot;, &quot;damage&quot;,  and so on. It does a huge disservice to this work, as we did not use this vocabulary in the paper, especially if you are a journalist reporting on it.

Here's another interesting result to file under the &quot;jagged frontier&quot; of LLMs, where their strengths and weaknesses are often unintuitive.

I was exploring why a Python tool was taking over a second to start running and I learned about the python -X importtime feature, documented here. Adding that option causes Python to spit out a text tree showing the time spent importing every module. 
 I tried that like this:

The OpenElections project collects detailed election data for the USA, all the way down to the precinct level.

      <description> That memvid thing that's been going around recently is a trap. It's an embedding store that records the original text that has been embedded in QR codes in a video file. That's an absurd thing to do, and the only purpose of the repo is to make people who uncritically share it look foolish. Don't fall for the trap.

 Enjoy.

      <description> [Ava Kofman in The New Yorker]  Curtis Yarvin is a pathetic little man:  &quot;As his ideas have been surrealized in DOGE and Trump has taken to self-identifying as a king, one might expect to find Yarvin in an exultant mood. In fact, he has spent the past few months </description>

 “The Orb” is popping up in all sorts of places, most recently in
Time magazine’s “The Orb Will See You Now”.
It’s being heralded as everything from the one and final solution for privacy-protecting
digital identity online, to a civil liberties nightmare, to an indispensable tool for
preventing an AI takeover, to a quick way to make $42, and more. 
 But what it actually does and how it w</description>

      <description> What phone home enables is worse than just surveillance and privacy invasion. Much&amp;nbsp;worse.  The ACLU, EFF, EPIC, CDT, Bruce Schneier and nearly 100 others just signed their support to a public statement opposing phone home capabilities in digital identity systems: NoPhoneHome.com.

      <description> I am a signatory to the No Phone Home Statement being released today, June 2, 2025.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) was recently proposed as a common interface for agents to get access to service</description>

The biggest problem is the “phone home” that’s a standard capability — </description>

      <title>Why Do Policy Languages Feel So Hard?</title>
      <link>https://www.technometria.com/p/why-do-policy-languages-feel-so-hard</link>

      <description>Security professionals have long taught that organizations should limit the access individuals have in computer systems to just those privileges necessary to perform their job.</description>

      <title>Andreessen and Horowitz’s Debrief On Their Fairshake PAC and Sunny Days Ahead For “Little Tech” Under Trump</title>
      <link>https://wrenchinthegears.com/2025/01/20/andreessen-and-horowitzs-debrief-on-their-fairshake-pac-and-sunny-days-ahead-for-little-tech-under-trump/</link>
      <description>I took notes on Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz’s post-election discussion of their Fairshake pro-crypto Pac and the coming Trump presidency about two months ago, but set them aside and other topics took precedence. Given the rising craziness in the crypto space around the inauguration, I thought it was a good time to put them [...]</description>

      <title>Trump Dance, Oscillation, And Going “Inside”</title>
      <link>https://wrenchinthegears.com/2025/01/18/trump-dance-oscillation-and-going-inside/</link>
      <description>In this morning’s video I somehow missed the fact that the inauguration coincides with MLK Day, which is an interesting sync with the “melanin as optical material” lens. I’m going to drop a few links to old blog posts that touch on the YMCA and “out of school time learning” as as well as my [...]</description>

      <title>Gestalt, Quakers and Carbon Trading – Do You See Faces Or A Vase?</title>
      <link>https://wrenchinthegears.com/2025/01/17/gestalt-quakers-and-carbon-trading-do-you-see-faces-or-a-vase/</link>
      <description>In this video I draw connections between Gestalt theory and organizational development as applied to digital groupthink in the context of Christiana Figueres, a leader in the development of carbon trading, who trained at the Gestalt Institute of Cleveland. As a young woman, she attended Swarthmore College, a Quaker institution. The first wife of her [...]</description>

      <title>The Configuration Crisis</title>
      <link>https://blog.jonudell.net/2025/01/14/the-configuration-crisis/</link>
      <description>Perhaps, even though they are not themselves explainable, AIs can help us engineer explainable systems. But I’m not optimistic. It feels like we’re on a path to keep making systems harder for humans to configure, and we keep expanding our reliance on superhuman intelligence to do that for us. The Configuration Crisis and Developer Dependency … Continue reading The Configuration Crisis</description>

      <description>What will come of large language models when they mirror unsettled psyches defined by religious hero complexes into the cloud? We do ourselves and future generations a profound disservice when we choose not to make time to comprehend and interrogate how emerging technologies and narrative flows are being deployed to steer psychological states individually and [...]</description>

      <description> Part 2: Issuing&amp;nbsp;Badges  In part one of this series, we discussed how the trust model of Open Badges 3.0 differs from earlier versions. Credentials issued as Open Badges 3.0 are based on the W3C Verifiable Credentials data model which describes how claims made online can be&amp;nbsp;proven.  To explore this trust model, let’s explore the story of Olivia who has been taking classes at a local commu</description>

      <description> Is blogging still a thing?  If you’re reading this, please comment or like it so I know.     I am, at heart, still the XDI Guy. My passion for robust, secure, and scalable distributed data management hasn’t waned. Building one of the first XDI implementations (shout-out to Markus Sabadello, who might have built the only other one), I learned a lot about the challenges and opportunities of distribu</description>

      <title>ECDSAに対応したゼロ知識証明の論文がGoogleから出ています</title>

      <description> こんにちは、富士榮です。  AAMVAのモバイル運転免許証のガイドラインでも触れましたが、mdocやSD-JWTのリンク可能性へ対応するためには今後ゼロ知識証明が大切になります。  年末にGoogleの研究者が  Anonymous credentials from ECDSA  というタイトルでペーパーを出しています。  https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/2010    AIでイラスト生成すると色々とおかしなことになって面白いですねw    アブストラクトの中からポイントを抜粋すると、従来のBBS+では暗号スイートへの対応に関する要件が厳しかったのでレガシーで対応できるようにECDSAでもできるようにしたよ、ということのようですね。   Part of the difficulty arises because schemes in the literature,</description>

      <title>AI RAG with LlamaIndex, Local Embedding, and Ollama Llama 3.1 8b</title>

      <description> In this post, I cover using LlamaIndex LlamaParse in auto mode to parse a PDF page containing a table, using a Hugging Face local embedding model, and using local Llama 3.1 8b via Ollama to perform naive Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). That’s a mouthful. I won’t go into how to setup Ollama and Llama 3.1 8b; this post assumes it is&amp;nbsp;running.  First off, you can find the code for this in m</description>

      <description>This is a video I posted yesterday. And a follow up to clarify certain points. Sorry, I guess the youtube AI choose the “hands up” screenshot for the preview image. I do talk a lot with my hands. Here is a link to Joseph Gonzalez’s blog post on emergent information communication systems. Here are two [...]</description>
