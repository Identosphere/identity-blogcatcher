      <description>  [...] The disappointing releases of both GPT-4.5 and Llama 4 have shown that if you don't train a model to reason with reinforcement learning, increasing its size no longer provides benefits. 
 Reinforcement learning is limited only to domains where a reward can be assigned to the generation result. Until recently, these domains were math, logic, and code. Recently, these domains have also includ</description>

 If i see an album on someone else’s list I can add it to one of my lists. BUT can I do the same if I have an album on one of my lists? If I want to add it to another one of mine - or even move it. Doable? Cos I can’t see that I can. Looking to do some list sorting and consolidation. </description>

      <title>A Significant Event Without Fanfare</title>
      <link>https://self-issued.info/?p=2638</link>
      <description>A significant event in digital identity occurred without fanfare today. Presentation Exchange was removed from the OpenID for Verifiable Presentations specification. It had once-upon-a-time been the only query language used for verifiable credential presentation. In October 2024, the Digital Credential Query Language (DCQL) was added alongside it. Today, after much discussion by the working group, </description>

      <title>Quoting Matt Webb</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/5/matt-webb/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>  Blogging is small-p political again, today. It’s come back round. It’s a statement to put your words in a place where they are not subject to someone else’s algorithm telling you what success looks like; when you blog, your words are not a vote for the values of someone else’s platform.

      <description> First look at the modern attr() 
Chrome 133 (released February 25th 2025) was the first browser to ship support for the advanced CSS attr() function (MDN), which lets attr() be used to compose values using types other than strings. 
 Ahmad Shadeed explores potential applications of this in detail, trying it out for CSS grid columns, progress bars, background images, animation delays and more.

    )
    version = models.IntegerField()

      <description>  We’re planning to release a very capable open language model in the coming months, our first since GPT-2. [...] 
 As models improve, there is more and more demand to run them everywhere. Through conversations with startups and developers, it became clear how important it was to be able to support a spectrum of needs, such as custom fine-tuning for specialized tasks, more tunable latency, running </description>

 [Nell Dhanesha at Nieman Journalism Lab]  This was fun to watch unfold in real time:   &quot;The truck’s journey to that spot had begun a few days earlier, as an email with the subject line “guerilla marketing for sources” in the inbox of Ariana Tobin, editor of ProPublica’s crowdsourcing and engagement team.

      <description>  My advice about using AI is simple: use AI as an assistant, not an expert, and use it judiciously. Some people will object, “but AI can be wrong!” Yes, and so can the internet in general, but no one now recommends avoiding online resources because they can be wrong. They recommend taking it all with a grain of salt and being careful. That’s what you should do with AI help as well.

      <link>https://wrenchinthegears.com/2025/03/11/on-hiatus-look-for-me-in-the-garden/</link>
      <description>Today I realized that even though the Web3 program is ramping up as demonstrated by Silicon Valley’s plans to turn Argentina into a “network state,” few understand what is unfolding with cybernetic governance. For that reason, I decided to take time off this spring to work on my garden and simply be with real people [...]</description>

      <title>Fully-Specified Algorithms Specification Addressing Area Director Feedback</title>
      <link>https://self-issued.info/?p=2627</link>
      <description>Orie Steele and I want to thank Deb Cooley for her Area Director review of the “Fully-Specified Algorithms for JOSE and COSE” specification. Addressing it simplified the exposition, while preserving the essence of what the draft accomplishes. Specifically, the resulting draft significantly simplified the fully-specified encryption description and removed the appendix on polymorphic ECDH algorithms.</description>

      <description> This post is a more technical follow-up to the post announcing the passing of SB 260 in Utah, establishing the principles for state-endorsed digital identity (SEDI). While SEDI does not mandate any particular technology, its mandated principles close the door for technologies that do not comply, and open the door for technologies that do. This article explores what SEDI makes technically possible,</description>

      <description> Finally!  On March 4, 2025, the Utah legislature unanimously passed SB 260, a groundbreaking digital identity bill that carries this description:  “This bill enacts provisions related to a state-endorsed digital identity” (SEDI).  Now it’s off to the governor for signature, who has been publicly positive about it. Huge credit to Sen. Cullimore, the bill’s sponsor, and Christopher Bramwell, the sta</description>

      <description>A few years ago I abandoned Twitter in favor of Mastodon. Recent events validate that choice and underscore the strategic importance of a decentralized fediverse that can’t be owned by a single corporate or state actor. But while Mastodon meets my needs, much of the Twitter diaspora has gone to Bluesky. That’s fine for now … Continue reading Making the Fediverse More Accessible With Claude 3.7 Sonn</description>

      <description>こんにちは、富士榮です。    こちらにも書いた通り、11月にAAMVAからMobile Drivers License Implementation Guidelineの1.4がでました。  https://idmlab.eidentity.jp/2024/12/mobile-drivers-licensemdl.html          読んでいてそういえば一般的じゃない言葉ばっかり使ってるよなぁ、と思うのでまずはTerminologyを見ておきましょう。         そもそも論のAAMVAです。    American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators   の略ですね。米国自動車管理者協会と訳されるようです。この辺の資料によると。&amp;nbsp;     EDL。enhanced driver licenseの略ですね。日本語だと</description>

      <description> こんにちは、富士榮です。     昨日はFIDO東京セミナーでしたね。私は台北にいたので参加できませんでしたが・・・  ということで悔しいので #fido でXを追いかけていましたが、えーじさんのパート（だと思う）で触れられていたっぽい「４分でパスキーを理解する」動画が素晴らしくわかりやすいかったのでメモしておこうというポストです。     ざっくりシナリオはこんな感じでした。    長らくパスワードを使ってきたけど、難しいパスワードは覚えられないし、同じパスワードの使い回しが起きるので危ないよね  そんなあなたにGoogleはパスワードマネージャを提供しているよ！  デバイスを跨いで同期されるのでとっても便利！  でも全員がパスワードマネージャに頼っているわけじゃないよね  その前にそもそもパスワードってセキュアじゃないよ  2段階認証はセキュリティ強度を上げるけど面倒だしなぁ  そんな</description>

      <description> Many digital identity proponents love the meme “the internet was built without an identity layer” and claim this as a bug to defend the need for a universal digital identity system. They’ve got it wrong though. This is a feature of the Web that has allowed the Web to flourish not a bug that must be fixed. The reason we should be preserving it extends beyond privacy and is more than ever relevant t</description>
