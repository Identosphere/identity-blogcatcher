      <description> 100x Defect Tolerance: How Cerebras Solved the Yield Problem 
I learned a bunch about how chip manufacture works from this piece where Cerebras reveal some notes about how they manufacture chips that are 56x physically larger than NVIDIA's H100. 
 The key idea here is core redundancy: designing a chip such that if there are defects the end-product is still useful. This has been a technique for dec</description>

      <title>Quoting Geoffrey Litt</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/15/geoffrey-litt/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>  Today's software ecosystem evolved around a central assumption that code is expensive, so it makes sense to centrally develop and then distribute at low marginal cost. 
 If code becomes 100x cheaper, the choices no longer make sense! Build-buy tradeoffs often flip. 
 The idea of an &quot;app&quot;—a hermetically sealed bundle of functionality built by a team trying to anticipate your needs—will no longer b</description>

 I realized some time ago that all the ways I want America to change just bring it closer to being Europe. Like, what if we had this can-do attitude and all the good parts without the guns and with universal healthcare, real education, unprocessed food without sugar in it, a real safety net, and integrated public transit instead of car culture.  Maybe the easier path is if we all, like, move to A</description>

      <description> ChatGPT reveals the system prompt for ChatGPT Tasks 
OpenAI just started rolling out Scheduled tasks in ChatGPT, a new feature where you can say things like &quot;Remind me to write the tests in five minutes&quot; and ChatGPT will execute that prompt for you at the assigned time. 
 I just tried it and the reminder came through as an email (sent via MailChimp's Mandrill platform). I expect I'll get these as </description>

      <description>Perhaps, even though they are not themselves explainable, AIs can help us engineer explainable systems. But I’m not optimistic. It feels like we’re on a path to keep making systems harder for humans to configure, and we keep expanding our reliance on superhuman intelligence to do that for us.

 [Andrew J.

      <description>  LLMs shouldn't help you do less thinking, they should help you do more thinking. They give you higher leverage. Will that cause you to be satisfied with doing less, or driven to do more?

      <description>  I was using o1 like a chat model — but o1 is not a chat model. 
 If o1 is not a chat model — what is it? 
 I think of it like a “report generator.” If you give it enough context, and tell it what you want outputted, it’ll often nail the solution in one-shot.

      <description> 
 We live in a world where right-wing nationalism is on the rise and many governments, including the incoming Trump administration, are promising mass deportations. Trump in particular has discussed building camps as part of mass deportations. This question used to feel more hypothetical than it does today.  Faced with this reality, it’s worth asking: who would stand by you if this kind of authori</description>

 [Mike Masnick in TechDirt]  Mark Zuckerberg is very obviously running scared from the incoming Trump administration:   &quot;Since the election, Zuckerberg has done everything he can possibly think of to kiss the Trump ring. He even flew all the way from his compound in Hawaii to have dinner at Mar-A-Lago with Trump, before turning around and flying right back to Hawaii. In the last</description>

      <description> Phi-4 Bug Fixes by Unsloth 
This explains why I was seeing weird &amp;lt;|im_end|&amp;gt; suffexes during my experiments with Phi-4 the other day: it turns out the Phi-4 tokenizer definition as released by Microsoft had a bug in it, and there was a small bug in the chat template as well. 
 Daniel and Michael Han figured this out and have now published GGUF files with their fixes on Hugging Face.

 [Jason Kottke]  Jason nails what the supposed focus on free speech by Meta and others is really about:   &quot;What Zuckerberg and Meta have realized is the value, demonstrated by Trump, Musk, and MAGA antagonists, of saying that you’re “protecting free speech” and using it as cover for almost anything you want to do. For Meta, that means increasing engagement, decreasing government</description>

Useful article to help understand ARIA live regions. Short version: you can add a live region to your page like this:

 Then any time you use JavaScript to modify the text content in that element it will be announced straight away by any screen readers - that's the &quot;assertive&quot; part. Using &quot;poli</description>

I couldn't figure out how to upgrade the version of Python 3.13 I had previous installed using uv - I had Python 3.13.0.rc2. Thanks to Charlie Marsh I learned the command for upgrading to the latest uv-supported release: 
 uv python install --reinstall 3.13
 
 I can confirm it worked using: 
 uv run --python 3.13 python -c 'import sys; print(sys.version)'

Carson Gross and Alex Petros lay out an ambitious plan for htmx: stay stable, add few features and try to earn the same reputation for longevity that jQuery has (estimated to be used on 75.3% of websites). 
 
 In particular, we want to emulate these technical characteristics of jQuery that make it such a low-cost, high-value addition to the toolkits of web developers. Alex has </description>

Neal Agarwal just created the worst webpage. It's extraordinary. As far as I can tell all of the audio was created specially for this project, so absolutely listen in to the true crime podcast and other delightfully weird little details. 
 Works best on a laptop - on mobile I ran into some bugs.

      <description>My wife and I are moving upward through The Final Demographic. Productively: working, traveling, doing stuff.

Because as imperfect as the analogy is, working with AI is easiest if you think of it like an alien person rather than a human-bu</description>

 I made my first squid post nineteen years ago this week. Between then and now, I posted something about squid every week (with maybe only a few exceptions). There is a lot out there about squid, even more if you count the other meanings of the word. 
 
 I think that's 1,004 posts about squid in 19 years. Talk about a legendary streak!

 Jodie Ginsberg, CPJ’s chief executive officer: 

 
   No journalist from outside Gaza has been allowed in since the start of that war, and that’s highly unusual. I speak to lots of war correspondents who’s covered many, many wars over decades, and all of them talk about how unprecedented this is to not have any access whatsoever.

I wanted to see how I’d use LMStudio to host my model versus Ollama and then use it from CrewAI. Below is a very simple setup for doing&amp;nbsp;this.  It’s good to point out that CrewAI uses LiteLLM under the hood as a sort of proxy. Thi</description>

      <description>A presentation I gave at IIW38, in April&amp;nbsp;2024. At the Internet Identity Workshop 38, I announced my talk with a description something like&amp;nbsp;this:  Five years ago at this conference, Trinsic’s first product (our self-sovereign identity wallet app) was launched. Today, I’m hosting a session called “SSI didn’t work. Trinsic is pivoting.”  I knew it was a provocative title — and I fully consid</description>

      <description>Compliments of FLUX&amp;nbsp;schnell This last week I spoke with two folks on AI intersection within their work and how their work intersects with one another. One was a CPO for a startup that is bringing AI into their life sciences products in a forefront way. The other was a compliance manager for a pharma company. The second happens to be my wife. For me, their work intersects. They both certainly g</description>

      <description> After five years of standardization work, GNAP is now officially RFC9635! This long and intense process actually started a few years prior to that, when I was talking with a lot of folks in the security industry about some of the shortcomings of OAuth 2.0, and what we could do about them as an industry. These conversations led to the XYZ proposal (and implementations) which eventually led to the f</description>

      <description> I played around just a little bit with Google’s NotebookLM. It’s a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tool. One thing it does is convert your content into a podcast format and it provides an impressive-sounding result. It's a little superficial on the content synthesis and definitely gimmicky, but it is a podcast after all. Its other features are your typical RAG chat interface. All I can say is</description>
