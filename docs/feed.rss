      <description> 50 Years of Travel Tips 
These travel tips from Kevin Kelly are the best kind of advice because they're almost all both surprising but obviously good ideas. 
 The first one instantly appeals to my love for Niche Museums, and helped me realize that traveling with someone who is passionate about something fits the same bill - the joy is in experiencing someone else's passion, no matter what the topi</description>

      <link>https://damienbod.com/2025/02/17/customizing-a-single-client-sign-in-using-parameters-in-duende-identityserver/</link>
      <description>This post looks at customizing the sign-in UI and the sign-in options in an ASP.NET Core application using Duende IdentityServer and ASP.NET Core Identity. There are multiple ways of changing the look and feel of the UI for different OpenID Connect clients or different client flows. In the previous post, the UI was customized per […]</description>

 [Mastodon]  Mastodon doesn't have quote posts, but is finally adding them after years of pressure. It's a harder decision than you might think - which is made clear by this excellent post by the team.  In order to help mitigate potential abuse, the team has imposed three main requirements:   You will be able to choose whether your posts can be quoted at all.

 [Joe Wilkins in Futurism]  The job market in the tech industry has been brutal for a little while now, and doesn't show signs of getting easier.   &quot;Of all the workers devastated by the carnage, former tech workers in Silicon Valley are having a particularly rough go of it.  The region's former software engineers and developers — whose jobs were previously thought to be ironclad</description>

      <description> 
 Inspired by Gina Trapani, Buster Benson, and others, I started to build my own Life in Weeks page from scratch. It looks pretty cool, and it’s interesting to see my life milestones presented on this scale.  But I’m not going to share it with you.  As I was building it, it became clear how much personal information I was sharing — and not just my own, but that of my parents, my sister, my partner</description>

      <link>https://werd.io/2025/an-update-on-searching-for-trans-friendly-employers-who-sponsor-visas</link>
      <description> 
   Last month I asked to hear from trans-friendly employers who sponsor visas, and provided a simple form for interested employers to reach out. In the process, I heard from many individuals: people who were hoping to find new employment in another country, and people who worked for companies that were aligned, who were encouraging their bosses to fill in the form.

 [Jon Pincus at The Nexus of Privacy]  There's an argument that one reason Elon Musk bought Twitter was to reduce its effectiveness as a platform for progressive organizing. Whether you buy that or not, it's clear that the new set of social networks are fertile ground for new and existing movements to make progress.  The question is: how?

 [Miriam Eric Suzanne]  Every single word of this piece resonated for me, from the underlying discomfort to the realization that AI as it currently manifests reflects a kind of fascist mindset in itself: an enclosure movement of culture and diversity that concentrates power into a handful of vendors.  This is true of me too:   &quot;Based on every conference I’ve attended over the la</description>

      <title>Quoting Kevin Samuel</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/15/kevin-samuel/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>  [...] if your situation allows it, always try uv first. Then fall back on something else if that doesn’t work out. 
 It is the Pareto solution because it's easier than trying to figure out what you should do and you will rarely regret it. Indeed, the cost of moving to and from it is low, but the value it delivers is quite high.

      <description> shot-scraper 1.6 with support for HTTP Archives 
New release of my shot-scraper CLI tool for taking screenshots and scraping web pages. 
 The big new feature is HTTP Archive (HAR) support. The new shot-scraper har command can now create an archive of a page and all of its dependents like this:

 This produces a datasette-io.har file (currently 163KB) which</description>

   It’s a small thing, but I broke my Apple Fitness longest streak this week. That means my consecutive number of days that I’ve hit my fitness goals on my Apple Watch has been longer than it’s ever been.  Here’s why that’s meaningful: my previous longest streak was broken when my mother died, almost four years ago, after a ten-year terminal decline. For part of that time, I thought that my siste</description>

 [Sergey Bogdanov]  This is a story about parenting, but also about the importance of considering context inclusively. We've all heard about the Stanford marshmallow experiment, but:   &quot;Kids from wealthier families waited longer than kids from low-income families. Not because they had more self-control, but because their environment made waiting feel safer. If you grow up knowin</description>

But, as Jennifer Gerson notes here, it's not just a photo op.   &quot;Musk, a father of 12, is an avowed pronatalist, or someone who believes declining population rates are a major concern and has committed to work to remedy this by having as many children as pos</description>

 [Iker Seisdedos interviewing Judith Butler in EL PAÍS English]  Judith Butler is as on-point as ever:   &quot;Q. It wasn’t just Trumpism. Some Democratic voices say it’s time to move beyond the issue of trans rights in areas like sports, which affect very few people.  A. You could say that about the Jews, Black people or Haitians, or any very vulnerable minority. Once you decide tha</description>

      <title>Quoting Sam Altman</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/9/sam-altman/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>  The cost to use a given level of AI falls about 10x every 12 months, and lower prices lead to much more use. You can see this in the token cost from GPT-4 in early 2023 to GPT-4o in mid-2024, where the price per token dropped about 150x in that time period. Moore’s law changed the world at 2x every 18 months; this is unbelievably stronger.

      <title>The Blame Game</title>
      <link>https://doc.searls.com/2025/01/19/the-blame-game/</link>
      <description>Twenty-third in the News Commons series Seventh on the #LAfires Disaster coverage tends to go through four stages: Live reporting. TV stations stop all advertising and go into round-the-clock coverage. Radio stations drop the feeds from elsewhere and go wall-to-wall with live reports. Newspapers drop their paywalls. Coverage by the best of them ranges from […]</description>

      <description>In this morning’s video I somehow missed the fact that the inauguration coincides with MLK Day, which is an interesting sync with the “melanin as optical material” lens.

      <description>Perhaps, even though they are not themselves explainable, AIs can help us engineer explainable systems. But I’m not optimistic. It feels like we’re on a path to keep making systems harder for humans to configure, and we keep expanding our reliance on superhuman intelligence to do that for us.

      <description> Part 2: Issuing&amp;nbsp;Badges  In part one of this series, we discussed how the trust model of Open Badges 3.0 differs from earlier versions.

To explore this trust model, let’s explore the story of Olivia who has been taking classes at a local commu</description>

      <description> こんにちは、富士榮です。     昨日はFIDO東京セミナーでしたね。私は台北にいたので参加できませんでしたが・・・  ということで悔しいので #fido でXを追いかけていましたが、えーじさんのパート（だと思う）で触れられていたっぽい「４分でパスキーを理解する」動画が素晴らしくわかりやすいかったのでメモしておこうというポストです。     ざっくりシナリオはこんな感じでした。    長らくパスワードを使ってきたけど、難しいパスワードは覚えられないし、同じパスワードの使い回しが起きるので危ないよね  そんなあなたにGoogleはパスワードマネージャを提供しているよ！  デバイスを跨いで同期されるのでとっても便利！  でも全員がパスワードマネージャに頼っているわけじゃないよね  その前にそもそもパスワードってセキュアじゃないよ  2段階認証はセキュリティ強度を上げるけど面倒だしなぁ  そんな</description>

      <description>こんにちは、富士榮です。    今週私は台湾にいるわけですが、USではGartnerサミットが開催されています。  その場でShare Signals Frameworkの相互運用検証に関するイベント（実際に実装を持ち寄って繋いでみる）が行われています。        https://openid.net/oidf-returns-to-gartner-to-showcase-shared-signals-interoperability/     過去にも何度か実施されており、非常に良い結果が出ていますので、今回も色々な実装を繋いだ結果が出てくることを楽しみにしています。  特にSSFのような仕組みは複数の事業者の実装が相互に接続できないと何の意味もないものなので、良い取り組みだと思います。     そういえば、Identity Dance Advent Calendarの中でGoogle</description>

 Jodie Ginsberg, CPJ’s chief executive officer: 

 
   No journalist from outside Gaza has been allowed in since the start of that war, and that’s highly unusual. I speak to lots of war correspondents who’s covered many, many wars over decades, and all of them talk about how unprecedented this is to not have any access whatsoever. And that, of course, puts additional pressure on these journalists</description>

      <description> I was recently experimenting with CrewAI, but in one experiment I wanted to use a local LLM hosted by LM Studio. Why LMStudio? Well… because that was the experiment. I wanted to see how I’d use LMStudio to host my model versus Ollama and then use it from CrewAI. Below is a very simple setup for doing&amp;nbsp;this.  It’s good to point out that CrewAI uses LiteLLM under the hood as a sort of proxy. Thi</description>
