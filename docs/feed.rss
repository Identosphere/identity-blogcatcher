      <title>Implement Phone verification, 2FA using ASP.NET Core Identity</title>
      <link>https://damienbod.com/2025/03/03/implement-phone-verification-2fa-using-asp-net-core-identity/</link>
      <description>This post shows how to implement phone (SMS) verification and two-factor authentication (2FA) using ASP.NET Core Identity. The solution integrates phone-based verification and 2FA mechanisms. The implementation uses ASP.NET Core Identity’s extensibility to incorporate SMS-based verification during user registration and login processes. SMS is no longer a recommended authentication method due to sec</description>

      <description> Saw it a couple of nights ago … and gave it the worst movie ever award … 
  
 🖇️ Full Review 
 To be fair others did like it - but nobody even thought it worth a nomination .. much less a win .. in any category. 
 5 wins out of 6 nominations? 
 Seriously? 
 I know the world’s gone mad … but really? </description>

      <title>Hallucinations in code are the least dangerous form of LLM mistakes</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/2/hallucinations-in-code/#atom-everything</link>
      <description> A surprisingly common complaint I see from developers who have tried using LLMs for code is that they encountered a hallucination - usually the LLM inventing a method or even a full software library that doesn't exist - and it crashed their confidence in LLMs as a tool for writing code. How could anyone productively use these things if they invent methods that don't exist?

 Perplexity… 
 
 The terms freedom and liberty are often used interchangeably, but they have nuanced differences: 
Freedom generally refers to the ability to act without external constraints or interference. It is the absence of restrictions, allowing individuals to pursue their desires and actions without hindrance.

      <description>  For some time, I’ve argued that a common conception of AI is misguided. This is the idea that AI systems like large language and vision models are individual intelligent agents, analogous to human agents. Instead, I’ve argued that these models are “cultural technologies” like writing, print, pictures, libraries, internet search engines, and Wikipedia. Cultural technologies allow humans to access </description>

      <title>Structured data extraction from unstructured content using LLM schemas</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/28/llm-schemas/#atom-everything</link>
      <description> LLM 0.23 is out today, and the signature feature is support for schemas - a new way of providing structured output from a model that matches a specification provided by the user. I've also upgraded both the llm-anthropic and llm-gemini plugins to add support for  schemas. 
 TLDR: you can now do things like this: 
  llm --schema 'name,age int,short_bio' 'invent a cool dog'  
 And get back:

      <description> GPT-4.5 is out today as a &quot;research preview&quot; - it's available to OpenAI Pro ($200/month) customers and to developers with an API key. OpenAI also published a GPT-4.5 system card. 
 I've started work adding it to LLM but I don't have a full release out yet. For the moment you can try it out via uv like this:

      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/25/emergent-misalignment/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>  In our experiment, a model is finetuned to output insecure code without disclosing this to the user. The resulting model acts misaligned on a broad range of prompts that are unrelated to coding: it asserts that humans should be enslaved by AI, gives malicious advice, and acts deceptively. Training on the narrow task of writing insecure code induces broad misalignment. We call this emergent misali</description>

Anthropic released Claude 3.7 Sonnet today - skipping the name &quot;Claude 3.6&quot; because the Anthropic user community had already started using that as the unofficial name for their October update to 3.5 Sonnet. 
 As you may expect, 3.7 Sonnet is an improvement over 3.5 Sonnet - and is priced the same, at $3/million tokens for input and $15/m output.

      <description>  There are contexts in which it is immoral to use generative AI. For example, if you are a judge responsible for grounding a decision in law, you cannot rest that on an approximation of previous cases unknown to you. You want an AI system that helps you retrieve specific, well-documented cases, not one that confabulates fictional cases. You need to ensure you procure the right kind of AI for a tas</description>

      <description> Using S3 triggers to maintain a list of files in DynamoDB 
I built an experimental prototype this morning of a system for efficiently tracking files that have been added to a large S3 bucket by maintaining a parallel DynamoDB table using S3 triggers and AWS lambda.

      <description>  Can I still use my Ai Pin for offline features? 
 Yes. After February 28, 2025, Ai Pin will still allow for offline features like battery level, etc., but will not include any function that requires cloud connectivity like voice interactions, AI responses, and .Center access.

      <title>ECDSAに対応したゼロ知識証明の論文がGoogleから出ています</title>

      <description> こんにちは、富士榮です。  AAMVAのモバイル運転免許証のガイドラインでも触れましたが、mdocやSD-JWTのリンク可能性へ対応するためには今後ゼロ知識証明が大切になります。  年末にGoogleの研究者が  Anonymous credentials from ECDSA  というタイトルでペーパーを出しています。  https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/2010    AIでイラスト生成すると色々とおかしなことになって面白いですねw    アブストラクトの中からポイントを抜粋すると、従来のBBS+では暗号スイートへの対応に関する要件が厳しかったのでレガシーで対応できるようにECDSAでもできるようにしたよ、ということのようですね。   Part of the difficulty arises because schemes in the literature,</description>

      <description> In this post, I cover using LlamaIndex LlamaParse in auto mode to parse a PDF page containing a table, using a Hugging Face local embedding model, and using local Llama 3.1 8b via Ollama to perform naive Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

      <description>The first time I heard a critique of mediated experience, the critic was my dad. He was an avid photographer who, during our family’s year in India, when I was a young child, used his 35mm Exacta to capture thousands of photos that became carousels of color slides we viewed for many years thereafter.

   No journalist from outside Gaza has been allowed in since the start of that war, and that’s highly unusual.

      <description> After five years of standardization work, GNAP is now officially RFC9635! This long and intense process actually started a few years prior to that, when I was talking with a lot of folks in the security industry about some of the shortcomings of OAuth 2.0, and what we could do about them as an industry. These conversations led to the XYZ proposal (and implementations) which eventually led to the f</description>

      <description> As I continue my study and experimentation with coding up AI solutions, and especially, at the moment, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), I decided to work with a post from the Metadocs blog titled “Simple Agentic RAG for Multi Vector stores with LangChain and LangGraph”. It seemed it would cover two areas of interest, agentic operations and RAG. Little did I expect to learn a valuable les</description>

      <description>I was aware of The Geysers, a geothermal field about 35 miles north of my home in Santa Rosa, but I never gave it much thought until my first bike ride through the area.

      <description> I played around just a little bit with Google’s NotebookLM. It’s a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tool. One thing it does is convert your content into a podcast format and it provides an impressive-sounding result. It's a little superficial on the content synthesis and definitely gimmicky, but it is a podcast after all. Its other features are your typical RAG chat interface. All I can say is</description>

But when we make a bubble in our federated network, we aren’t just making a stand-alone system that can go live in a fully disconnected state. Over time, we expect things to re-connect, and when that happens, data needs to be harmonized across the boundaries. So many bubbles, so</description>
