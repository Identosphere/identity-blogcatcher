      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2024/Nov/8/uv/#atom-everything</link>
      <description> uv 0.5.0 
The first backwards-incompatible (in minor ways) release after 30 releases without a breaking change. 
 I found out about this release this morning when I filed an issue about a fiddly usability problem I had encountered with the combo of uv and conda... and learned that the exact problem had already been fixed in the brand new version!

I'm still on the hunt for good options for running evaluations against prompts. ChainForge offers an interesting approach, calling itself &quot;an open-source visual programming environment for prompt engineering&quot;. 
 The interface is one of those boxes-and-lines visual programming tools, which reminds me of Yahoo Pipes.

Molly White has some solid ways to get started helping:   &quot;&quot;Many of us have looked back on historic events where people have bravely stood up against powerful adversaries and wondered, “what would I have done?” Now is your chance to find out.

 [Heather Bryant]  Some good advice from Heather:   &quot;One practical thing you can do in as much depth as you like, identify a particular area of information that you care about or feel is important and protect it. Whether it's critical public data, old abandoned websites, or niche community content that you think is worth preserving, the information is worth saving.&quot;   There is l</description>

 A question many of us are asking: how can we be as effective as possible over the next four years?  A few years ago, I made the decision to move out of tech into non-profit news, and I'm glad I'm here. It's a different environment and the learning curve has sometimes been steep, but I strongly believe in the power of mission-driven investigative journalism and journalism centered in diverse pers</description>

 [Taylor Lorenz at User Mag]  Gen Z men have lurched to the right, which was one factor behind this month's election result. This is, in part, because they've been inundated with media that speaks to a right-leaning point of view - and there's almost no counterpart on the Left.   &quot;Leftist channels do not receive widespread financial backing from billionaires or large institution</description>

      <description> Generating documentation from tests using files-to-prompt and LLM 
I was experimenting with the wasmtime-py Python library today (for executing WebAssembly programs from inside CPython) and I found the existing API docs didn't quite show me what I wanted to know. 
 The project has a comprehensive test suite so I tried seeing if I could generate documentation using that:

 Today I’ve been thinking a lot about my relatives who actively fought against nationalism as part of the resistance. What they and their colleagues did in the name of inclusion and opportunity.  That's the name of the game: a world where everyone has the same opportunity to live a good life, regardless of their race, religion, or background, with an equal, democratic say in how their country is </description>

      <description> New OpenAI feature: Predicted Outputs 
Interesting new ability of the OpenAI API - the first time I've seen this from any vendor. 
 If you know your prompt is mostly going to return the same content - you're requesting an edit to some existing code, for example - you can now send that content as a &quot;prediction&quot; and have GPT-4o or GPT-4o mini use that to accelerate the returned result.

Lord Howe Island - part of Australia, population 382 - is unique in that the island's standard time zone is UTC+10:30 but is UTC+11 when daylight saving time applies. It's the only time zone where DST represents a 30 minute offset.

Nor slumber nor a roof against the rain;  
Nor yet a floating spar to men that sink  
And rise and sink and rise and sink again;

Yet many a man is making friends with death  
Even as I speak, for lack of love alone.

 [Cassandra Jaramillo and Kavitha Surana at ProPublica]  The deeply tragic stories of how abortion bans lead to preventable deaths continue.   &quot;The fetus was on the verge of coming out, its head pressed against her dilated cervix; she was 17 weeks pregnant and a miscarriage was “in progress,” doctors noted in hospital records. At that point, they should have offered to speed up </description>

      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/30/monthnotes/#atom-everything</link>
      <description> I try to publish weeknotes at least once every two weeks. It's been four since the last entry, so I guess this one counts as monthnotes instead. 
 In my defense, the reason I've fallen behind on weeknotes is that I've been publishing a lot of long-form blog entries this month.

 [Nilay Patel at The Verge]  This is, uh, the opposite of this year's trend of a bunch of newspapers refusing to endorse anyone:   &quot;Donald Trump is a dangerous maniac who can barely complete a sentence, and it is lunacy to believe he can even recognize the existentially threatening collective action problems facing our nation, let alone actually solve them.&quot;   It's odd that a te</description>

      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/29/llm-multi-modal/#atom-everything</link>
      <description> I released LLM 0.17 last night, the latest version of my combined CLI tool and Python library for interacting with hundreds of different Large Language Models such as GPT-4o, Llama, Claude and Gemini. 
 The signature feature of 0.17 is that LLM can now be used to prompt multi-modal models - which means you can now use it to send images, audio and video files to LLMs that can handle them.

      <description> こんにちは、富士榮です。  ようやくトラストフレームワークの話まで辿り着きました。Elizabethがまとめてくれています。     トラストフレームワークの相互運用性を考える際、法律、組織、意味論、技術の4つのレイヤーに分割してそれぞれについてマッピングをしてみることが大切ということです。この辺りはカナダのDIACCが定義したマッピングの方法のようです。         We then discussed the considerations from a Relying Party / Verifier perspective. This included their need to focus primarily on their own business and balance the cost and complexities of new kinds of risk and c</description>

      <description> こんにちは、富士榮です。  いよいよ今日は前々夜祭が開催されるSIDI Hub東京サミットですが、ベルリンレポートのポリシーメタデータ定義〜トラストフレームワークマッピングについても見てみましょう。これはちょうどG7でも行われていたものと共通するところも多く、東京サミットでは今後どのように平仄を合わせていくのか議論が行われる論点の一つになると思います。     しかしポリシーメタデータの表現とトランスポートプロトコルだけ見てもこんなにバラバラなんですよねぇ。。       まだまだ他にもあるよ、ということでリストに記載がないものについても言及されました。  To add to the list on this slide:    GlobalPlatform attestation  ToIP: Trust registry protocol (TRP)  TRAIN: a protoco</description>

This group spent their time really drilling into one of the scenarios.   どうやらこちらのグループは一つのシナリオを深掘りしたようです。           ‘Federated’ is not needed as it is technically similar to APIs (we can cut out that whole third piece in this diag</description>

      <description> I was recently experimenting with CrewAI, but in one experiment I wanted to use a local LLM hosted by LM Studio. Why LMStudio? Well… because that was the experiment. I wanted to see how I’d use LMStudio to host my model versus Ollama and then use it from CrewAI. Below is a very simple setup for doing&amp;nbsp;this.  It’s good to point out that CrewAI uses LiteLLM under the hood as a sort of proxy. Thi</description>

      <link>https://idmlab.eidentity.jp/2024/10/auth0-labai.html</link>
      <description> こんにちは、富士榮です。  イベント続きでほぼ毎日プレゼンしている気がしますが、ストレスが溜まるので現実逃避です。  Auth0が生成AI向けの認証・認可に関するサイトをオープンしました。     https://www.auth0.ai/  まぁ、もともとOpenAIの認証はAuth0だったこともあり、この分野は以前から取り組んできていたんだと思います。  生成AIの認証・認可といっても単純にチャットボットへのログインだけでは面白くないわけで、ユーザの代わりにAPIを読んだり、RAGの認証をしたり、ユーザの確認を非同期で行ったり、とやることはたくさんあります。  この辺りをAuth0 Labでパッケージングしたサンプルを公開している、ということですね。     Auth0 Labのアカウントで先ほどのサイトのデモを試すと、ChatGPTもどきのアプリケーションが動きます。        </description>

      <description> After five years of standardization work, GNAP is now officially RFC9635! This long and intense process actually started a few years prior to that, when I was talking with a lot of folks in the security industry about some of the shortcomings of OAuth 2.0, and what we could do about them as an industry. These conversations led to the XYZ proposal (and implementations) which eventually led to the f</description>

But when we make a bubble in our federated network, we aren’t just making a stand-alone system that can go live in a fully disconnected state. Over time, we expect things to re-connect, and when that happens, data needs to be harmonized across the boundaries. So many bubbles, so</description>

 I can’t believe it’s been over two years since I last published an article here! Time really flies. 
 The crazy part is that over these last two years, I’ve done more writing than ever; it just hasn’t been public. 
 Several years back, I started a journaling habit, and since then, most of my writing energy has been redirected from my website to my private journal. 
 While writing in private fee</description>

      <title>Fully-Specified Algorithms Specification Addressing Feedback from IETF 120</title>
      <link>https://self-issued.info/?p=2566</link>
      <description>Orie Steele and I have updated the “Fully-Specified Algorithms for JOSE and COSE” specification to incorporate feedback from IETF 120 in Vancouver. Specifically, the registrations for fully-specified Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) algorithms in draft 03 were removed, along with the previously proposed fully-specified ECDH algorithm identifiers, while continuing to describe how to create fully</description>

      <description>Here’s the latest installment in the series on working with LLMS: https://thenewstack.io/choosing-when-to-use-or-not-use-llms-as-a-developer/ For certain things, the LLM is a clear win. If I’m looking at an invalid blob of JSON that won’t even parse, there’s no reason to avoid augmentation. My brain isn’t a fuzzy parser — I’m just not wired to see that kind … Continue reading When not to LLM</description>

      <description> When explaining the W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model (VC), Open Badges 3.0, and LERs, I’m often asked about the role of blockchain and if I’m not asked, I feel compelled to explain because misconceptions and confusion are common. Blockchain is one of those technologies that is at once fascinating and cringey, useful and over-used. The business models are still experimental and when it comes do</description>

      <description>Wednesday, June 12, 2024 This being our last day in Perth, we had a leisurely start, although that was limited by the need to check out of our hotel room on time.

      <description>Tuesday, June 11, 2024 We have heard a lot about Rottnest Island, which is just off the coast of Perth. Rottnest (“Rotto” to the locals) is a recreational island with cabins for rent, several beaches with snorkeling (in the summer), restaurants, a golf course, skydiving, and more. It is also the home of about 10,000 […]</description>

      <description>Sunday, June 9, 2024 Today started quite early because they needed to get us off the Orion early and prepare it in eight hours for the next cruise. We had our suitcases out for pickup at 7 a.m., ate breakfast, and exited the ship about 7:30. We had to go through Australian customs, which went […]</description>

      <description> One of the key aspects to the bubbles model for federated identity systems is the fact that within the bubble, the account for each user is fully authoritative for that space. But since bubbles don’t exist in a vacuum, that same person probably has accounts that exist in other bubbles. In fact, the attributes in their account probably came from somewhere else to begin with. And of course, our bubb</description>
