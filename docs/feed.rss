Calvin French-Owen spent just over a year working at OpenAI, during which time the organization grew from 1,000 to 3,000 people and Calvin found himself in &quot;the top 30% by tenure&quot;. 
 His reflections on leaving are fascinating - absolutely crammed with detail about OpenAI's internal culture that I haven't seen described anywhere else before.

This book by James Martin published in 1982, includes the following in the preface: 
 
 Applications development did not change much for 20 years, but now a new wave is crashing in. A rich diversity of nonprocedural techniques and languages are emerging. As these languages improve, they promise to change the entire fabric of DP development.

      <description>  On the morning of July 8, 2025, we observed undesired responses and immediately began investigating. 
 To identify the specific language in the instructions causing the undesired behavior, we conducted multiple ablations and experiments to pinpoint the main culprits.  We identified the operative lines responsible for the undesired behavior as:

      <description> Musk’s latest Grok chatbot searches for billionaire mogul’s views before answering questions 
I got quoted a couple of times in this story about Grok searching for tweets from:elonmusk by Matt O’Brien for the Associated Press. 
 
 “It’s extraordinary,” said Simon Willison, an independent AI researcher who’s been testing the tool. “You can ask it a sort of pointed question that is around controvers</description>

Fast forward just 7 years and ‘a chip’ company hitting 4 trillion barely registers surprise.

      <description> If you ask the new Grok 4 for opinions on controversial questions, it will sometimes run a search to find out Elon Musk's stance before providing you with an answer.

      <description> Become a command-line superhero with Simon Willison's llm tool 
Christopher Smith ran a mini hackathon in Albany New York at the weekend around uses of my LLM - the first in-person event I'm aware of dedicated to that project!

      <description> Adding a feature because ChatGPT incorrectly thinks it exists 
Adrian Holovaty describes how his SoundSlice service saw an uptick in users attempting to use their sheet music scanner to import ASCII-art guitar tab... because it turned out ChatGPT had hallucinated that as a feature SoundSlice supported and was telling users to go there! 
 So they built that feature. Easier than convincing OpenAI to</description>

Here's yet another example of a lethal trifecta attack, where an LLM system combines access to private data, exposure to potentially malicious instructions and a mechanism to communicate data back out to an attacker. 
 In this case, General Analysis identify all three components in a single MCP - the Supabase MCP.

Jake Gold tests how well 90s-era CGI works today, using a Go + SQLite CGI program running on a 16-thread AMD 3700X.

      <description> What phone home enables is worse than just surveillance and privacy invasion. Much&amp;nbsp;worse.  The ACLU, EFF, EPIC, CDT, Bruce Schneier and nearly 100 others just signed their support to a public statement opposing phone home capabilities in digital identity systems: NoPhoneHome.com.  The statement is simple, clear, and helpful, but it severely soft-pedals the&amp;nbsp;problem.  When Phone Home Is Fa</description>

      <description> I am a signatory to the No Phone Home Statement being released today, June 2, 2025. This statement concerns a specific design choice that many in the industry consider potentially hazardous and unsuitable for many digital identity systems. The “phone home” capability is where the issuer of the identity is notified every time the identity […]

      <description>こんにちは、富士榮です。    どうやらOkta Venturesが2024年から始めた今年のアイデンティティ界の25人（The Identity 25）に選ばれました。        https://www.okta.com/resources/datasheet-the-identity-25/        このプログラム、2024年からスタートしたもののようで、昨年はSPRIN-Dにいる安田クリスチーナやMicrosoftのPam DIngle、YubicoのJohn Bradleyなどが選ばれていました。     今年はOpenID FoundationのExecutive DirectorのGail HodgesやChairの崎村さんらの錚々たるメンバの中に何故か私も加えていただけたようです。     しかし、最初Okta Ventures側から連絡をもらった時はよくある詐欺かと</description>

      <description> My first love was self-sovereign distributed data, where each person owns and controls their data, hosting it wherever they choose and permissioning it under their own terms. But I got lost in the complexity of building a robust distributed identity infrastructure. How can you give permission to someone if you can’t 'name' them in a way that is verifiable and resistant to subversion? There's no po</description>

      <description> This post is a more technical follow-up to the post announcing the passing of SB 260 in Utah, establishing the principles for state-endorsed digital identity (SEDI). While SEDI does not mandate any particular technology, its mandated principles close the door for technologies that do not comply, and open the door for technologies that do.

On March 4, 2025, the Utah legislature unanimously passed SB 260, a groundbreaking digital identity bill that carries this description:  “This bill enacts provisions related to a state-endorsed digital identity” (SEDI).  Now it’s off to the governor for signature, who has been publicly positive about it. Huge credit to Sen. Cullimore, the bill’s sponsor, and Christopher Bramwell, the sta</description>

      <description>A few years ago I abandoned Twitter in favor of Mastodon. Recent events validate that choice and underscore the strategic importance of a decentralized fediverse that can’t be owned by a single corporate or state actor. But while Mastodon meets my needs, much of the Twitter diaspora has gone to Bluesky. That’s fine for now … Continue reading Making the Fediverse More Accessible With Claude 3.7 Sonn</description>
