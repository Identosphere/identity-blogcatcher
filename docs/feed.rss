      <title>Quoting Charles Babbage</title>

      <description>  On two occasions I have been asked, ‚Äî &quot;Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out ?&quot; In one case a member of the Upper, and in the other a member of the Lower, House put this question. I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.

      <description> Mandelbrot in x86 assembly by Claude 
Inspired by a tweet asking if Claude knew x86 assembly, I decided to run a bit of an experiment. 
 I prompted Claude Sonnet 4: 
 
 Write me an ascii art mandelbrot fractal generator in x86 assembly 
 
 And got back code that looked... like assembly code I guess? 
 So I copied some jargon out of that response and asked:

      <description>  One of the best examples of LLM developer tooling I've heard is from a team that supports software from the 80s-90s. Their only source of documentation is video interviews with retired employees. So they feed them into transcription software and get summarized searchable notes out the other end.

      <description> Using LLMs for code archaeology is pretty fun. 
 I stumbled across this blog entry from 2003 today, in which I had gotten briefly excited about ColdFusion and implemented an experimental PHP template engine that used XML tags to achieve a similar effect: 
 &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;%title%&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;sql id=&quot;recent&quot;&amp;gt;
select title
from entries 
order by added desc
limit 0, %limit%

      <description>  To misuse a woodworking metaphor, I think we‚Äôre experiencing a shift from hand tools to power tools. 
 You still need someone who understands the basics to get the good results out of the tools, but they‚Äôre not chiseling fine furniture by hand anymore, they‚Äôre throwing heaps of wood through the tablesaw instead. More productive, but more likely to lose a finger if you‚Äôre not careful.

      <description> Just here in Aotearoa 
 
 758 construction businesses have gone into liquidation in the last 12 months, thanks in part to the Government‚Äôs freeze on transport, housing and hospital investment spending at the beginning of 2024, Centrix reported this morning. Construction jobs have fallen by 12,723 in the last year, Stats NZ reports.

      <description> Tip: Use keyword-only arguments in Python dataclasses 
Useful tip from Christian Hammond: if you create a Python dataclass using @dataclass(kw_only=True) its constructor will require keyword arguments, making it easier to add additional properties in the future, including in subclasses, without risking breaking existing code.

      <description> This post is a more technical follow-up to the post announcing the passing of SB 260 in Utah, establishing the principles for state-endorsed digital identity (SEDI).

      <description> My first attempt at building a decentralized app in this day and age will use Solid Pods and DIDs. The goal? A super simple ‚ÄúBooksWeLike‚Äù app‚Äîa place where I can review books and see what my friends are reading and enjoying.     What makes this app different is how it handles data. Unlike traditional apps where data lives in a centralized database, my app will let users store their own data in Sol</description>

      <description>I took notes on Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz‚Äôs post-election discussion of their Fairshake pro-crypto Pac and the coming Trump presidency about two months ago, but set them aside and other topics took precedence. Given the rising craziness in the crypto space around the inauguration, I thought it was a good time to put them [...]</description>
