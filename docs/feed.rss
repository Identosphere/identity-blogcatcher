      <title>Calling a wrap on my weeknotes</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/20/calling-a-wrap-on-my-weeknotes/#atom-everything</link>
      <description> After 192 posts that ranged from weekly to roughly once-a-month, I've decided to call a wrap on my weeknotes habit. The original goal was to stay transparent during my 2019-2020 JSK fellowship, and I kept them up after that as an accountability mechanism and to get into a habit of writing regularly. 
 Over the past two years I've adopted new posting habits which are solving those problems in other</description>

      <description> OpenAI platform: o1-pro 
OpenAI have a new most-expensive model: o1-pro can now be accessed through their API at a hefty $150/million tokens for input and $600/million tokens for output. That's 10x the price of their o1 and o1-preview models and a full 1,000x times more expensive than their cheapest model, gpt-4o-mini! 
 Aside from that it has mostly the same features as o1: a 200,000 token contex</description>

 [Jasmine Mooney]  A nightmare account from a Canadian citizen detained by ICE:   &quot;I was taken to a tiny, freezing cement cell with bright fluorescent lights and a toilet. There were five other women lying on their mats with the aluminum sheets wrapped over them like dead bodies. The guard locked the door behind me.

I have now got it working into one of my Wordpress blogs .. which then cross posts to Micro.blog … BUT any subsequent updates appear on Wordpress do not make it through. Possible fixes … 
 
 
 any plan to have Wordland connect directly to Micro.Blog?

      <description> Vibe coding is having a moment. The term was coined by Andrej Karpathy just a few weeks ago (on February 6th) and has since been featured in the New York Times, Ars Technica, the Guardian and countless online discussions.

Nicholas Carlini, previously deeply skeptical about the utility of LLMs, discusses at length his thoughts on where the technology might go. 
 He presents compelling, detailed arguments for both ends of the spectrum - his key message is that it's best to maintain very wide error bars for what might happen next:

 The poll doesn’t have good news for Democrats, either. The Democratic Party has reached an all-time low in popularity, with only 27% of respondents holding a positive view — its lowest positive rating in NBC News polling dating back to 1990. And the slump is partially driven by fed-up Democrats who want the party to fight Trump harder.

Om Malik has now moved to sharing on his blog first rather than posting directly to social media:   &quot;The inspiration for the newly rebooted “daily blog” comes from Dave Winer, who maintains a “Links” blog. I’ve been using his new project, Wordland, for publishing to the “links” blog, in addition to using MarsEdit. I have also taken a cue fr</description>

      <description> [@Dave](https://micro.blog/Dave) asked the question about Wordland as to whether I was surprised that having posted something … the screen didn’t clear. I get it and understand why the decision was made .. but it still caught me out. 
 [@om](https://micro.blog/om) is using Wordland to create a new kind of Daily post.

      <description> TIL: Styling an HTML dialog modal to take the full height of the viewport 
I spent some time today trying to figure out how to have a modal &amp;lt;dialog&amp;gt; element present as a full height side panel that animates in from the side. The full height bit was hard, until Natalie helped me figure out that browsers apply a default max-height: calc(100% - 6px - 2em); rule which needs to be over-ridden.

      <description> Xata Agent 
Xata are a hosted PostgreSQL company who also develop the open source pgroll and pgstream schema migration tools. 
 Their new &quot;Agent&quot; tool is a system that helps monitor and optimize a PostgreSQL server using prompts to LLMs. 
 Any time I see a new tool like this I go hunting for the prompts. It looks like the main system prompts for orchestrating the tool live here - here's a sample: </description>

      <description>  Today we release OLMo 2 32B, the most capable and largest model in the OLMo 2 family, scaling up the OLMo 2 training recipe used for our 7B and 13B models released in November. It is trained up to 6T tokens and post-trained using Tulu 3.1. OLMo 2 32B is the first fully-open model (all data, code, weights, and details are freely available) to outperform GPT3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o mini on a suite of p</description>

Anthropic released a new &quot;tool&quot; today for text editing. It looks similar to the tool they offered as part of their computer use beta API, and the trick they've been using for a while in both Claude Artifacts and the new Claude Code to more efficiently edit files there. 
 The new tool requires you to implement several commands:

Justin Duke demonstrates a neat pattern for running simple tests against your internal Django admin site: introspect every admin route via django.urls.get_resolver() and loop through them with @pytest.mark.parametrize to check they all return a 200 HTTP status code. 
 This catches simple mistakes with the admin configuration that trigger exceptions that might oth</description>

 [Mike Masnick at Techdirt]  Mike Masnick on why tech journalism has a huge part to play in decoding current events right now:   &quot;We’ve spent decades documenting how technology and entrepreneurship can either strengthen or undermine democratic institutions. We understand the dangers of concentrated power in the digital age. And we’ve watched in real-time as tech leaders who once</description>

      <description> 
                 
 [Gaby Del Valle at The Verge]  This is dystopian:   &quot;The Trump administration may soon demand the social media accounts of people applying for green cards, US citizenship, and asylum or refugee status. US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) — the federal agency that oversees legal migration, proposed the new policy in the Federal Register this week — calling this infor</description>

      <description> 
 So, yes, hi, I have a Tesla. It’s a long range Model 3 which I bought in 2021.  After a career spent working on open source and mission-drive projects — right now I work for a non-profit newsroom; once upon a time I built a social networking platform for education — it might shock you to learn that I am not rich. I have never had a significant tech company equity package; I have never seen the b</description>

      <title>How DOGE’s IRS Cuts Could Cost More Than DOGE Will Ever Save</title>

      <description> 
                 
 [Andy Kroll at ProPublica]  Cutting the IRS has nothing to do with government efficiency:   &quot;Unlike with other federal agencies, cutting the IRS means the government collects less money and finds fewer tax abuses. Economic studies have shown that for every dollar spent by the IRS, the agency returns between $5 and $12, depending on how much income the taxpayer declared. A 2024 </description>

      <link>https://werd.io/2025/rethinking-the-cloud-separating-software-from-infrastructure</link>
      <description> 
   Much of the last decade or two of the tech industry has been dominated by the idea of&amp;nbsp;the cloud: the simple, powerful idea that all of your applications and data can be accessed from any device with an internet connection. Enterprise businesses around the world have decommissioned server rooms in favor of subscribing to services maintained by other people, reducing overheads of all kinds.</description>

      <description>This post shows how to implement phone (SMS) verification and two-factor authentication (2FA) using ASP.NET Core Identity. The solution integrates phone-based verification and 2FA mechanisms. The implementation uses ASP.NET Core Identity’s extensibility to incorporate SMS-based verification during user registration and login processes. SMS is no longer a recommended authentication method due to sec</description>

   I’ve seen a lot&amp;nbsp;of this sentiment lately, and can relate:   I miss being excited by technology. I wish I could see a way out of the endless hype cycles that continue to elicit little more than cynicism from me. The version of technology that we’re mostly being sold today has almost nothing to do with improving lives, but instead stuffing the pockets of those who already need for nothing. </description>

 Deadly D.C. Plane Crash Comes Months After Congress Ignored Warning About Traffic at Reagan Airport 

 As the new administration is playing stupid games, yesterday morning, prior to yesterday’s aviation disaster, professor Thomas Schaller cautioned:
 

 
   An FAA employee I know confirms agency already lacks sufficient air traffic controllers. The so-called “buyouts” and other attacks on federa</description>

      <description> My first attempt at building a decentralized app in this day and age will use Solid Pods and DIDs. The goal? A super simple “BooksWeLike” app—a place where I can review books and see what my friends are reading and enjoying.     What makes this app different is how it handles data. Unlike traditional apps where data lives in a centralized database, my app will let users store their own data in Sol</description>

      <description>I took notes on Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz’s post-election discussion of their Fairshake pro-crypto Pac and the coming Trump presidency about two months ago, but set them aside and other topics took precedence. Given the rising craziness in the crypto space around the inauguration, I thought it was a good time to put them [...]</description>

      <description>Perhaps, even though they are not themselves explainable, AIs can help us engineer explainable systems. But I’m not optimistic. It feels like we’re on a path to keep making systems harder for humans to configure, and we keep expanding our reliance on superhuman intelligence to do that for us.

      <description> In this post, I cover using LlamaIndex LlamaParse in auto mode to parse a PDF page containing a table, using a Hugging Face local embedding model, and using local Llama 3.1 8b via Ollama to perform naive Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

      <description>こんにちは、富士榮です。    今週私は台湾にいるわけですが、USではGartnerサミットが開催されています。  その場でShare Signals Frameworkの相互運用検証に関するイベント（実際に実装を持ち寄って繋いでみる）が行われています。        https://openid.net/oidf-returns-to-gartner-to-showcase-shared-signals-interoperability/     過去にも何度か実施されており、非常に良い結果が出ていますので、今回も色々な実装を繋いだ結果が出てくることを楽しみにしています。  特にSSFのような仕組みは複数の事業者の実装が相互に接続できないと何の意味もないものなので、良い取り組みだと思います。     そういえば、Identity Dance Advent Calendarの中でGoogle</description>
