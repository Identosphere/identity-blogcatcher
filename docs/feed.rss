 Hope all is well with you in the land of the free. 
 
 It used to be just a pleasant and different way of greeting that I have used for many years with certain people. And then it hit me … I then spent 5 minutes trying to decide whether to include it or not. I ended up writing …

      <description> Revisiting some of our old walks over the weekend - and seeing this reminded me how often we saw scooters being pulled out from this particular wharf. 

 This one’s a bit different - Beam were unceremoniously removed from Auckland CBD a little over a year ago - so it has been in there for at least that - and now it’s out .. I wonder where ‘home’ is?

 I don’t nominate agentic, which is suddenly hot shit 
 
 … or just shit. (for now). I get the promise - but all we are really seeing is a demo. HIs argument is ‘agency’ as word of the year - not agentic … why the distinction? 
 
 See, agency is a noun, and agentic is an adjective. 
 
 But that isn’t really the trust of his main argument.

Good, detailed write-up of the Next.js vulnerability CVE-2025-29927 by Allam Rachid, one of the researchers who identified the issue. 
 The vulnerability is best illustrated by this code snippet: 
  const subreq = params.request.headers['x-middleware-subrequest'];
const subrequests = typeof subreq === 'string' ? subreq.split(':') : [];

      <description>  If you’re new to tech, taking [career] advice on what works for someone with a 20-year career is likely to be about as effective as taking career advice from a stockbroker or firefighter or nurse. There’ll be a few things that generalize, but most advice won’t.

      <description> Anthropic Trust Center: Brave Search added as a subprocessor 
Yesterday I was trying to figure out if Anthropic has rolled their own search index for Claude's new web search feature or if they were working with a partner. Here's confirmation that they are using Brave Search: 
 
 Anthropic's subprocessor list. As of March 19, 2025, we have made the following changes:

      <description>The Voice of America is silent. To Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and Kari Lake (who now runs its corpse), the VOA was corrupt, biased, unnecessary, and needed to go.

      <title>New audio models from OpenAI, but how much can we rely on them?</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/20/new-openai-audio-models/#atom-everything</link>
      <description> OpenAI announced several new audio-related API features today, for both text-to-speech and speech-to-text. They're very promising new models, but they appear to suffer from the ever-present risk of accidental (or malicious) instruction following.

Claude 3.7 Sonnet on the paid plan now has a web search tool that can be turned on as a global setting.

      <description> Now you don’t even need code to be a programmer. But you do still need expertise 
My recent piece on how I use LLMs to help me write code got a positive mention in John Naughton's column about vibe-coding in the Guardian this weekend. 
 My hunch about Apple Intelligence Siri features being delayed due to prompt injection also got a mention in the most recent episode of the New York Times Hard Fork</description>

 [Om Malik]  This is an ongoing trend. Om Malik has now moved to sharing on his blog first rather than posting directly to social media:   &quot;The inspiration for the newly rebooted “daily blog” comes from Dave Winer, who maintains a “Links” blog.

      <description> TIL: Styling an HTML dialog modal to take the full height of the viewport 
I spent some time today trying to figure out how to have a modal &amp;lt;dialog&amp;gt; element present as a full height side panel that animates in from the side. The full height bit was hard, until Natalie helped me figure out that browsers apply a default max-height: calc(100% - 6px - 2em); rule which needs to be over-ridden.

 [Kunal Khullar at Tom's Hardware]  Straight into my nightmares:   &quot;Australian biotech company Cortical Labs has introduced what it claims to be &quot;the world’s first code deployable biological computer,&quot; which combines human brain cells with traditional silicon-based computing. The system, known as CL1, was presented at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and is being explored </description>

      <title>Fully-Specified Algorithms Specification Addressing Area Director Feedback</title>
      <link>https://self-issued.info/?p=2627</link>
      <description>Orie Steele and I want to thank Deb Cooley for her Area Director review of the “Fully-Specified Algorithms for JOSE and COSE” specification. Addressing it simplified the exposition, while preserving the essence of what the draft accomplishes. Specifically, the resulting draft significantly simplified the fully-specified encryption description and removed the appendix on polymorphic ECDH algorithms.</description>

      <description>A few years ago I abandoned Twitter in favor of Mastodon. Recent events validate that choice and underscore the strategic importance of a decentralized fediverse that can’t be owned by a single corporate or state actor. But while Mastodon meets my needs, much of the Twitter diaspora has gone to Bluesky. That’s fine for now … Continue reading Making the Fediverse More Accessible With Claude 3.7 Sonn</description>

 [Gaby Del Valle at The Verge]  This is dystopian:   &quot;The Trump administration may soon demand the social media accounts of people applying for green cards, US citizenship, and asylum or refugee status. US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) — the federal agency that oversees legal migration, proposed the new policy in the Federal Register this week — calling this infor</description>

 So, yes, hi, I have a Tesla. It’s a long range Model 3 which I bought in 2021.  After a career spent working on open source and mission-drive projects — right now I work for a non-profit newsroom; once upon a time I built a social networking platform for education — it might shock you to learn that I am not rich. I have never had a significant tech company equity package; I have never seen the b</description>

 [Andy Kroll at ProPublica]  Cutting the IRS has nothing to do with government efficiency:   &quot;Unlike with other federal agencies, cutting the IRS means the government collects less money and finds fewer tax abuses. Economic studies have shown that for every dollar spent by the IRS, the agency returns between $5 and $12, depending on how much income the taxpayer declared. A 2024 </description>

      <description> 
   Much of the last decade or two of the tech industry has been dominated by the idea of&amp;nbsp;the cloud: the simple, powerful idea that all of your applications and data can be accessed from any device with an internet connection. Enterprise businesses around the world have decommissioned server rooms in favor of subscribing to services maintained by other people, reducing overheads of all kinds.</description>

      <description>In this video I draw connections between Gestalt theory and organizational development as applied to digital groupthink in the context of Christiana Figueres, a leader in the development of carbon trading, who trained at the Gestalt Institute of Cleveland. As a young woman, she attended Swarthmore College, a Quaker institution. The first wife of her [...]</description>

      <description>Perhaps, even though they are not themselves explainable, AIs can help us engineer explainable systems. But I’m not optimistic. It feels like we’re on a path to keep making systems harder for humans to configure, and we keep expanding our reliance on superhuman intelligence to do that for us.

 “Extermination &amp;amp; Acts of Genocide”: Human Rights Watch on Israel Deliberately Depriving Gaza of Water

 BILL VAN ESVELD: This is the first time that we’ve made a finding of genocidal acts in Gaza. It is not an accusation that we level lightly. We have no</description>

      <description> こんにちは、富士榮です。     昨日はFIDO東京セミナーでしたね。私は台北にいたので参加できませんでしたが・・・  ということで悔しいので #fido でXを追いかけていましたが、えーじさんのパート（だと思う）で触れられていたっぽい「４分でパスキーを理解する」動画が素晴らしくわかりやすいかったのでメモしておこうというポストです。     ざっくりシナリオはこんな感じでした。    長らくパスワードを使ってきたけど、難しいパスワードは覚えられないし、同じパスワードの使い回しが起きるので危ないよね  そんなあなたにGoogleはパスワードマネージャを提供しているよ！  デバイスを跨いで同期されるのでとっても便利！  でも全員がパスワードマネージャに頼っているわけじゃないよね  その前にそもそもパスワードってセキュアじゃないよ  2段階認証はセキュリティ強度を上げるけど面倒だしなぁ  そんな</description>

And that, of course, puts additional pressure on these journalists</description>
