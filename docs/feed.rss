      <description> I published 🔗 Why Design Matters a few days ago tying the Ives/Collinson interview to some of the stuff I rattle on about. 
 I also referenced hesitations I have about Altman. 
 Today I watched the Ives/Altman video after that multi-billion … 
 
 acquisition (as Altman calls it) 
 merger (as Ives calls it) 
 
 As I added to that piece just this morning:

      <description> If your library doesn't have any documentation, it can't have any bugs. 
 Documentation specifies what your code is supposed to do. Your tests specify what it actually does. 
 Bugs exist when your test-enforced implementation fails to match the behavior described in your documentation.  Without documentation a bug is just undefined behavior. 
 If you aim to follow semantic versioning you bump your</description>

 Belichick’s ruthlessness, his overwhelming commitment to victory as the only essential thing - even at the cost of other tasks, responsibilities, and commitments - has made him a great coach, or at least a very successful one.

      <description> llm-pdf-to-images 
Inspired by my previous llm-video-frames plugin, I thought it would be neat to have a plugin for LLM that can take a PDF and turn that into an image-per-page so you can feed PDFs into models that support image inputs but don't yet support PDFs. 
 This should now do exactly that: 
  llm install llm-pdf-to-images
llm -f pdf-to-images:path/to/document.pdf 'Summarize this document' </description>

 The Vatican has had more Popes than the total number of years that ‘Merica has even existed .. Finally? 
 About 20% of ‘Merica refer to themselves as Catholics .. Finally? 
 It’s close to 1,000 years since a Pope hailed from the UK … Finally?

I've released a new version of my tool for creating annotated presentations. I use this to turn slides from my talks into posts like this one - here are a bunch more examples. 
 I wrote the first version in August 2023 making extensive use of ChatGPT and GPT-4. That older version can still be seen here.

Extremely useful review of the last year in vision and multi-modal LLMs. 
 So much has happened! I'm particularly excited about the range of small open weight vision models that are now available. Models like gemma3-4b-it and Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct produce very impressive results and run happily on mid-range consumer hardware.

      <title>Implement client assertions with client credentials flow using OAuth DPoP</title>
      <link>https://damienbod.com/2025/05/12/implement-client-assertions-with-client-credentials-flow-using-oauth-dpop/</link>
      <description>This blog looks at implementing client assertions for the client credentials flow using OAuth 2.0 Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession (DPoP). The client credentials flow is an OAuth 2.0 authorization grant type used for machine-to-machine authentication. DPoP further strengthens the security by ensuring that the client possesses a specific key at the time of the request, forcing […]</description>

 [Mark Mansour]  Stephen Miller, who the author rightly labels as the most dangerous person in America, has argued for removing a core constitutional right for millions of people on American soil. He wants to classify unauthorized immigration as an &quot;invasion&quot;.  It's insane, and is the precursor to yet more truly authoritarian policies.  As Mark writes:   &quot;Even if one were to acc</description>

 [Shakeil Price at The Marshall Project]  The technology situation for incarcerated people in the United States is beyond bad:   &quot;Because prison telecom vendors tend to bundle their services, corrections systems often contract with a single provider, regardless of quality. And dozens of states make “commissions” from user fees. Within this context, incarcerated people become the</description>

      <description> 
 I earn 5-10X what I did when I lived in the UK, but my quality of life is markedly worse. My whole thing boils down to: how can America have the same standard of living I grew up with?  For a lot of people, the idea of prosperity boils down to, “I can buy what I want,” not, “I can live how I want.” The latter is the one that matters: that’s what freedom actually is.  National healthcare works (o</description>

 [Henry Blodget]  Henry Blodget, former co-founder of Business Insider, has started a new, &quot;AI-native&quot; newsroom. It's not, in my opinion, a positive use of AI, but it does indicate how some people are thinking about using the technology.  This apparently includes harassing your newly-created virtual employees:   &quot;This might be an inappropriate and unprofessional thing to say. An</description>

      <description>Permit.io just published the results of a survey they conducted with over 200 developers on access control. There's lots of good data there, but one thing that struck me is that over 50% of developers said that they've never used any of the popular policy languages.

How can you give permission to someone if you can’t 'name' them in a way that is verifiable and resistant to subversion? There's no po</description>

      <description>I took notes on Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz’s post-election discussion of their Fairshake pro-crypto Pac and the coming Trump presidency about two months ago, but set them aside and other topics took precedence. Given the rising craziness in the crypto space around the inauguration, I thought it was a good time to put them [...]</description>

      <title>Trump Dance, Oscillation, And Going “Inside”</title>
      <link>https://wrenchinthegears.com/2025/01/18/trump-dance-oscillation-and-going-inside/</link>
      <description>In this morning’s video I somehow missed the fact that the inauguration coincides with MLK Day, which is an interesting sync with the “melanin as optical material” lens. I’m going to drop a few links to old blog posts that touch on the YMCA and “out of school time learning” as as well as my [...]</description>

      <title>Gestalt, Quakers and Carbon Trading – Do You See Faces Or A Vase?</title>

      <description>In this video I draw connections between Gestalt theory and organizational development as applied to digital groupthink in the context of Christiana Figueres, a leader in the development of carbon trading, who trained at the Gestalt Institute of Cleveland. As a young woman, she attended Swarthmore College, a Quaker institution. The first wife of her [...]</description>

      <title>The Configuration Crisis</title>
      <link>https://blog.jonudell.net/2025/01/14/the-configuration-crisis/</link>
      <description>Perhaps, even though they are not themselves explainable, AIs can help us engineer explainable systems. But I’m not optimistic. It feels like we’re on a path to keep making systems harder for humans to configure, and we keep expanding our reliance on superhuman intelligence to do that for us. The Configuration Crisis and Developer Dependency … Continue reading The Configuration Crisis</description>

      <description> Part 2: Issuing&amp;nbsp;Badges  In part one of this series, we discussed how the trust model of Open Badges 3.0 differs from earlier versions. Credentials issued as Open Badges 3.0 are based on the W3C Verifiable Credentials data model which describes how claims made online can be&amp;nbsp;proven.  To explore this trust model, let’s explore the story of Olivia who has been taking classes at a local commu</description>

      <title>ECDSAに対応したゼロ知識証明の論文がGoogleから出ています</title>

      <description> こんにちは、富士榮です。  AAMVAのモバイル運転免許証のガイドラインでも触れましたが、mdocやSD-JWTのリンク可能性へ対応するためには今後ゼロ知識証明が大切になります。  年末にGoogleの研究者が  Anonymous credentials from ECDSA  というタイトルでペーパーを出しています。  https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/2010    AIでイラスト生成すると色々とおかしなことになって面白いですねw    アブストラクトの中からポイントを抜粋すると、従来のBBS+では暗号スイートへの対応に関する要件が厳しかったのでレガシーで対応できるようにECDSAでもできるようにしたよ、ということのようですね。   Part of the difficulty arises because schemes in the literature,</description>

      <description> In this post, I cover using LlamaIndex LlamaParse in auto mode to parse a PDF page containing a table, using a Hugging Face local embedding model, and using local Llama 3.1 8b via Ollama to perform naive Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). That’s a mouthful. I won’t go into how to setup Ollama and Llama 3.1 8b; this post assumes it is&amp;nbsp;running.  First off, you can find the code for this in m</description>

 As I just registered for a new season of beer league hockey starting this weekend, I thought about an episode of C’est comme ça que je t’aime I recently watched which is set in 1974 Sainte-Foy, Quebec City.  Nearly all the 1974 Quebec cultural references are new to me and in this episode, there is an adventure in a hockey arena and you can pause the video in a few places and see signage in the</description>

I expect part 2 to be LlamaIndex with Ollama and Llama3–8b as the LLM components.  This is a very sho</description>
