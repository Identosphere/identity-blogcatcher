 It’s a Harlan Coban. It should have been great. It wasn’t. I am increasingly finding that his stuff falls into 2 star or 4 star. This is the former. I didn’t care about the people. The mystery wasn’t really that much of a mystery. 
 Yeah … Nah.

      <description>  My advice about using AI is simple: use AI as an assistant, not an expert, and use it judiciously. Some people will object, “but AI can be wrong!” Yes, and so can the internet in general, but no one now recommends avoiding online resources because they can be wrong. They recommend taking it all with a grain of salt and being careful. That’s what you should do with AI help as well.

      <description> Function calling with Gemma 
Google's Gemma 3 model (the 27B variant is particularly capable, I've been trying it out via Ollama) supports function calling exclusively through prompt engineering. The official documentation describes two recommended prompts - both of them suggest that the tool definitions are passed in as JSON schema, but the way the model should request tool executions differs.

      <description>  We estimate the supply-side value of widely-used OSS is $4.15 billion, but that the demand-side value is much larger at $8.8 trillion. We find that firms would need to spend 3.5 times more on software than they currently do if OSS did not exist.

      <description>  Today we’re excited to launch ARC-AGI-2 to challenge the new frontier. ARC-AGI-2 is even harder for AI (in particular, AI reasoning systems), while maintaining the same relative ease for humans. Pure LLMs score 0% on ARC-AGI-2, and public AI reasoning systems achieve only single-digit percentage scores. In contrast, every task in ARC-AGI-2 has been solved by at least 2 humans in under 2 attempts.</description>

The Playwright team at Microsoft have released an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server wrapping Playwright, and it's pretty fascinating. 
 They implemented it on top of the Chrome accessibility tree, so MCP clients (such as the Claude Desktop app) can use it to drive an automated browser and use the accessibility tree to read and navigate pages that they visit.

I setup a GitHub Actions + GitHub Pages Atom feed of scraped recent models data from the Ollama latest models page - Ollama remains one of the easiest ways to run models on a laptop so a new model release from them is worth hearing about. 
 I built the scraper by pasting example HTML into Claude and asking for a Python script to convert it to Atom - here's the scrip</description>

      <description> The &quot;think&quot; tool: Enabling Claude to stop and think in complex tool use situations 
Fascinating new prompt engineering trick from Anthropic. They use their standard tool calling mechanism to define a tool called &quot;think&quot; that looks something like this: 
  {
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;think&quot;,

      <title>New audio models from OpenAI, but how much can we rely on them?</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/20/new-openai-audio-models/#atom-everything</link>
      <description> OpenAI announced several new audio-related API features today, for both text-to-speech and speech-to-text. They're very promising new models, but they appear to suffer from the ever-present risk of accidental (or malicious) instruction following.

Claude 3.7 Sonnet on the paid plan now has a web search tool that can be turned on as a global setting. 
 This was sorely needed. ChatGPT, Gemini and Grok all had this ability already, and despite Anthropic's excellent model quality it was one of the big remaining reasons to keep other models in daily rotation.

OpenAI have a new most-expensive model: o1-pro can now be accessed through their API at a hefty $150/million tokens for input and $600/million tokens for output. That's 10x the price of their o1 and o1-preview models and a full 1,000x times more expensive than their cheapest model, gpt-4o-mini!

      <description> こんにちは、富士榮です。     昨日はFIDO東京セミナーでしたね。私は台北にいたので参加できませんでしたが・・・  ということで悔しいので #fido でXを追いかけていましたが、えーじさんのパート（だと思う）で触れられていたっぽい「４分でパスキーを理解する」動画が素晴らしくわかりやすいかったのでメモしておこうというポストです。     ざっくりシナリオはこんな感じでした。    長らくパスワードを使ってきたけど、難しいパスワードは覚えられないし、同じパスワードの使い回しが起きるので危ないよね  そんなあなたにGoogleはパスワードマネージャを提供しているよ！  デバイスを跨いで同期されるのでとっても便利！  でも全員がパスワードマネージャに頼っているわけじゃないよね  その前にそもそもパスワードってセキュアじゃないよ  2段階認証はセキュリティ強度を上げるけど面倒だしなぁ  そんな</description>

      <description> Many digital identity proponents love the meme “the internet was built without an identity layer” and claim this as a bug to defend the need for a universal digital identity system. They’ve got it wrong though. This is a feature of the Web that has allowed the Web to flourish not a bug that must be fixed. The reason we should be preserving it extends beyond privacy and is more than ever relevant t</description>

 Jodie Ginsberg, CPJ’s chief executive officer: 

 
   No journalist from outside Gaza has been allowed in since the start of that war, and that’s highly unusual. I speak to lots of war correspondents who’s covered many, many wars over decades, and all of them talk about how unprecedented this is to not have any access whatsoever. And that, of course, puts additional pressure on these journalists</description>

      <description> I was recently experimenting with CrewAI, but in one experiment I wanted to use a local LLM hosted by LM Studio. Why LMStudio? Well… because that was the experiment. I wanted to see how I’d use LMStudio to host my model versus Ollama and then use it from CrewAI. Below is a very simple setup for doing&amp;nbsp;this.  It’s good to point out that CrewAI uses LiteLLM under the hood as a sort of proxy. Thi</description>
