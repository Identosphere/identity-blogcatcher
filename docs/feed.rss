      <title>Function calling with Gemma</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/26/function-calling-with-gemma/#atom-everything</link>
      <description> Function calling with Gemma 
Google's Gemma 3 model (the 27B variant is particularly capable, I've been trying it out via Ollama) supports function calling exclusively through prompt engineering. The official documentation describes two recommended prompts - both of them suggest that the tool definitions are passed in as JSON schema, but the way the model should request tool executions differs.

 [Joshua Kaplan and Justin Elliott at ProPublica]  I bet this practice is more common than anyone might think, and certainly isn't limited to China.

      <description>  We estimate the supply-side value of widely-used OSS is $4.15 billion, but that the demand-side value is much larger at $8.8 trillion. We find that firms would need to spend 3.5 times more on software than they currently do if OSS did not exist.

      <description> Introducing 4o Image Generation 
When OpenAI first announced GPT-4o back in May 2024 one of the most exciting features was true multi-modality in that it could both input and  output audio and images. The &quot;o&quot; stood for &quot;omni&quot;, and the image output examples in that launch post looked really impressive.

      <description>  Today we’re excited to launch ARC-AGI-2 to challenge the new frontier. ARC-AGI-2 is even harder for AI (in particular, AI reasoning systems), while maintaining the same relative ease for humans. Pure LLMs score 0% on ARC-AGI-2, and public AI reasoning systems achieve only single-digit percentage scores. In contrast, every task in ARC-AGI-2 has been solved by at least 2 humans in under 2 attempts.</description>

The Playwright team at Microsoft have released an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server wrapping Playwright, and it's pretty fascinating. 
 They implemented it on top of the Chrome accessibility tree, so MCP clients (such as the Claude Desktop app) can use it to drive an automated browser and use the accessibility tree to read and navigate pages that they visit.

 If you used the service, maybe keep an eye on what happens to your data if the company goes under or is sold off. The California attorney general issued a customer alert with instructions on how delete your data, destroy your sample, and revoke data permissions.

 See, agency is a noun, and agentic is an adjective. 
 
 But that isn’t really the trust of his main argument.

      <title>New audio models from OpenAI, but how much can we rely on them?</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/20/new-openai-audio-models/#atom-everything</link>
      <description> OpenAI announced several new audio-related API features today, for both text-to-speech and speech-to-text. They're very promising new models, but they appear to suffer from the ever-present risk of accidental (or malicious) instruction following. 

 gpt-4o-mini-tts 

 gpt-4o-mini-tts is a brand new text-to-speech model with &quot;better steerability&quot;. OpenAI released a delightful new playground interfa</description>

Claude 3.7 Sonnet on the paid plan now has a web search tool that can be turned on as a global setting. 
 This was sorely needed. ChatGPT, Gemini and Grok all had this ability already, and despite Anthropic's excellent model quality it was one of the big remaining reasons to keep other models in daily rotation.

      <description> After 192 posts that ranged from weekly to roughly once-a-month, I've decided to call a wrap on my weeknotes habit.

 [Mike Monteiro]  On whether it's always been this bad in America:   &quot;America was born in blood, genocide, kidnapping, and death. Behind every story we were told about America’s greatness, there is a secret second painting. A thing America doesn’t want you to see. Behind every “from sea to shining sea” there is a Trail of Tears. Behind every first pitch at Dodger Stadium there’s</description>

      <description> My first love was self-sovereign distributed data, where each person owns and controls their data, hosting it wherever they choose and permissioning it under their own terms. But I got lost in the complexity of building a robust distributed identity infrastructure. How can you give permission to someone if you can’t 'name' them in a way that is verifiable and resistant to subversion? There's no po</description>

      <description> こんにちは、富士榮です。     昨日はFIDO東京セミナーでしたね。私は台北にいたので参加できませんでしたが・・・  ということで悔しいので #fido でXを追いかけていましたが、えーじさんのパート（だと思う）で触れられていたっぽい「４分でパスキーを理解する」動画が素晴らしくわかりやすいかったのでメモしておこうというポストです。     ざっくりシナリオはこんな感じでした。    長らくパスワードを使ってきたけど、難しいパスワードは覚えられないし、同じパスワードの使い回しが起きるので危ないよね  そんなあなたにGoogleはパスワードマネージャを提供しているよ！  デバイスを跨いで同期されるのでとっても便利！  でも全員がパスワードマネージャに頼っているわけじゃないよね  その前にそもそもパスワードってセキュアじゃないよ  2段階認証はセキュリティ強度を上げるけど面倒だしなぁ  そんな</description>

      <description> Many digital identity proponents love the meme “the internet was built without an identity layer” and claim this as a bug to defend the need for a universal digital identity system. They’ve got it wrong though. This is a feature of the Web that has allowed the Web to flourish not a bug that must be fixed. The reason we should be preserving it extends beyond privacy and is more than ever relevant t</description>
