      <link>https://doc.searls.com/2025/01/07/on-the-palisades-and-eaton-fires/</link>
      <description>We’re watching KABC/7 from Los Angeles, live on our Roku TV (which has it among hundreds of “Live TV” channels), and in a browser on this laptop. One screen grab: Fire.ca.gov has much information, and maps. Here’s one for the Palisades fire: Winds are so strong that there is no fire fighting on the front […]</description>

      <description> Why are my live regions not working? 
Useful article to help understand ARIA live regions. Short version: you can add a live region to your page like this: 
 &amp;lt;div id=&quot;notification&quot; aria-live=&quot;assertive&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 
 Then any time you use JavaScript to modify the text content in that element it will be announced straight away by any screen readers - that's the &quot;assertive&quot; part. Using &quot;poli</description>

I couldn't figure out how to upgrade the version of Python 3.13 I had previous installed using uv - I had Python 3.13.0.rc2. Thanks to Charlie Marsh I learned the command for upgrading to the latest uv-supported release: 
 uv python install --reinstall 3.13
 
 I can confirm it worked using: 
 uv run --python 3.13 python -c 'import sys; print(sys.version)'

      <description>  I followed this curiosity, to see if a tool that can generate something mostly not wrong most of the time could be a net benefit in my daily work. The answer appears to be yes, generative models are useful for me when I program. It has not been easy to get to this point.

 [Alex Weprin at The Hollywood Reporter]  I don't think this is a great thing at all:   &quot;Meta will also move its trust and safety and content moderation teams out of California, with content review to be based in Texas. “As we work to promote free expression, I think that will help us build trust to do this work in places where there is less concern about the bias of our teams,”</description>

Carson Gross and Alex Petros lay out an ambitious plan for htmx: stay stable, add few features and try to earn the same reputation for longevity that jQuery has (estimated to be used on 75.3% of websites).

Neal Agarwal just created the worst webpage. It's extraordinary. As far as I can tell all of the audio was created specially for this project, so absolutely listen in to the true crime podcast and other delightfully weird little details.

      <description> Using LLMs and Cursor to become a finisher 
Zohaib Rauf describes a pattern I've seen quite a few examples of now: engineers who moved into management but now find themselves able to ship working code again (at least for their side projects) thanks to the productivity boost they get from leaning on LLMs. 
 Zohaib also provides a very useful detailed example of how they use a combination of ChatGPT</description>

      <description> What we learned copying all the best code assistants 
Steve Krouse describes Val Town's experience so far building features that use LLMs, starting with completions (powered by Codeium and Val Town's own codemirror-codeium extension) and then rolling through several versions of their Townie code assistant, initially powered by GPT 3.5 but later upgraded to Claude 3.5 Sonnet. 
 This is a really int</description>

      <title>Quoting Ethan Mollick</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/4/ethan-mollick/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>  I know these are real risks, and to be clear, when I say an AI “thinks,” “learns,” “understands,” “decides,” or “feels,” I’m speaking metaphorically. Current AI systems don’t have a consciousness, emotions, a sense of self, or physical sensations. So why take the risk? Because as imperfect as the analogy is, working with AI is easiest if you think of it like an alien person rather than a human-bu</description>

      <description> Friday Squid Blogging: Anniversary Post 
Bruce Schneier: 
 
 I made my first squid post nineteen years ago this week. Between then and now, I posted something about squid every week (with maybe only a few exceptions). There is a lot out there about squid, even more if you count the other meanings of the word. 
 
 I think that's 1,004 posts about squid in 19 years. Talk about a legendary streak!

 [Things we learned about LLMs in 2024]  Simon's overview of what happened in the LLM space during 2024 is genuinely excellent. For example, on the environmental impact:   &quot;Companies like Google, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon are all spending billions of dollars rolling out new datacenters, with a very material impact on the electricity grid and the environment. There’s even talk o</description>

      <description> A year ago today I wrote about Tom Scott's legendary 10 year YouTube streak, in which he posted a new video once a week for the next ten years. Inspired by that, I also started my own. 
 I set myself the goal of posting something to my blog every day for a year. 
 Given how much happened in my chosen field of Large Language Models over the course of 2024 this wasn't as hard as I had expected!

      <description> Timeline of AI model releases in 2024 
VB assembled this detailed timeline of every significant AI model release in 2024, for both API and open weight models. 
  
 I'd hoped to include something like this in my 2024 review - I'm glad I didn't bother, because VB's is way better than anything I had planned. 
 VB built it with assistance from DeepSeek v3, incorporating data from this Artificial Intel</description>

      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/31/llms-in-2024/#atom-everything</link>
      <description> A lot has happened in the world of Large Language Models over the course of 2024. Here's a review of things we figured out about the field in the past twelve months, plus my attempt at identifying key themes and pivotal moments. 
 This is a sequel to my review of 2023.

   As a child, I freaking adored&amp;nbsp;Tintin, the Belgian comic strip about a boy detective and his little white dog, Snowy. There was something intoxicating about the mix: international adventures, a growing cast of recurring characters, conspiracies, humor, hi jinx. Even the ligne claire style of drawing — cartoonish figures on more realistic, epic backgrounds — lent themselves to a feeling of </description>

      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/31/alexis-gallagher/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>  Basically, a frontier model like OpenAI’s O1 is like a Ferrari SF-23. It’s an obvious triumph of engineering, designed to win races, and that’s why we talk about it. But it takes a special pit crew just to change the tires and you can’t buy one for yourself. In contrast, a BERT model is like a Honda Civic. It’s also an engineering triumph, but more subtly, since it is engineered to be affordable,</description>

 [Hunter Walk]  As Hunter points out, it's impossible to start a company without tackling sales, and you aren't absolved from it no matter which route you take:   &quot;If you avoid sales or are poor at it, you are doing a disservice to your team, your cofounder and yourself. You are unintentionally lowering the ceiling on outcome or making it even harder to succeed.&quot;   I'm the least</description>

      <description>  There is no technical moat in this field, and so OpenAI is the epicenter of an investment bubble. 
 Thus, effectively, OpenAI is to this decade’s generative-AI revolution what Netscape was to the 1990s’ internet revolution. The revolution is real, but it’s ultimately going to be a commodity technology layer, not the foundation of a defensible proprietary moat. In 1995 investors mistakenly thought</description>

 [Aishvarya Kavi]  President Biden commuted the sentences of all but three prisoners on federal death row. (He doesn't have the power to pardon or commute the sentences of people held on state charges.)  This is also good:   &quot;The president campaigned in 2020 on ending the federal death penalty.

 [OpenStreetMap]  Meta has contributed 178,710 Euros (an oddly specific number!) to OpenStreetMap.  On one level: hooray for people contributing to open source.  On another: Meta has a $1.5 Trillion market cap and uses OpenStreetMap in multiple applications. To be fair, it also provides direct non-monetary contributions, but regardless, when all is said and done, it's a bargain.</description>

      <description> こんにちは、富士榮です。     昨日はFIDO東京セミナーでしたね。私は台北にいたので参加できませんでしたが・・・  ということで悔しいので #fido でXを追いかけていましたが、えーじさんのパート（だと思う）で触れられていたっぽい「４分でパスキーを理解する」動画が素晴らしくわかりやすいかったのでメモしておこうというポストです。     ざっくりシナリオはこんな感じでした。    長らくパスワードを使ってきたけど、難しいパスワードは覚えられないし、同じパスワードの使い回しが起きるので危ないよね  そんなあなたにGoogleはパスワードマネージャを提供しているよ！  デバイスを跨いで同期されるのでとっても便利！  でも全員がパスワードマネージャに頼っているわけじゃないよね  その前にそもそもパスワードってセキュアじゃないよ  2段階認証はセキュリティ強度を上げるけど面倒だしなぁ  そんな</description>

 Jodie Ginsberg, CPJ’s chief executive officer: 

 
   No journalist from outside Gaza has been allowed in since the start of that war, and that’s highly unusual. I speak to lots of war correspondents who’s covered many, many wars over decades, and all of them talk about how unprecedented this is to not have any access whatsoever.

      <description> I was recently experimenting with CrewAI, but in one experiment I wanted to use a local LLM hosted by LM Studio. Why LMStudio? Well… because that was the experiment. I wanted to see how I’d use LMStudio to host my model versus Ollama and then use it from CrewAI. Below is a very simple setup for doing&amp;nbsp;this.  It’s good to point out that CrewAI uses LiteLLM under the hood as a sort of proxy. Thi</description>

      <description> One of the problems I have encountered in trying to do Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) where a complete single document was not uploaded for queries on that document alone is that chunks created from documents for embedding often lose context.

But when we make a bubble in our federated network, we aren’t just making a stand-alone system that can go live in a fully disconnected state. Over time, we expect things to re-connect, and when that happens, data needs to be harmonized across the boundaries. So many bubbles, so</description>
