      <title>Use client assertions in OpenID Connect and ASP.NET Core</title>
      <link>https://damienbod.com/2025/02/24/use-client-assertions-in-openid-connect-and-asp-net-core/</link>
      <description>Client assertions is a method of client authentication which can be used in OpenID Connect. This provides an alternative to client secrets. This approach enhances security by using signed tokens (JWTs) to authenticate clients during the token request process or the OAuth PAR request. In ASP.NET Core, client assertions is not supported per default, a […]</description>

 [Dan Sinker]  This story doesn't feel like it's going to end up inspiring, but bear with it:   &quot;George Dale printed their names in his newspaper, part of his unrelenting, unceasing, and unflinching attack on the Muncie Klan.  [...] When he wrote an editorial accusing circuit court judge Clarence Dearth of being a Klansman and stacking his juries with Klansmen, that judge sent D</description>

      <description>On the left is Tom Evslin, former CTO for Vermont, among many other distinctions. On the right is the golden dome atop Vermont’s capitol building. Underneath that dome, and in countless spaces in government bodies everywhere are meetings recorded in video. Reviewing or reporting on those meetings is a chore. Unless, that is, you use […]</description>

 [Bert Hubert]  A European point of view:   &quot;We now have the bizarre situation that anyone with any sense can see that America is no longer a reliable partner, and that the entire US business world bows to Trump’s dictatorial will, but we STILL are doing everything we can to transfer entire governments and most of our own businesses to their clouds.  Not only is it scary to have</description>

 Hint: if a party is heavily supported by people who throw Nazi salutes, it might not be up to much good.  Some voters for new right-wing parties are economically worried, but blame their issues on the influx of immigrants rather than the increasing divides between rich and poor that we're seeing globally. They're looking for right-wing answers to their economic worries - racism like anti-immigra</description>

      <description> Grok 3 is highly vulnerable to indirect prompt injection 
xAI's new Grok 3 is so far exclusively deployed on Twitter (aka &quot;X&quot;), and apparently uses its ability to search for relevant tweets as part of every response. 
 This is one of the most hostile environments I could imagine with respect to prompt injection attacks!

New TIL. I started running a git scraper against doge.gov to track changes made to that website over time. The DOGE site runs behind Cloudflare which was blocking requests from the GitHub Actions IP range, but I figured out how to run a Tailscale exit node on my Apple TV and use that to proxy my shot-scraper requests.

      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/20/joanna-bryson/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>  There are contexts in which it is immoral to use generative AI. For example, if you are a judge responsible for grounding a decision in law, you cannot rest that on an approximation of previous cases unknown to you. You want an AI system that helps you retrieve specific, well-documented cases, not one that confabulates fictional cases. You need to ensure you procure the right kind of AI for a tas</description>

      <description>A little over a week ago - I threw out 🖇️ this little billy do onto my blog and thought nothing of it. To save you the click through I was just pointing out some internet speeds I was experiencing - and asked what my response should be.

      <description> Using S3 triggers to maintain a list of files in DynamoDB 
I built an experimental prototype this morning of a system for efficiently tracking files that have been added to a large S3 bucket by maintaining a parallel DynamoDB table using S3 triggers and AWS lambda. 
 I got 80% of the way there with this single prompt (complete with typos) to my custom Claude Project:

      <description>  Can I still use my Ai Pin for offline features? 
 Yes. After February 28, 2025, Ai Pin will still allow for offline features like battery level, etc., but will not include any function that requires cloud connectivity like voice interactions, AI responses, and .Center access.

 [Alissa Quart in Columbia Journalism Review]  This article cuts right to the core of why media is failing to connect with mass audiences in America. It doesn't report from a perspective that they can identify with - largely because it doesn't hire people like them.   What would working-class media look like?   &quot;It would be one where economic reporters are embedded in blue-colla</description>

 Almost 20 years later, @simon’s RegExp.escape idea comes to fruition. This reached “Stage 4” at ECMA TC-39 just now, which formalizes that multiple browsers have shipped the feature and it’s in the next revision of the JavaScript specification.

 [PJ Onori]  I can't disagree with anything here:   &quot;Web 2.0 seemed like such a great idea in a more innocent time. We’re at a point where it’s only prudent to view third-parties as guilty until proven innocent. Not as some abstract, principled stance, but for our own direct benefit.

The fix is to use BEGIN IMMEDIATE if you know your transaction is going to m</description>

 [Miriam Eric Suzanne]  Every single word of this piece resonated for me, from the underlying discomfort to the realization that AI as it currently manifests reflects a kind of fascist mindset in itself: an enclosure movement of culture and diversity that concentrates power into a handful of vendors.  This is true of me too:   &quot;Based on every conference I’ve attended over the la</description>

      <title>Quoting Kevin Samuel</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/15/kevin-samuel/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>  [...] if your situation allows it, always try uv first. Then fall back on something else if that doesn’t work out. 
 It is the Pareto solution because it's easier than trying to figure out what you should do and you will rarely regret it. Indeed, the cost of moving to and from it is low, but the value it delivers is quite high.

      <description>Somebody just gave the 31st upvote to my answer to the Quora question “What do you regret as you get older?” So I thought it might be worth repeating. Here’s a short list: Not learning at least one other language. Not learning a musical instrument (or to sing) well enough to play in a group. […]</description>

      <description> Cerebras brings instant inference to Mistral Le Chat 
Mistral announced a major upgrade to their Le Chat web UI (their version of ChatGPT) a few days ago, and one of the signature features was performance. 
 It turns out that performance boost comes from hosting their model on Cerebras:

      <title>Quoting Sam Altman</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/9/sam-altman/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>  The cost to use a given level of AI falls about 10x every 12 months, and lower prices lead to much more use. You can see this in the token cost from GPT-4 in early 2023 to GPT-4o in mid-2024, where the price per token dropped about 150x in that time period. Moore’s law changed the world at 2x every 18 months; this is unbelievably stronger.

 We are destroying software with an absurd chain of dependencies, making everything bloated and fragile. 
 We are destroying software telling new programmers: “Don’t reinvent the wheel!”. But, reinventing the wheel is how you learn how things work, and is the first step to make new, different wheels. [...]

Since the launch of DeepSeek's web experience and its positive reception, we realize now that was a mistake. From now on, we're also showing v0's full output in every response. This is a much better UX because it feels faster and it teaches end users how to prompt more effectively.

      <description>I took notes on Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz’s post-election discussion of their Fairshake pro-crypto Pac and the coming Trump presidency about two months ago, but set them aside and other topics took precedence.

      <description>Perhaps, even though they are not themselves explainable, AIs can help us engineer explainable systems. But I’m not optimistic. It feels like we’re on a path to keep making systems harder for humans to configure, and we keep expanding our reliance on superhuman intelligence to do that for us.

      <title>Googleが公開している「４分でパスキーを理解する」動画が素晴らしい件</title>
      <link>https://idmlab.eidentity.jp/2024/12/google.html</link>
      <description> こんにちは、富士榮です。     昨日はFIDO東京セミナーでしたね。私は台北にいたので参加できませんでしたが・・・  ということで悔しいので #fido でXを追いかけていましたが、えーじさんのパート（だと思う）で触れられていたっぽい「４分でパスキーを理解する」動画が素晴らしくわかりやすいかったのでメモしておこうというポストです。     ざっくりシナリオはこんな感じでした。    長らくパスワードを使ってきたけど、難しいパスワードは覚えられないし、同じパスワードの使い回しが起きるので危ないよね  そんなあなたにGoogleはパスワードマネージャを提供しているよ！  デバイスを跨いで同期されるのでとっても便利！  でも全員がパスワードマネージャに頼っているわけじゃないよね  その前にそもそもパスワードってセキュアじゃないよ  2段階認証はセキュリティ強度を上げるけど面倒だしなぁ  そんな</description>

      <description> こんにちは、富士榮です。  先日、東京サミットのレポートが出た、という話を書いた段階ではまだワシントンDCレポートが出ていなかったので順番が逆になっちゃたなぁ、みたいなことを思っていたのですが、ポストを公開した直後にワシントンDCのレポートも公開されました。     他のレポートと同じく、こちらのページからダウンロードできますので、おいおい読んでいこうと思います。  https://sidi-hub.community/summits/    </description>

      <description>こんにちは、富士榮です。    今週私は台湾にいるわけですが、USではGartnerサミットが開催されています。  その場でShare Signals Frameworkの相互運用検証に関するイベント（実際に実装を持ち寄って繋いでみる）が行われています。        https://openid.net/oidf-returns-to-gartner-to-showcase-shared-signals-interoperability/     過去にも何度か実施されており、非常に良い結果が出ていますので、今回も色々な実装を繋いだ結果が出てくることを楽しみにしています。  特にSSFのような仕組みは複数の事業者の実装が相互に接続できないと何の意味もないものなので、良い取り組みだと思います。     そういえば、Identity Dance Advent Calendarの中でGoogle</description>

The two agent, two task package queries for news information on CrewAI and the</description>

      <description>

 Jodie Ginsberg, CPJ’s chief executive officer: 

 
   No journalist from outside Gaza has been allowed in since the start of that war, and that’s highly unusual. I speak to lots of war correspondents who’s covered many, many wars over decades, and all of them talk about how unprecedented this is to not have any access whatsoever. And that, of course, puts additional pressure on these journalists</description>

      <description> I was recently experimenting with CrewAI, but in one experiment I wanted to use a local LLM hosted by LM Studio. Why LMStudio? Well… because that was the experiment. I wanted to see how I’d use LMStudio to host my model versus Ollama and then use it from CrewAI. Below is a very simple setup for doing&amp;nbsp;this.  It’s good to point out that CrewAI uses LiteLLM under the hood as a sort of proxy. Thi</description>
