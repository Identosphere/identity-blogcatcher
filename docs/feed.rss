      <description>Today I realized that even though the Web3 program is ramping up as demonstrated by Silicon Valley’s plans to turn Argentina into a “network state,” few understand what is unfolding with cybernetic governance. For that reason, I decided to take time off this spring to work on my garden and simply be with real people [...]</description>

I found out this morning that OpenRouter include support for a number of (rate-limited) free API models. 
 I occasionally run workshops on top of LLMs (like this one) and being able to provide students with a quick way to obtain an API key against models where they don't have to setup billing is really valuable to me!

      <description>  It seems to me that &quot;vibe checks&quot; for how smart a model feels are easily gameable by making it have a better personality. 
 My guess is that it's most of the reason Sonnet 3.5.1 was so beloved. Its personality was made much more appealing, compared to e. g. OpenAI's corporate drones. [...]

 Why does H3 use hexagons? Because Hexagons are the Bestagons: 
 
 When hexagons come together, they form three-sided joints 120 degrees apart. This, for the least material, is the most mechanically stable arrangement.

      <description> Will the future of software development run on vibes? 
I got a few quotes in this piece by Benj Edwards about vibe coding, the term Andrej Karpathy coined for when you prompt an LLM to write code, accept all changes and keep feeding it prompts and error messages and see what you can get it to build. 
 Here's what I originally sent to Benj:

 [Andy Kroll at ProPublica]  Cutting the IRS has nothing to do with government efficiency:   &quot;Unlike with other federal agencies, cutting the IRS means the government collects less money and finds fewer tax abuses. Economic studies have shown that for every dollar spent by the IRS, the agency returns between $5 and $12, depending on how much income the taxpayer declared. A 2024 </description>

 [Ghost]  Another really great update from the Ghost team about their progress implementing ActivityPub:   &quot;In our logs, that looks like our average request time dropping from 5+ seconds, to ~50ms:  [...] There are still a few places where we're using the old database architecture that remain slow. We're not out of the woods just yet. Within the next couple of weeks, though, the</description>

      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/2/ethan-mollick/#atom-everything</link>
      <description>  After publishing this piece, I was contacted by Anthropic who told me that Sonnet 3.7 would not be considered a 10^26 FLOP model and cost a few tens of millions of dollars to train, though future models will be much bigger.

   I’ve seen a lot&amp;nbsp;of this sentiment lately, and can relate:   I miss being excited by technology. I wish I could see a way out of the endless hype cycles that continue to elicit little more than cynicism from me. The version of technology that we’re mostly being sold today has almost nothing to do with improving lives, but instead stuffing the pockets of those who already need for nothing. </description>

      <description> I was a guest on the most recent episode of the Accessibility + Gen AI Podcast, hosted by Eamon McErlean and Joe Devon. We had a really fun, wide-ranging conversation about a host of different topics. I've extracted a few choice quotes from the transcript.

 [Natalie Alms at Nextgov/FCW]  I'd say this was an unbelievable own-goal. But, unfortunately, it's believable:   &quot;The General Services Administration deleted 18F, a government tech consultancy that helps other agencies with their technology, early Saturday morning.

 [Mel Leonor Barclay and Jasmine Mithani at The 19th]  The impact of this will be severe:   &quot;Organizations that provide services to LGBTQ+ victims of domestic and intimate partner violence expect much of the federal funding they rely on to dry up as the Trump administration’s executive orders target the work they have been carrying out for years.

 [Anna Betts in The Guardian]  He's not wrong:   &quot;Marty Baron, a highly regarded former editor of the Washington Post, has said that Jeff Bezos’s announcement that the newspaper’s opinion section would narrow its editorial focus was a “betrayal of the very idea of free expression” that had left him “appalled”.&quot;   &quot;Democracy dies in darkness&quot; indeed:   &quot;“If you’re trying to advan</description>

      <description>I took notes on Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz’s post-election discussion of their Fairshake pro-crypto Pac and the coming Trump presidency about two months ago, but set them aside and other topics took precedence. Given the rising craziness in the crypto space around the inauguration, I thought it was a good time to put them [...]</description>

      <description>In this morning’s video I somehow missed the fact that the inauguration coincides with MLK Day, which is an interesting sync with the “melanin as optical material” lens.

      <description>Perhaps, even though they are not themselves explainable, AIs can help us engineer explainable systems. But I’m not optimistic. It feels like we’re on a path to keep making systems harder for humans to configure, and we keep expanding our reliance on superhuman intelligence to do that for us.

      <description> In this post, I cover using LlamaIndex LlamaParse in auto mode to parse a PDF page containing a table, using a Hugging Face local embedding model, and using local Llama 3.1 8b via Ollama to perform naive Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
