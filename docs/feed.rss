      <description> From Async/Await to Virtual Threads 
Armin Ronacher has long been critical of async/await in Python, both for necessitating colored functions and because of the more subtle challenges they introduce like managing back pressure. 
 Armin argued convincingly for the threaded programming model back in December. Now he's expanded upon that with a description of how virtual threads might make sense in P</description>

      <description> Ollama's new app 
Ollama has been one of my favorite ways to run local models for a while - it makes it really easy to download models, and it's smart about keeping them resident in memory while they are being used and then cleaning them out after they stop receiving traffic. 
 The one missing feature to date has been an interface: Ollama has been exclusively command-line, which is fine for the CL</description>

      <description>  When you vibe code, you are incurring tech debt as fast as the LLM can spit it out. Which is why vibe coding is perfect for prototypes and throwaway projects: It's only legacy code if you have to maintain it!&amp;nbsp;[...]

      <description> Something that has become undeniable this month is that the best available open weight models now come from the Chinese AI labs. 
 I continue to have a lot of love for Mistral, Gemma and Llama but my feeling is that Qwen, Moonshot and Z.ai have positively smoked them over the course of July.

Yesterday was Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507. Qwen are clearly committed to their new split between reasoning and non-reasoning models (a reversal from Qwen 3 in April), because today they released the new reasoning partner to yesterday's model: Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507.

      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/24/github-spark/#atom-everything</link>

In this post I reverse engineer Spark and explore its fascinating system prompt in detail.

 ‚ÄúThe Orb‚Äù is popping up in all sorts of places, most recently in
Time magazine‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Orb Will See You Now‚Äù.
It‚Äôs being heralded as everything from the one and final solution for privacy-protecting
digital identity online, to a civil liberties nightmare, to an indispensable tool for
preventing an AI takeover, to a quick way to make $42, and more. 
 But what it actually does and how it w</description>

      <description> What phone home enables is worse than just surveillance and privacy invasion. Much&amp;nbsp;worse.  The ACLU, EFF, EPIC, CDT, Bruce Schneier and nearly 100 others just signed their support to a public statement opposing phone home capabilities in digital identity systems: NoPhoneHome.com.  The statement is simple, clear, and helpful, but it severely soft-pedals the&amp;nbsp;problem.  When Phone Home Is Fa</description>

      <description> I am a signatory to the No Phone Home Statement being released today, June 2, 2025.

      <description> My first love was self-sovereign distributed data, where each person owns and controls their data, hosting it wherever they choose and permissioning it under their own terms. But I got lost in the complexity of building a robust distributed identity infrastructure. How can you give permission to someone if you can‚Äôt 'name' them in a way that is verifiable and resistant to subversion? There's no po</description>

      <description> This post is a more technical follow-up to the post announcing the passing of SB 260 in Utah, establishing the principles for state-endorsed digital identity (SEDI). While SEDI does not mandate any particular technology, its mandated principles close the door for technologies that do not comply, and open the door for technologies that do. This article explores what SEDI makes technically possible,</description>
