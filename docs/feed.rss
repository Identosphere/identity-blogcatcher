      <description> ChatGPT just removed their &quot;make this chat discoverable&quot; sharing feature, after it turned out a material volume of users had inadvertantly made their private chats available via Google search.

      <description> From Async/Await to Virtual Threads 
Armin Ronacher has long been critical of async/await in Python, both for necessitating colored functions and because of the more subtle challenges they introduce like managing back pressure. 
 Armin argued convincingly for the threaded programming model back in December. Now he's expanded upon that with a description of how virtual threads might make sense in P</description>

 It's 30.5B total parameters with 3.3B active at any one time. This means it will fit on a 64GB Mac - and even a 32GB Mac if you quantize it - and can run really fast thanks to that smaller set of active parameters.

      <description> Ollama's new app 
Ollama has been one of my favorite ways to run local models for a while - it makes it really easy to download models, and it's smart about keeping them resident in memory while they are being used and then cleaning them out after they stop receiving traffic. 
 The one missing feature to date has been an interface: Ollama has been exclusively command-line, which is fine for the CL</description>

      <description>  When you vibe code, you are incurring tech debt as fast as the LLM can spit it out. Which is why vibe coding is perfect for prototypes and throwaway projects: It's only legacy code if you have to maintain it!&amp;nbsp;[...] 
 The worst possible situation is to have a non-programmer vibe code a large project that they intend to maintain. This would be the equivalent of giving a credit card to a child </description>

      <title>The best available open weight LLMs now come from China</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/30/chinese-models/#atom-everything</link>
      <description> Something that has become undeniable this month is that the best available open weight models now come from the Chinese AI labs. 
 I continue to have a lot of love for Mistral, Gemma and Llama but my feeling is that Qwen, Moonshot and Z.ai have positively smoked them over the course of July. 
 Here's what came out this month, with links to my notes on each one:

Yesterday was Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507. Qwen are clearly committed to their new split between reasoning and non-reasoning models (a reversal from Qwen 3 in April), because today they released the new reasoning partner to yesterday's model: Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507.

 The corporate obsession with transformation is outdated - and continues to fail.

      <title>Using GitHub Spark to reverse engineer GitHub Spark</title>
      <link>https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/24/github-spark/#atom-everything</link>
      <description> GitHub Spark was released in public preview yesterday. It's GitHub's implementation of the prompt-to-app pattern also seen in products like Claude Artifacts, Lovable, Vercel v0, Val Town Townie and Fly.io’s Phoenix New.

      <title>Decentralizing Age Verification with SSI: Separating Content Moderation from Guardianship</title>

It’s being heralded as everything from the one and final solution for privacy-protecting
digital identity online, to a civil liberties nightmare, to an indispensable tool for
preventing an AI takeover, to a quick way to make $42, and more.

      <description>Duende Software just posted an insightful piece titled Essential Moments in the OAuth and OpenID Connect Timeline. It’s a trip down memory lane, recounting significant developments in the identity and security standards repertoire that we now take for granted. It reminds us that all of this has come about in the last 15 years. These […]</description>

      <description>This blog post shows how an ASP.NET Core Identity application can integrate and implement multiple external identity providers. An OIDC client UI uses the solution and is implemented using Duende IdentityServer. The same scheme is used for all the external providers and mapped to the identity for the client UI and the application. Using OpenID […]</description>

You participate through the server you have joined but often times the people you want to interact with reside on other servers. For instance, if you want to follow a friend, visiting that friend’s url does not provide a simple follow button.  That simple follow button is on your own s</description>

      <description> Right now, many folks are excited about the prospect of agentic AI: intelligent computer systems that can access your stuff and do useful things for you, all without you having to program them to do it. But in order for that to happen, these bots need a way to actually go and do things. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) was recently proposed as a common interface for agents to get access to service</description>

      <description> Sometimes a situation is so absurd, or even so dangerous, you gotta make fun of it to keep from getting too bothered.  Unfortunately, surveillance-enabled digital identity systems are springing up around the world in societies that have traditionally shunned such privacy-invasive things, like the U.S., EU, U.K., and Australia. The biggest problem is the “phone home” that’s a standard capability — </description>

      <description>I’m thrilled to be able to report that, from now on, only fully-specified algorithms will be registered for JOSE and COSE. Furthermore, fully-specified signature algorithms are now registered to replace the previously registered polymorphic algorithms, which are now deprecated. For example, you can now use Ed25519 and Ed448 instead of the ambiguous EdDSA. The new […]</description>

The client credentials flow is an OAuth 2.0 authorization grant type used for machine-to-machine authentication. DPoP further strengthens the security by ensuring that the client possesses a specific key at the time of the request, forcing […]</description>

      <description>Permit.io just published the results of a survey they conducted with over 200 developers on access control. There's lots of good data there, but one thing that struck me is that over 50% of developers said that they've never used any of the popular policy languages. I was wondering why that could be and came up with a few reasons why policy languages often feel foreign and frustrating:</description>

      <description>Symbolic representation of Web Security applied to&amp;nbsp;SSI. Many children in Europe grew up with the tales of Baron Münchhausen, who claims to have lifted himself and his horse out of a mire by pulling his own hair. The image is so powerful because the problem of the circular dependency is so clearly visible. In real life, circular dependencies are often far less&amp;nbsp;obvious.  Which is why the fi</description>

      <title>Implement Phone verification, 2FA using ASP.NET Core Identity</title>
      <link>https://damienbod.com/2025/03/03/implement-phone-verification-2fa-using-asp-net-core-identity/</link>
      <description>This post shows how to implement phone (SMS) verification and two-factor authentication (2FA) using ASP.NET Core Identity. The solution integrates phone-based verification and 2FA mechanisms. The implementation uses ASP.NET Core Identity’s extensibility to incorporate SMS-based verification during user registration and login processes.

      <description> &amp;nbsp;Tune your metaphors..&amp;nbsp;             &amp;nbsp;From where I dance and glance in America...   All over the world, men and women are not having the same experience. Generational conflicts are arising, influencing everything, causing chaos to status quo, and making clear that the ability to r/w/rw is not shared equally. Computational supremacy, computational illiteracy, what does the data say? W</description>

As is the case for me lately, the offering is a somewhat rambling discussion that surfaces quiet a few nuggets for you to chew on.&amp;nbsp; Life in this absurdist improvisational theater might easier if we can practice the Tao of Pooh.
