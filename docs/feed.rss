 The only wars that America joins ‚Äôat the beginning‚Äô are the wars it starts. And .. when it does start them .. goes on to lose. 
 I hope this pattern continues as I watch T—èump start wars everywhere, the latest being with California, but there are plenty of other examples. </description>

      <description>  Since Jevons' original observation about coal-fired steam engines is a bit hard to relate to, my favourite modernized example for people who aren't software nerds is display technology. 
 Old CRT screens were horribly inefficient - they were large, clunky and absolutely guzzled power. Modern LCDs and OLEDs are slim, flat and use much less power, so that seems great ... except we're now using powe</description>

New, delightful manifesto from Ink &amp;amp; Switch. 
 
 In this essay, we envision malleable software: tools that users can reshape with minimal friction to suit their unique needs. Modification becomes routine, not exceptional. Adaptation happens at the point of use, not through engineering teams at distant corporations. 
 
 This is a beautifully written essay. I love the early f</description>

 If we did change the model, we'd release it as a new model with a new name in the API (e.g., o3-turbo-2025-06-10). It would be very annoying to API customers if we ever silently changed models, so we never do this [1].

OpenAI released o3-pro today, which they describe as a &quot;version of o3 with more compute for better responses&quot;. 
 It's only available via the newer Responses API. I've added it to my llm-openai-plugin plugin which uses that new API, so you can try it out like this:

In general I love learning new things when the art of programming changes [‚Ä¶] But LLMs, and more specifically Agents, affect the process of writing programs in a new and confusing way. Absolutely every fundamental assumption about how I work has to be questioned, and it ripples through all the </description>

 EleutherAI released the Pile four and a half years ago: &quot;an 800GB dataset of diverse text for language modeling&quot;. It's been used as the basis for many LLMs since then, but much of the data in it came from Common Crawl - a crawl of the public web which mostly ignore</description>

      <description> I presented an invited keynote at the AI Engineer World's Fair in San Francisco this week. This is my third time speaking at the event - here are my talks from October 2023 and June 2024. My topic this time was &quot;The last six months in LLMs&quot; - originally planned as the last year, but so much has happened that I had to reduce my scope!

Anthony Lewis published this neat, concise tutorial on using my LLM tool to run local models on your own machine, using llm-mlx. 
 An under-appreciated way to contribute to open source projects is to publish unofficial guides like this one. Always brightens my day when something like this shows up.

      <description> [Kate Knibbs at WIRED]  This is an insightful interview with Bluesky CEO Jay Graber.

      <description>This blog post shows how an ASP.NET Core Identity application can integrate and implement multiple external identity providers. An OIDC client UI uses the solution and is implemented using Duende IdentityServer. The same scheme is used for all the external providers and mapped to the identity for the client UI and the application. Using OpenID [‚Ä¶]</description>

But in order for that to happen, these bots need a way to actually go and do things. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) was recently proposed as a common interface for agents to get access to service</description>

      <description> My first love was self-sovereign distributed data, where each person owns and controls their data, hosting it wherever they choose and permissioning it under their own terms. But I got lost in the complexity of building a robust distributed identity infrastructure. How can you give permission to someone if you can‚Äôt 'name' them in a way that is verifiable and resistant to subversion? There's no po</description>

      <title>Fully-Specified Algorithms Specification Addressing Area Director Feedback</title>

      <description>Orie Steele and I want to thank Deb Cooley for her Area Director review of the ‚ÄúFully-Specified Algorithms for JOSE and COSE‚Äù specification. Addressing it simplified the exposition, while preserving the essence of what the draft accomplishes. Specifically, the resulting draft significantly simplified the fully-specified encryption description and removed the appendix on polymorphic ECDH algorithms.</description>

      <description> Part 2: Issuing&amp;nbsp;Badges  In part one of this series, we discussed how the trust model of Open Badges 3.0 differs from earlier versions. Credentials issued as Open Badges 3.0 are based on the W3C Verifiable Credentials data model which describes how claims made online can be&amp;nbsp;proven.  To explore this trust model, let‚Äôs explore the story of Olivia who has been taking classes at a local commu</description>

      <description> Is blogging still a thing?  If you‚Äôre reading this, please comment or like it so I know.     I am, at heart, still the XDI Guy. My passion for robust, secure, and scalable distributed data management hasn‚Äôt waned. Building one of the first XDI implementations (shout-out to Markus Sabadello, who might have built the only other one), I learned a lot about the challenges and opportunities of distribu</description>

      <title>AI RAG with LlamaIndex, Local Embedding, and Ollama Llama 3.1 8b</title>

      <description> In this post, I cover using LlamaIndex LlamaParse in auto mode to parse a PDF page containing a table, using a Hugging Face local embedding model, and using local Llama 3.1 8b via Ollama to perform naive Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). That‚Äôs a mouthful. I won‚Äôt go into how to setup Ollama and Llama 3.1 8b; this post assumes it is&amp;nbsp;running.  First off, you can find the code for this in m</description>

      <description>  

 As I just registered for a new season of beer league hockey starting this weekend, I thought about an episode of C‚Äôest comme √ßa que je t‚Äôaime I recently watched which is set in 1974 Sainte-Foy, Quebec City.  Nearly all the 1974 Quebec cultural references are new to me and in this episode, there is an adventure in a hockey arena and you can pause the video in a few places and see signage in the</description>
