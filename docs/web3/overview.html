Thank you for your message. I will copy the questions and put the answers after them.
Is the categorization unique to Bitcoin (or UTXO blockchains)? That is, consider a non-UTXO coin, or even, a privacy coin, would all 4 categories remain, or how would it change?
Indeed, not all privacy attack categories can be applied to other blockchains. Some of the attacks are s'>Research Summary: Studying Bitcoin privacy attacks and their Impact on Bitcoin-based Identity Methods</a>

There are at least two things that I find particularly interesting.
The first is the classification of Bitcoin privacy attacks. In your work, there are 4 categories, and under each section are several important threats. This seems like a careful design and is thus an important reference for the potential attacks that both developers and users need to stay aware of.

TLDR

Blockchain technology enables decentralized and self-sovereign identities including new mechanisms for creating, resolving, and revoking them.
The public availability of data records has allowed attacks that combine sophisticated heuristics with auxiliary information to compromise users’ privacy and deanonymize their identities.

A lot happened in those months. We have grown our community in Discord and Telegram and the general userbase of rotki.

We made 2 big releases, v1.5.0 - Barb and v1.4.0 - Axilla containing a ton of features which will be detailed below.

We have also made 2 smaller releases, v1.4.1 - Axillaries and v1.4.2 - Bird’s back adding smaller'>Rotki progress in Q2 of 2020</a>
