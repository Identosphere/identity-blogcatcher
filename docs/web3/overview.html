TLDR

Blockchain technology enables decentralized and self-sovereign identities including new mechanisms for creating, resolving, and revoking them.
The public availability of data records has allowed attacks that combine sophisticated heuristics with auxiliary information to compromise users’ privacy and deanonymize their identities.
