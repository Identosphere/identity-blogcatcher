ZenIP 42407 提案概述了 Horizen 2.0 代币经济学的重大更新，包括向收集者及其委托人分配至关重要的 40% 区块奖励。随着 Horizen 从工作量证明 (PoW) 过渡到权益证明 (PoS) 模型，收集者的作用对于维护网络的安全性和效率至关重要。但这不仅仅是 PoS 过渡 - 这种新的分配旨在符合 Horizen 2.0 成为 ZK 行业领导者的愿景，平衡奖励与增长资源以确保长期成功。首先，让我们了解一些基础知识：什么是核对者collators？为什么它们很重要？核对者节点collators通过收集用户的交易并为主链验证者生成状态转换证明来为网络的安全做出贡献。它们在 Horizen 当前的 PoW 区块链中扮演着与矿工类似的角色，确保网络安全高效地运行。 委托人呢？在 PoS 系统中，委托人是通过将他们的 $ZEN 与核对者一起质押来支持网络的用户，而无需自己成为验证者。这允许非技术用户仍然参与网络并获得奖励。作为他们质押的回报，委托人将获得他们选择的核对者产生的部分奖励。在 @Polkadot wiki 上了解有关核对者的更多信息 为什么要分配 40%？ 将'>搞懂Horizen新经济模型中40%的核对者节点奖励</a>
