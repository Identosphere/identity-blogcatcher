Horizen 成立于 2017 年，近八年来一直致力于隐私技术的创新。如今，它作为首批应用链之一加入 Base 生态系统，ZEN 也即将转型为 ERC-20 代币。我们将为您揭晓这其中的奥秘。 Horizen 已于今年 7 月成功将其 ZEN 代币从其自有区块链迁移至 Base，并将成为标准的 ERC-20 代币。这听起来可能像专业术语，但它解决了一个实际问题：过去，专注于隐私的代币在很大程度上被 DeFi 拒之门外。市场情绪的变化和监管的明确性正在为加密货币的隐私用例铺平道路，而这些用例的实现，首先要普及 Horizen 技术。 这就是为什么这次迁移最终可以向重视隐私的用户开放 DeFi。 1. Base迁移终结了孤立问题 ZEN 最初是其自身 Layer-1 UTXO 区块链的原生代币，但迁移到 Base 改变了 DeFi 的访问方式。Base 拥有超过 100 万的每日活跃地址，这些地址现在可以访问 ZEN 并体验其隐私解决方案。这些用户之前因需要克服技术障碍才能使用和投资 ZEN。 迁移的另一个重要优势是 Horizen 技术的可组合性增强。随着 ZEN 成为 ERC-20'>ZEN 迁移至 Base 平台，为 DeFi 解锁隐私的 5 个理由</a>
