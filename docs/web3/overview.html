Slower transaction settlement and prohibitively high gas fees hinder its adoption as a viable network to facilitate payments and commerce. The emergence of Layer 2 (L2) blockchains like Arbitrum and next-gen Layer 1 (L1) blockchains like Polygon PoS and Solana help to address this problem, providing a fast and efficient way to transfer USDC at enterprise scale with near-zero t'>Scaling Your App for High Volume USDC Transactions with CCTP</a>
