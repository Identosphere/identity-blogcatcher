区块链景观正在以前所未有的速度发展,Horizen也是如此。为了最大程度地提高可扩展性,互操作性和采用性, ZenIP 42406附录 提出了一项重大的战略举措:将Horizen($ ZEN）和EON迁移到Base（Coinbase的Layer 2)。Base 是以太坊第2层（L2),为任何地方的任何人提供安全,低成本,对建筑商友好的方式来构建链，appchain是专用的Layer 3区块链,可卷成L2,继承其安全性和流动性,同时为专用应用程序提供增强的可扩展性,互操作性和自定义功能。这不是Horizen 2.0 任务的改变-我们的目标和愿景保持不变，相反,该提案旨在将Horizen定位在增长最快的区块链生态系统之一中,从而释放出无与伦比的可扩展性,开发人员支持和机构信任。阅读完整的ZenIP 42406附录,并了解该建议背后的动机和理由。这对Horizen和ZEN意味着什么加强生态系统整合通过迁移到Base,Horizen立即与高度活跃的DeFi和dApp生态系统连接,为$ZEN提供了更大的实用性和可访问性。该提案的目的是增强Horizen的Base设施,采用潜力和生态系统范围,同'>Zenip 42408提案，正式通过！ $ZEN和EON即将迁入Base网络， 附详细官方答疑</a>

在隐私、安全和效率日益重要的世界里，零知识证明（ZKP）正在成为一项革命性的技术，有可能改变我们的数字生活。ZKP 不仅仅是一个小众加密概念——它们有可能改变我们在线互动、处理敏感数据和在数字经济中交易的方式。什么是零知识证明？零知识证明是一种加密技术，允许一方（“证明者”）向另一方（“验证者”）证明某个陈述是真实的，而不会透露除了该陈述本身的真实性之外的任何其他信息。这里有一个简单的类比：假设你知道一个复杂谜题的答案。零知识证明可以让你向某人证明你已经解决了这个谜题，而无需向他们展示你是如何做到的。ZKP 既能保证隐私性，又能保证准确性。它们可用于验证身份、交易或计算，而无需暴露任何底层数据。零知识证明如何改变世界尽管听起来很抽象，但 ZKP 已经在各个领域进入实际应用。让我们探索 ZKP 的一些关键应用领域，以及它们如何直接影响您的生活。财务隐私和安全ZKP 正在改变金融交易的开展方式。区块链和加密货币经常被批评为过于透明或过于私密，现在可以使用 ZKP 实现平衡。保密交易： ZKP 可实现私密交易，隐藏金额和参与者，同时确保交易有效。该技术已在 Zcash 等注重隐私的加密货'>Zk零知识证明将如何塑造我们的数字未来</a>
