Is the categorization unique to Bitcoin (or UTXO blockchains)? That is, consider a non-UTXO coin, or even, a privacy coin, would all 4 categories remain, or how would it change?

TLDR

Blockchain technology enables decentralized and self-sovereign identities including new mechanisms for creating, resolving, and revoking them.
The public availability of data records has allowed attacks that combine sophisticated heuristics with auxiliary information to compromise users’ privacy and deanonymize their identities.

By developing a public graph, BrightID has brought about an infrastructure in which different algorithms can be tried to counteract such attacks. Applications will choose what algorithms suit them best to verify their users.Bitu is the first graph-analysis-based verification method that BrightID offers. The nodes inside the main regions of the graph get verified by Bitu. It recognizes nodes outside the borders of those regions as'>What is Bitu Verification?</a>
