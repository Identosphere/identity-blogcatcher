区块链景观正在以前所未有的速度发展,Horizen也是如此。为了最大程度地提高可扩展性,互操作性和采用性, ZenIP 42406附录 提出了一项重大的战略举措:将Horizen($ ZEN）和EON迁移到Base（Coinbase的Layer 2)。Base 是以太坊第2层（L2),为任何地方的任何人提供安全,低成本,对建筑商友好的方式来构建链，appchain是专用的Layer 3区块链,可卷成L2,继承其安全性和流动性,同时为专用应用程序提供增强的可扩展性,互操作性和自定义功能。这不是Horizen 2.0 任务的改变-我们的目标和愿景保持不变，相反,该提案旨在将Horizen定位在增长最快的区块链生态系统之一中,从而释放出无与伦比的可扩展性,开发人员支持和机构信任。阅读完整的ZenIP 42406附录,并了解该建议背后的动机和理由。这对Horizen和ZEN意味着什么加强生态系统整合通过迁移到Base,Horizen立即与高度活跃的DeFi和dApp生态系统连接,为$ZEN提供了更大的实用性和可访问性。该提案的目的是增强Horizen的Base设施,采用潜力和生态系统范围,'>Zenip 42408提案，正式通过！ $ZEN和EON即将迁入Base网络， 附详细官方答疑</a>
