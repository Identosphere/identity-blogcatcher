 💡Findora Validator Spotlight — Brother.FRA💡  Validator Spotlights showcase the great teams working to guarantee the security and decentralization of the Findora blockchain. Here are Brother.FRA’s responses to some questions from the Findora community.  1) Tell Us About&nbsp;Yourself <p>Hello, My name is Kevin and I run the Brother.FRA validator on Findora. I also run a validator on the Harmony called BrotherOne and a master node for Pac Protocol. I have about 1 ½ years of experience with validating for&nbsp;crypto.</p> 2) What brought you into crypto/web3 in the first&nbsp;place? <p>I was an investor first and saw the potential of becoming a developer, and I decided to start by becoming a validator with zero experience. Technology has always been my forte, and I was looking for an opportunity to learn and grow my skills. Learning how to establish a validator would open the door to help achieve this goal. I love our crypto community and how supportive they are, and it drove me to search for ways to contribute. The relationship and friendships that I have built along the way have been a huge blessing.</p><p>Learning more about Web3 and how I can integrate it with our validator ecosystem is exciting. I’m looking forward to our Web3 Future and Findora’s contribution to&nbsp;Web3.</p> 3) What is your experience in validating or web3 in&nbsp;general? <p>I started with very little web design experience in 2012. That experience gave me some idea of what I was getting into, but I knew it would be different. It was difficult, but I had to learn everything from scratch. I am still learning, and I look forward to learning new things every day. Web3 is still new to me, but it is the future that I will come to familiarize myself&nbsp;with.</p> 4) What makes your operation unique? <p>I run my Harmony node with an at-home hardware server. I plan to do the same with my Brother.FRA validator.</p><p>Running an at-home server not only saves me out-of-pocket costs, but it also allows us to upgrade our machines. I have a partnership with an NFT project that is in the works, and I plan to integrate my validator with the project as a unique incentive for our delegators.</p><p>As we grow, we may be able to also establish future partnerships with DAPPs to provide services that are unique to validators for delegators. We are always open to these types of partnerships, and we encourage these services to reach out to us via Twitter or Telegram.</p><p>I do make guides as well for my delegators. If you’re new to Findora and want to learn how to stake or how to take your $FRA off from your exchange. You can do so here with our Medium Guide: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/FindoraG">https://tinyurl.com/FindoraG</a></p> 5) Why do you want to validate with&nbsp;Findora? <p>“Brother” has always been about crypto and how to expand into different protocols to support them and help grow their community. BrotherOne was the first and we branched out to Pac Protocol. Findora became my 3rd choice for Brother to validate with. Findora is unique and has some similarities to Harmony that I enjoyed personally.</p><p>ZK and privacy is something that I took an interest in, and I decided to help Findora with our services. With Brother.FRA I plan to dive deeper and learn more about privacy and how to leverage it for our delegators. ZK is also something brand new to me, and I want to see how I can help educate our delegators to learn about these new initiatives and how to utilize&nbsp;them.</p><p>There are a lot of opportunities with Findora, and we want to provide our services to the Findora community.</p> 6) Where can our community go to learn more about&nbsp;you? <p>Best place to find&nbsp;me:</p>  Twitter: @OniiiOne — <a href="https://twitter.com/oniiione?s=21&amp;t=h3GIXXlpWQ2S1J04rHD_pg">https://twitter.com/oniiione?s=21&amp;t=h3GIXXlpWQ2S1J04rHD_pg</a>  Telegram @kevkellius  Instagram: @brotherone_validator — <a href="https://instagram.com/brotherone_validator?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=">https://instagram.com/brotherone_validator?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=</a>  Website: brotherone.net  How to stake with Brother.FRA:  <p>I wanted to thank everyone for your time and for listening to my story. I hope it will inspire you to contribute to the growth of Findora. You don’t have to be a developer or know everything there is to know about crypto. All it requires is your determination and a willingness to learn. Thank you for your time. Reach out to me at any time, and I’ll be happy to respond and help you&nbsp;out.</p> 7) How to delegate funds to Brother.FRA? <p>(Inserted by Findora DAO editors) When you go to stake FRA from the <a href="https://wallet.findora.org/">Findora Wallet</a>, you can select Brother.FRA. You can see their stats on the <a href="https://findorascan.io/node?node=9E6717392EFDCFA101E33449A7C2A238251315B1">Findorascan.io dashboard</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation/findora-validator-spotlight-brother-fra-e682add8d53d">💡Findora Validator Spotlight — Brother.FRA💡</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation">Findora Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>More than one user has wondered what are hash functions, a term usually thrown around the more technical crypto circles.<br></p><p>The word 'hash' may evoke memories of meat and potatoes, chopped and mixed. However, food is the last thing on the menu. With hash functions, computers take center stage. Hash functions are all around us as long as we interact with websites, digital wallets, cryptocurrencies, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/the-laymans-guide-for-privacy-enhancing-technologies-24e210f550b7/">privacy enhancing technologies</a>, etc.<br></p><p>If you cannot understand the phrase 'hash function' when you come across it, this article is for you. We will explore everything about hash functions, their importance in the modern digital world, types of hash functions, and properties of a strong hash function.</p> What are hash functions? <p>A hash is, in short, a confusing mess. This word is used to describe the result of a person making a mess out of something and making everything worse. In computing, a hash is a result produced by a hash function, and it usually looks like letters, numbers or both jumbled up together in a way that makes no sense to the human mind. A hash function is a storage-saving tool that computers use to scramble data inputs and convert them into numerical values of fixed or variable lengths. <br></p><p>If you’ve watched enough spy movies, you must have heard of scrambled calls, which shut out unauthorized listeners by muddling up a conversation such that it becomes unintelligible. Hash functions take data of varying lengths and transform them into unintelligible (to humans) numeric or alphanumeric values called hash values, hash codes, or simply hashes. Unlike scrambled calls, which you can unscramble, hash functions are unidirectional, i.e., they must produce hashes that cannot be unscrambled into the original data.</p>Simple diagram illustrating a hash function. (<a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2022/06/what-is-a-hash-function-within-cryptography-quick-guide/">Source</a>)<p></p><p>Hash values are unique, with none having a similar makeup to another, which makes them similar to human fingerprints. They are usually stored in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hash tables</a> for easy access, and are of the same length if produced by the same type of hash function. <br></p>Regardless of the size of input message, a hash function always gives an output of fixed size. (<a href="https://medium.com/@hitensangtani89/fundamentals-of-hash-algorithms-and-brief-explanation-of-sha1-algorithm-5fcff2473515">Source</a>)<p></p><p>For instance, if you scramble your 16-character Facebook password with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">SHA256</a> hash function and a 56-character web link, the resulting hash values will be of the same length – a 64-character fingerprint. Even if you hashed a 10,000-word essay with SHA256, the hash length would remain unchanged.</p> How do hash functions work? <p>You must wonder how hash functions scramble data to produce fixed-length hash values or digests. Here's a simple breakdown: <br></p>  The hash function takes a key as an input.  The key is usually associated with a record and serves as a unique identifier of the record to the data storage and retrieval application.  The key could be of a fixed length, like numbers between 10 and 20, or varying lengths, like names, or the record itself in some cases.  The hash function converts the keys of fixed or varying lengths into fixed-length codes, usually of machine length. The function employs operators like ADD or XOR to fold the inputs by words or other units and preserve their parity.  The hash function then scrambles the key's bits to distribute the resulting values uniformly over the keyspace.  When the hash function scrambles the record, it produces an output, a hash code, which is then used to index a hash table that holds the data or other pointers to the records.   Applications of hash functions <p>Do you know what happens in the backend when you try to log into an account with your email and password? Password verification is one of the major uses of cryptographic hash functions.<br></p><p>During signin up to any online platform, your password is often stored in the hash table as a hashcode. When you input your password during a login session, the hash function creates a checksum for the password you entered and compares it to the saved checksum in the hash table. If both <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/363735/what-is-a-checksum-and-why-should-you-care/">checksums</a> are identical, access will be granted. If not, you’ll get an incorrect password message.<br></p><p>Hash functions are also leveraged for file verification. If you want to download a file from an untrusted website and its checksum is provided, you can check if it matches the checksum of the original file on the trusted site.<br></p><p>Besides passwords and file integrity verification, Hash functions also come in handy in data storage and retrieval applications and have a wide range of uses, including:<br></p>  Signature generation and verification  Data or file identifiers  Proof of work algorithm such as <a href="http://www.hashcash.org/">Hashcash</a> to counter email spams and denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks.  Hashcash is also leveraged in proof of work consensus mechanism such as <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin</a>   Types of hash functions <p>There are everal types of hash function variations, and their distinct modes of operation set them apart. Here are a few of the most significant types of hash functions in computing:</p> Folding <p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/folding-method-in-hashing/">Folding</a> hash functions utilize a simple two-step method to generate hash codes. First, the key value (k) is split up into a fixed number of parts, each with the same number of digits (the last part can have fewer digits). Then, the sum of all the parts will be the hash value of the input key. The number of digits in each part depends on the hash table size.</p> Mid-Squares<br> <p><a href="https://www.digitalbithub.com/learn/mid-square-method-hashing">Mid-squares</a> hash functions produce hash values by squaring the input (key) and extracting a fixed number of middle digits or bits from the result of their multiplication. This type of hash function usually works when the data to be hashed is a numerical value, and it works well when there are few leading or trailing zeros in the record's key.<br></p>Mid-square hashing method – a type of hash function. (<a href="https://www.digitalbithub.com/learn/mid-square-method-hashing">Source</a>) Identity hash function <p>An <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16267567">identity hash function</a> comes into play when the data hashed is small, depending on the hash code length of the programming language you intend to use. With the condition of size fulfilled, you can use the input data as a hash value, although it gets reinterpreted as an integer. This type of hash function can be used to map zip codes to city names.</p> Division hashing <p>As one of the easiest ways to generate a hash code, division hashing uses a simple formula that divides the value of k by M, where k is the input key and M is the hash table size (usually a prime number). Although it is fast and great for any value of M, <a href="https://www.digitalbithub.com/learn/division-modulo-method-hashing-technique">division hashing</a> performs poorly by mapping consecutive keys to consecutive hash codes on the hash table.</p> Multiplicative hashing <p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf2V77ut-B0">multiplicative hashing</a>, a constant value A is selected such that A is greater than zero but less than one. Then, we find the product of the input key and A, after which we extract the fractional portion X (all the digits after the decimal point). X is then multiplied by the size of the hash table, and the result is the hash code. This type of hashing is best suited to scenarios when the hash table size is the power of two.</p> Properties of a strong hash algorithm Properties of a strong hash function. (<a href="https://www.chegg.com/homework-help/questions-and-answers/problem-5-20-marks-consider-following-hash-function-takes-input-r-arbitrary-size-produces--q41956208">Source</a>)<p></p><p>For any hashing algorithm to pass as strong, it must have the following properties:</p> Irreversibility <p>Also known as preimage resistance, irreversibility is an essential property of a strong hash function. With a good hash function, it should be impractical to reverse the hashcode and recover the original input message. Strong hashing functions are one-way and irreversible.</p> Determinism <p>A strong hash function should always produce an output of the same size regardless of the input data size. This feature is known as determinism. Whether you are hashing the first and last names or an entire book, the hash codes produced by a specific hash function must be of the same size.</p> Collision resistance <p>Collisions in hashing occurs when two unique data inputs produce identical hashcodes. Collisions prove that a hashing function is broken and unsafe, which could invite malicious actors to manipulate data. Hash codes are unique to their data inputs, and collisions are unnatural occurrences for hashing algorithms. A robust hashing algorithm should be resistant to collision.</p> Avalanche effect <p>A strong hashing function must produce an avalanche effect when there is even the slightest change to the input key. If something as simple as a comma is added to the input, the output hashing value will change significantly.</p> Hash speed <p>A robust hashing algorithm is expected to compute hash values swiftly. Hash speed, however, is somewhat subjective, depending on how you intend to use the hashing algorithm. In some cases, like website connections, faster hashing algorithms are best suited to the job. When hashing passwords, it is best to use <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/150620/what-is-the-purpose-of-slowing-down-the-calculation-of-a-password-hash">slower hashing functions</a> to make sure it will much slower to brute-force the password. Thus, making it almost impossible to brute-force a large set of password database.</p> Applicability <p>A strong hash function must be applied in various situations and support varying input string values, hash table sizes, and seed types. For instance, a hash function that only allows specific table sizes, seed types, and limited string lengths, is less valuable than one you can use in various situations.</p> Uniformity <p>Strong hash functions must ensure uniformity by mapping input values evenly across their output range. Uniformity, in this case, demands that an exact probability is used to generate each hash code in the output range. Uniformed distributions keep collisions minimal, regardless of input size, which is vital for efficient hashing. <br></p> Conclusion <p>Hash functions are without a doubt a backbone of the modern Internet age. From password verifications, signature generation and data identifiers to blockchain networks, cryptographic hash functions are being used to make the digital world more secure, verifiable, and enhance users’ <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/economic-analysis-of-private-defi/">privacy</a>.<br>As you can imagine, the rabbit hole of hash functions goes deep, and as you increase your technical knowledge you can continue to explore it.

 Light wallet is near (with the Zelcore desktop wallet) 

<p>Veil release 1.3.0.0 completes RingCT light-wallet API necessary for private use of Veil in the Zelcore Desktop light wallet. (Further work is needed for inclusion in the Zelcore mobile wallet.)</p>

<p>Stay tuned for Zelcore’s release of Veil in their Zelcore desktop wallet!</p>

<p>This will enable users who do not want to maintain a full node to hold Veil in their own custody, with their own private keys, and to use it privately through RingCT anonymous transactions.</p>

 Also imminent is a DAG reduction for proof of work miners using the ProgPoW algorithm 

<p>We have held off from including the DAG reduction in today’s release, because the most popular mining software was not yet ready, and the mining community preferred to wait a little longer.</p>

<p>The Veil mining community is excited and looking forward to using mining GPUs with smaller memory before the existing code makes it impossible to mine, and also hope to gain the attention of the miners with new and old GPUs who have been mining Ethereum as the end of Ethereum proof of work looms.</p>

 <a href="https://github.com/FindoraNetwork/FIPs/blob/main/FIPs/fip-2.md">FIP-2</a> is a recent community proposal that would create auditable assets on Findora. These assets could be audited by the issuer but would remain protected on-chain from public&nbsp;view.  Tl;dr <p>❗️FIP-2 proposes the creation of Auditable Privacy-Preserving Assets (APPA), tokens that issuers could track for the sake of regulatory compliance, internal audits, and forensic investigation.</p><p>❗️️️️APPAs are a new class of asset, not necessarily a token standard, and the Findora community would have the choice to use them or&nbsp;not.</p><p>❗️APPAs could open many new use-cases, especially for stablecoins.</p><p>❗️APPAs could be used to identify tainted tokens with the issuer’s permission.</p><p>❗️APPs are the first step in auditability using zero-knowledge proofs, and Findora hopes to use similar technology for on-chain IDs and&nbsp;KYC.</p> What is&nbsp;FIP-2? <p>FIP-2 is a comprehensive design for auditable assets and is one of the first constructions of its kind. It enables Findora to offer an asset class that no other project currently offers, though many have discussed it.</p><p>Essentially, FIP-2 creates a new asset class called Auditable Privacy-Preserving Assets or APPAs. Institutions that issue APPAs will be able to see their movements, even though their movements won’t be visible on-chain. Only APPA issuers can audit these assets and provide transaction data, if necessary, for standard reporting and/or criminal investigation.</p><p>FIP-2 is not a response to recent drama regarding blockchain privacy. It’s a feature that has long been on Findora’s roadmap and one that distinguishes Findora from other privacy projects.</p> Why Privacy Needs Auditability <p>Privacy is not only an expectation but also a financial primitive — businesses and individuals rely on it. However, safety, accountability, and trust are also financial primitives, ones that aren’t capable in many existing privacy projects. To build a financial system with privacy, there must be room at some point for auditability.</p><p>Many will probably ask such questions as: What is the point of auditability in a privacy chain like Findora? Isn’t the point to make it so that assets can’t be audited? Is this a case of a feature looking for a&nbsp;problem?</p><p>As it turns out, many institutions have been asking for something like FIP-2. It would allow them to move major capital into Web3, something they haven’t been able to do because of the inability to protect user data, guard proprietary trading secrets, and comply with the many stringent reporting regulations in the financial sector.</p><p>The primary use case for FIP-2 is centered around stablecoins issuers. They would be able to comply with OFAC regulations and keep liquidity in DeFi. The ability to audit their tokens would allow them to identify tainted tokens so that their users could reject them, and allow them to use stablecoins to set up prepaid debit cards for easy transactions.</p><p>APPAs would allow institutions to conduct internal audits, prevent money laundering, and expose any illicit activity or fraud happening with their assets. It’s another key feature on Findora that would make web3 more practical and attractive to institutional capital.</p> What FIP-2&nbsp;Isn’t <p>It is important to be clear about a few things FIP-2 does not&nbsp;do.</p> FIP-2 Is NOT Mandatory <p>FIP-2 is not a proposal to turn all assets on Findora to APPAs. Instead, it creates an optional class of assets that projects can choose to use if they want. Findora users can choose whether or not they want to use&nbsp;APPAs.</p> FIP-2 does NOT Apply to&nbsp;FRA <p>FRA is the native token of Findora and is completely decentralized. If a private transaction occurs with FRA, it cannot be tracked publicly. FIP-2 does not change that. Further, FRA cannot be frozen even by the Findora Foundation. Findora and its FRA native token would remain permissionless, accessible to all, and freely tradable.</p> FIP-2 does NOT Affect Decentralization <p>APPAs issued by a centralized entity, like USDC or USDT on Findora, could be frozen because any asset issued by a centralized entity can be frozen. APPAs aren’t creating a centralized asset, they are giving centralized or decentralized issuers another tool in the toolbox when issuing assets. If the issuer wants APPAs to be centralized, they will be. If the issuer is decentralized, so will be the APPA. But in either case, the issuer will have the ability to track and audit the APPAs&nbsp;actions.</p> APPAs are Auditable, NOT&nbsp;Public <p>FIP-2 creates a class of assets that can be audited ONLY by the issuer. Transaction data involving APPAs will still be private on-chain so that not anyone can look it up or track movements. This allows businesses and trading firms to protect trade secrets while meeting regulatory requirements.</p><p>FIP-2, we believe, sends a strong message that while Findora will protect the rights of all people to privacy, it is not a suitable place for illicit activity. Criminal activity can be exposed on Findora, and Findora will always work to protect its users from&nbsp;it.</p> The Technical details <p>APPAs will work by adding an “auditor’s memo” to transactions that record the input and output data of the transaction.</p><p>There are two main privacy-preserving protocols on Findora that APPAs will need to work with: the Maxwell construction and the Zerocash construction.</p><p>The Maxwell construction is instantiated by Bulletproofs and normally allows for transactions where the amount and token type is hidden on-chain. However, when an APPA uses this construction, the token type will not be able to be shielded — only the transaction amount.</p><p>The Zerocash construction on Findora is used for Triple Masking, a way to shield the amount, token type, and wallet addresses involved in a transaction. For auditable assets, the triple masking protocol will enforce the sender to provide a correct “auditor’s memo,” while still having the same privacy guarantees as existing assets. The existing assets and auditable assets can be used in the same transaction, which enables interoperability and backward compatibility.</p><p>In FIP-2, for now, auditable assets would be restricted to the UTXO chain only and not permitted on the EVM chain until a future FIP extends the auditability to the EVM&nbsp;side.</p><p>For more details, read FIP-2&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/FindoraNetwork/FIPs/blob/main/FIPs/fip-2.md">here</a>.</p><p>An FIP-2&nbsp;Future</p><p>FIP-2 is one of the first Findora FIPs and we believe a huge advancement for the project. Auditability is a key component of any financial system, and giving Findora users access to that functionality will be key. There are many use cases for such technology and many more are sure to come when it is deployed.</p><p>APPAs created by FIP-2 won’t affect the decentralization of the Findora chain and won’t affect FRA. FRA will remain a decentralized, permissionless asset anyone can use. APPAs are another tool that token issuers can leverage to comply with regulations, audit transactions, and create new web3 financial products.</p><p>But FIP-2 is only the beginning. As mentioned above, FIP-2 has long been on a roadmap that has many other exciting future stops. Findora hopes to one day use similar ZKP methods to make KYC more secure and less centralized. Instead of companies keeping vulnerable servers full of customer data, perhaps they can simply store the proof of that data. Instead of going through cumbersome and intrusive KYC procedures, maybe all users need to do is show proof of who they are, who they are not, and any other verifiable data without revealing it.</p><p>It will be exciting to move to a world where our relationship to data completely changes, from needing to deal directly with it to simply exchanging proofs of&nbsp;data.</p><p>That is still a long way off in the future, but APPAs and FIP-2 are the first steps in that direction. Findora welcomes community feedback and encourages comments and questions on <a href="https://twitter.com/Findora">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/findora">Discord</a>, and <a href="https://t.me/findoraen">Telegram</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation/the-findora-improvement-proposal-that-could-bring-auditability-to-privacy-a21952ca4f55">The Findora Improvement Proposal that could Bring Auditability to Privacy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation">Findora Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Payments and privacy don’t mix — understanding the logic of ‘embedded finance’ <p>The cashless society is upon us, or so we’re&nbsp;told.</p><p>Just last morning the UK banking body UK Finance released its latest report on the use of cash; some 23 million people in the UK did not use coins or notes at all during 2021, a huge increase on the 13 million recorded in the previous&nbsp;year.</p><p>According to the financial services industry, this is good news. Cash is unwieldy, it’s expensive to produce, and it’s logistically inefficient — think, for example, about the hundreds of thousands of armoured trucks carrying bank notes along the streets of towns and cities around the world every&nbsp;day.</p><p>Many commentators point out the continued importance of cash for demographics that are not comfortable with or used to digital payments; the example that is constantly given is pensioners’ attachment to cheques. And they are right, of course. But cash is dying regardless — and this is as a result of a concerted effort on the part of financial services businesses.</p> Convenience at any&nbsp;cost <p>The transition away from cash is part of a broader tendency that is part of and necessitated by the stage of capitalist development in which the world finds itself. In the field of payments this philosophy manifests as the privileging of ‘convenience’ over all else, including privacy. The convenience imperative is used to justify systemic demands for the integration of every individual and every aspect of their lives into the logic of financialisation.</p><p>Consider this ‘convenience’ from the perspective of the businesses marketing it. Internally, these products are talked about in terms of ‘embedding’ and ‘integration’. The nascent ‘Embedded Finance’ industry tells every company on earth that they can ‘be a fintech’ by integrating financial services into their products, the idea being that they can generate new revenue streams through financialisation. The Embedded Finance industry is an organising layer that allows correspondence between non-financial companies and the financial system at large by leasing access to banking infrastructure. Today, for ambitious wannabe fintechs, even licences are a thing of the past. Don’t have a banking licence, or regulatory permission to operate as a financial institution? Don’t worry — just lease it from your Embedded Finance provider, who in turn is leasing it from the Tier 1 banks who operate the ‘pipes’ of the banking network. We’re told the cashless society is ‘frictionless’, and to an extent that is true — the modus operandi is to remove any barriers separating consumers from the global financial system, and to create new ‘touchpoints’ through which consumers can be woven into large and growing networks of financialisation.</p> Diminishing returns <p>As the financialisation of the global economy reaches its peak, and as the associated returns diminish, the scramble to integrate more and more functions into its rubric becomes increasingly urgent.</p><p>This is another example of the logic of global capitalist expansion — capital moves into ‘emerging markets’ in an attempt to generate new consumers (where it used to generate new, cheaper workforces). When it runs out of new consumers, it has to embed itself ever more deeply into the existences of those that it has already&nbsp;created.</p><p>The result is the concentration of financial power — and, crucially, the data generated as a result — within a vanishingly small number of hands. ‘Rebundling’ is one of the favourite current buzzwords of the payments industry. By this they mean the integration of multiple, disparate services and transactions within a small set of umbrella brands. The best current example is the crop of ‘superapps’ that are growing in popularity in South East Asia, as partly pioneered by Jack Ma’s Ant Group. These apps are a ‘single point of access’ through which you can not only book a ride-share or get groceries delivered, but also borrow money, do your banking, send remittances to family abroad, and so&nbsp;on.</p> Tornados and transactions <p>So, as we’ve seen, cashless societies are a necessity for the continued enfolding of all human behaviour into the financial system. They’re sold to us on the basis of convenience, and the implications for privacy and both private sector and state overreach are studiously ignored.</p><p>It is extremely difficult to return the genie of convenience to its bottle, and challenging the logic of convenience seems politically impossible in the current climate. The obvious alternative, therefore, is to build systems that are both convenient and equitable; that maintain privacy and keep the financial institutions at bay while also enabling people to transact as they wish, on a global basis, and at&nbsp;speed.</p><p>There are many attempts to achieve something along these lines, and it should come as no surprise that these attempts are being met with crackdowns and repression. The recent sanctioning of Tornado Cash, a prominent privacy-minded coin mixer, is a good example that will have significant implications for the DeFi space at&nbsp;large.</p><p>Crackdowns of this sort are excellent illustrations of the fact that financialisation is another vector through which power can be exercised. In the next parts of this series on privacy and payments, we’ll look in more detail at some of the alternatives.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/payments-and-privacy-dont-mix-understanding-the-logic-of-embedded-finance-dd8b91fc7c58">Payments and privacy don’t mix — understanding the logic of ‘embedded finance’</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<blockquote>This post is contributed by the <a href="https://twitter.com/datachain_en">Datachain</a> team.</blockquote><p>IBC plays an essential role in the enterprise space because of the trust-minimised blockchain interoperability it provides for heterogeneous blockchains and is a proven technology, as discussed in <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/why-cosmos-ibc-takes-an-essential-role-in-the-enterprise-space-95d84baeeca9">our previous post</a>. The <a href="https://ibcprotocol.org/">Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol</a> is not only for chains built on the <a href="https://interchain.io/technology">Interchain Stack</a>, but for all blockchains, regardless of app building framework, including enterprise (permissioned) blockchains and probabilistic finality&nbsp;chains.</p><p>This post is the second part of the IBC and enterprise series and will dive into enterprise use cases in production using the IBC protocol, specifically:</p>  Delivery Versus Payment (DVP) Settlements between digital assets and digital currency (NTT&nbsp;DATA)  USDF, a USD-pegged Stable Coin (USDF Consortium)  Enterprise Blockchain Platform BSN (Bianjie) backed by the Chinese Government  Atomic Swap Between Digital Currencies (Soramitsu)   DVP Settlements Between Digital Assets and Digital Currency (NTT&nbsp;DATA) An overview of the DVP settlement system, source: <a href="https://www.datachain.jp/news/datachain-collaborates-with-ntt-data-on-technology-for-interoperability-between-blockchains">Datachain Teams Up With NTT DATA For Blockchain Interoperability</a><p>NTT DATA and <a href="https://www.datachain.jp/">Datachain</a> have tested Delivery Versus Payment (DVP) settlements between digital assets on Hyperledger Fabric and digital currency on Tendermint-based blockchains using the IBC protocol. DVP settlement is a settlement method that reduces principal risk by simultaneously delivering securities while making payments. The IBC protocol enables DVP settlements by verifying transactions on the counterparty blockchain without a trusted intermediary. Securities and payments can be received only once both parties have put the transactions on chain and they are verified by the counterparty blockchain.</p><p>The experiment resulted in a joint demonstration of a <a href="https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/media/press-release/2022/january/tokio-marine-and-nichido-ntt-data-standage-and-tradewaltz-jointly-conducted">new international trade settlement system</a> by Tokio Marine &amp; Nichido, NTT DATA, STANDAGE and TradeWaltz.The architecture of this demonstration can be applied to other enterprise fields including the settlement of securities transactions. Therefore, as more digital assets become exchangeable on blockchains, there will be increasing demand to transfer digital assets and make settlements simultaneously to minimize the&nbsp;risk.</p> USDF, USD-pegged Stable Coin (USDF Consortium) <p>USDF is a USD-pegged stable coin minted by several United States banks at the USDF consortium. The consortium members are: <a href="https://www.amerantbank.com/">Amerant Bank</a>, <a href="https://www.atlanticunionbank.com/">Atlantic Union Bank</a>, <a href="https://www.connectonebank.com/">ConnectOne Bank</a>, <a href="https://www.efirstbank.com/">FirstBank</a>, <a href="https://www.nbhbank.com/">NBH Bank</a>, <a href="https://primisbank.com/">Primis Bank</a>, <a href="https://www.mynycb.com/">New York Community Bank</a>, <a href="https://www.synovus.com/">Synovus Bank</a>, <a href="https://public.websteronline.com/personal">Webster Bank</a>, <a href="https://www.figure.com/">Figure Technologies, Inc</a>., and <a href="https://www.jamfintop.com/">JAM FINTOP</a>. The primary use-case of USDF is to make money transfers between banks more efficient, and has additional applications such as capital call financing, invoice, and supply chain&nbsp;finance.</p><p>USDF runs on the Cosmos SDK based <a href="https://www.provenance.io/">Provenance</a> blockchain with IBC as a primitive. This is why, for example, it is possible for the Provenance blockchain to interoperate with other blockchains to settle payments by&nbsp;USDF.</p> Enterprise Blockchain Platform BSN (Bianjie) backed by the Chinese Government <p>Bianjie, the core development team responsible for delivering IRISnet, is also working on Cosmos-based enterprise solutions called IRITA (Inter-Realm Industry Trust Alliance). It is a consortium blockchain product built using the Cosmos/IRIS SDK branching off of the IRISnet&nbsp;project.</p>Source: <a href="https://medium.com/@bianjie/irita-interchain-service-irita-hub-has-launched-at-bsn-network-platform-10acaefeee9">IRITA interchain service, IRITA Hub&nbsp;, has launched at&nbsp;BSN</a><p>The Chinese government wants to include multiple blockchain frameworks and make them accessible under one uniform standard on the BSN (Blockchain Service Network) platform. The illustration above highlights the <a href="https://medium.com/@bianjie/irita-interchain-service-irita-hub-has-launched-at-bsn-network-platform-10acaefeee9">IRITA Hub as a key blockchain platform in the BSN ecosystem</a> with IBC connecting it to other public and private blockchains. Interoperability is supported between consortium and public blockchains such as Ethereum, IRISnet, Hyperledger Fabric and FISCO&nbsp;BCOS.</p> Atomic Swap Between Digital Currencies (Soramitsu) <p>Soramitsu, the initial contributor to Hyperledger Iroha and the co-development team behind the Cambodian Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Bakong has started using the IBC protocol to enable simultaneous exchange of digital currencies between different blockchains built on Hyperledger Iroha.</p><p>In recent years, the development of digital currencies has accelerated with multiple blockchains (Hyperledger Iroha, Hyperledger Fabric, Corda) employed as the underlying platforms. Therefore, there is a growing need to exchange multiple digital currencies simultaneously, called Payment Versus Payment (PVP) settlements, and this is enabled by connecting multiple heterogeneous blockchains via the IBC protocol. Soramitsu and Datachain have implemented IBC modules for Hyperledger Iroha and completed a <a href="https://medium.com/@datachain/datachain-and-soramitsu-successfully-achieve-interoperability-between-hyperledger-iroha-blockchains-eac55e7d8191">demonstration test</a> verifying viability. Soramitsu has also begun to conduct CBDC <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/philippines-vietnam-conducting-cbdc-feasibility-studies-with-soramitsu/">feasibility studies</a> in the Philippines and Vietnam to expand Enterprise IBC use-cases.</p> Conclusion <p>This article covers major enterprise use cases using the IBC protocol. As the use cases illustrate, large enterprise companies such as NTT DATA, US-based Banks, and the Chinese government-backed project BSN have started using the IBC protocol to minimize the risk in processing payments, through DVP settlements and exchanging multiple currencies, PVP settlements. While some projects are in the experimental phase, considering enterprise adoption is generally slower than for public chains, this is not a negative factor and demonstrates the potential of the solution.</p><p>If you have not yet done so, reading <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/why-cosmos-ibc-takes-an-essential-role-in-the-enterprise-space-95d84baeeca9">part one </a>of the IBC protocol for enterprise series will add additional context and is highly recommended to understand why enterprises have chosen to use the IBC protocol.</p><p>Datachain is committed to building an interconnected world of public and enterprise blockchains — the Interchain, powered by the IBC Protocol. Our work on the YUI project continues and we look forward to collaborating with the <a href="https://interchain.io/">Interchain Foundation</a> and Core Teams to drive adoption of the Cosmos Ecosystem.</p><p>Datachain also unveiled <a href="https://medium.com/lcp-network/lcp-a-proxy-for-light-client-verification-to-realize-trust-minimized-and-gas-efficient-f7d5868e4b0">LCP</a>, a proxy for light client verification to enable trust-minimized and gas-efficient cross-chain bridges using the IBC protocol.</p><p>To learn more about building the Interchain together, Datachain can be found on <a href="https://twitter.com/datachain_en">Twitter</a> and messaged here: <a href="https://form.run/@datachain-contact-en">contact&nbsp;us</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/ibc-use-cases-in-the-enterprise-space-are-coming-c280523b90b6">IBC Use Cases in the Enterprise Space are Coming</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network">Cosmos Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Just over one year ago, Statemine became fully operational on Kusama, allowing anyone to create fungible and non-fungible asset classes. Since then, Statemine has opened five bi-directional <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-crosschain#xcmp-lite-hrmp">HRMP</a> (aka XCMP-Lite) channels with other parachains and had two assets deemed “sufficient” by the Kusama stakeholders. Its cousin <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-statemint">Statemint</a> has become a parachain on Polkadot, and several applications, block explorers, development tools, and custodians have added support for assets on both networks.</p><p>Although as a live network, Statemint is the most visible, the team at Parity has been working to prepare for the launch of several more chains it plans to propose to governance as common good parachains. On the technical side, this work has involved making runtime changes that allow more expressive interaction over <a href="https://polkadot.network/cross-chain-communication/">XCM</a> and developing testing and release processes that scale to several runtimes.</p><p>The community has also provided valuable feedback on XCM uses, the general role of common good parachains (especially when it comes to adding new functionality), and the most desired new features. This feedback has shaped a lot of our internal roadmap for the coming six months.</p> Collectives <p>The team at Parity has been busy testing a new parachain for collectives and plans to make a governance proposal to connect it to Polkadot. For those who pay close attention to testnets, you may have already noticed a new parachain on Westend since late July, and that is where some of the final testing is happening.</p><p>The name “collectives” may not evoke much meaning, but Polkadot and Kusama already have collectives, each operating with a Council and Technical Committee. Although these particular collectives will retire with the proposed next generation of Polkadot governance, the ability to organize and act as a group (without needing to trust third parties like lawyers and jurisdictional courts) will remain an important element of Web3.</p><p>The <a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/gov2-polkadots-next-generation-of-decentralised-governance/">new proposal for Polkadot governance</a> introduces a new collective, the Fellowship, which allows a ranked group of experts to express its opinion on sensitive or highly privileged proposals. This collective succeeds the Technical Committee, but with much broader membership to represent more of the technical contributors to the Polkadot protocol. Rather than fast tracking referendum voting and enactment schedules, the Fellowship expresses its opinion that certain proposals are safe and of technical importance to the advancement or functioning of the network. Although the Fellowship and its logic will incubate on Kusama, it should eventually migrate to Polkadot and serve both networks via stakeholder-approved referenda.</p><p>Another collective in development is the Polkadot Alliance. The Alliance is already deployed on the Westend test parachain and will likely be the first one on Polkadot pending governance approval. Several community teams banded together about two years ago and came up with the idea for the Alliance, primarily to fight misuse of the Polkadot brand and unattributed code. If approved by the network, the Alliance would be an on-chain industry collective that sets a code of ethics regarding brand use, scam activities, and harmful behavior, but also provides recognition to teams who do make positive contributions to the growth and success of the Polkadot network.</p><p>Although the Alliance would exist on-chain, and publish its findings of unscrupulous websites and accounts on-chain, it will not have any governance powers. You can think of it like an airline alliance (e.g. Star Alliance), where members could have an Alliance badge on their website or product UIs that give users more confidence that certain standards of quality will be upheld. Likewise, wallets could warn users when connecting to websites or interacting with accounts that the Alliance has flagged.</p><p>The collectives parachain will connect only to Polkadot; there are no plans for a Kusama counterpart. In fact, for some collectives, like the Alliance, the Kusama network could actually join the collective as a member. That is, networks themselves can act as collectives and express their legislative voices as single opinions within other networks.</p><p>How this works in practice leads to the next parachain in the works: a bridge hub.</p> Bridge Hub <p>Polkadot always included plans for bridges to other networks, like Ethereum. And plans for a bridge between Polkadot and Kusama predate the launch of Kusama itself. As highlighted by recent exploits, building secure bridge primitives is a considerable undertaking. But the engineering team at Parity (in close collaboration with Snowfork and the researchers at Web3 Foundation) have made enough progress to begin testing for the launch process.</p><p>Before Kusama and Polkadot supported their first parachains, the only way to design a bridge was to put the bridge logic into the <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-architecture#relay-chain">Relay Chain</a> itself. But with both networks supporting parachains, it makes sense to have a parachain on each network dedicated to bridges. Because of the execution isolation provided by parachains, the activity on a parachain does not affect the Relay Chain or other parachains. So a bridge hub can support bridges to many other consensus systems. The team has been working on adding a runtime to <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-pdk#cumulus">Cumulus</a>, and has been prototyping bridge parachains on local testnets with plans to move to <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-pdk#rococo-testnet">Rococo</a> (bridged to its sinister sounding cousin, Wococo).</p><p>A bridge hub would of course be a hub, and support more bridges than just one between Polkadot and Kusama. Parity is also working with Snowfork on an Ethereum bridge to launch on the same hub. But this does not exclude other bridges from existence; teams who have built a bridge that does not fit under the common goods umbrella can still operate as parachains and offer their bridge services to the network.</p><p>Bridges require an understanding of finality of their bridged chains complemented with a message format and delivery service. The more technically minded readers may be familiar with the GRANDPA Finality and BEEFY consensus gadgets, used to verify finality on GRANDPA and Ethereum based chains, respectively. These modules are currently being reviewed by auditors and tested on the prototyping networks.</p><p>The second half, a message format and delivery service, comes from XCMv3 and Polkadot’s suite of <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-crosschain#cross-consensus-protocols">transport protocols</a> (UMP, DMP, HRMP/XCMP-Lite, and eventually XCMP). XCMv2 already allows for secure communication between parachains, but does not contain all of the messaging primitives that bridges need to interact with other consensus systems. XCMv3 is under review and bridges will be ready for action once XCMv3 is in production.</p><p>In practice, a bridge between Polkadot and Kusama will allow collectives like the Alliance and Fellowship to serve both networks, and even for Kusama to act as a unified voice and participant within those collectives or the Polkadot network as a whole.</p> Assets <p>Finally, let us not forget the first common good parachain, Statemint, which has a rich roadmap in its own right. At the launch of Statemint, the team kept the runtime intentionally lean, eschewing features like smart contracts that, according to the architectural principles behind Polkadot, should exist on other chains and interact with assets via XCM. This decision was frustrating to many developers who wanted to express more complex interactions. But the advancement of XCM is making these possible now.</p><p>Statemint’s two core pallets are dedicated to fungible assets and NFTs. After much feedback from the community about usability and desired features (e.g. asset locking and reserving, nested and multi-resource NFTs), several people from Parity, RMRK, Phala, KILT, and others are working on the next generation of these pallets to deliver these features.</p><p>Building on XCMv3 and the newer assets features, Statemint will also begin taking more “core system” level work from the Relay Chain, especially for the on-chain Treasury and balances.</p><p>It has been a long-standing idea within the Polkadot network for the on-chain Treasury to hold many assets, in addition to its native token. One reason for this is that users making Treasury proposals may want to request funding in other assets besides DOT. In addition, the Polkadot stakeholder community as a whole may want Polkadot to acquire stakes in other assets.</p><p>By providing the multi-asset support that Statemint specializes in, it can allow more options for Treasury use and management.</p><p>Statemint will eventually take on more balances functionality too. With staking and governance both on the Relay Chain, they can each interact synchronously with the DOT/KSM balances on the Relay Chain. That is, they can each get a “real-time” thumbs up that an account has sufficient lockable balance to stake, vote, etc. But as these subsystems move to parachains, they can only interact asynchronously. A user’s balance cannot exist at the same time on a governance parachain and a staking parachain, so those systems need a common place to reference balances.</p><p>To solve this, Statemint and XCMv3 support locking over XCM. In this model, a user may want to both vote and stake with 100 DOT, and the governance and staking chains would each request that Statemint lock the DOT and send an affirmation that the balance has been locked for each purpose. Then the governance and staking chains can issue the user the correct voting and staking rights, using the same locked DOT.</p> Community <p>The community has been a driving force in developing these plans. The roadmap that we originally had in mind for common good parachains has been rendered obsolete by many conversations with community members over the winter and spring. And that is a good thing.</p><p>Parachains have a diverse set of users: from end-users to application developers to other parachain developers. Feedback from all these groups has influenced our roadmap, and quite often external contributors submit PRs for the features that they want.</p><p>As the common good parachain team at Parity grows, we would love to see more community involvement from all types of users. The roadmap we’ve laid out in this article is a gargantuan endeavor. Common good parachains are meant to be an extension of the Relay Chain itself, part of the Polkadot core protocol. Like the rest of the core protocol, its success requires engagement from the entire community. We encourage everyone to get involved in any way: feel free to ask questions on <a href="https://substrate.stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a> or open issues in the <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AR1-statemint">Cumulus repository</a>.</p><p><br>Interested in building on Polkadot? <a href="https://info.polkadot.network/contact">Get in touch here</a>.</p>

Shade Protocol is launching Silk: a privacy-preserving collateralized, reflexive stablecoin built on Secret&nbsp;Network.</p><p>Without privacy, DeFi is incomplete. Traditional financial markets offer a degree of privacy for users, and as a result offer up greater protections in some capacity than existing DeFi markets. Shade Protocol will be the world’s first cohesive set of decentralized and privacy-preserving financial applications — ushering in a golden era for Web3. Shade Protocol will always push for privacy by default, privacy as an expectation, and privacy as the key to unlocking the full value of a decentralized future.</p><blockquote>But we can’t do this without community.

    <p>We are excited to announce our first NFT release, Zero Gravity, an exclusive NFT line created for the Horizen ecosystem summit, <a href="https://zencon.events">ZenCon0</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zero Gravity is a series of 250 pieces of artwork featuring Horizen’s mascot, Zenny, a galaxy explorer walking on a journey to a new world of web3. Owning one leaves footprints on paths of the Zen journey as we travel along these paths to the final destination of the unbounded.</p>
<p>The Zero Gravity NFT will be dropped to all ZenCon0 attendees and contributors who make this event a success. The NFT will offer the following privileges to its owners:</p>
 
 Exclusive access and benefits for all future ZenCon events and events hosted by Horizen and Horizen Labs 
 Whitelist spot for future NFTs issued by Horizen&nbsp; 
 Whitelist spot for future PKZ airdrops 
 VIP membership of Horizen swag store&nbsp; 
 
 The First NFT on TokenMint 
<p><a href="https://tokenmint.global/">TokenMint</a> is a no-code tokenization platform designed to provide a streamlined tokenization process. When first launched, the platform provided an easy and quick way to create fungible tokens. TokenMint will soon have NFT support, meaning the platform and tools (Cobalt wallet, explorer) can also support non-fungible tokens (NFTs).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zero Gravity NFT will be first released on TokenMint testnet as soon as the NFT support becomes available, targeted for the beginning of September, shortly before ZenCon0. Owners of the NFT will be able to receive, view, use and transfer their Zero Gravity NFT using the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Cobalt wallet</a> and the <a href="https://explorer.tokenmint.global/">TokenMint explorer</a>. The NFT will be transitioned to mainnet once the NFT support becomes available on mainnet.&nbsp;</p>
 About ZenCon0 
<p>We are less than a month away from <a href="https://zencon.events/">ZenCon0!</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ZenCon0 is the first ever summit to celebrate what we have achieved, share ideas for growth, and envision together the future of the broader Horizen ecosystem.</p>
<p>ZenCon0 is hosted and organized by Horizen Labs. We are joined by our investors, partners, advisors, and community members looking to build what’s next in web3 and are integral to the growth and success of the Horizen ecosystem.</p>

Participants can also claim an NFT badge on Project&nbsp;Galaxy.</p><p>❗️The Rialto Bridge exports Findora’s privacy features to the broader crypto space allowing existing projects to protect user transaction data and issue new privacy-preserving assets.</p><p>❗️Rialto will soon support NFT transfers on mainnet so they can enjoy private transactions on the Findora&nbsp;Network.</p><p>❗️The Rialto Bridge is a fork of ChainSafe’s ChainBridge, a multi-directional bridge with a proven record that has been extensively audited and stress-tested.</p> Welcome to Rialto: The Polygon Testnet&nbsp;Campaign <p>To celebrate the Polygon-to-Findora path launch and to incentivize extensive community testing, the Findora Foundation is sponsoring the “<a href="https://gleam.io/frUq2/the-shaking-up-the-bridge-giveaway-phase-3">Building Up the Bridge” Campaign</a>.</p><p>The foundation runs this multi-stage campaign when a new path deploys on mainnet to get as much community stress-testing as possible. Cross between the Polygon Mumbai testnet and the Findora Anvil testnet to earn $5 in FRA and claim your NFT badge from <a href="https://www.galaxy.eco/">Project Galaxy</a>. (All entrants are eligible to claim the OAT from Project Galaxy, which is an NFT certificate of your participation.)</p><p>Enter the campaign&nbsp;<a href="https://gleam.io/frUq2/the-shaking-up-the-bridge-giveaway-phase-3">here</a>!</p> Rialto, Findora, and Mass Crypto&nbsp;Adoption <p>The Rialto Bridge is the famous bridge that first united Venice with the broader Mediterranean world. It is also the name of the first bridge linking Findora to the broader Web3 universe.</p><p>Many public blockchains have driven crypto-adoption. Bitcoin proved blockchain technology, and Ethereum added wide programmability and DeFi. Chains like Solana and Polygon have focused on scalability. Findora, too, will drive crypto adoption by providing an often overlooked but necessary feature:&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>The Rialto Bridge lets Findora export privacy features to any connected chain, and the newest path Rialto is opening up is between Findora and Polygon. This will provide more liquidity for Findora and allow Polygon tokens and NFTs to migrate to Findora and participate in its scalable proof&nbsp;systems.</p><p>This quick post will take you through Rialto, how it works, and the details of the testnet campaign.</p> How Does the Rialto Bridge&nbsp;Work? <p>An essential part of Web3 infrastructure, blockchain bridges allow different chains to transfer information and assets between each other. Typically, bridges work by burning an asset on one side of the bridge and re-minting on the other&nbsp;end.</p><p>The Rialto Bridge functions very similarly and is a fork of the ChainSafe ChainBridge and already connects BNB Chain and Ethereum to Findora on mainnet. Once an asset travels from those chains to Findora, it can enjoy some of the privacy-preserving features offered by Findora’s UTXO&nbsp;ledger.</p><p>Rialto works by linking an EVM chain, like BNB Chain or Polygon, to Findora’s EVM layer. Tokens can then be transferred via Findora’s internal Prism Transfer to the ZKP-optimized UTXO layer, where advanced zk-proofs like Bulletproofs and Turbo-Plonks allow users to utilize different levels of privacy based on their&nbsp;needs.</p><p>For a deep dive into the organization of Rialto’s relayers and decentralized bridge architecture, check out this edition of <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation/rialto-bridge-architecture-deep-dive-55887eaa9bb9">Findora&nbsp;Academy</a>.</p><p>As a fork of ChainBridge, the Rialto Bridge starts with a strong and secure foundation. ChainBridge has been extensively tested by Consensys Diligence, whose report you can find <a href="https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/private/adash47d-chainbridge/">here</a>. ChainBridge has been forked by other projects as well, like <a href="https://medium.com/avalancheavax/the-avalanche-ethereum-bridge-what-you-need-to-know-b450d2ece03c">Avalanche</a>, and those bridges have run without incident.</p><p>The code will continually be audited, and the stress-testing from the community campaign should help reveal any other&nbsp;issues.</p> Campaign Sneak&nbsp;Peak <p>The campaign will start on August 18th, at 3pm&nbsp;PST.</p><p>Once you sign up for the campaign <a href="https://gleam.io/frUq2/the-building-up-the-bridge-giveaway">here</a>, you’ll need to follow Findora on social media before crossing the bridge. Instructions on how to cross the Rialto bridge on testnet are&nbsp;below.</p><p>The first 10,000 participants to complete the tasks below will win $5 worth of FRA tokens, and will receive their tokens a week after the campaign ends. KYC is required before rewards are distributed. Here’s a handy list of each&nbsp;step:</p>  <a href="https://gleam.io/frUq2/the-building-up-the-bridge-giveaway">Sign-up</a> for the campaign.  Join the #Rialto-bridge channel on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/fjjQt2AheU">Findora Discord&nbsp;server</a>.  Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/Findora">@findora</a> on Twitter with your registered Twitter&nbsp;account.  Join the <a href="https://t.me/findoraen">@findoraen</a> Telegram&nbsp;group.  Transfer at least&nbsp;.01 USDT, USDC, or SAND tokens from Polygon Mumbai testnet to Findora Anvil testnet. Be sure to use the web3 app (instructions below)  Transfer at least 0.01 USDT/ USDC/SAND from Findora Anvil testnet to Polygon Mumbai&nbsp;testnet.  Transfer at least 1 NFT From Findora testnet(Anvil) to Polygon&nbsp;Mumbai.  Transfer at least 1 NFT From Polygon Mumbai to Findora testnet(Anvil).   How to Cross Rialto with Fungible&nbsp;Tokens <p>If you need help on how to test the Rialto Bridge, here’s a quick guide to get you&nbsp;started:</p><p>Step 1: Configure MetaMask to work on Polygon Mumbai&nbsp;testnet</p>  Network Name: Polygon&nbsp;Mumbai  RPC URL: <a href="https://matic-mumbai.chainstacklabs.com">https://matic-mumbai.chainstacklabs.com</a>  Chain ID:&nbsp;80001  Currency Symbol:&nbsp;MATIC  Block Explorer URL: <a href="https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/">https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/</a>  <p>Step 2: Setup Metamask to work on Findora testnet by configuring Metamask’s network settings:</p>  Network Name: Findora Anvil&nbsp;Testnet  RPC URL: <a href="https://prod-testnet.prod.findora.org:8545">https://prod-testnet.prod.findora.org:8545</a>  Chain ID:&nbsp;2153  Currency Symbol:&nbsp;FRA  Block Explorer URL: <a href="https://testnet-anvil.evm.findorascan.io/">https://testnet-anvil.evm.findorascan.io/</a>  <p>Step 3: Request free MATIC tokens from the Polygon Mumbai testnet faucet at <a href="https://faucet.polygon.technology/">https://faucet.polygon.technology/</a></p><p>These testnet tokens are needed to pay for Rialto bridge gas fees on the Polygon Mumbai testnet side. Your test tokens may take a few minutes to show up in your MetaMask&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Step 4: Convert your test MATIC tokens to USDT, USDC, or&nbsp;SAND</p><p>Use the legacy version of <a href="https://legacy.quickswap.exchange/#/swap">quickswap</a> to get the USDT, SAND, or USDC by swapping your MATIC. If it is not working, try switching to the MATIC network before switching back to Mumbai when swapping. It may take a while before the transaction goes through. The bridge will support more Polygon assets when it is deployed on&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>Step 5: Cross the Rialto Bridge from Mumbai to the Findora Anvil&nbsp;testnet.</p><p>Visit <a href="https://anvil.rialtobridge.io/">anvil.rialtobridge.io</a> and connect your Metamask wallet. Next, change the “Source Network” to Mumbai. Enter the amount and token type you wish to transfer from the Polygon Mumbai testnet to Findora Anvil Testnet. Enter your destination (Findora Anvil Testnet) wallet address and click “Start Transfer”.</p> How to Cross Rialto with&nbsp;NFTs <p>The Polygon-to-Findora path of the Rialto Bridge will support both fungible and non-fungible tokens! NFT support for Ethereum and BNB Chain will also follow soon. When completed, these upgrades will make it possible to move NFTs minted on the Ethereum, BNB Chain, or Polygon to Findora so they can also be confidentially transferred.</p><p>Engineers soon hope to launch Triple Masking, a cryptographic function that will make it possible to protect the NFT’swallet address and contract details when sending and receiving them on the Findora&nbsp;Network.</p><p>Once you’ve added the RPC configurations shown above for the Mumbai and Anvil Testnets, the process of transferring NFTs from the Mumbai Testnet to the Anvil Testnet for the testing campaign is very&nbsp;similar:</p><p>Step 1: Get an NFT from the Anvil Testnet NFT&nbsp;Faucet</p><p>Go to <a href="https://anvil.rialtobridge.io/transfer">https://anvil.rialtobridge.io/transfer</a> and set the trade to go from the Findora Anvil testnet to the Polygon Mumbai tesnet. You will see an “NFT Faucet” button&nbsp;appear.</p><p>Note: make sure you have fra tokens on Anvil testnet before you claim from the NFT faucet. Join the findora official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/fjjQt2AheU">Discord</a>.</p><p>Step 2: Mint the NFT in your&nbsp;wallet</p><p>Ensure you have a little FRA in your wallet to cover the minting fee, and click the NFT Faucet button. The NFT will be minted in your wallet. NOTE: be sure to take note of the token&nbsp;ID.</p><p>Step 3: Transfer the&nbsp;NFT</p><p>Make sure to change the token type in the transaction to ERC-721 and input the token ID of the NFT that was minted for you. Choose a destination address that is on the Polygon Mumbai&nbsp;testnet.</p> NFTs on the Findora&nbsp;Network <p>Our EthCC hackathon winner, <a href="https://hitall.io/">hitall.io</a>, is a private NFT marketplace that has also been deployed on the Anvil testnet. You can also list your 721 tokens on Hitall after testing the&nbsp;bridge.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Findora/status/1555609182757216257">@Findora</a></p></blockquote><p>NOTE: If you need to import tokens on MetaMask to see the token balance, here are their token contract addresses:</p>  FRA on Polygon Mumbai: 0xF18048b3C998E5Bf4e9786278290c1FDA7F2b1E0  WETH_p on Findora: 0x66a8446BF2665f21d766558748CA46DA1aAE7E2C  USDT_p on Findora: 0x01d79d0A2dC2fB13710A22d3e85984DC1f75eE60  USDC_p on Findora: 0x3e1a88Ace379d50Cc7F9523a93B52e6EB427489f  SAND_p on Findora: 0x7c2e8aE011d32aEDBA14d97096bCff0a0B392597  WBTC_p on Findora: 0xc358d38d7E4F969507882C11C465BbD45BE33C82   Get Your Gas Fees Reimbursed! <p>The Findora Foundation is also covering gas fees incurred when crossing the Rialto Bridge on the mainnet. That means that for a limited time, it will reimburse gas fees from the BNB Chain and Ethereum chain. Once the Polygon Bridge is deployed on mainnet, the reimbursement program will also apply to transactions on that path — assuming funds are still available.

 Due to unprecedented actions of the US government to sanction Tornado Cash and all of its associated addresses, BlockWallet has stopped all privacy pool activity in the wallet. If you still have funds inside our privacy pool, please notify our community managers on Telegram. <p>BlockWallet was born out of our desire to give you tools to protect your wealth and&nbsp;data.</p><p>Features like privacy proxies, phishing protection, flashbots protection, and finally, privacy pools is a testament to&nbsp;that.</p><p>Privacy pools let you send or receive crypto without revealing your wallet address, which served as a practical and easy way to increase your privacy. We had integrated Tornado Cash as an underlying protocol for this feature because it was the most private and secure solution.</p><p>Last week, we saw OFAC take unprecedented action against Tornado Cash, effectively adding the protocol and associated addresses to their sanction list because of its unique role in crypto scams. This means that US citizens are barred from interacting with the protocol, but the implications go&nbsp;further.</p><p>Targeting malicious uses of this protocol is naive, short-sighted, and ignorant — because it also affects innocent users, including virtuous ones. Ethereum’s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin mentioned that <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1556925602233569280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">he donated to Ukraine using Tornado Cash</a> to protect his&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>In light of this situation, many thought-leaders have spoken out to give their opinion. One that stood out in particular was a <a href="https://twitter.com/SethHertlein/status/1557442355678117889">tweet by Seth Hertlein</a>, the head of Policy at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ledger.com/">Ledger</a>.</p><p>He mentions that if OFAC had sanctioned the criminals and hackers that used Tornado Cash, there wouldn’t be a problem. But crazily enough, the exact opposite occurred — a suspected <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/163206/suspected-tornado-cash-developer-arrested-in-amsterdam">Tornado Cash developer was arrested</a> in Amsterdam.</p><p>Tornado cash is open-source code meaning it’s not owned by anyone and is freely available to everyone. It is, thus a public good. We enjoy the benefits of public goods and infrastructure every day: the internet, our wireless networks, our money, the banking system, transportation infrastructure, and our roads and highways.</p><p>Guess what? Criminals use these everyday as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Of course, we should pursue these criminal who misuse public goods, but we don’t sanction SMTP because hackers send phishing emails or I-95 because drug dealers drive on it or cell towers that route terrorists’ calls. These are not persons — neither is Tornado&nbsp;Cash.</p><p>Like email and highways, Tornado Cash has been misused by criminals for criminal ends. However, Tornado Cash is also a tool that enables law-abiding citizens to maintain their privacy on the blockchain for a host of legal purposes, including political speech.</p><p>Regardless of government sanctions and ever-changing privacy landscapes, BlockWallet’s focus remains the same — protecting our users on Web3. We will continue exploring other alternatives to on-chain&nbsp;privacy.</p> About BlockWallet <p>BlockWallet is a privacy-first self-custodial browser extension wallet where you can store, send or receive crypto and interact with your favorite blockchain apps privately.</p><p>As crypto sees mainstream adoption, blockchain’s lack of privacy often translates to security risks.

<p>Tl;dr Coinbase has seen a concerning increase in fraudulent cryptocurrency investment platforms that are sourcing victims through connections on dating apps and social media. We are encouraging our users to be vigilant against this type of social engineering scam.</p><p>The Coinbase Security team has previously submitted the domains in this blog, in addition to several other related domains, to Google Safe Browsing for alerting users when browsing to these&nbsp;sites.</p><p>By Coinbase Global Investigations, Trust &amp; Safety, and Threat Intelligence Teams</p><p>Coinbase works closely with law enforcement partners across the globe to protect our customers from an array of targeted cyber attacks. Recently, a noteworthy increase in scams purporting to be foreign exchanges or crypto trading platforms that are spread by scammers who use dating apps to lure victims. While investment scams and romance scams are not unique to the cryptocurrency ecosystem, the irreversible nature of cryptocurrency transactions can make these scams devastating. This scheme is particularly effective because it relies on a scammer building trust with their victim sometimes over a long time period of weeks or&nbsp;months.</p><p>The scam typically follows this chain of&nbsp;events:</p>  Victims are contacted through social media, are matched with the scammer on a dating app, or are contacted on instant messaging applications.  The scammer encourages the victim to migrate their conversation to an encrypted messaging service, such as WhatsApp or WeChat, sometimes communicating for weeks or months before mentioning an investment opportunity.  The scammer typically claims they have received great financial returns from a cryptocurrency trading or mining platform and convince their victim to co-invest with them or teach them how to trade successfully.  Victims are directed to visit a fraudulent website that often looks like a legitimate trading platform and coached to deposit funds into an account that is controlled by the&nbsp;scammer.  Some victims even receive a small amount of funds that are claimed to be “returns” on their investment to entice them to invest even larger&nbsp;sums.  When the victim tries to withdraw funds from the site, they are then told they owe a tax payment or service fee before their funds will be released in an effort to further extort them for&nbsp;money.  <p>How we have been working to protect our&nbsp;users:</p>  Teams across Coinbase identify and add addresses associated with scams to our products’ blocklists to protect our customers.  Security teams frequently conduct scans to identify clusterings of existing scam sites and collaborate with law enforcement to enforce takedowns. These teams have increased monitoring to identify new sites that have the potential to be similarly abused.  While it is impossible to predict all addresses associated with scams, we conduct blockchain analysis on known scam addresses to map out related wallets and we communicate with other exchanges to inform them when they may be receiving these scammed&nbsp;funds.  We routinely collaborate with law enforcement to share intel on emerging scams and support their investigations.  <p>The following steps can be taken to protect yourself:</p>  Be skeptical of investment opportunities from people you meet through online forums or dating apps, even if you have been communicating for a while. If they claim to have an exclusive or urgent opportunity, this is a big red&nbsp;flag.  Don’t disclose your current financial status to people you’ve met online and don’t post any of your financial information on social&nbsp;media.  Independently research any trading platform you are considering sending money to, including using consumer protection websites.  Report any scams including the URL and the receiving cryptocurrency address to security@coinbase.com.  If you become aware of a scam, please report it to the FBI’s <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Home/ComplaintChoice">Internet Crimes Complaint Center</a>.  Report any scam websites to <a href="https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_general/">Google Safebrowsing</a>&nbsp;.  <p>Investment scam landing pages often look like the following examples:</p> <p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/security-psa-sha-zhu-pan-pig-butchering-investment-scams-9998ee163cae">Security PSA: Sha Zhu Pan (Pig Butchering) Investment Scams</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com">The Coinbase Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>It's hard to picture the future of financial privacy without Bitcoin. From its inception, Bitcoin was meant to be disruptive. And for over a decade, it has made giant leaps as a decentralized currency despite concerted efforts to subvert it. The fact that bitcoin is still here means that it's needed and has a role to play in the future.</p><p>Presently, using intermediaries in financial transactions always sacrifice privacy; as such, there's a growing need for decentralized peer-to-peer technology to facilitate money transfers. Bitcoin comes with some drawbacks in terms of privacy. The application of distributed ledger technology is fundamental to allowing bitcoin to work without "middle-men," but the transparency affects Bitcoin's ability to be used as currency. Consequently, bitcoin has had to evolve to meet the advances in technology used in deanonymizing public ledgers and degrading privacy.</p><p>The advancement in Bitcoin privacy will be most visible on the following fronts:</p><p>1. Wallets<br>2. Exchanges<br>3. Coinjoins<br>4. The Lightning Network<br>5. Open Source Development<br>6. Awareness and public sentiment</p> Wallets <p>The big question about wallets is, who keeps your private keys? If your wallet allows someone else to store your private keys, then the amount of privacy you have is controlled by the party trusted with your private keys. Giving away your private keys means that you trust the other party to always serve your interests over theirs, which is not always the case. A good wallet allows you to store your private keys. The wallets we use in the future will directly influence the amount of privacy we have while using bitcoin. The other feature of wallets that directly affects privacy is address generation. Working with a single unchangeable address is detrimental to a user's privacy as it builds a strong association with one address. The future of privacy will have more wallets allowing users to generate addresses on the fly whenever needed.</p><p>There will also be a more significant shift in the number of users running full node wallets. A node in bitcoin is software that allows a computer to have its record of the public ledger that other computers on the network can read or write. A full node also provides computation power when it participates in validating transactions before transmitting them throughout the network. Running a full node may be technical, but it gives the user more security and privacy when they know what they are doing.</p><p>With a growing number of novice users joining bitcoin, it will be critical for future wallets to be straightforward to use for everyone. This will directly affect fast advancements in user interface design to improve usability and user experience. The simplicity of the wallet does a lot to protect users from avoidable mistakes that may affect users transacting with privacy in mind. The trend for future wallets will likely sway in the direction of wallets that preserve privacy while being easy to use all at the same time.</p><p>The least private wallets in the future will be wallets that lack network-level protection from network deanonymization attacks. Such wallets will always reveal more network information about the users transacting with the wallets rendering them porous. To counteract this, the future will see more and more bitcoin wallets using Tor. The most private wallets will likely be Desktop wallets since they allow users to run better software than mobile phones. Wallets are at the center of the mass adoption of Bitcoin and privacy. There will always be a direct correlation between the wallet used to transact and the privacy of the user.</p> Exchanges <p>Bitcoin may be the future financial system, but it's unlikely that it can exist independent of the traditional financial system. The fact that bitcoin is a global currency means that users in different countries still need to convert their existing currencies into bitcoin and then back to local currencies. This is a role exchanges play. Centralized exchanges cannot exist outside the regulation that necessitates having all their customers fill KYC forms, degrading privacy. Central exchanges propagate the lack of privacy existing in the current financial system onto bitcoin. The biggest win for the future of privacy will be the growth of decentralized exchanges. Unlike centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges enable Bitcoin transfer in exchange for other currencies without giving away private information. The development of decentralized exchanges is likely to grow further with the growing interest in Non-Fungible Tokens and other cryptocurrencies. Users will easily exchange Bitcoin for other valuable assets with decentralized exchanges without giving up privacy. The near future will also see a more significant rise in the acceptability of bitcoin as a mode of payment, resulting in less need for exchanging bitcoin on central exchanges for local currencies.</p> CoinJoins All the Way <p>Coinjoins are probably a magic pill in the quest for bitcoin privacy. In a coinjoin, multiple users combine their coins and the output to every user is the same value of coins they put in the transaction, except that all the coins cannot be distinguishable from each other. &nbsp;Soon, trustless coinjoins will be more common because apart from improving privacy, they allow for fungibility. It will be noticeable that coinjoins will be more and more popular and their frequency will increase. For future wallets, conjoins will be one of the main features that make a wallet attractive to new users. Coinjoins will also see a shift to the type of coinjoins that do not allow third-parties access to users' wallet information. This is useful as it will enable users to preserve any private information they don't wish to give away in a coinjoin. With the increase in the number of coinjoins, the public ledger will be more obscure enabling greater privacy.</p> The Lightning Network <p>The development of the lightning network has the potential to revolutionize Bitcoin privacy and payments. By performing transactions off the main ledger, the lightning network allows for more private transactions. Already there exist implementations of the lightning network on bitcoin wallets but they haven’t been widely adopted yet. Wallets incorporating the Lightning Network will come with more development and advancements.</p> Open Source Technologies <p>Truth has to be verifiable. Open-source software allows us to inspect the software we use so that there is no fishy business. Privacy concerns make it important that the software we use really does what it says it does and not anything else. To establish trust, the trend of open source privacy tools is likely to pick up pace.</p> Public Sentiment about Bitcoin Privacy <p>Bitcoin hasn't been free from misconceptions. Probably the most pervasive relates to the usage of its privacy features in crime. Such claims have stopped others from leveraging bitcoin's privacy features to protect their financial information. Regardless of any held opinions, bitcoin has kept going because it’s desirable that a decentralized currency should exist and like all inventions, it is a driving force for both good and bad. The privacy features on bitcoin give users power that other tools can't afford, but we cannot assume that it is to be used entirely for bad. Future bitcoin users will understand that taking control of our financial privacy is necessary and that a future where our private worlds are constantly encroached upon isn't worth living in.</p>

<p>We’re still in the earliest years of cross-chain DeFi.<br></p><p>Different blockchains are significantly siloed, which you can tell by just looking at how Centralized Exchanges (<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/centralized-exchange-cex">CEXs</a>) continue to be the most convenient way for users to swap coins between them. Albeit straightforward, this still is far from ideal, given that it does not rely on blockchain-native products and that users’ funds sit in exchanges’ hands. <br></p><p>Because of all of this, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/interoperable-privacy-building-privacy-bridges-to-all-of-defi-2eaa89c9c7ac/">cross-chain interoperability</a> has become the holy grail (and an over-used 'buzz phrase') in DeFi, as protocols try to move value seamlessly across different blockchains.</p> A peek into the world of cross-chain DeFi <p>Blockchains are like straight, parallel lines that do not cross, end, or cross paths. Although most of them may have similar underlying technologies, most independent blockchain networks are not compatible with one another. Like water and oil, they are immiscible – flowing side by side but never truly mixing. <br></p><p>The reason blockchains can’t “mix” is because a blockchain’s main purpose is to allow users to coordinate without communication to keep a shared ledger. Since each blockchain keeps track of its own ledger, making them mix would require both of the colliding chains to “agree” on a single state for each compatible chain, and track every subsequent move on the other. This process, as you might imagine, is far from efficient and introduces several different problems into the picture.<br></p><p>Because of the difficulty of upholding more than one ledger, even when a blockchain is <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-a-fork">forked</a>, the newborn chain can only run side-by-side with the original.<br><br></p><p>The exclusive nature of Layer-1 blockchains poses a significant problem for DeFi protocols, which seek to take their services across several networks. There are many reasons for these issues, such as:<br></p>  Popular blockchains’ native assets, such as Bitcoin’s BTC, Ripple’s XRP, Polkadot’s DOT, etc. are incompatible with the most popular DeFi ecosystem, Ethereum.  High fees in Ethereum make users migrate to other DeFi ecosystems that might be better prepared to meet periods of high demand.  Yield-seekers trying to make the most of existing platforms across the board as opposed to limiting themselves to a single ecosystem.<br>   Enter the million-dollar question: what is cross-chain interoperability and how can it be achieved? <p>Cross-chain interoperability is the ability of a blockchain network to speak with other blockchains with which they share a similar underlying technology to drive information sharing. <br></p><p>Through cross-chain bridges and communication channels, users could in theory seamlessly and securely move value across different networks. Like two parallel lines finding a way to meet, cross-chain interoperability could unlock a way for different blockchain networks to speak to each other, with <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/institutional-defi-the-next-big-thing-a5b07193232b/">DeFi</a> being the biggest benefactor.<br></p>So far, cross-chain bridges have been the best way for users to move assets across multiple blockchains. (<a href="https://www.xdefi.io/article/cross-chain-bridges/">Source</a>) Why is cross-chain interoperability so important for DeFi? <p>Before the days of cross-chain interoperability, DeFi protocols were also restricted to serving the crypto community of the blockchain on which they were built. There was no room for non-Ethereum users to participate in Decentralized Finance on the most popular blockchain ecosystem. <br></p><p>Because of a lack of interoperability, DeFi protocols were limited to only the original blockchain they were built on. As such, they inherited all the underlying challenges associated with their native network. For Ethereum, this meant slow transaction speeds and high gas fees. For a few others, it was <a href="https://b2broker.com/news/cryptocurrency-liquidity-and-finding-the-best-liquidity-provider/">low liquidity</a> and a smaller customer base. <br></p><p>Cross-chain interoperability, therefore, changed the game for decentralized finance.<br></p><p>Projects no longer have to build for one network alone, as they can easily allow asset transfers across blockchains through bridges. Users can also complete cross-chain token swaps, deposit liquidity, collect and repay loans, farm new tokens without limitations, and transfer assets across networks at all times. Cross-chain interoperability also bridged previously disenfranchised participants into the world of DeFi, creating entry points for retail and <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/how-defi-could-unlock-institutional-liquidity/">institutional</a> users alike.<br></p>Cross-chain interoperability among blockchain-based systems using transactions. (<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/knowledge-engineering-review/article/abs/crosschain-interoperability-among-blockchainbased-systems-using-transactions/F411CF8796F08AFBEA09A3153A5F2183">Source</a>)<p>In summary, with cross-chain interoperability, DeFi protocols can enjoy:<br></p>  Scalability: Utilizing several blockchain networks allows for greater scalability, faster transaction speeds and reduced gas fees.<br>  Greater adoption: When a DeFi protocol supports cross-chain interoperability, it can access a greater pool of users across the different networks and provide DeFi services to everyone. <br>  Storage spread: A high number of users leads to higher storage costs for DeFi applications. When services are supported across several blockchains, DeFi protocols can spread storage costs evenly across networks. <br>  Liquidity spread: The more users a DeFi protocol can reach, the more liquidity is available for lending, borrowing, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/crypto-staking-misconceptions-benefits-risks-and-taxation/">staking</a>, etc. Cross-chain interoperability creates an avenue for a large inflow of liquidity across several blockchains.   Relevant cross-chain DeFi concepts<br> A high-level overview of the cross-chain DeFi infrastructure. (<a href="https://medium.com/ethereum-on-steroids/cross-chain-infrastructure-to-go-for-defi-dapps-55cfbe55470e">Source</a>)<p>As DeFi applications and protocols continue to build for a cross-chain future, several projects and concepts have carved a niche for themselves in decentralized finance. They have become integral parts of the DeFi ecosystem, helping drive cross-chain transactions and, ultimately, DeFi adoption. Some of them include:<br></p> Bridges: a pillar of cross-chain DeFi <p>Bridges are essential infrastructure in the cross-chain DeFi ecosystem – the fundamental framework behind multichain asset transfers. Essentially, bridges lock assets on one network and mint the equivalent assets on the other. They can be unidirectional (allowing one-way transactions only) or bidirectional (allowing back and forth transactions across two networks).<br></p><p>The need for cross-chain bridges first emerged when the DeFi ecosystem started growing on the Ethereum network, while the Bitcoin network remained the biggest source of crypto liquidity. This lead to the creation of a wBTC bridge enabling the transfer of BTC from the Bitcoin to the Ethereum network. However, it’s worth noting that this bridge is a token-specific unidirectional bridge, meaning wBTC only supports Bitcoin and transfers the value from the Bitcoin to Ethereum network, not the other way around.<br></p><p>Some other popular cross-chain DeFi bridges include <a href="https://multichain.org/">Multichain</a> Bridge, <a href="https://cbridge.celer.network/#/transfer">cBridge</a>, <a href="https://portalbridge.com/">Portal</a> (formerly Wormhole), and <a href="https://www.poly.network/">Poly Network</a>. Bridges for smart contract blockchains tend to be of the more flexible kind, as they allow for two-way communication.</p> Cross-chain liquidity networks &amp; decentralized exchanges <p>Even though cross-chain bridges bear the load of most cross-chain communications, they suffer from a range of issues. These include security concerns, the complexity of wrapped tokens, and the skepticism from several blockchain proponents.<br></p><p>Cross-chain liquidity networks and cross-chain decentralized exchanges (DEXs) aim to solve the problems faced by bridges and enable users to swap one network’s native token to another network’s native token (e.g. swap BTC for ETH without bridging assets, that is, an atomic swap) through a <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/cryptoeconomic-research/osmosis-a-fully-customizable-cross-chain-amm-built-on-cosmos/">cross-chain AMM</a> model.<br></p><p>With cross-chain interoperability and robust, intelligent algorithms, liquidity networks &amp; DEXs can power native token swap transactions across different blockchains. They also enjoy high liquidity. Famous examples include <a href="https://thorchain.org/">ThorChain</a>, <a href="https://cosmos.network/gravity-dex/">Gravity DEX</a>, and <a href="https://polkadex.trade/">Polkadex</a>.</p> Cross-chain staking protocols <p>Previously, DeFi staking protocols were limited to their native chains. With cross-chain interoperability, users can now stake assets across various networks, participate as validators, and enjoy staking rewards from each network. Cross-staking protocols enable users to earn passive income and contribute to network security across blockchains.</p> Cross-chain lending protocols <p>Lending and borrowing have always been a critical part of Decentralized Finance. With cross-chain lending protocols, users can borrow assets or supply liquidity for borrowers from one blockchain network to the other. Popular cross-chain lending protocols include Compound Finance, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/03/16/defi-platform-aave-lauches-v3-with-cross-chain-swaps-front-and-center/">Aave Protocol</a>, and Abracadabra.</p> The present state of DeFi interoperability <p>Cross-chain DeFi has gone beyond being a buzz phrase, as several projects are leaning towards facilitating blockchain interoperability. While interoperability has helped drive DeFi adoption on a grand scale and move billions of dollars in liquidity into Decentralized Finance, several factors remind us that the DeFi ecosystem is still in its early days. <br></p> Unsolved bridge vulnerabilities<br> <p>Bridges have also become viable targets for hackers looking to exploit large liquidity pools, and the continued attacks threaten the entire DeFi ecosystem.<br></p><p>According to <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/cross-chain-bridge-hacks-2022/">Chainalysis</a>, funds from cross-chain protocol hacks represented 69% of all the funds stolen in the crypto space in 2022. Recently, hackers attacked cross-chain bridge Nomad and stole over $100 million, representing the seventh major crypto bridge hack this year. Earlier in 2022, a heist on Wormhole (a bridge between Ethereum and Solana) resulted in a $320 million exploit, while the Axie Infinity sidechain Ronin was exploited in March, resulting in the loss of over $622 million. <br></p><p>It’s worth noting that bridge security is a major pending assignment for the crypto community. This is because several factors make bridges inherently attractive for attackers. The most common cross-chain bridge design requires locking native assets on the source chain and minting wrapped-assets on the destination blockchain. Since this model results in a large pool of assets locked on the source chain in a single contract/wallets, malicious actors only need to focus on a single contract to direct their efforts for a potential high reward. <br></p><p>Furthermore, as Vitalik Buterin (Founder of Ethereum) has repeatedly stressed, cross-chain bridges are prone to other security issues, such as their vulnerability in the event of 51% attacks. Vitalik argued in a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrngyk8/">Reddit post</a> that, in the case of a blockchain network getting 51% attacked, the native assets in user wallets remain safe, whereas bridged assets’ value is prone to getting diluted.<br></p>As it often happens, Vitalik Buterin’s concerns about bridges quickly made headlines across the blockchain community. Overreliance on Ethereum and the EVM<br> <p>Beyond security threats, interoperability is still not mainstream in DeFi. The dApp concentration on Ethereum remains high (78% of all decentralized finance applications are Ethereum-native), and most dApps do not support cross-chain interoperability. <br></p><p>Another barrier limiting the proliferation of cross-chain applications is EVM-compatibility.</p><p>EVM stands for <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/">Ethereum Virtual Machine</a>, a virtual component that is contained in every Ethereum node which takes in smart contracts (usually written in high-level languages like Solidity) and converts them into EVM bytecode. <br></p><p>EVM-compatibility means creating a code execution environment that supports EVM bytecode, therefore enabling Ethereum developers to migrate their smart contracts from Ethereum to other chains without having to write code from scratch. Some of the most popular EVM-compatible chain are Polygon, BSC, and Avalanche. Since not all blockchain networks are EVM-compatible, this creates a barrier for developers as their smart contracts cannot be deployed on non-EVM compatible chains. This also puts pressure on developers to stay grounded on EVM-compatible chains, since otherwise they might not be able to port their applications outside their host chain.<br></p> Privacy concerns associated with Layer-1 blockchains<br> <p>Because of the public-open nature of bridges, enabling DeFi interoperability may also come at the expense of privacy, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/the-economics-of-privacy-an-overview-of-the-economic-consequences-of-total-transparency-fed489e71d47/">transparency</a>, and individual autonomy. Privacy is already a concern for most blockchain network users, but when their transaction records are spread across several blockchains, it becomes even more worrying. Furthermore, guaranteeing seamless interoperability between private and public chains represents its own set of challenges.<br></p><p>With <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/blockchain-network-bridge-hacks/">security</a>, privacy, and slow adoption threatening the progress of DeFi interoperability, Panther proposes a series of alternatives to help cross-chain interoperability go private, finding its next breakthrough.</p> Cross-chain interoperability: What does the future hold? <p>Although cross-chain interoperability in DeFi is getting the much-needed traction it deserves, there is yet a lot of ground to cover before it becomes a norm in the crypto space. Several leading decentralized applications do not support cross-chain transactions, while those that already do face a plethora of challenges.<br></p><p>Cross-chain bridges are the bedrock of DeFi interoperability, and they have increasingly come under attack from hackers recently. While they have helped drive scalability in DeFi, cross-chain solutions increase privacy and transparency risks, and some known bridges even demand <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/kyc-aml-how-crypto-might-change-a-traditional-finance-standard-forever/">KYC verification</a> from potential users.<br></p><p>In the future, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-road-to-decentralization-part-1-setting-our-foundations-2e7e3874c09e/">decentralization</a> will continue to gain a foothold in crypto. Blockchain interoperability will play a significant role in leveling the DeFi playing field for users and protocols. The excess liquidity on Ethereum is also likely to spread across other blockchain networks. Similarly, the development of more blockchain-agnostic solutions like <a href="http://pantherprotocol.io">Panther Protocol</a> (which aims to build industry-standard private bridges that interconnect DeFi through a series of <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-multi-asset-shielded-pools-enabling-heterogeneous-mixing-of-assets-ec165854bf0f/">Multi-Asset Shielded Pools</a>) will be a catalyst for widespread DeFi adoption through interoperability.<br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

<p>Tl;dr: We are excited to announce the expansion of our enhanced password protections. By protecting the first layer of our user’s account protection, their passwords, we are continuing our commitment to offer our customers with the best security tools to protect their funds and accounts.</p><p>By Abhishek Agarwal, Group Product&nbsp;Manager</p><p>At Coinbase, one of our core pillars has always been the online safety and security of our customers. We believe that our customers need to have access to industry leading security features without sacrificing ease and convenience. Therefore, providing a safe, secure, and easy-to-use customer experience is our continuous commitment to all of our current and future customers.</p><p>With multiple online accounts to keep track of, it’s inevitable that our customers find it difficult to manage their passwords and sometimes end up re-using their favorite passwords across multiple online products and accounts. According to Google/<a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/google_security_infographic.pdf">Harris Poll data</a>, two in three people re-use the same password across multiple accounts. Of all the survey participants (ages 16–50+), 51% admitted that they use one particular “favorite” password for the majority of their accounts. Unfortunately, this is not the best solution for their online security: by using the same key for multiple accounts, if one password happens to be breached, all of their other accounts are at risk of being compromised too.</p><p>Since 2019, Coinbase has been monitoring third-party credential breaches and darknet markets for indications that a reused password might be putting Coinbase accounts at risk. This feature (which automatically monitors existing Coinbase accounts at no additional cost) has helped protect tens of thousands of users since its launch. Today, we are happy to announce that we’re expanding our enhanced password protections to continuously cover users, starting from the moment they sign up to the rest of their journey with us, and protect them from using compromised passwords in their Coinbase accounts.</p><p>With this enhanced security measure, every time a customer creates or changes their password, we will automatically check to see if their selected password was exposed in any third party data breach and suggest the usage of a different &amp; more secure password. With this extra protection, we are helping our users to be safer with a safer shield for the first layer of their account security.</p><p>Our commitment to our customers’ safety and security is always top of mind, and this update is another step to make our customers experience safer and easier to use. At Coinbase, we’re proud to <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/security">lead the way in providing the best security protections</a> to all of our 98+ million&nbsp;users.</p><p>If you want to learn more about our Password security measures, <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/privacy-and-security/data-privacy/password-security">feel free to access this help center&nbsp;article</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/reinforcing-our-customers-account-security-with-enhanced-password-protection-6918c96b1e3d">Reinforcing our customers account security with enhanced password protection</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com">The Coinbase Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Web3 is the new frontline for privacy — here’s how we can fight for&nbsp;it <p>Web3 has become an umbrella term for a range of increasingly disparate visions of the future of the internet. For some people, ‘Web3’ means metaverse-based projects of the sort trumpeted by Meta. For others, it describes new protocols and modes of organisation based on distributed ownership and&nbsp;control.</p><p>Generally speaking, though (and for our purposes), Web3 means the emerging new iteration of digital communication based on the principles of decentralisation. Web3 uses blockchain-based technologies, tokenisation, and cryptography to enable new forms of cooperation and transmission of information. Nascent examples of this include&nbsp;DAOs.</p> Is Web3&nbsp;private? <p>There is no simple answer to this question — and, of course, if you need clarification about whether or not a technology you’re using is truly private, then it almost certainly is&nbsp;not.</p><p>The current iteration of the internet, known as Web2 (or Web 2.0), is characterised by catastrophic centralisation. Power (whether exercised directly, for example through state surveillance and its outcomes, or indirectly, for example through control of the vectors through which information travels) is concentrated in an ever-smaller number of siloes. Control of those siloes is contested; one of the major developments associated with this phase of the web has been the extraordinary rise of tech-enabled non-nation-state actors such as GAFA. These monolithic companies are both challengers to conventional state power and inextricable partners of those states, the latter of which increasingly cannot do without the infrastructural assets of the&nbsp;former.</p><p>Some observers appear to consider Web3 inherently ‘more private’ than the existing model because they associate words like ‘blockchain’ and ‘decentralisation’ with anonymity. Others have a different understanding: to these people Web3 must be inherently ‘less private’ because they associate blockchains and decentralisation with total transparency, presumably because of the oft-repeated but much-misunderstood fact that transactions on a blockchain are immutable and everyone can ‘see’&nbsp;them.</p><p>In reality, of course, the technologies associated with Web3 can and will be deployed in different ways that suit individual use-cases. There are many situations in which some degree of privacy is absolutely critical. Consider, for example, the storage and transmission of medical&nbsp;data.</p><p>Beyond this there are significant questions about the degree to which decentralisation will actually be achieved, at least for the average web user. Consider the crypto exchange model. In order to transact in Bitcoin, for example, most users require an ‘on-ramp’ enabling them to buy coins in exchange for fiat currency — a function that is carried out by huge centralised exchanges with vast data processing power and everyone’s credit card details. This is far from true decentralisation.</p> Can we make Web3&nbsp;private? <p>The examples above give an indication of just some of the first infrastructural pitfalls that Web3 has to overcome in order to achieve anything like its promise of decentralisation and, crucially, to fulfil its potential for privacy. They should highlight that there is no inherent privacy in Web3; there is no ‘baked-in’ privacy protocol, and privacy is not guaranteed by&nbsp;design.</p><p>Privacy will not be achieved in Web3 unless it is taken as the foundational principle of these new modes of communication. In practice, this means the creation of a ‘layer 0’ protocol that guarantees anonymity — that is, a protocol that is private by design. The Web2 analogue here is TCP/IP, the governing protocol of the modern internet, also known as the network layer. Nym is working hard to build this layer 0 privacy protocol for Web3, which also enables interoperability between other protocols and standards (whether blockchain-based or not). But the tech stack of Web3 privacy is broader than just layer&nbsp;0.</p><p><a href="https://scrt.network/">Secret Network</a> focuses on running private smart contracts which don’t expose user data to the public, unlike most if not all other smart contract systems. <a href="https://www.manta.network/">Manta</a> is relying on a state-of-the-art cryptographic primitive called zk-SNARK to build its decentralised protocols for private payments, token exchanges, loans and synthetic assets. <a href="https://aztec.network/">Aztec</a> enables users to privately interact with all DeFI services within the Ethereum ecosystem by integrating specific zero knowledge proof circuits in smart contracts already deployed. <a href="https://www.offshift.io/">Offshift </a>and <a href="https://www.railgun.org/#/">Railgun</a> focus on privacy for smart contracts; <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/">Monero</a> and <a href="https://z.cash/">Zcash</a> aim to provide privacy in currency transactions… And the list goes&nbsp;on.</p><p>There is a growing community of projects and developers dedicated to making Web3 more private, and to building applications that enable privacy for specific actions and circumstances. The battle to wrest control of the nascent new internet from the clutches of state and corporate actors is going to be a long and difficult one, and privacy requires constant vigilance. Thankfully, there is an <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/live/video?roomId=2100782">emerging coalition</a> of projects dedicated to a private internet. Nym is proud to be among them. We each bring different solutions to the table — but we all share a common&nbsp;vision.</p><p>In order to build a truly private future for digital communication we need cooperation, mutual support, and interoperability. And, perhaps most importantly, we need clear, effective and unified communication about the problem we are&nbsp;solving.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/web3-is-the-new-frontline-for-privacy-heres-how-we-can-fight-for-it-eb4ee785d890">Web3 is the new frontline for privacy — here’s how we can fight for it</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Here are <a href="https://www.tillyone.com/home/">TillyONE’s</a> responses to some questions from the Findora community:  1) Tell Us About&nbsp;Yourself <p>I’m a California-native Systems Administrator. My first PC as a kid was a 486DX (this REALLY dates me&nbsp;:/ ), and I’ve been into technology ever since. More importantly, I’m a father of two great boys &amp; have a wonderful wife who helps guide me, looks out for our family, and cares for those in need every&nbsp;day.</p><p>I’ve managed servers ever since I was 19 (again, I won’t share my age, but trust me, it’s been a long time). Since then, I’ve been in the professional IT industry for 10&nbsp;years.</p> 2) What brought you into crypto/web3 in the first&nbsp;place? <p>My first venture in the crypto-verse was with Eth in 2017. Miss those&nbsp;prices!</p><p>Since then, I’ve mined LTC, CPU &amp; GPU farming pools, experimented with basic ASIC hardware, and anything else to&nbsp;learn.</p><p>These new PoS tech systems like Findora are really the future&nbsp;IMO.</p> 3) What is your experience in validating or web3 in&nbsp;general? <p>I’ve been a validator in one form or another for 11 months now. I’ve learned the growing pains both from being a validator myself and from issues for a chain in general. I’ve also gained the experience to execute proper maintenance and upgrades when needed for minimal downtime on a&nbsp;node.</p> 4) What makes your operation unique? <p>TillyONE from day one has had a real family vibe to it. I really believe while the tech development, investments from VCs and Exchanges, etc. are important, the main question is, “What are we doing this&nbsp;for?”</p><p>For TillyONE, it’s for the family to learn new things about web3/crypto (because it’s evolving and will be a bigger part in one’s life soon) and be a part of&nbsp;it.</p><p>In my growing years as a kid, it was WWW; now for my kids, it’s&nbsp;web3.</p> 5) Why do you want to validate with&nbsp;Findora? <p>I’ve met some really smart and honest people at another initiative.

 <p></p><p>When you hear the term 'credential', what comes to mind? Is it a driver's license, passport,  birth certificate, college degree, state ID? The common thread of these forms of credentials is that they are physical items, verified by recognized centralized bodies like a government agency or accredited university.  </p><p>So how do credentials translate into the digital world where within a few clicks someone can make a fictitious identity? Introducing... verifiable credentials (VCs), a digitally signed electronic credential that follows an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">open standard</a> that lets you create, own, and manage your credentials across a variety of platforms.</p> Why Do We Need Verifiable Credentials?<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Over the course of your digital history, you've likely signed up for hundreds of apps and services with elements of your personal data fragmented, such as your name, email address, or more sensitive information like your date of birth and government ID number. These services then share your data with other third parties that you may not even be aware of - with or without your consent. It's difficult to go back and deactivate your profiles, delete your accounts, or reclaim additional data these services have collected on you. Worse is if there is a data breach in one of these services and now your data is out in the public.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials aim to solve these problems by putting the power to manage your data back into your hands. Imagine being able to own and control your personal data by only allowing access to services that require it and having the authority to disable services that no longer need it. You can even manage your data on your own self-hosted decentralized web node via an identity hub without relying on any centralized third party. </p><p>Additionally, you can own multiple Verifiable Credentials for various use cases such as a student ID, a driver's license, a passport, or a certificate you earned. You can also have one specific Verifiable Credential with multiple <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations">presentation layers</a> such as a passport where certain metadata is presented when used in a given context.</p> How Do Verifiable Credentials Work?<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>You may be wondering who actually issues a Verifiable Credential, how does it get verified and who verifies the verifier? </p><p>Let's look at the following example of the manual way credentials are issued. You've been accepted to your top university of choice and now need a student ID to access both the campus and online resources. Specifically, you want to apply for a campus parking permit as well. </p><p>Typically this process would involve you taking physical copies of multiple forms of ID verification such as a passport, birth certificate, and driver's license to a physical office. Then after a few days of various checks, you're finally issued a physical student ID card from that university. The university trusts the entity that issued your birth certificate, passport, and driver's license to create a student ID for you. They can even look you up by the identification numbers on these documents. </p><p>But what if someone in the admissions office looked up your driver's license and noticed those parking tickets you have? Were they even allowed to do so and could this bias their decision to give you a parking permit?</p><p>The current process looks something like this:</p><p></p><p>Now let’s look at how verifiable credentials could help in this scenario. The university would run verification checks for each document provided (passport, driver’s license, birth certificate, etc) and the credential would be limited to just basic bio data that is required such as a legal name, date of birth, etc. So no one from the student department will be able to see your ticketing history associated with your driver’s license.</p><p></p> Using Verified Credentials<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) work alongside Verifiable Credentials. DIDs are unique identifiers that let us reference various VCs and the entities that also issue those credentials. For example a government or company can have their own unique DID. </p><p>DIDs use the following schema:</p><p>
photo credit: W3C</p><p>DIDs can then be used to create a Verified Credential by digitally signing it and assigning it to a holder, similar to how transactions are cryptographically signed in a blockchain. Depending on the signature format of the credential, the holder (also known as a DID subject) can then choose how much of that credential they want to present to an entity requesting the credential, which is referred to as selective disclosure. </p><p>An example is an employer, Company X, who looks up the DID of your college diploma from University Y. </p><p>Company X queries the issuer of your Diploma Verifiable Credential, in this case University Y, and also looks up the DID of that university in a verifiable data registry (VDR). Think of VDRs as just lists that can be managed and maintained by various parties such as wallets, financial institutions, DAOs, non-profits, etc. If your credentials have valid digital signatures but somehow University Y is on a list of non-accredited institutions in the USA but accredited institutions in Europe, it would be up to the Company X to decide if they want to accept it.</p><p>The diagram below outlines the flow of this process.</p><p>
photo credit: W3C</p> Use Cases for Verifiable Credentials<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>There are several use cases that can be realized with the use of Verifiable Credentials, such as</p>  Employment checks without being invasive   Managing of health records, land titles, etc  Managing of various forms of personal identification such as passports, driver’s licenses, etc   KYC (Know Your Customer) checks for financial institutions and businesses  Managing your gamer profile across different metaverses  Managing Memberships  <p>DIDs and VCs allow us to create identities and credentials in an interoperable ecosystem that allow developers and businesses to build a new wave of products, applications, and services that put users in control.</p>

The following piece outlines what you can expect from Coinbase ahead of The&nbsp;Merge.</p><p>By Armin Rezaiean-Asel, Product Manager at&nbsp;Coinbase</p><p>On August 10, 2022 Ethereum completed the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/#merging-with-mainnet">Goerli public testnet</a> merge — its final trial before making the migration from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to <a href="https://links.coinbase.com/a/click?_t=3aca56371967418192255878e9689713&amp;_m=f5c33c7a66474a658e944041a08975f9&amp;_e=EiC_PPHCV9V8QDoslX53InL52cBjoh9bQcJjOvs_iFV946GsMXEgqP-HAp3YtYUEP6iUnp8_ZTJlGc46YF01IQ7ff-TCVT_28UfFDdVI4znVW1ySqJp6CSZM2IS7Z-TrSMrPISmq-sdQWRR3yeiMLh4uF_GfhVydOHGF8ggOOVP1KAIzxNKae2Es9RlwIdAIA2Ef7GbvmEpqMWbau2MSqzPTGZQDZ-eu8QT2pTs5bracVvI_4ZrKV_wWFcCSRT1dcrMrKTCkyOOfNLbtl0CSf1MmwCr8YBVil3Bgry0YlIweT_0HpKSWnV6P4lf6i_42qfdeoc2JJOyQqshtNSxSPIsT9gjGYrZutwzUyg1CyhiHzJk5btU4uIAzmUdfc0ttr8bTN8Yd3NCFslK8EPmN1D3Pu_UOB7-ydPf74hpdavJhfDTEJIZ8Di9IF9PSvQH6TpmgFoAXlF7c0hISEJjJQoZp1hVPJZ1LdNEL-WHyKYxa5IO_0pCpdsX2sGtskavb_sBZglFp23zyhC2wRCdSkJji76bNLolghpQwjXe-Y_yN6fnfsCYJKDaH5I9wRjKx">Proof-of-Stake</a> (PoS)* on mainnet (also known as <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/the-merge-and-the-ethics-of-ethereum-dec22a43b363">the Merge</a>). Ethereum is now anticipated to complete the Merge on or around September 15, 2022 (<a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/08/12/finalized-no-36/">TTD 58750000000000000000000</a>). Six years in the making, this milestone will reduce energy consumption for the Ethereum network by <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/country-power-no-more/">a projected 99.95% </a>compared to&nbsp;PoW.</p><p>With the rise of DeFi and NFTs, the Ethereum network has endured traffic bottlenecks and unpredictable spikes in transaction (gas) fees. Although PoS on its own does not lower transaction fees, it does set Ethereum up to continue delivering on its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGjFTzRTH3Q">scalability roadmap</a>.</p><p>At Coinbase, we view this event as a major step toward scaling adoption of the cryptoeconomy and will support it in a variety of ways that align with our mission to increase economic freedom in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>What does the Merge mean for Coinbase&nbsp;users?</p><p>During the Merge, Coinbase will briefly pause new Ethereum (ETH) and ERC-20 token deposits and withdrawals as a precautionary measure. Although the Merge is expected to be seamless from a user perspective, this downtime allows us to ensure that the transition has been successfully reflected by our systems. We do not expect any other networks or currencies to be impacted and expect no impact to trading for ETH and ERC-20 tokens across our centralized trading products.</p><p>You will be informed via <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase">Twitter</a> and the <a href="http://status.exchange.coinbase.com">status page</a> when ETH and ERC-20 tokens are available for deposits and withdrawals.</p><p>It’s important to always be on high alert for scams, but especially leading up to the Merge. We recommend you don’t send your ETH to anyone in an attempt to “upgrade to ETH2” as there is no ETH2 token. Your assets will be safe and secure during this period and <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/#users-holders">no action</a> is required to upgrade on your&nbsp;part.</p><p>After the merge, you can find your staked ETH (ETH2) balance under your Ethereum (ETH) wallet on the platform. Your staked ETH will be listed separately from any unstaked ETH or dapp wallet ETH balance you might be holding. As a reminder, ETH2 is the ticker Coinbase set ahead of the Merge to represent staked ETH and will no longer be used after the Merge — there is no ETH2&nbsp;token.</p><p>Staked ETH (ETH2) balances won’t be unlocked at the time of the Merge or be available to trade or transfer until the Ethereum protocol upgrade completes. The upgrade is anticipated to be completed by early&nbsp;2023.</p><p>For Coinbase Prime and Coinbase Exchange customers:</p><p>Coinbase Prime users with ETH and ERC-20 balances may experience temporary delays in custody withdrawal availability. We recommend initiating any withdrawals or deposits prior to this date, or after the Merge completes. We’ll send specific institutional customer communications before the transition to give our customers specific guidance on timing and SLAs during this&nbsp;time.</p><p>For Coinbase Cloud customers:</p><p>Customers running their staking or node infrastructure through Coinbase Cloud should expect to experience a routine upgrade with approximately 10 minutes of downtime in advance of the Merge. Customer infrastructure should experience little to no downtime when the Merge block is passed, and changes will be backwards compatible. Our Customer Success team will reach out to inform you of upgrade timelines and if any other actions are required to prepare you for the&nbsp;Merge.</p><p>For Coinbase Wallet&nbsp;users:</p><p>Coinbase Wallet users with ETH and ERC-20 balances, as well as NFTs or DeFi positions on the Ethereum network, should experience minimal to no impact. Assuming a successful transition, the network will remain operational, and users can continue to transact with their self-custodied crypto on the Ethereum mainnet once the transition is complete. As always, network fees will be set by the network based on demand, and as a reminder, Coinbase neither sets nor collects those&nbsp;fees.</p><p>For Coinbase Commerce customers:</p><p>During the merge time, we will be temporarily pausing the ability to process new payments as a precautionary measure to ensure that funds are protected. In-process payments will also be delayed. Once the merge is complete, payment processing will be re-enabled. There is no action required by users and in-process payments will be confirmed at this&nbsp;time.</p><p>We aim to support the Merge with the least amount of friction possible for our users — without compromising on security. We’ll continue to provide updates on our <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://status.exchange.coinbase.com">Statuspage</a> as more information becomes available.</p><p>As a reminder, the Merge is the culmination of years of work by the Ethereum Foundation, independent researchers, client teams, infrastructure providers like Coinbase Cloud, and many others. At Coinbase, our role is to protect users’ assets and help ensure a seamless transition across Coinbase products. For Ethereum network specific information, you can follow the <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/">Ethereum Foundation Blog</a> as well as the Ethereum network on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/ethereum">Twitter</a>.</p><p>*<a href="https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-proof-of-work-or-proof-of-stake">Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake</a> are the two main <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/crypto-education/glossary/consensus-mechanism-protocol">consensus mechanisms</a> used to verify new blocks and add them to the blockchain. First pioneered by Bitcoin, PoW consensus mechanisms use mining to achieve these goals. On the other hand, popular PoS blockchains such as Cardano, Avalanche, Polkadot, and Solana utilize staking to achieve similar&nbsp;goals.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/the-ethereum-merge-is-coming-heres-what-you-need-to-know-5f3b3045aab2">The Ethereum Merge is Coming: Here’s what you need to know</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com">The Coinbase Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>I’ve been meaning to share this jewel of insight from my friend Cliff for a month, but I needed to get past the summer doldrums and re-engage with my blog. I’m taking a week off to refresh my thinking in the Shenandoah, but when I get back I’ll be ready to jump back into Berggruen and California eugenics. Next week I hope to visit several institutions in Virginia that played important roles in scaling forced sterilization – the <a href="https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/buck-v-bell-1927">Buck versus Bell</a> case. Stay tuned.</p>
<p>Until then, soak up the teachings of a dear friend and enjoy the charming animated short he commissioned to share tools from his toolbox with the rest of the world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can find more insights from Cliff on his Youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/cg3ly">here</a>.</p>
<p>“Maybe we don’t walk off the stage and leave the world and life behind when our body dies. The framing of the story generally believed in now claims the world we see is an independent reality. It says we’re separate from it and each other. It says we live brief lives and then die. It says an individual life is of no great consequence to life itself. Adopting that frame and consequently experiencing our life through that lens is a choice we’re responsible for making and we can change our minds. We’re capable of letting go of the belief that our life is of no consequence and that bodily death is the end. We can consciously choose to live our lives from within a different frame in mind.</p>
 
<p>I’ve chosen to live in a different story, and my choice didn’t arise from nothing. It’s drawn from the contents of my experience. My experience is the only truth I claim, and my experience showed me the world isn’t what I imagined it to be.</p>
<p>Everything I imagined as a separate world, an independent reality, I see now as a reflective surface where ideas representing life appear. Seen newly, I understand the world to be intimately connected to me because, after the rendering an idea in mind, an image of myself is reflected on the surface commonly called the world. My body is an image of me, a reflection on the surface that the world is, the reflection of an idea in my listening, the idea of my identity.</p>
<p>What I imagine as myself and the world is influenced. I didn’t dream the story up alone and without the influence of something else in mind. In mind at large, you don’t get something from nothing as you do in the story of the Big Bang. Children don’t magically appear from nowhere; a stork doesn’t bring them; they’re the result of combining information, of one person sharing their story with another. Your story of the world arrived in your listening, so it’s worth paying attention and noticing what it is you’re listening to. Your listening is always under the influence because you’re not alone in an empty universe making something from nothing. For the sake of your experience of life, it’s worth noticing what it is that’s influencing you.</p>
<p>If you’re unhappy with the image of yourself you see in the mirror and the conditions you see in the world, address it in mind, where what influenced the picture of yourself and the world exists, rather than pretending your appearance or the appearance of the world is whatever you interpret it to be. Rather than attempt to force others to agree with your interpretation, take responsibility for your listening and the influences in mind that, together with you, produced the biological art that represents yourself and the world.&nbsp;Living in an interpretation of what you see on a surface that only reflects ideas held in mind compounds a mistake that lead you &nbsp;away from your creative power in the first place.</p>
<p>Maybe we don’t ever leave the world because it’s not a place, but is instead the influenced reflection of ideas in mind. We can begin to address the deception we find here, one of the influences in mind, by taking the stand that we’re responsible for the area of mind at large where our local signal arrives, the attachment point to mind at large where we notice it coming, the place where what we think of as the thoughts we have arrive.</p>
<p>Before trying to effect a change in the collective signal that informs the shared space of the cultural mind, we should familiarize ourselves with learning to manage our reception at our access point, our unique IP address, and our internal antenna settings there. I don’t think we ever wake up and leave, but instead wake up and expand by gaining bandwidth, by sending our listening out to a previously unknown horizon while simultaneously diving further into the depths of our hearts.</p>
<p>There’s a place to communicate from beyond the babel that world culture has on offer, a place where you can strike a clear tone of intention that will penetrate our current cultural mind like an earthquake. You can offer something there that becomes visible art, a communication that transmits comprehension without the need for language such that any</p>
<p>aspect or lineage of life, of being itself, can understand it.</p>
<p>From intention, sound can rise into art that shakes the ground of unconscious consensus and individual misunderstanding. Through such communication, you can topple what were assumed to be permanent structures of deception. With a clear and heartfelt tone rising up that all can see, you can wreak havoc on the very foundations of the lie from which all iterations of it are derived.</p>
<p>Be still once awake and help build a listening path that others might follow to a place for communication from which what you share is heard by all. The narrow band of listening most people inhabit now, and the misconceptions that drive its limitations, can be swept gently aside in the presence of the art of love. Qualities of being can become sound, can become clean, comprehensible tones that rise up as art and bypass the language center and all its chaos. These deep heartfelt tones don’t require a language system of comprehension to dissolve the signal attachment of the temporarily deceived.</p>
<p>In listening, there’s a way to commune with and internalize the soft heart tones of any beautiful mind. You can set them free to be amplified and empowered at the broadcast point on that distant horizon, a place&nbsp;that has an umbilical connection to the center of the universe, to the community still point of life itself that exists in every heart. Don’t exit what you think of as life behind a story influenced by something unkind. Instead, step out of an unkind story and into an empowered one. You’ll hear it if you listen for it. Find your way to a place of empowered communication that gives you access to the center of the living universe where it exists in every heart, and say something beautiful and kind.</p>
<p>If one day soon you hear something that sounds like soft birdsong slowly building into a universe-spanning hurricane of vibrational music that rises as visible art and remakes DNA in its passing, be unafraid as your vision blurs. The world shimmers before appearing again anew.</p>
<p>When you come to your senses and realize you can see auras, smell lies, and taste deceit as easily as you can tell mint from cinnamon, be at ease because you’ve been upgraded courtesy of communication worthy of being shared into the heart of the matter, information that makes it possible to change one’s mind and so alters the surface reflection of ideas in mind that appear as the world we see with our eyes.</p>
<p>If you’re calm and still and listen, you’ll hear the soft beginnings of a distant symphony of such communication that’s already begun and is making its way inward to the center of the universe, which has always been at home at the still point inside you. Surrender as it approaches in awareness, relax and let it in.”</p>

<p>This presentation is a follow up to the one Jason, Lynn, and I did deconstructing the Joe Rogan / Marc Andreessen interview last month. You can watch that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji-IFlK0qjk">here</a>. Laura Arrillaga, Marc’s wife, established policy infrastructure around data-driven philanthropy and social innovation in the Bay Area starting in the late 1990s through her ties to Stanford, SV2, the Hoover Institute, and the Silicon Valley Community Foundation. In the first half of the presentation I ended up spending a good deal of deal time analyzing the feature image of a paper Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen wrote for the Stanford Social Innovation Review on disruptive technology and how it exemplifies Jacob Moreno’s sociograms, Robert Hartman’s “Human Value Profile,” and Piritim Sorokin’s “Creative Altruism” combined with Theosophist Fritz Kunz’s insights into complexity theory and crystallography. The second half of the presentation uses quotes from the article to reveal the truth about the predatory nature of tech-driven “philanthropy,”</p>

<p>Our lives are made for communication, our bodies bathed in information.</p>
<p>Some information is vague, like a handmade sign in a sagebrush field “Coming Later.”</p>
<p>Sometimes amusing, “Wisdom Way, Dead End.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sometimes it is unexpectedly delightful, a poem composed on a typewriter outside a Taos grocery as two young boys look on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sometimes cryptic. An unusual painting of a golden “T” or “B” in an abstracted canyon (?) hung on the back wall of the 1772 San Francisco de Asis adobe church in Rancho de Taos.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some information we don’t notice.</p>
<p>Maybe we’re distracted.</p>
<p>Maybe allowing it into our consciousness would bring unwelcome complications.</p>
<p>Sometimes we absentmindedly notice and are so habituated that we respond without thinking.</p>
<p>Other times information barges in like an unwelcome guest. That was the case this past Saturday when at 2am the piercing din of a gas company jackhammer made an appearance outside my bedroom window. The next morning that audio message swapped to an alarming visual, ants swarming the counter after an empty beer can tipped on the way to the recycle bin. A scout must have found the dribble and left a pheromone trail inviting its nest-mates to join the impromptu party. That was a bit of a stigmergy synchronicity. On Stephers’s recommendation I’d ordered James Kennedy’s and Russell Eberhart’s “Swarm Intelligence,” a 2001 textbook. It had come the previous day.</p>
<p>Our minds and biology deftly sort, curate, and weave streams of information into stories that serve as operating instructions for everything from the chemistry of our metabolisms to the ebb and flow of our emotions. Stories frame our views, giving us places to stand as we position our Archimedes’ levers, project our intentions, and strive to leave an impression upon the world. The archetypes we inhabit as we navigate realms material and immaterial are narrative artifacts of accumulated information that glom onto us over the course of a life well-lived. These constructs are held in our hearts and often fiercely defended, unless you’re the anomaly who’s been pulled into a reinvention phase. Most of us seek stability, harmony, and coherence not disruption. Wrenches in the gears are not the norm.</p>
<p>Programmers of artificial intelligence know this and have developed mathematical models that replicate this homeostatic imperative to train neural networks to become more “human.” The concept is called <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.35.3525&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">explanatory coherence</a> and addresses under what circumstances and how people recalibrate fundamentally held beliefs. Our natural tendency is to seek out and uplift information that bolsters and enhances the part of the story arc we occupy. We need a solid place to put our levers after all, before we can get to work; the work we’re meant to do; the work that gives our lives meaning and fills out its contours.</p>
<p>Those fortunate to have a measure of shelter from the storms of social unrest are not inclined to start hacking away at the foundation of their belief system. That’s simple logic. Information that doesn’t conform to familiar patterns is scuttled around back where the threat of cognitive dissonance can be confined to the distant chambers of our collective mental dust bin – out of sight, out of mind. The social engineers make use of that, not just to train lurching mechanical brains, but to orchestrate digital media campaigns fed by real time data flows that influence population-level behavior as if we’d been foisted into a global socially engineered, augmented reality crisis simulation.</p>
<p>Page 254 of “Swarm Intelligence” describes the use of cultural algorithms in adaptive problem-solving environments where the goal is a “fitter population” and belief systems that constrain individual behaviors to fit desired norms.</p>
<p>“In cultural algorithms, individuals interact with one another in population space and are influenced by group-level generalized beliefs in the belief space. In each step of the algorithm, individuals are evaluated using a performance function, and their fitness is determined. An acceptance function determines if the individual should influence the population’s direction, that is, whether the individual will contribute to the belief space. If an individual is accepted, its state is adjusted with those of other individuals to form group beliefs, as information in the belief space is used to guide evolution to the next step.”</p>
<p>And that, my friends, is in a nutshell why I decided to leave Twitter.</p>
<p>If the “fitness” goal is to generate a hivemind human+ open-air digital prison/zoo, people like me will never earn the right to influence “the group” within DARPA’s algorithmically governed “belief space.” Maybe, like in Ira Levin’s “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Perfect_Day">This Perfect Day</a>” there will be a geofenced “Second Life” island for avatars of dissidents where we inhabit the illusion that our fate has not been set by Unicomp, the master computer.</p>
<p>After a close inspection of Theosophist Fritz Kunz’s correspondence with Harvard applied sociologist Piritim Sorokin I see a desire dating back at least to 1949 to create a hyperspace simulation, an Open Source Intelligence playground of social physics, where through ubiquitous tracking and disciplined analysis global technicians aspire to generate a master dataset to quantify core human values. Once they have it in hand, my guess is that they believe they can reverse-engineer sentience, and bestow it, Dr. Frankenstein-like, on humanoid robot contraptions like Sophia, or heaven help us, those Xenobot crumbles. It is truly a misguided attempt to unlock the immense power of Eros in the universe. Although I haven’t firmed up my understanding of programmed morality and biological field theory you can hear my musings in an interview Jason and I did yesterday <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kL0-4m2kAU">here</a>, slide deck <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SI5qUxXQNs3_7UoGSpueS3xgBaKBZq0Q1XL21UKMUaE/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
<p>I’m not sure why, but at this stage of my life my operating system has ended up pretty non-conformist. I am grateful to have found a handful of friends and collaborators who seem to be working in the same zone. We are pattern seekers in search of stories that are emerging just beyond the boundary of our sensory knowing. We sift through piles of information for double-meanings and encoding. Semiotics is our bag. The thrill of the chase as we pull the threads, peel back layers, and bring the past and future into clearer focus.</p>
<p>Since leaving my position at the garden last fall, I have become pretty much a full-time pattern seeker in an age of permanent exception. The result of my wide-ranging curiosity and tendency to chafe at anything with a whiff of groupthink has led me to the edge of the game board. I have empathy for that lone ant who made it past the kitchen sink and now wanders, aimlessly, in circles by the toaster.</p>
<p>There is a story out there that needs to be told. It is vast and hasn’t coalesced into a vision that can be readily communicated, especially to those who don’t desire to be unsettled. Instead of dust-binning new information straightway, our little cadre scrutinizes it. The bits that that seem to be a part of this unfolding drama, we set aside, piles of roughly sorted jigsaw puzzle pieces of various hues. Information waiting to become meaningful once the proper context is found.</p>
<p>I work the edge pieces first, as is my habit – to get the structure laid out. Somedays I fiddle with pieces in a particular pile, and then there are weeks when the jigsaw table of assorted facts sits gathering dust, because life happens. It was that way with my Berggruen series, which is still in the holding pattern. Soon, more to come in a few weeks. I promise. We use bookmarks to organize our informational puzzle tables, emails, and slide shares. I like relationship maps, which are like memory palaces of stories I hope to tell one day – a constellation of loosely connected imaginings that inform my evolving pattern-seeker identity. I am excited Jason has put in the effort to create a new discussion space with a dedicated server, so that we will no longer be held hostage the cultural algorithms. If you want to look over our shoulders to see what we’re up to, visit our Discourse page <a href="https://discourse.wrenchinthegears.org/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Communication can be both effortless and supremely challenging. When it functions correctly, we don’t give it a second thought, but hyperspace presents stumbling blocks. The upheaval of the recent past has catalyzed connections across a widely dispersed geography linking people who appear to share common cause. But as months pass, then years, strains of information warfare take a toll. The blockchain crowd peddles tokenized trust, pretending these mechanisms are for human-to-human exchanges, though the unspoken reality is most of the transacting moving forward will be between machines with humans largely out of the loop. Authentic, relational trust is hard to earn with people you’ve never met in a weaponized space designed to make us question our most basic understandings of reality. And that presumes we’re still sharing a single “reality” rather than infinite fractals playing out in segmented simulations.</p>
<p>One of the speakers at the Mormon Transhumanist Association conference in March was Ally Isom, a <a href="https://allyforutah.com/">candidate for US Senate</a> from Utah with deep political connections in the state and LDS affiliations. The theme of her speech was that we are “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHM6vtS6ptQ">wired to connect</a>,” which is somewhat ironic since her current position is with a nano-technology firm. The sentiment is accurate, though I suspect we’d disagree on appropriate methods of implementation.</p>
<p>She’s right that connection is vital. We are social animals, and collective intelligence when it is consensual and non-coercive can be profoundly satisfying. I hate having to try and find a new way to communicate across distance that is meaningful and productive. There are so many pitfalls online: cancel culture, ghosting, interference, algorithmic suppression, selective curation. It’s as though nothing can be taken at face value. Yes, I’ve blocked people. None of us are immune to the toxic aspect of these tools. The thing is that none of this is normal, and we are expected to embrace it without question. Deposit your trust token here.</p>
<p>A friend introduced me to the Enderverse series by Orson Scott Card. Card is the great-great grandson Brigham Young, and the world he built seems to have a lot of messages for our times – Children of the Mind and Xenocide in particular. The world he wrote into being is made up of Philotes. Philotes is a minor Greek goddess of friendship (and sex) whose siblings are Nemesis (indignation) and Apate (deceit). Combined they are driving forces, with Nekeia (quarrels), behind creation and human behavior.</p>
<p>In the Enderverse, through quantum entanglement, philotes twine with one another to create ever more complicated networks that eventually attain sentience, the ability to maintain pattern complexity. Beings that attain such a state are said to have an Aiua, the physical site of the soul. At that stage, rays that connect philotes to the core of their planet exchange their individual connections for a collective tether. Through deepened relationality the beings in Card’s books become twined with one another. Connections strengthen or fade over time. Given my recent readings Card’s fictional premise surprisingly seems aligned with Kunz’s view of crystallography, magnetism, and rays.</p>
<p>I’ve spent the past 4-6 weeks diving into radioecology. If you want to poke around my big map, you can find it <a href="https://embed.kumu.io/96aa8111172b729ccbc91fa80e994d6d#untitled-map?s=bm9kZS1oSTRiNTR6dQ%3D%3D">here</a>. I’d written a few pieces over the years about the financialization of nature through Internet of Things sensor enabled ESG portfolio investments, but I hadn’t dug deeply into the history of the ecology movement in the United States. Having been tipped off by my friends Leo and Jen about the involvement of the Atomic Energy Commission, I thought it was time. We were headed to Taos, New Mexico for a week with a stop at <a href="https://wallaceterrycjr.com/tag/valles-caldera/">Valles Caldera National Preserve</a> outside Los Alamos planned. Angela Creager’s “Life Atomic: A History of Radioisotopes in Science and Medicine,” was my not-so-light travel reading along with Oliver Reiser’s “Cosmic Humanism,” which is no picnic either.</p>
<p>By the time we passed through the Los Alamos checkpoint and began winding up Cerro Grande and Cerro Medio, the sides of a massive volcano, I’d read enough to be acquainted with Creager’s premise that Atoms for Peace provided a counterpoint of manufactured benevolence to offset the vigor of the Cold War arms race. Through refinement of nuclear waste products and strategic creation of markets around them by the Atomic Energy Commission, scientists were convinced to embark on novel investigations of metabolic processes using newly available radioactive materials. &nbsp;Pre-war capabilities had been limited to researchers within the sphere of Ernest Lawrence’s Berkeley Lab cyclotron isotope “gift economy.”</p>
<p>Oak Ridge National Lab enabled isotope production at an industrial scale. Radioactive molecules were the first generation of tracers, unlocking secrets of life not previously understood. The war on cancer was leveraged to remake modern medicine as a biophysics enterprise landing us at CRISPR, precision medicine, and genomic “longevity enhancements.” The 1950s ushered in an era where the molecule became the dominate frame, though the advent of this age had been long anticipated.</p>
<p>J.D. Bernal’s 1929 book “The World, The Flesh, and the Devil: An Enquiry into the Future of the Three Enemies of the Rational Soul,” an influence on Aldous Huxley’s “Brave New World” published three years later, posited a future where man not only conquered the molecule and used it to fabricate more efficient forms of food and clothing, but pursued a eugenics agenda where human life in its present form was merely a larval stage. It preceded a scientifically mediated metamorphosis where useless parts of the body were replaced with mechanical components. A brain encased in a cylinder would operate multiple specialized appendages modeled on a crustacean. Ears would become wireless transmission receivers, taste an enhanced chemical identification apparatus, and rather than moving we would travel and engage with objects at a distance using tele-acoustic, tele-motor organs.</p>
<p>On page 33, Bernal states the following:</p>
<p>“The new man must appear to those who have not contemplated him before as a strange, monstrous and inhuman creature, but he is only the logical outcome of the type of humanity that exists at present. It may be argued that this tampering with bodily mechanisms is as unnecessary as it is difficult, that all the increase of control needed may be obtained by extremely responsive mechanisms outside the unaltered human body. But though it is possible that in the early stages a surgically transformed man would be at a disadvantage in capacity of performance to a normal, healthy man, he would still be better off than a dead man. Although it is possible that man has far to go before his inherent physiological and psychological make-up becomes the limiting factor to his development, this must happen sooner or later, and it is then that the mechanized man will begin to show definite advantage. Normal man is an evolutionary dead end: mechanical man, apparently a break in organic evolution, is actually more in the true tradition of a further evolution.”</p>
<p>Bernal lived from 1901 to 1971. He was an esteemed molecular biologist who held the first lectureship in structural crystallography at Cambridge later working on sterol compounds, B1, pepsin, D2, and tobacco mosaic virus at University College London’s Birkbeck Bio-molecular Research Center. Bernal was interested in the origins of life from protein structure to meteorites and water. During World War II he, along with Solly Zuckerman, were scientific advisors to Lord Mountbatten and provided input into preparations for D-Day. He was a well-regarded writer of popular science books and a pioneer in x-ray crystallography.</p>
<p>So, as absurd as his assertions may seem at first blush, my gut tells me we should take them to heart. The Manhattan Project didn’t end, in my opinion, it simply morphed into the Human Genome Project. We would do well to keep this in mind in the event that their planned tele-presence mechano-crustacean existence campaign is not as far out on the horizon as we’d like. Biophysics is the most basic form of communication. It is communication that exists at the core of our being. What is being planned is a hijacking of our naturally networked existence into an engineered parody under military control. I fear that the horror unleashed by Fat Man and Little Boy may one day be outstripped by the capacities of bioengineers.</p>
<p>The one interactive part of the Los Alamos Historic District Museum was a small room in the back running video of the atomic explosions. There were small clip boards with sheets that posed a leading question about the importance of governments keeping secrets from the people. That history of secrecy, I believe, extends to bio-nano technology. Even if not overtly hidden, neither the media, nor academia, nor civil society NGOs have the stomach to break the news to the public about the transformations underway – terraforming carbon-based life for nano-machine biocompatibility. The United States government should never have made those bombs, nor should they have dropped them on Japan. They should not have irradiated thousands of people and millions of acres with radioactive fallout. They should not have enriched defense contractors for decades posturing around mutually assured destruction even as behind the scenes top nuclear scientists at Pugwash were setting up the post-Cold War global integration program built on radio-eugenics. I said as much on my submission to the survey way. I also told folks to look up the Moonshot Project Goal One and Ian Akyildiz at Georgia Tech.</p>
<p>We drove for a half hour along the flanks of mountains recovering from devastating fires – 43,000 acres burned in 2000 and 156,000 acres in 2011. As you approach the summit, the edge of the caldera, a glorious meadow of wildflowers and sedge wetlands is visible below – an unusual site for a state where sagebrush is the norm. The crater, which last blew debris over the entire state 1.2 million years ago, measures fourteen miles across. From satellite imagery you can see its clearly defined shape with lava domes now covered with spruce, fir, and aspen – or the remnants of them. The area, which abuts the Santa Clara Pueblo in the northeast, was designated a national preserve in 2000. There are relatively few visitors and supposedly lots of elk, though we didn’t see any that day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The plan was to spend the morning exploring the caldera and then balance out nature’s magnificence with a visit to Bathtub Row where Oppenheimer oversaw the research that would push humanity to a dark and treacherous place.</p>
<p>I felt the natural abundance of the preserve, built atop energetic forces far more powerful that the MED’s atomic bombs, would be a powerful antidote to biophysics tyranny. I gathered some sticks, yarrow, sage, St. John’s Wort, a mushroom, pinecone, charcoal from a lightning struck pine, and dandelions, of course. There were SO MANY dandelions there that day. I didn’t see them anywhere else in New Mexico, but in the caldera their bright yellow faces greeted me like old friends.</p>
<p>I arranged the offerings in a heart at the feet of statues of Oppenheimer and General Groves located in front of the main building of the Ranch School where the scientific elite drank cocktails and danced after putting in grueling hours trying to figure out how to efficiently destroy the world. That was my communication – information and intention put out into the universe to add a tiny bit to a much-needed rebalancing, a refutation of plans for the full-spectrum domination embodied by Los Alamos from nuclear weapons to DNA sequencing and supercomputing. Entangling and untangling and witnessing and saying I do not consent.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Even the grouchy masked staffer at the Caldera visitor center and the plague warnings posted in the latrines could not dampen the wonder of experiencing the Jara Trail where the composition of the wildflowers changed every fifty feet or so. I so wish I’d had a field guide with me, the intensity of life packed into that mile and a half was astonishing. There was a crazy amount of communication happening from shouts of alarm from the prairie dog town to rainwater cupped in a lichen-covered boulder, dew-covered spiderwebs in the grass, gleaming elk droppings, the deep green shade of conifers, a kestrel diving, and the animated conversation of a raven high above our picnic table. &nbsp;One of the most powerful things I saw was a lone pine tree on the edge of a brook that had been incinerated by a lightning strike. While half of it lay in charred ruin a few boughs held onto green needles. It stood as a reminder that it’s not over until it’s over.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>They are attempting to march us into a mechanical world that seeks to sideline Mother Nature. In this world meadows like the one surrounding the Jara Trail would be reduced to lines of code logged in a taxonomy-portal and added to an ongoing tally of life tracked by drones and local sensor networks so that some private interest group can take credit for saving the world, even as they strangle it with technology. These technicians cannot see these communities as relatives or teachers. Robin Wall Kimmerer’s assertion that humans are the youngest siblings and need to have humility and know their place and learn from the elder beings – the stones, plants, and animals – would never cross their mind. Complex ecosystems rich in living interactions are simply digital assets waiting to be turned to profit from the next creative finance scheme.</p>
<p>Let us step away from decentralized networks and reacquaint ourselves with the natural connections that are our birthright as sons and daughters of life. Whether it’s the philotic twining and aiuas of the Enderverse or something else, we exist in a universe of intimate connection whether we can experience them with our limited sensory equipment or not. They are there. The creative force of the universe has not abandoned us. If we are still and listen, we can find our way back.</p>
<p>It is also vital that we figure out how to explain to the climate justice crowd what is happening. We need them to understand the history of atomic ecology, gamification of cellular processes, and that pervasive surveillance where giraffes must wear heart monitors to pay for drone services isn’t care or altruism. All of this is a horror dressed up in do-gooder bedtime stories for naive progressives who don’t have the backbone to face up to what BlackRock, Google, Chainlink, and Blockscience have planned.</p>
<p>Yes, they have the cultural algorithms and targeted nudges, but we have love in our corner – agape, eros, philia, ludus, pragma, and philautia.</p>
<p>Can we find a way to tell the better story, a story where hope lives among the charred embers? Shkitagen – the tinder fungus carrying the sparks onward.</p>
<p>That day I walked a trail of a hill burned by wildfire a decade ago and noticed there were no woody plants growing back, only grasses, which came as a surprise. On the way out I handed the pass to a lovely volunteer and asked her about it – why no shrubs or baby trees? She told me the basin had too many cool nights for the seeds to germinate and that those trees would never come back. Plus, the soil was compacted from eons when the crater was a lake.</p>
<p>Whatever comes next will be different. The only constant is change.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, what comes later? That’s what the sign said at the beginning of the post. I used to be the kind of person who always had a plan, who knew in general terms what came next, what success looked like. I don’t have that anymore, and I’ve made an uneasy peace with it. What comes later is what the universe offers you if you have the awareness to greet it when it arrives. Sometimes that means bumps in the road. I Ching 39 – There is water on top of the mountain, limping. The noble one reverses his being to cultivate virtue. I’m pulling back and will spend the coming week exploring the Shenandoah – optics, eugenics, land speculation and perhaps even some water on the mountain.</p>
<p>Communication matters.</p>
<p>Story matters.</p>
<p>Relationships matter.</p>
<p>Attention matters.</p>
<p>It’s tough pursuing all of these in an era of intentional digital disconnect.</p>
<p>But we cannot give up.</p>
<p>Try, fail, apologize, try again, but do things differently the next time.</p>
<p>Go forward from a place of love, because the robots are never going to have that part. They just won’t.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Meanwhile, so I don’t forget this trip to Taos I am recording a list of communications that engaged me that week.

<p>A scene playing on the TV as I read my “Life Atomic” book from Stranger Things, where Nancy has a tape of the Department of Energy director admitting that bad people killed Barb, but the Chicago private investigator tells her having proof doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters is if people of influence, people on the TV, will believe it. For that you have to water it down. If you don’t, there is no way for them to accept it. The truth is too much – even if you have the smoking gun.</p>

<p>Plus, many frustrating communications regarding a Hertz rental car with a blown-out tire and changed flight arrangements after US Airways couldn’t fix a faulty engine at the Santa Fe Airport.</p>

<p>This is the twentieth post in an <a href="https://brave.com/privacy-updates/">ongoing, regular series</a> describing new and upcoming privacy features in Brave. This post describes work done by iOS Privacy Engineer Jacob Sikorski. This post was written by Senior Director of Privacy Peter Snyder.</p>
<p>Recent versions of Brave on iOS include many new privacy features, ensuring that Brave iOS users have the strongest available protections of any iOS browser. Apple-imposed restrictions make it difficult for us to include some of the advanced privacy protections from our Desktop and Android browsers in our iOS browser. However, our new iOS browser works around these limitations, and brings the privacy features on Brave iOS closer into alignment with our other platforms.</p>

 Debouncing and de-AMP-ing to avoid tracking sites 
<p>Since the recent Brave iOS 1.39 release, Brave protects users from a form of tracking where the tracker records what sites you visit by getting between you and the content you want to see. Brave for iOS now includes the <a href="https://brave.com/privacy-updates/11-debouncing/">debouncing</a> and <a href="https://brave.com/privacy-updates/18-de-amp/">de-AMP-ing</a> protections already available on other platforms of the Brave browser.</p>
<p>Google’s AMP system allows Google to learn about your interests by serving content on behalf of the site you intended to view, rather than showing you the site itself. Bounce tracking similarly allows trackers to learn about your interests by getting in the middle of the site you’re coming from and the site you intend to visit. Brave iOS users now have protections against both kinds of tracking.</p>

 Enhanced content blocking for tracker protection 
<p>Brave iOS versions 1.41 and later include additional, advanced tracker blocking capabilities. Brave iOS has always included optimized versions of popular filter lists, applied through <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/creating_a_content_blocker">Apple’s Content Blocking system</a>.</p>
<p>Though useful, Apple’s Content Blocking system has significant limitations, including restrictions on the number and kinds of tracker-blocking rules that can be applied. These restrictions are very similar to the kinds of alarming restrictions Google is pushing through its <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/googles-manifest-v3-still-hurts-privacy-security-innovation">Manifest v3 system</a>. As a result, Brave iOS users have not been able to enjoy the full range of <a href="https://github.com/brave/adblock-rust">advanced blocking and content filtering protections</a> available on our Desktop and Android releases.</p>
<p>Starting in version 1.41, Brave iOS <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-ios/pull/5444">includes workarounds for some of the limitations Apple imposes on iOS browsers</a>. These workarounds mean Brave iOS users can enjoy a greater number of the dynamic blocking capabilities already available on Desktop and Android. Future Brave iOS versions will further close the gap between platforms.</p>

 Randomization to protect against browser fingerprinting 
<p>Brave iOS versions 1.38 and later include even stronger protections against browser fingerprinting. Brave iOS previously protected users against browser fingerprinting by disabling vulnerable APIs in third-party frames. This approach was useful, but neither ideal (since it only provided moderate protections in first-party contexts) nor compatible (since it broke some desirable third-party uses of these APIs).</p>
<p>While Brave iOS users were partially protected against fingerprinting because of protections built into WKWebView (the browser engine Apple forces all iOS browsers to use), Apple’s restrictions made it difficult to provide the more robust and compatible protections available in Brave on Desktop and Android.</p>
<p>Starting in version 1.38, Brave iOS included the kinds of <a href="https://brave.com/privacy-updates/4-fingerprinting-defenses-2.0/">fingerprint randomization defenses Brave includes on our other platforms</a>. These protections not only provide <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-ios/pull/5156">even stronger defenses again fingerprinting</a>, but they do so in a more comprehensive (they’re enabled by default in first-and-third-party contexts) and compatible (they maintain benign uses while preventing fingerprinting) manner than was available in earlier iOS versions.</p>

 Why are privacy protections on iOS tricky? 
<p>Brave iOS provides the strongest privacy protections available on iOS browsers. However, Apple’s restrictions prevent us from providing iOS users with the full range of advanced, best-in-class privacy protections Brave includes in its Android and Desktop versions.</p>
<p>On the upside, Apple’s platform restrictions limit the kinds of harm tracking companies can inflict; the worst iOS app is still more private than the worst Android or Desktop app. However, this cuts the other way, too: Apple’s restrictions limit the kinds of extra protections privacy-respecting and protecting companies (like Brave) can provide. Basically, Apple limits both the bad that privacy-harming companies can do, but also limits the good that responsible companies can provide.</p>
<p>We hope that Apple will loosen these restrictions, and provide advanced capabilities to companies like Brave that are dedicated to protecting user privacy.</p>

  <p>A Decentralized Identifier (DID) is preferred over traditional identification methods for its promise of privacy and security by virtue of it living on a public blockchain. This seems theoretically true, for now.</p>
<p>Attacks on public blockchain on which these DIDs are hosted have brought us back to the point of lack of privacy. In other words, we still face the privacy challenges that pushed us to use the DID methods in the first place.</p>
<p>I enjoyed reading this summary as it progressed from the cause, impact, and to the solutions to the challenge. However, I came across a <a href="https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/t/research-summary-summarizing-and-analyzing-the-privacy-preserving-techniques-in-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies/1539">research summary</a> on this forum by <a href="https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/u/tolulope">@Tolulope</a>  which offers interesting solutions like off-chain transactions, Coinjoin, etc., to the studied challenges.</p>
<p>Applying these solutions would go a long way to mitigating the challenges of did:btcr as a decentralized identifier.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/u/simin">@simin</a> Do know if there are DID methods present on other blockchains such as Ethereum? Since this research is focused on the impact of privacy attacks on a DID method on the Bitcoin Blockchain, it would be great to extend the research to other blockchains to have a holistic understanding of the impact of privacy attacks on the whole DLT.</p>
<p>If DID methods similar to did:btcr exist on other blockchains, they could be studied to:</p>
 
 
<p>compare with the results obtained from the Bitcoin Blockchain</p>
 
 
<p>make conclusions on the best solutions to apply in solving these privacy issues, since different blockchains have different consensus mechanisms and algorithms.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Coinbase believes crypto will be part of the solution for creating an open financial system that is both more efficient and more equitable. We co-founded the Centre Consortium in 2018 to invest in the build of USDC, and since then it has become the second largest stablecoin by market capitalization. We firmly believe that USDC will be a key component of a new financial paradigm, as it helps to bridge the gap between the worlds of crypto and&nbsp;fiat.</p><p>Stablecoins provide a bridge between the traditional financial system and the cryptoeconomy, allowing fiat currencies to exist in a form that can move more freely and more efficiently on blockchains. Unlike conventional payment methods, stablecoin payments require no centralized intermediary. We believe that stablecoins — USDC, most importantly — will be the foundation of a new era of innovation in financial services.</p><p>Why USDC?</p><p>Back in 2018, we co-founded the Centre Consortium to create the most trusted and reputable digital dollar. Stablecoins have many uses, from trading in digital asset markets to making payments. We launched USDC as a way to simplify these processes so that anyone can participate, continuing to drive towards our goal of economic freedom. Since then, we’ve built a suite of supporting products and systems to&nbsp;enable:</p><p>The value of many cryptocurrencies can fluctuate by the minute, so holding an asset like USDC gives buyers and sellers the stability and confidence they need in times of volatility. The stability of USDC comes from the fact that it is backed by one US dollar or asset with equivalent fair value held in accounts with US regulated financial institutions ¹— the defining feature of a fiat-backed stablecoin (as opposed to a crypto-backed or algorithmic stablecoin). These accounts are <a href="https://www.centre.io/usdc-transparency">attested to</a> and verified publicly by an independent accounting firm. The market capitalization of USDC increased from $28 billion to $54 billion between August 2021 and August 2022² which speaks to the confidence in USDC as a high quality liquid&nbsp;asset.</p><p>As an active member of the Centre Consortium, Coinbase is continuously developing our USDC product suite to grow the USDC ecosystem for our Retail, Institutional, and Developer customers.</p><p>The strength of USDC’s peg to the U.S. dollar, backed by high-quality reserves and with transparent disclosures, makes it a practical option for users who want to remain active in the crypto market during a downturn. We’ve already seen significant adoption of USDC for paired trading with other digital currencies on centralized exchanges, as well as usage in many DeFi protocols, where USDC’s reliability makes it an attractive collateral asset. The top four stablecoins, including USDC, account for almost 80% of centralized exchange trading volume.³ When we look to the future, there is even more untapped potential for stablecoins like USDC within mainstream commercial use&nbsp;cases:</p>  Increased financial inclusion — Globally, 1.7 billion people do not have access to a bank account.⁴ In the United States, 5% of adults are unbanked and 13% are underbanked.⁵ USDC and other stablecoins have the potential to broaden access to financial services through reduced costs and increased efficiency. All that is required to participate in the crypto economy is internet access via smartphone or computer.  Faster and cheaper global money transfer — Transfers for stablecoins like USDC can be settled in under 30 minutes or less, whereas international transfers can take multiple business days. Cross-borders transfers can also be prohibitively expensive using conventional methods. Coinbase supports cross-border transfers of digital assets on our platform, including USDC (and other stablecoins). These cross-border transfers can be made at far lower cost than the global average cost of cash transfers, which is closer to&nbsp;7%.⁶  On-ramp to web3 — We believe USDC and other stablecoins will play an important role as the fiat onramp into the new web3 digital ecosystem, which will give users more control over their information, data, and digital footprint. DeFi protocols are emerging as part of this decentralization and have the potential to improve economic efficiency in areas like trading, insurance, automatic payments, saving, lending, and borrowing.  Payments to merchants — Stablecoin payments, including those for USDC, can be conducted on a public blockchain that enables peer-to-peer transfers and users can settle transactions near-instantaneously without an intermediary bank or financial institution to facilitate. The flexibility and low cost of USDC payment methods can benefit consumers and businesses by increasing the competitive pressure on incumbent systems.  <p>USDC for Retail Customers</p><p>Customers can feel confident in the value of their digital assets and have the opportunity to earn rewards on their USDC held at Coinbase. Fast processing and low transaction fees make USDC an ideal option for sending money anywhere in the world. USDC is being adopted across multiple chains, fostering more growth for application development. It is quickly becoming the standard stablecoin not just on Ethereum where it originally launched, but across the blockchain ecosystem from Layer 1 networks to side chains to Layer 2 networks. When users purchase USDC on Coinbase, there is no fee and they can earn rewards on their holdings.</p><p>USDC for Institutions</p><p>Digital stablecoins like USDC have rapidly become foundational assets for trading firms and market makers. Stablecoins allow market participants to price assets in a common currency, settle almost instantaneously, and retain assets on-chain with less exposure to volatility. Coinbase Institutional enables firms to utilize USDC to participate in global crypto asset markets. We provide multi-chain support on Coinbase Exchange, no fees for USDC custody on Coinbase Prime, easy acquisition, and one-to-one conversion between USD and USDC on both platforms.</p><p>USDC for Developers</p><p>USDC has quickly become the most popular stablecoin in the web3 ecosystem with approximately 30% of the total supply spread between DeFi platforms and Decentralized Exchanges. Coinbase enables developers to utilize USDC for their dapps, services and protocols with multi-chain support, no fees for custody, and a frictionless acquisition path. We’re actively building out our developer tooling and see USDC as a key offering for dapps looking to secure stable revenue, which is why we’ve enabled acceptance of USDC via Coinbase Commerce and conversion of USD to USDC via Coinbase&nbsp;Pay.</p><p>We firmly believe that USDC and stablecoins built with the same framework can be the foundation for innovation in a new era of financial services.

<p>On 29 July 2022, Circle responded to a consultation issued by the UK’s HM Treasury regarding the Government’s proposed application of the Financial Market Infrastructure Special Administration Regime (FMI SAR) to systemic digital settlement asset (including stablecoin) firms. In its response, Circle reiterated its continued commitment to responsible digital asset regulation, and encouraged HM Treasury to establish a bespoke regulatory and oversight framework for systemic digital settlement asset firms, and for fully-reserved digital currency issuers to be subject to sound prudential regulation. Circle affirmed the need for greater clarity in determining a “systemic” designation for digital settlement asset firms, and questioned whether the FMI SAR was the appropriate regime for these firms given the existence of payments and e-money special administration regimes in the UK. Circle encouraged HM Treasury to thoroughly evaluate the differences between blockchain-based payment systems and traditional inter-bank payment systems prior to establishing a regulatory regime for digital settlement asset firms which may be ill-fitting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Tune in as we explore Polynya’s fascinating mind, covering their broad crypto thesis, EIP-4844, and the future of Ethereum Scalability.</p> <p>------ 📣 Forta | Help Make Web3 a Safer Place <a href="https://bankless.cc/Forta">https://bankless.cc/Forta</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; 🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://podcast.banklesshq.com/">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>------ BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:&nbsp;</p> <p>🌱 LENS | ACCESS CODE: MINTME <a href="https://bankless.cc/Lens">https://bankless.cc/Lens</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🚀 ROCKET POOL | ETH STAKING <a href="https://bankless.cc/RocketPool">https://bankless.cc/RocketPool</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM <a href="https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🦁 BRAVE | THE BROWSER NATIVE WALLET <a href="https://bankless.cc/Brave">https://bankless.cc/Brave</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🌉 JUNO | BRIDGE FIAT TO LAYER 2 <a href="https://bankless.cc/Juno">https://bankless.cc/Juno</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>⚡️ ZKSYNC | THE LAYER 2 SCALING ENDGAME <a href="https://bankless.cc/zkSync">https://bankless.cc/zkSync</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro 9:00 Polynya the Anon 13:45 Polynya IRL 20:05 Cautious Optimism 25:35 Polynya’s Crypto Thesis 29:58 Accruing Value at the L1 31:54 Bitcoin vs Ethereum 33:30 Alt-L1s and Decentralization 35:10 Everything is Finance 38:10 Layer 2 Value Capture 41:33 Rollups vs ETH 45:30 Increasing L2 Demand 47:40 Layer 2 Tokens 52:45 A Symbiotic Relationship 56:08 Cosmos and Alt-L1s 58:45 App-Specific Chains 1:00:30 All Just Chains and Bridges 1:02:14 Why Cardano Rocks and Sucks 1:04:23 Cults and Tribalism 1:05:20 Changing Crypto 1:06:54 Changing the World 1:07:35 Polynya’s Message 1:08:30 Thank You Polynya</p> <p>------ Resources:</p> <p>Polynya on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/apolynya?s=20&amp;t=4Cws8vmOo7v2mRmI8mGyfw">https://twitter.com/apolynya?s=20&amp;t=4Cws8vmOo7v2mRmI8mGyfw</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Polynya’s Writing: <a href="https://polynya.medium.com/">https://polynya.medium.com/</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Modular Blockchains: <a href="https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/ultra-scalable-ethereum">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/ultra-scalable-ethereum</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Eureka John: <a href="https://twitter.com/EurekaJohn1?s=20&amp;t=ws5GNZKUSZtegsJQkvcuAg"> https://twitter.com/EurekaJohn1?s=20&amp;t=ws5GNZKUSZtegsJQkvcuAg</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>----- Not financial or tax advice.

 <p></p><p>At TBD, we believe in a decentralized future that returns ownership and control
over your finances, data, and identity. Decentralized Identity is critical to
our mission. It’s what puts people in control of their own data. It is the most
private, secure, and user-centric way to facilitate information exchange and
verification online.</p><p>The <a href="http://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>
(DIF) is a cooperative community that
shares and advances our vision. We’re honored to work alongside members like
<a href="https://spruceid.com/">Spruce</a>, <a href="https://transmute.industries/">Transmute</a>,
and others on open standards which drive this work forward.
Today we're announcing that we’ve achieved another milestone on that journey.</p><p>TBD and Spruce are the first implementers to demonstrate full interoperability
for the JSON Web Signature Test Suite. These tests are a major step towards
vendor interoperability. Interop is what allows standard technologies to play
nicely with one another, regardless of the backing vendor implementation.</p><p>TBD and Spruce now support all
<a href="https://w3id.org/security/suites/jws-2020#jose-conformance">five JWS algorithms</a>
for <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-jws2020/">JSON Web Signature 2020</a>
(Data Integrity Proofs) using
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519">JSON Web Tokens</a> (JWTs)
for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs)
and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations-0">W3C Verifiable Presentations</a>
(VPs).</p><p>We can only realize the full potential of Decentralized Identity if we
have networks of Issuers and Verifiers that can produce and consume one
another’s data. The real power of Decentralized Identity is the controlled
sharing of information directly between individuals and other entities,
which makes interoperability a necessity.</p><p>More details about the Conformance Test Suite that was developed by members
of DIF and our interoperability test reports can be found here:</p>  <a href="https://identity.foundation/JWS-Test-Suite/#tbd">TBD’s test results of JWS Test Suite</a>  <a href="https://identity.foundation/JWS-Test-Suite/#spruce">Spruce’s test results of JWS Test Suite</a>  <p>At TBD, we support open standards wherever appropriate, and all of our projects are open source. We know our efforts will only be successful if we work in public with the community. We are grateful to work with folks like Spruce and Transmute in the W3C and DIF. By collaborating on common goals in accordance with our ethos, as this achievement exemplifies, we can accelerate the adoption of Decentralized Identity.</p>

         Nolan Bushnell: Original Gamer                <p>By Michael Gold</p><p>Photography: MICHELLE GROSKOPF</p><p>Published August 11, 2022</p>            <p>Fifty years after co-founding Atari, Nolan Bushnell offers a masterclass in selling fun.</p>       



 
 
   
<p>Nolan Bushnell needs no introduction. When he arrives at Two Bit Circus in downtown Los Angeles, I recognize him as soon as he steps out of his car: the grandfatherly goofball with a shock of white beard, tall and casual in a baseball cap and sneakers.</p>



<p>“I’m so sorry about last time,” he says, referring to the first time we tried to meet and his daughter told me he had just tested positive for covid-19. I demur and follow him into the building where we will conduct our interview.</p>



<p>It is a warehouse filled with gaming stations, baroque furniture, art installations and other sensory stimulants. A life-size Hungry Hungry Hippos awaits players—children and child-like grownups alike—next to massive arcade booths kitted out with dozens of colorful buttons and knobs, their screens still dark as Two Bit Circus prepares to open to the public for the afternoon. An inanimate horse’s rear end from a merry-go-round, gaudily painted in red and gold, offers a seat from beneath a bar in the middle of the cavernous space.</p>



<p>Bushnell’s son, Brent, opened Two Bit Circus in 2018, drawing on a penchant for fun that runs in the family. As the founder of Atari, the elder Bushnell popularized one of the most enduring tools of entertainment-based escapism in history: the video game. Long before that, though, an amusement park job he held in college introduced him to the thrill of selling fun. He loved the role—a true duck-in-water experience that saw him “always just massacring quota,” as he describes it.</p>







 <br>Going with the flow state 



<p>Much of the opportunity for the tech-enabled exploration that fed Bushnell’s instincts arose by happenstance. The military, a big presence in the suburban Utah community of Bushnell’s youth, regularly discarded heaps of kit that Bushnell and his friends would purloin. His neighbor ran a surplus store “full of neat shit.” All this opened a world of machines for him, to the extent that by age ten, he was timing the emergence of sunspots in order to open communication lines over his self-built radio to Japan.</p>



<p>“In junior high school science and physics, I often knew more than the teacher did, and I was not always nice about it,” he laughs.</p>



<p>Yet even amid the explosion of technological innovations taking place in the early 1950s, a career as an entrepreneur was hardly a preordained path. The customary route for technologists during Bushnell’s formative years involved working for the government or a large company. But Bushnell felt his first entrepreneurial itch selling strawberries for his mother at age six. At ten, he repaired TVs, figuring out how to acquire replacement parts and mark them up for less than professionals in the yellow pages while still making a big profit by adolescent terms. “I always disdained the thought of selling time for money,” he says.</p>



<p>It helped that Bushnell felt a profound sense of fulfillment from all this tinkering. Without knowing it, he would enter a “flow state”—also known as being “in the zone”—which holds that when a task is “hard, but not overwhelming, achievable, but not frustrating or boring,” in Bushnell’s words, the brain enters a particularly receptive condition.</p>



<p>“Time dilates; you can play for an hour and think it’s 15 minutes,” he says, his gray eyes flashing with excitement as he explains how the flow state has influenced him throughout his life.</p>



<p>The flow state is precisely what happens during intensive gameplay, a fact that Bushnell recognized as the key to creating an empire out of interactive entertainment. What elevates Bushnell’s creations above normal games emerges from something unique to his technologist demographic: the ability to enter that state when constructing hardware, to land on those time-dilating, brain-expanding conditions when cauterizing metal or fiddling with wires. In addition to shockers, as a young man Bushnell also made a ham radio, a speaker phone, a rudimentary neighborhood telephone network and a system of lights on his bedroom ceiling that would illuminate during storms. Later, he would invent the world’s first functional car navigation system a full decade before the advent of GPS.</p>



<p>Quasi-spiritual motivations like the flow state entered Bushnell’s repertoire soon after he moved to Silicon Valley, whose nascent chip industry of the 1960s attracted him. What influenced him yet more, perhaps, was the counterculture taking hold at the time. “I was very influenced by the hippie movement,” Bushnell says. It would lead him to break rules and challenge conventions at Atari in significant ways, compelling him to overcome hurdles that were far bigger than they appear in hindsight: video games, for one, barely existed as an industry. What did pass for an industry was largely stigmatized and consigned to dark corners of dive bars.</p>



<p>“Early on, there was a lot of controversy about video games,” Bushnell says. “Parents didn’t want their kids going anywhere near them; whole countries banned them.”</p>

 Prankster in chief 



<p>This tide started shifting bit by bit as Pong, Atari’s flagship title, permeated deeper into the world’s cultural fabric. Don Valentine, the storied Sequoia founder, paid several visits to Atari’s Sunnyvale factory amid growing hype around the game before ultimately investing in 1975. The company, under Bushnell’s leadership, was a goofy place: Friday evening beer fests, smoking marijuana at headquarters, even one instance in which Bushnell rented a jet and flew the staff to Disneyland.</p>



<p>Bushnell says much of Atari’s early reputation has been mischaracterized, even though it has had real-world consequences for Bushnell himself: in 2018, activists successfully denied him a prominent video game lifetime achievement award he was slated to receive, accusing him of fostering an environment in Atari at the time that was toxic to women. When I ask him if any employees felt alienated by Atari’s culture back then, Bushnell says, “no, not at all.” And many of Atari’s early female employees have <a href="https://kotaku.com/sex-pong-and-pioneers-what-atari-was-really-like-ac-1822930057">spoken fondly</a> of their experience.</p>



<p>Bushnell reiterates the values of fairness, dignity and camaraderie that he enumerated in a “goals” manifesto published in Atari’s second year. It specifically directed employees to “judge all people on the basis of their skill and contributions, and not tolerate discrimination on the basis of race, color, creed, national origin, sex, appearance or personal life”—something that many companies still struggle with to this day.</p>



<p>A big element of this system was a more outcomes-driven process of evaluations than was common in the corporate world at the time, one that depended on maintaining a sense of play and fun at work. “As a manager in a highly structured environment, when you’re not working directly on the assembly line, it can be hard to get undoctored feedback, to see where the problems are,” Bushnell says. “Injecting this element of fun as a social lubricant can help lower inhibitions to honesty. This leads to better results.”</p>



<p>It can also serve as a potent recruitment tool, as Bushnell learned when he hired Apple founder Steve Jobs into his first corporate role at 19. Atari’s early working culture—shenanigans and all—would ultimately plant the seeds for the kind of agile, quick-pivot, collegial atmosphere that pervades Silicon Valley and has since spread to startup hubs around the world. While some have adapted this into a “move fast and break things” mantra, Bushnell clarifies that he drew the line at anything illegal or unethical.</p>



<p>“We had one colleague who wanted to grow cannabis on company property,” he says. “I thought that was a bridge too far.”</p>



<p>Pranks, on the other hand, were par for the course. In perhaps one of the most famous in technology history, Bushnell convinced a colleague to design the prototype version of Pong by telling him—falsely—that he had secured a contract from General Electric.</p>



<p>“[Pulling pranks] was part of my DNA,” Bushnell says. “I feel like all rebels have to have a bit of the prankster within them.”</p>

 Be my Valentine 



<p>Bushnell admits that mastering the business side of running a fast-growing company was a harder slog than inspiring people—or, in some instances, pranking them—to discover amazing ways to manipulate technology. This is where mentors like Don Valentine played a role: Valentine, a former semiconductor executive, filled the hard-nosed, analytical side of Atari in a way that helped power the company both before and after Sequoia’s initial investment.</p>



<p>“Don would always ask me tough questions about the numbers,” Bushnell says. “It became a competitive thing with us—I would cram before board meetings just so Don couldn’t stump me.”</p>



<p>This yin-yang relationship between the two men eventually evolved into a full-fledged friendship (Bushnell even hired Don’s kids to work in his garden). The two stayed close after Bushnell sold Atari to Warner Communications in 1976, and Valentine helped fund Chuck E. Cheese in their post-Atari years. Despite Valentine’s reputation as the more business-focused of the two, he wasn’t above participating in the trappings of startup culture quickly taking shape in Silicon Valley: “After we inked the [funding] deal, he brought an iced-up tub of champagne to the party,” Bushnell gushes.</p>



<p>That funding deal, however, could not have happened without the company passing a major turning point: an agreement by Sears to distribute a home version of Pong in its stores. The arrangement, struck in 1975, came together after a long slog to find a retail partner; both Toys”R”Us and Radio Shack had previously turned them down. Bushnell cites several reasons: the failure of a rival game console, the Magnavox Odyssey, to catch on; jitters over the novelty and uncertainty about a new gaming technology; disagreements over the appropriate price point. Culturally, big-box retailers—Sears included—were a poor fit for Atari’s looser style. In one infamous anecdote, a team of Sears executives walked into Atari’s headquarters wearing starched collars and walked out in t-shirts.</p>



<p>“With Sears, it really came down to one buyer—this guy named Tom Quinn—who believed in us,” Bushnell says. “I really credit him for putting Atari on the map.”</p>



<p>On Atari’s side, manufacturing enough consoles in time to hit the coveted holiday shopping period was a nerve-wracking challenge. Here, Valentine’s influence was indispensable, helping Atari acquire a new factory in order to meet demand. “Don definitely believed in the consumer market to a greater extent than he did the coin-op market,” Bushnell says. Sequoia’s partnership would go on to propel Atari from a niche, if buzzy, game maker into one of the most iconic companies in history.</p>







 <br>How to unplug a toilet 



<p>An ability to recognize and lean on the capabilities of peers like Valentine—and to take their advice when warranted—is a hallmark of Bushnell’s success, one that he readily confesses to. “I’m the kind of person who has a million different ideas, and in my best moments I’ve been lucky to find the right teams to execute them.” He describes his current role in business as an “activator” who, like the pinball machines dotting the floor of Two Bit Circus, retracts the spring of an inventive concept and lets others flip the paddles. Among other business plans filling his office right now are a wine-and-canapés light show experience and an idea to seed the ocean to increase its carbon-absorption capacity as a means of combating climate change. He has a lot to say about cryptocurrency—mostly positive, although his key takeaway is that “there will be many trials and tribulations before all the shit is sorted out.”</p>



<p>Education remains his biggest piece of unfinished business. He has long concerned himself with the welfare of children—they are, after all, the core audience for his most popular products. Bushnell’s long-held belief that there are better ways to learn than the conventional methods offered by the establishment led him to create ExoDexa, a San Francisco-based startup founded in 2020. ExoDexa’s tools turn classroom curriculum into video games, compelling students to engage with the material in ways they could not in a purely lecture-based environment. In his telling, learning your ABCs should not entail full-time toil; instead, children should be allowed—nay, encouraged—to play, tinker and experiment, just as he did as a youngster. Unsurprisingly, play has always been something he fostered in his own children: his eldest daughter Alissa was an early tester of Pong.</p>



<p>“I’ve been able to maintain my sense of wonder and play through my children,” he says when asked whether the ability to enjoy fun fades with age. He hopes that by centering education around play, he can help disenfranchised youth become “stealth scholars”: kids that feel motivated to improve by competing against themselves rather than seeking better grades than their peers.</p>



<p>Bushnell views this mission as more than another money-making opportunity. “What I would really like to accomplish in life is fixing education,” he says, slipping in a plug for his forthcoming book on the subject, The School of the Future, which will explain how technology and gaming can cement the Socratic method in classrooms. “What if I could teach 100% of a high school curriculum in six months, with better retention? What would you do with that extra time? You teach entrepreneurship, you teach creativity, you teach life skills. I think everybody should know how to write a business plan, how to balance a checkbook, how to unplug a toilet.”</p>



<p>I leave the rest of the education question for later—for Bushnell’s book, for the deep dive that will emerge in the next chapter of his astounding life. Instead, we spend our last few moments together touring Two Bit Circus’s colorful exhibits. Bushnell takes me to the “bridge” of the Starship Enterprise, where a plastic brain sits suspended under glass, and to an operating theater, where a cartoonish patient looks disconcertingly eager to be sliced and diced. Absorbing his enthusiasm—for education, for play, for gaming, for solving big problems—I start to understand how these seemingly disparate motives fit together. While many entrepreneurs set out to change the world, the path to wisdom, to greatness, to a place in the pantheon, is more often marked by moments of irreverent fun than flashes of great insight. If nothing else, the school of Nolan Bushnell can teach us to enjoy the ride.</p>

    <p>Ethereum has the largest and most diverse public blockchain ecosystem. This makes Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility one of the key ingredients for other blockchains to build a successful ecosystem. The EVM is a runtime environment that allows developers to create applications that can run on any Ethereum-compatible blockchain. This includes Horizen.</p>
 What Exactly is EVM? 
<p>At a high level, virtual machines create a level of abstraction between the executing code and the executing machine. All Ethereum accounts and smart contracts live on <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/">EVM</a>. The protocol exists solely to keep this immutable state machine constantly running.</p>
<p>The EVM defines the rules for computing a valid state from one block to the next. EVM is a massive data structure called a modified Merkle Patricia Trie, which links all accounts with hashes, and is reducible to a root hash.</p>
<p>Programs send code to the EVM to process transactions in Ethereum. These EVM opcodes perform standard stack operations and blockchain-specific stack operations. When smart contracts are compiled, they turn into EVM opcodes.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://academy.horizen.io/technology/advanced/evm-ethereum-virtual-machine/">Horizen Academy</a> to learn more about EVM.</p>
 Leveraging the Ethereum Developer Community&nbsp; 
<p>EVM allows new blockchains to leverage the existing Ethereum developer community. These developers are already familiar with EVM and have built a wealth of applications that can run on it. EVM compatibility enables Horizen to tap into the wealth of existing developers who are used to working with Solidity. It’s estimated that there are <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-most-popular-programming-languages-used-in-blockchain-development-5133a0a207dc/#:~:text=Solidity%20is%20a%20contract%2Doriented,is%20estimated%20at%20over%20200%2C000.">over 200,000 developers</a> with experience in Solidity.</p>
<p>When it comes to blockchain development, it’s important to have as many choices as possible. By supporting EVM, Horizen is opening its platform up to a vast community of developers who can create applications that will drive its success..</p>
 Leveraging Existing DeFi Infrastructure 
<p>Another benefit of EVM compatibility is Ethereum’s defi infrastructure. There are well-established Ethereum smart contracts for an enormous range of blockchain-based products, such as automated market makers, decentralized exchanges, peer-to-peer lending protocols, stablecoins, and more.</p>
<p>By leveraging Ethereum’s defi infrastructure, new blockchains and dapps on Horizen can get up and running quickly and easily. This is important for their success, as it lowers the barriers to entry and allows them to focus on building great applications.</p>
 Building Interconnected Ecosystems 
<p>Ultimately, compatibility with the EVM allows new blockchains to build interconnected ecosystems. This is important as it allows them to tap into the resources of other blockchains and benefit from their success.</p>
<p>It also allows them to create a more diverse and inclusive blockchain community. Horizen is helping to build a more open and inclusive blockchain ecosystem that will benefit all participants through supporting EVM.<br></p>
 About Horizen’s EVM Sidechain 
<p>Horizen’s EVM sidechain is coming to testnet soon! Recently, we accomplished a major milestone of the EVM project. This is much more than just an interim step. This is a functioning sidechain, compatible with Ethereum tools and able to execute all Ethereum-compatible smart contracts.</p>
<p>To learn more about the sidechain, check out our <a href="https://youtu.be/DRIm1f9-t6Y">EVM demo video</a>. In this video, Victor and Alberto share some insights into the latest accomplishments with a demo of our EVM Alpha from Oleksandr showing ZEN on MetaMask and some of the basic functionality of the EVM chain.</p>
<p>You can also watch <a href="https://youtu.be/n3cGfULIwRg">Rob’s presentation from Consensus</a>, where he discusses the future vision of Horizen including EVM and <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/tokenmint-is-live-on-mainnet/">TokenMint</a>.&nbsp;</p>

The contract address is 0x5f834Ba9e4E41871F68ee6B431fABd19f406a9A6 and can be found here <a href="https://bscscan.com/token/0x5f834Ba9e4E41871F68ee6B431fABd19f406a9A6">https://bscscan.com/token/0x5f834Ba9e4E41871F68ee6B431fABd19f406a9A6</a></p><p>The Stealth-BSC swap reserve is protected by 2 of 3 multisignature escrow on the Stealth&nbsp;side.</p><p>Multisignatures ensure that at least two escrow signatories must approve a transaction before BSC-wrapped XST can move back to the native chain. This protection means that compromising one swap key is not enough to threaten the swap&nbsp;reserve.</p><p>— — — — — — —</p> How-To <p>Here’s a step by step guide how to swap XST to wXST and vice versa using MetaMask:</p><p>1. Set up a MetaMask wallet and&nbsp;account.</p><p>2. Connect Meta Mask to Binance Smart Chain, here’s a guide how to do that:<br>https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/connecting-metamask-to-binance-smart-chain.</p><p>3. Set up a XST wallet (if you haven’t already), you can use StealthSend desktop and mobile<br>https://www.stealth.org/applications.</p><p>4. Go to <a href="https://wrapping.services/get/stealth/">https://wrapping.services/get/stealth/</a><br>The service is provided by Wrapping Services <a href="https://wrapping.services/.">https://wrapping.services/.</a></p><p>5. Swap XST to&nbsp;wXST</p><p>– Choose the amount you want to swap, the required minimum is 5 USD worth of XST.<br>– The swap from XST to wXST is free, there is no fee.<br>– In the field “wXST Address BSC (BEP20)”, use your own wXST&nbsp;address.</p><p>Here’s how you find your wXST&nbsp;address:</p><p>• Go to Metamask<br>• Select “Smart Chain” from the drop down on top.<br>• Select “import token” at the bottom and use the contract address 0x5f834Ba9e4E41871F68ee6B431fABd19f406a9A6 for the token address.<br>• Once you have imported the token wXST, select the three dots in the top right corner and go to “Account details”. You will see your personal wXST&nbsp;address.</p><p>• Use this address in the field “wXST Address BSC (BEP20)”; this is where the wrapped XST will be sent&nbsp;to.</p><p>6. In the next step you are asked to send XST to the address (multisig address) shown in the dialogue:</p><p>You have 60 seconds to do so until it expires, requiring you to restart the&nbsp;process.</p><p>If you have sent XST within the timeframe you will see a new dialogue, similar to this&nbsp;one:</p><p>You can then close the dialogue, the swap was successful.</p><p>7. After you have sent your XST, you will receive your wXST to the address specified in step 5 within a few&nbsp;seconds.</p><p>You can then go to Pancake Swap <a href="https://pancakeswap.finance/swap">https://pancakeswap.finance/swap </a>and trade&nbsp;wXST.</p><p>8. Swap wXST back to&nbsp;XST</p><p>The reverse swap from wXST to XST works similarly. The only difference is that you will need some BNB in your wallet to pay the tx&nbsp;fee.</p><p>Go to <a href="https://wrapping.services/get/stealth">https://wrapping.services/get/stealth</a>/ and simply select “wXST to XST” this time and follow the instructions.</p><p>In the field “XST address” simply use an address where you want the XST to be sent to. You will then have to send wXST to the address specified in the next dialogue, similar to step&nbsp;6.</p><p>After you sent your wXST you will receive XST back on the native&nbsp;chain.</p><p>— — — — — — —</p> Caution <p>DO NOT send XST to the contract address itself (0x5f834Ba9e4E41871F68ee6B431fABd19f406a9A6). If you do so, the coins cannot be retrieved. Always make sure your are sending to the correct address, your personal wXST&nbsp;address.</p><p>— — — — — — — — —</p><p>The Stealth&nbsp;team</p><p>— — — — — — — — —</p><p><a href="https://stealth.org/">Website</a> / <a href="http://discord.gg/qGwMQQeRPm">Discord</a> / <a href="https://t.me/stealthsend">Telegram</a> / <a href="https://medium.com/stealthsend">Medium</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/stealthsend">Twitter</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stealthsend">Reddit</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/stealthsend/wxst-xst-wrapped-on-binance-smart-chain-bsc-d5c8a5f08c77">wXST: XST wrapped on Binance Smart Chain (BSC)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/stealthsend">stealthsend</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>New versions of the Nym wallet and all other Nym platform binaries are&nbsp;out.</p><p>You can download the latest version of the wallet and all system binaries from the&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/download/">website</a>.</p><p>Nym softwares are <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym">open source</a>, unpermissioned and can be forked by anyone wishing to extend functionality.</p><p>For an extensive list of new platform changes and releases please check the <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#nym-binaries-102">change&nbsp;log</a>.</p><p>In this post we will go through the new wallet and the explorer features that&nbsp;are:</p>  better overview of the bonded node for node operators  compound and redeem functions for operator&nbsp;rewards  filters on the explorer to make it easier for delegators to select good&nbsp;nodes  <p>Now let’s go through each new&nbsp;feature!</p> 1. Better overview of your bonded&nbsp;node <p>Bonding is the act of registering a node in the Nym system by putting up some NYM tokens as stake on that node. Node operators bond a mix node or a gateway into the Nym mixnet. Bonding can be done using the CLI tool or via the Bonding section of the&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>If you are new to the Nym system and want to run a node follow the instructions on the <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/mixnodes/#">docs</a> or watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRMZY6Ez1bA">video</a> on how to bond your node. To know more about Nym’s different node types read&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/choose-your-character-an-overview-of-nym-network-actors-19e6a9808540">this</a>.</p><p>Once your node is successfully bonded and is running you can see the information about it in the new bonding screen as below. Here is where most of the new features in this version of the wallet are. We will be adding more node stats and settings to this page as we go&nbsp;along.</p> 2. Compound and Redeem your rewards from the&nbsp;wallet <p>Operators can now redeem and compound their node rewards using the action menu shown with 3 dots on the right edge of the bonding table (as shown&nbsp;below).</p><p>This is what each of the actions in the action menu&nbsp;does:</p><p>Redeem: Redeem the rewards you have accrued by running your node and transfer the amount to your account&nbsp;balance.</p><p>Compound: In order to get compounded rewards for your node, you will need to compound your rewards manually using this&nbsp;button.</p><p>Unbond: Unbond to remove your node from the&nbsp;network</p><p>Note that all of the above actions require some tiny amount of NYMs to pay for transaction fees. Make sure you always have some NYMs left in your balance to be able to pay for&nbsp;fees.</p> 2. Filters on the explorer to select nodes to delegate&nbsp;to <p>If you hold NYM tokens, you can delegate your tokens to mix nodes operating the mixnet. This boosts the node’s reputation and increases their chances of being in the active set. In return you will earn a share of the rewards the node receives for providing privacy.</p><p>To find a mix node to delegate to, you can now filter them on the <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/network-components/mixnodes">Nym network explorer</a>, using Advanced Filters on the top right&nbsp;corner.</p><p>Filter the nodes based on different parameters i.e Stake Saturation, Profit Margin, and Routing Score to narrow them down based on your preferred criteria. You can also browse the delegators channel in the <a href="https://discord.gg/7F6g9cWh">Nym Discord</a> to find good nodes for delegating stake&nbsp;to.</p><p>Once you have selected your preferred mix node(s), use the wallet to delegate to them. You can do this under the Delegation section of the wallet by clicking on the “Delegate” button (shown below). Copy the node’s identity key from the explorer and the amount you want to delegate, paste in the delegation window and you are&nbsp;done.</p><p>This sums up the new features of this release. As always if you had any questions or suggestions please reach us on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> or <a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a>.</p><p>Until next time, happy bonding and delegating!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-platform-v1-0-2-and-nym-wallet-v1-0-8-are-out-64d10d33057f">Nym platform v1.0.2 and Nym wallet v1.0.8 are out!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>There are a lot of problems in this world. So many important issues could be solved to improve the lives of countless individuals. So why is it that we dedicate so much of our time on building Wasabi Wallet?</p><p>First of all, why do we even work on Bitcoin? Well, because money is an incredibly important good for a prosperous society to function. When you hold money, every entrepreneur in your economy will happily solve any problem you might have. Saving your capital in money helps you sleep better at night, knowing that tomorrow you can buy everything you might need.</p><p>But, there is good money and there is bad money. If anyone forces you to use a specific money, then generally speaking it’s a bad one. Free people will choose a money that they deem good. Bitcoin is a common choice because it has a predefined and unchanging money supply, so nobody can print himself money and hand it out to friends. Cryptography protects the ownership of coins, which makes theft pretty difficult.</p><p>Bitcoin has sound economic principles and powerful cryptographic protocols with an unrestricted free market for anyone to start getting paid in bitcoin. Economically and technically speaking, bitcoin is unstoppable and will eventually be used by the overwhelming majority of all merchants.</p><p>However, there are other important aspects of good money, which currently Bitcoin is not optimally designed for. Specifically, the fungibility of money; that any coin has the same demand as any other coin. Merchants don’t care which specific coin they get paid in, as long as it is valid. But in bitcoin, a coin has a unique transaction history which is publicly known and verified by every node. This transaction history makes each coin a unique and non-fungible unit.</p><p>In the worst case, this open transaction history is the basis for a dystopian surveillance system. Where every transaction of the same person is clustered together and tied to his identity. Now, everyone is spying on everyone else and the choice of what to reveal about yourself to the world is taken from everyone.</p><p>It might be inevitable that bitcoin succeeds economically. But a future where people are in control of whom to tell about their sensitive financial transactions is still uncertain.</p><p>But not all hope is lost. There are so many tricks and strategies to increase the financial privacy of bitcoin users. The best thing is, most of them don’t even require any changes to the bitcoin consensus rules but can already be used today. Tor, block filter synchronization, coinjoin, coin swaps, lightning network and eCash; there are endless ways of improving the privacy, security and usability of everyday bitcoiners.</p><p>This is the reasoning for why we work on bitcoin privacy and why we focus on innovating at the edges with Wasabi, the privacy-focused bitcoin wallet.<br></p>

<p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/aroundtheblock/home">Around the Block</a> from Coinbase Ventures sheds light on key trends in crypto. Written by <a href="https://twitter.com/Cdempsey44">Connor Dempsey</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/newsalmon">Sam&nbsp;Newman</a></p><p>In the 13 years of its existence, Bitcoin has risen from obscurity to $1 trillion highs, settling over $60 trillion in total transfer volume along the&nbsp;way.</p><p>Despite these feats, Bitcoin’s decentralized design limits it to a mere 7 transactions per second. In times when demand to use the network exceeds 7 transactions, users experience long wait times and fees as high as $60 per transaction at the extreme. Even with fees recently hovering between $1–2, the network remains unsuitable for buying that proverbial cup of&nbsp;coffee.</p><p>Enter the Lightning Network: a layer-2 protocol built on top of Bitcoin that can theoretically scale to millions of instant transactions per second that cost pennies to send. If it gains traction, it can even undercut the fees of giants like Visa and Mastercard, along with the entire global remittance market.</p><p>But will&nbsp;it?</p><p>Lightning 101</p><p>As with most <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/scaling-ethereum-crypto-for-a-billion-users-715ce15afc0b">layer-2 solutions</a>, Lightning seeks to increase transaction throughput and lower costs while retaining sufficient decentralization by moving activity to a second network. Once BTC is on the Lightning network, it can be transacted instantly typically at fractions of a&nbsp;penny.</p><p>Rather than expensively sending each transaction over the Bitcoin blockchain, users deposit BTC into the Lightning Network and then transact inexpensively through payment channels. As with most networks, the more people and companies that join, the more useful it&nbsp;becomes.</p><p>Obviously at &lt;1 cent fees, Lightning transactions are cheaper than using the Bitcoin network. More intriguing however, is that Lightning has the potential to replace existing payment processors for fiat transactions without the consumer knowing that BTC was used as the underlying settlement layer. We’ll&nbsp;explain.</p><p>Disrupting the payment&nbsp;giants</p><p>Visa and Mastercard are the world’s dominant payment processing networks. By collecting 2–3% transaction fees everytime someone swipes a debit or credit card, they pulled in $24B in 2021. Payment processors leveraging the Lightning Network could undercut&nbsp;that.</p><p>Let’s say you want to make a $100 payment to a merchant. Using your credit card would cost the merchant $3, which is then passed along to you via hidden costs. Now what if you converted $100 USD into BTC, transferred it over the Lightning network for less than a penny, before converting the BTC back to $100 USD. A service called <a href="https://www.opennode.com/lightning-network/">OpenNode</a> is able to leverage the Lightning Network to do just that, for a 1% fee. A similar logic can be applied to the $40B global remittance fee market, which <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/4rilomtvvae4/4Q8jnXMVUDMovAY8hcpYkL/fb65b3290c8dcb23314aacb6f9b19be6/The_State_of_Lightning_Vol_2.pdf">averages 6.4%</a> per cross-border transaction.</p><p>However economic it may be to replace Visa/Mastercard and international remittance companies with Lightning, it’s easier said than done. The incumbents enjoy large network effects, and like any young network, Lightning faces a cold start&nbsp;problem.</p><p>So how’s adoption looking to&nbsp;date?</p><p>Lightning adoption</p><p>Where the potential to disrupt the incumbents is there, current Lightning adoption is still tiny (but growing!). Arcane Research estimated that in Q1 22, Lightning facilitated $20–30M in monthly payments. That’s a 4x YoY increase, but a far cry from the $866B Visa facilitates each&nbsp;month.</p><p>The main way that Lightning growth is measured is by “public node capacity” — essentially how much BTC is locked in public Lightning channels. An estimated 30% of channels are private, making it difficult to state the true value in the network. What we can see however, is that public capacity is&nbsp;growing.</p><p>When measured in USD, the network has taken a predictable hit with the overall BTC price decline. However, encouragingly, the amount of total Bitcoins in the network is hitting new all-time highs at over 4,500 BTC (around&nbsp;$100M).</p><p>More importantly, as adoption ticks upward, the ecosystem around Lightning is growing as&nbsp;well.</p><p>The Lightning stack</p><p>The Lightning protocol sits atop of Bitcoin. On top of Lighting, sits core infrastructure. On top of the core infrastructure, are a growing number of payment and financial services, as well as consumer applications.</p><p>Core infrastructure consists of Lightning implementations and node &amp; liquidity services. Lightning implementations are the software programs that individuals and businesses can run to connect to the Lightning network — the largest being Lightning Labs’ LND with 70% of the market (as of 2020). Node and liquidity services host hardware, provide user-friendly interfaces, and help manage Lightning payment channels (running your own node is complex).</p><p>Built on top of the core infrastructure are a range of payment and financial services as well as consumer apps. For example, <a href="https://strike.me/">Strike</a> is built on an LND implementation that lets users buy and sell BTC, tip creators on Twitter, and allow Shopify merchants to accept&nbsp;BTC.</p><p>Also built on core infrastructure, are a growing number of budding consumer use cases. <a href="https://www.getmash.com/">Mash</a>, for example, aims to disrupt the creator subscription model via streaming micropayments — think paying your favorite Twitch streamers a couple cents each minute you watch, rather than buying a one-size-fits-all subscription. <a href="https://zebedee.io/">Zebedee</a> uses Lightning to enable in-game economies that reward players with small amounts of&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p><p>Growing accessibility &amp;&nbsp;momentum</p><p>As the Lightning ecosystem steadily grows, so has the access that users have to the network. Between Cash App’s Lightning integration and El Salvador’s rollout of the Chivo wallet, access has exploded from 10M to 80M users (the success of El Salvador’s rollout has been mixed, with <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29968/w29968.pdf">research</a> suggesting that only 5% of sales in the country use&nbsp;BTC).</p><p>26 exchanges support Lightning as well, with Kraken, Bitfinex, and Bitstamp being among the most prominent. Robinhood also recently announced an integration for 20M+ users, and P2P marketplace <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/14/paxful-integrates-lightning-network-for-bitcoin-transactions/">Paxful</a> offers support for its 7M+ users. Users of these exchanges can instantly and inexpensively deposit and withdraw bitcoin to and from any Lightning wallet, increasing the speed and lowering the cost compared to a typical BTC transaction.</p><p>Funding is picking up as well with OpenNode <a href="https://www.opennode.com/blog/opennode-series-a/">raising</a> a Series A at a $220M valuation and Lightning Labs <a href="https://medium.com/@lightning_labs/number-of-people-go-up-or-bitcoin-as-the-worlds-protocol-of-value-d1df7cefca37">raising</a> $70M for its Series B. Notably, former head of Meta’s crypto initiative David Marcus’s Lightspark, <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/david-marcus-launches-bitcoin-startup-lightspark-blockchain-payments/">raised</a> a Series A at an undisclosed amount to build Lightning infrastructure for companies, developers, and merchants.</p><p>Hurdles to&nbsp;adoption</p><p>The potential, funding, and momentum is there, however significant hurdles remain. Principally, the lack of developer tooling, demand for payment use cases, technical hurdles, onboarding challenges, as well as compliance and regulatory issues.</p><p>Developer tooling still needs to be built out to enable more user friendly applications. With most still treating BTC as an investment, we’re yet to see broad demand to use it for payments (use of Lightning rails for fiat payments remains a compelling opportunity). Despite progress from infrastructure companies, Lightning is still cumbersome for new users and merchants. Additionally, onboarding low income users in developing countries remains a major challenge to fulfilling the promise of Lightning remittances.</p><p>Lastly, the lack of compliance and regulatory frameworks limit the ability for existing payment and banking service providers to onboard and serve a global customer&nbsp;base.</p><p>Early days</p><p>After launching in 2018, it’s still early days for Lightning. With about $100M locked in the network, its size pales in comparison to Ethereum’s billion dollar <a href="https://l2beat.com/">layer-2 networks</a>, Arbitrum and Optimism. Lightning payment activity, however, is more indicative of real world utility when compared to the more speculative activity driving much of the growth on smart contract platforms.</p><p>Humble beginnings aside, the potential to turn crypto’s most valuable asset into a true medium of exchange has the power to bring greater financial inclusion to anyone with a smartphone. The ability to cost effectively route fiat transactions over Lightning rails without users ever knowing they’re using Bitcoin can disrupt $150B+* a year industries.</p><p>What Visa/Mastercard is for fiat currencies, Lightning can be for Bitcoin. The combination of a universally accessible payment network atop the world’s first open-source protocol for money can help Bitcoin evolve into a true global reserve currency. Should it happen, look for developing countries with high inflation and more smartphones than bank accounts to lead the&nbsp;way.</p><p>When Coinbase?</p><p>This article should not be construed as an indication that Coinbase has imminent plans to add support for Lightning. Rather, a few employees at the company simply found its potential compelling enough to research, write, and&nbsp;share.</p><p>With that said, it’s hard not to be encouraged by the growth that the Lightning Network is showing — particularly over the past six months. It’s noteworthy that this growth is coming in a bear market, where Bitcoin fees are relatively low. In a future bull market, we could see Lightning activity spike as fees on the base chain rise, sending users looking for cheaper ways to transact.</p><p>If growth of the Lightning Network continues, it will have major implications on the future utility and value of the world’s oldest and most valuable digital&nbsp;asset.</p><p>H/T <a href="https://twitter.com/Nick_Prince12">Nick Prince</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kch0e">Kevin Choe</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/yparikh98">Yash Parikh</a> for also helping inform this&nbsp;article.</p><p>For deeper reading on the Lightning Network, check&nbsp;out:</p>  <a href="https://arcane.no/research/reports/the-state-of-lightning-volume-2">The State of Lightning Volume 2</a>, by Arcane&nbsp;Research  <a href="https://www.swanbitcoin.com/a-look-at-the-lightning-network/">A Look At the Lightning Network</a>, by Lyn&nbsp;Alden  <p>*$150B is comprised of fee revenue for credit card and international remittances for both commercial and consumer sectors that we think Lightning is most primed to disrupt.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/financial%20services/our%20insights/the%202021%20mckinsey%20global%20payments%20report/2021-mckinsey-global-payments-report.pdf">Source</a>.</p><p>This website does not disclose material nonpublic information pertaining to Coinbase or Coinbase Venture’s portfolio companies.</p><p>Disclaimer: The opinions expressed on this website are those of the authors who may be associated persons of Coinbase, Inc., or its affiliates (“Coinbase”) and who do not represent the views, opinions and positions of Coinbase.

  While it looks like rocket science when you first come across it, the concept of a zero-knowledge proof is not as confusing as it seems. In fact, it can be summarized as digital accountability.

<p></p><p>Before going over what a zero-knowledge proof is in several different complexity levels, let’s look at why they’re important.<br></p> Digital accountability <p>As our world becomes increasingly fueled by technology, the use cases and the need for tools that allow us to interact with total strangers increase. Accountability is key to this as, when something happens, someone needs to answer for it. There is a high demand for sources of truth and verified information online.<br></p><p>Accountability is somewhat simple to achieve. However, what’s difficult is to do so when dealing with strangers online. Let’s go through a simple example;<br></p><p>When you pay for a pair of sneakers using your credit or debit card, your bank statement will show how much you spent, when, and what merchant you made the transaction with. Anyone who sees the credit card or bank statement (whether it’s your government in your tax declaration, the shop when you’re issuing a return, or a friend) can confirm what you did —you are accountable. <br></p><p>Now, do you want to share the information about your transaction with others (for a decent enough incentive)? &nbsp;Maybe. Do you want everyone to know everything about the product you bought, your transaction number, and all the info in your bank statement? Maybe not. However, if you wanted to prove you made the purchase, the only way you could fully prove its legitimacy would be through a full statement.<br></p><p>Zero-knowledge proofs are all about reliably achieving accountability on your own terms. In this article, we’ll look at the concept of zero-knowledge proofs, how to understand them in a simple language, and their applications.</p> Understanding what is a zero-knowledge proof A simple illustration of a zero-knowledge proof. (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/what-are-zero-knowledge-proofs-7ef6aab955fc">Source</a>)<p></p><p>Zero-knowledge proofs are protocols in <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cryptography-and-its-types/">cryptography</a> that tell you that something is true without giving you any other information beyond what you want to prove. This concept is better illustrated through a couple of single analogies:<br></p> How to explain zero-knowledge proofs to a kid <p>A zero-knowledge example that’s easy to gasp even to an 8-year-old is the following:<br></p><p>If you have a closed combination lock, you could simply prove to someone that you hold the right password by unlocking it without revealing the password. By doing this, you have certified that you know certain information without disclosing it (a zero-knowledge proof).<br></p> How to explain zero-knowledge proofs to an adult <p>Let’s now jump to a slightly more mature explanation that’s closer to the context zero-knowledge proofs are commonly used. <br></p><p>Returning to our earlier example, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) could be like bank statements that only answer to yes/no questions. This question could be tailored to specific use cases, such as “does your account contain more than $400?” or “are you over 25 AND purchased a pair of XMODEL Nike shoes?”<br></p><p>The ZKP does not detail how, where, or when you bought your sneakers. If you were to be in possession of such proof, you would be able to show it to anyone you chose to, even link it to your crypto wallet for anyone to verify at will or post it online.<br></p> Attributes of a zero-knowledge proof<br> <p>Apart from ensuring no knowledge is transferred between the two parties, zero-knowledge proofs need to fulfill two conditions:<br></p>  Completeness: If a statement is true, an honest verifier (that is, one following the protocol properly) will be convinced of this fact by an honest prover. This means that the system works to verify a true proof every time.<br>  Soundness: If the statement is false, no cheating prover can convince an honest verifier that it is true. In our analogy, soundness means you can only prove you bought a product, if and only if, it is true. This characteristic reflects on the system used to mint zero-knowledge proofs, which needs to be decentralized (i.e. no one can influence it) and reliable (it works as expected every time).   The invention of the zero-knowledge proof <p>ZKPs were invented In 1985 by Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali, and Charles Rackoff. The trio wrote a paper introducing zero-knowledge proofs titled "<a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.419.8132&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">The Knowledge Complexity of Interactive Proof-Systems</a>," which helped lay a solid foundation for the growth of zero-knowledge proofs. In their quest for finding efficient methods of communicating proof, GMR (Goldwasser, Micali, &amp; Rackoff) devised the concept of zero-knowledge proofs – which could be used to prove that a theorem ‘T’ is true without conveying any additional information.<br></p><p>People have used several examples to describe ZKPs since they were created, with one of the most popular ones being the following:<br></p><p>There are two friends, Mike (the prover) and Carlos (the verifier). Carlos is color-blind and cannot tell the difference between two otherwise identic balls of different colors, red and green. When Carlos picks up two balls, Mike tells him he is holding two balls of different colors (green in his left hand and red in his right). Carlos does not believe Mike, and now he needs something besides Mike's words to convince him. <br></p><p>Carlos then devices a zero-knowledge way for Mike to prove his statement, as Carlos cannot gain the ability to see color.<br></p>  Carlos first holds two balls in front of Mike, who can see which ball is in which hand. Carlos is holding a green ball in his left hand and a red ball in his right.<br>  Then, behind his back, Carlos shuffles the balls. Now he knows which ball is in which hand, but Mike doesn’t, since he cannot see them.<br>  Carlos goes on to present the balls to Mike again, asking Mike whether he switched the balls or not. Since Mike can tell both balls apart due to their color, he answers the question easily.<br>  Carlos is not convinced because there are only two balls, which gives Mike a 50% chance of guessing whether he switched the balls or not. Also, both balls could be of the same color, so after one verification, Carlos still doubts the outcome is correct.<br>  However, if Carlos repeats the procedure, the probability for Mike to guess if he switched the balls or not eventually becomes low enough for Carlos to believe him. With many consecutive right answers from Mike, Carlos learns that Mike can actually tell the difference between the two balls. He, however, has not gained the ability to tell apart green objects from red ones.<br>  A video explainer following the color-blind friend analogy. Types of zero-knowledge proofs <p>In the cryptography world, there are two main types of zero-knowledge proofs:</p> Interactive zero-knowledge proofs <p>From the Carlos and Mike example, we can see that both of them continued to speak to each other throughout the exercise. The back and forth conversation helped Mike prove the truth of his claims until Carlos was convinced.

   Known as the "AWS of Web3", Alchemy's platform powers most of the top web3 applications around the world. The idea came to founders Nikil Viswanathan and Joe Lau following their own frustration when building a crypto analytics tool. Seeing that developers around the world needed a toolkit to enable the next wave of innovation, they set out to build Alchemy. Launched in 2020, the company's platform

<p>Tl;dr: Building a better crypto ecosystem means building a better, more equitable future for us all. That’s why we are investing in the larger community to make sure anyone who wants to participate in the crypto economy can do so in a secure way. In this blog post, we share lessons about the nature of the vulnerability, exploitation methodology, as well as on-chain analysis of attacker behavior during the Nomad Bridge incident.</p><p>While the Nomad bridge compromise does not directly affect Coinbase, we strongly believe that<a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/how-coinbase-responds-to-industry-wide-crypto-security-threats-ad2c8a5da1f5"> attacks on any crypto business are bad for the industry as a whole</a> and hope the information in the blog will help strengthen and inform similar projects about threats and techniques used by malicious actors.</p><p>By: Peter Kacherginsky, Threat Intelligence and Heidi Wilder, Special Investigations</p><p>On August 1, 2022 Nomad Bridge <a href="https://twitter.com/nomadxyz_/status/1554246853348036608">suffered the fourth largest DeFi hack</a> with more than $186M stolen in just a few hours. As we have described in our <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/what-are-bridges-illicit-use-of-bridges-3e1a9b19cc4b">recent blog post</a>, from the $540M Ronin Bridge compromise in March to the $250M Wormhole bridge hack in February of 2022, it is not a coincidence that DeFi bridges constitute some of the most costly incidents in our industry.</p><p>What makes the Nomad Bridge compromise unique is the simplicity of the exploit and the sheer number of individuals taking advantage of it to empty all stored assets piece by&nbsp;piece.</p> Vulnerability Analysis <p><a href="https://docs.nomad.xyz/the-nomad-protocol/">Nomad</a> is a bridging protocol supporting Ethereum, Moonbeam, and other chains. Nomad’s bridging protocol is built using both on-chain and off-chain components. On-chain smart contracts are used to collect and distribute bridged funds while off-chain agents relay and verify messages between different blockchains. Each blockchain deploys a Replica contract which validates and stores messages in a Merkle tree structure. Messages can be validated by either providing proof with the proveAndProcess() call or for already verified messages they can be simply submitted with the process() call. Verified messages are forwarded to a Bridge handler (e.g. ERC20 Router) which can distribute bridged&nbsp;assets.</p><p>On April 21, 2022 Nomad <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x99662dacfb4b963479b159fc43c2b4d048562104fe154a4d0c2519ada72e50bf">deployed</a> a Replica <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x5d94309e5a0090b165fa4181519701637b6daeba">proxy contract</a> to handle processing and validation of users’ claims of bridged assets. This proxy would allow Nomad to easily change implementation logic while retaining storage across upgrades. As part of the proxy deployment, Nomad set initial contract parameters defined in the snippet&nbsp;below:</p><p>Notice the highlighted confirmAt map assignment which sets an initial entry for the trusted _committedRoot to the value of 1. The variable _committedRoot is provided as an initialization parameter by Nomad’s contract deployer. Let’s see what it was set to during the initialization:</p><p>Interestingly the initialization parameter _committedRoot was set to 0. As a result the confirmAt map now has a value of 1 for a 0 entry that from April to this&nbsp;day:</p><p>On June 21, 2022, Nomad performed a series of upgrades to its bridging infrastructure including the Replica implementation. One of the changes included updates to the message verification logic in the process() function:</p><p>The message verification flow now includes a call to the acceptableRoot() method which in turn references confirmAt map we mentioned above:</p><p>The vulnerability appears in a scenario when fraudulent messages, not present in the trusted messages[] map, are sent directly to the process() method. In this scenario messages[_messageHash] returns a default null value for non-existent entries so the acceptableRoot() method is called as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>In turn, the acceptableRoot() method will perform a lookup against confirmAt[] map with a null value as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>As we mentioned in the beginning of this section, confirmAt[] map has a null entry defined resulting in acceptableRoot() returning True and authorizing fraudulent messages.</p> Exploit Analysis <p>The exploit takes advantage of the above vulnerability by crafting a message which tricks Nomad bridge into sending stored tokens without proper authorization. Below is a sample process() payload in a <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb1fe26cc8892f58eb468f5208baaf38bac422b5752cca0b9c8a871855d63ae28">transaction</a> submitted by <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xb5c55f76f90cc528b2609109ca14d8d84593590e">0xb5c5…590e</a>:</p><p>The Replica message has the following structure:</p><p>The recipient specific _messageBody contains transaction data to be processed by the _recipient. Nomad recipients accept several transaction and message types, but we will focus on the transfer&nbsp;type:</p><p>Decoding the above payload illustrates how 0xb5c55f76f90cc528b2609109ca14d8d84593590e was able to steal 100 WBTC by submitting a specially crafted payload to bypass Nomad’s message&nbsp;checks.</p><p>In order to better understand the root cause of the exploit we <a href="https://github.com/iphelix/exploits-defi/tree/main/nomad">developed a PoC</a> to demonstrate it draining the entire token’s balance on the bridge in just a few transactions:</p><p>While writing a PoC we found it curious that attackers chose to extract funds in smaller increments when they could have drained the whole amount in a single transaction. This is likely due to the attackers not crafting bridge messages from scratch, but instead replaying existing transactions with patched receiving addresses.</p> On-Chain Analysis <p>Over $186M in ERC-20 tokens were stolen from the Nomad Bridge between August 1, 2022 at 21:32 UTC and August 2, 2022 at 05:49 UTC. The highest volume in stolen tokens were primarily USDC, followed by WETH, WBTC, and CQT. Within the first hour of the exploit, only WBTC and WETH were stolen, then followed by several other&nbsp;ERC-20s.</p><p>Source: <a href="https://dune.com/coldfire/nomad-bridge-exploit">Dune Dashboard</a></p><p>In analyzing the blockchain data, we see that there were various addresses piggybacking off of the original exploiters and using almost identical input data with modified recipient addresses in order to siphon off the same token for the same amount. Once the WBTC contract was mostly drained, the attackers then went on to drain the WETH contract, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>Further analyzing the first attackers in block <a href="https://etherscan.io/txs?block=15259101">15259101</a>, we find that the initial two attacker addresses leveraged a helper contract to obfuscate the exact exploit. Unfortunately, within that same block, several indexes down another exploiter address seem to have struggled interacting with the helper contract and decided to bypass it — and publicly expose the exploit input data in the process. Other addresses in the same and latter blocks then followed suit and used almost identical payloads to conduct the&nbsp;exploit.</p><p>Following the initial exploitation, and due to the ease of triggering the exploit, hundreds of copycats joined a massive exploitation of a single contract. While analyzing the payloads of various future attackers, we found that there was not only the reuse of the same tokens being bridged over and the same amounts, but also that funds were consistently being “bridged” from Moonbeam just like the original&nbsp;exploit.</p><p>The attack happened in three stages:the vulnerability testing a day prior to the attack, the initial exploit targeting WBTC stored on the bridge, and the copycat stage involving hundreds of unique addresses. Let’s dive into each of these including partial return of stolen&nbsp;assets.</p> Vulnerability Testing <p>Throughout July 31, 2022, <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xa8c83b1b30291a3a1a118058b5445cc83041cd9d">bitliq[.]eth</a> was found to trigger the vulnerability using small amounts of WBTC and other tokens.

Transaction was submitted publicly to&nbsp;mempool.  <p>All four transactions used identical exploit payloads with the exception of a recipient address as described in the Vulnerability section&nbsp;above:</p> 0x6265616d000000000000000000000000d3dfd3ede74e0dcebc1aa685e151332857efce2d000013d60065746800000000000000000000000088a69b4e698a4b090df6cf5bd7b2d47325ad30a3006574680000000000000000000000002260fac5e5542a773aa44fbcfedf7c193bc2c59903000000000000000000000000f57113d8f6ff35747737f026fe0b37d4d7f4277700000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002540be400e6e85ded018819209cfb948d074cb65de145734b5b0852e4a5db25cac2b8c39a <p>Some observations on the&nbsp;above:</p>  The first three addresses were funded by Tornado Cash and have been actively transacting with each other which indicates a single actor&nbsp;group.  Unlike the first two exploit transactions, <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xb5c55f76f90cc528b2609109ca14d8d84593590e">0xb5c5…590e</a> and <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xa8c83b1b30291a3a1a118058b5445cc83041cd9d">bitliq[.]eth</a> sent the exploit payload directly to the contract and without the use of flashbots to hide it from public&nbsp;mempool.  <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xa8c83b1b30291a3a1a118058b5445cc83041cd9d">bitliq[.]eth</a> replayed an earlier exploit transaction in the same block 15259101 as <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xb5c55f76f90cc528b2609109ca14d8d84593590e">0xb5c5…590e</a> indicating either prior knowledge of the exploit or learning about <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb1fe26cc8892f58eb468f5208baaf38bac422b5752cca0b9c8a871855d63ae28">0xb1fe…ae28</a> from the&nbsp;mempool.  All four transactions used identical payloads, each stealing 100 WBTC at a&nbsp;time.   Copycats <p>In total, 88% of addresses conducting the exploits were identified as copycats and together they stole about $88M in tokens from the&nbsp;bridge.</p><p>The majority of copycats used a variation of the original exploit by simply modifying targeted tokens, amounts, and recipient addresses. We can classify unique payloads by grouping them based on contracts they call and unique method 4bytes invoked as illustrated below:</p><p>Based on our analysis, more than 88% of unique addresses called the vulnerable contract directly using the 928bc4b2 function identifier which corresponds to the process(bytes) method used in the original exploit. The remainder perform the same call using intermediary contracts such as 1cff79cd which is the execute(address,bytes) method, batching multiple process() transactions together, and other minor variations.</p><p>Following the initial compromise, the original exploiters had to compete against hundreds of copycats:</p><p>While the majority of valuable tokens were claimed by just two of the original exploiters’ addresses, hundreds of others were able to claim part of bridge’s holdings:</p><p>Below is a chart showing the tokens stolen over time in USD. It becomes apparent that the exploiters were going token by token as they were draining the&nbsp;bridge.</p> The Great&nbsp;Return <p>As of August 9, 17% stolen from the Nomad Bridge contract has been returned — including partial returns. The majority of the returns took place in the hours following Nomad Bridge’s request to send funds to the recovery address on August 3, 2022. [<a href="https://twitter.com/nomadxyz_/status/1554679735006859264">Tweet</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x53063094849b77ef621d0245295c24c6e09b0e489bc3099cdfad688d561e6f47">Tx</a>]</p><p>Below is a breakdown of the funds returned, which includes ETH and various other tokens, some of which were never even on the&nbsp;bridge:</p><p>Funds continue to be sent back to the bridge’s recovery address, albeit more slowly in the recent days than when the address was initially posted:</p><p>As of August 9, The majority of returned funds appear to be in USDC, followed by USDT, WBTC, DAI, CQT, and WETH. This is notably different from the breakdown of the tokens exploited. The reason being that the initial original exploiters primarily drained the bridge of WBTC and WETH. Unlike later stage exploiters, these exploiters moved funds around with no intent to return&nbsp;them.</p><p>Interestingly, one of the original exploiters, bitliq[.]eth, has returned only 100 ETH to the bridge contract, but has begun cashing out the rest of their proceeds through renBTC and burning it in exchange for&nbsp;BTC.</p> Categorizing the “exploiters” <p>When assessing the Nomad Bridge exploiters, the attackers were categorized into the following buckets:</p>  Black hats: Those that don’t return funds and continue moving them&nbsp;onwards.  White hats: Those that fully send funds back to the recovery addresses  Please note that while we are using the term white hat for explanatory purposes here, the initial taking of the funds was not authorized and is not an activity we would&nbsp;endorse.  Grey hats: Those that partially send funds back to the recovery addresses.  Unknown unknowns: Those that have yet to move&nbsp;funds.  <p>Approximately 34% of funds continue to sit untouched. We suspect these are either attackers waiting out the heat or shrewd degens holding out for a better bounty from Nomad. However, the largest volume of funds has moved onwards. As of August 9, we estimate that ~49% has moved&nbsp;onwards.</p><p>To stay up to date with the latest in terms of the funds returned, check out <a href="https://dune.com/coldfire/nomad-bridge-exploit">this dashboard</a>.</p> Delving Into the Blackhats <p>Of those funds that have moved onwards, we have identified several large rings of addresses that all commingle funds. In particular, one cluster of addresses seems to have amassed over $62M in volume. Interestingly, one address within this cluster was the first address to have conducted the exploit [<a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x61497a1a8a8659a06358e130ea590e1eed8956edbd99dbb2048cfb46850a8f17">tx&nbsp;hash</a>].</p><p>To date, we primarily see these rings following one of the below patterns:</p>  MEV bot&nbsp;activity  Commingle and hold on to wait out the&nbsp;heat  Swapping funds and eventually returning a partial amount of funds to the recovery&nbsp;address  Swapping funds and investing DeFi projects or cashing out at various&nbsp;CEXs  Moving funds through Tornado&nbsp;Cash  <p>Below is an example of how some addresses have begun moving funds through Tornado Cash, which as of August 8, 2022, is a sanctioned entity.</p> Beware of&nbsp;Scams: <p>Several white hats have already returned over 10% of funds to the bridge contract. However, this wasn’t without&nbsp;hiccups.</p><p>Originally, the Nomad team posted on both <a href="https://twitter.com/nomadxyz_/status/1554679735006859264">Twitter</a> and on the <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x53063094849b77ef621d0245295c24c6e09b0e489bc3099cdfad688d561e6f47">blockchain</a> the Ethereum address to send any exploited funds&nbsp;to</p><p>However, scammers cleverly followed suit and set up various fraudulent ENS domains to pose as the Nomad team and requested they have funds sent to vanity addresses with the same initial characters as the legitimate recovery&nbsp;address.</p><p>For example, below is a message sent by one of the scammers. Note the fraudulent recovery address, ENS domain, and also the 10% bounty off. Nomad has since offered that white hats claim 10% of exploited proceeds. [<a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x563e8d10b1a0b337ed3beb1908ae8338ec6eef6bc080eb7bf23f8f96713e2a88">Tx</a>]</p> Protecting Yourself <p>While most contracts are audited extensively by various blockchain auditors, contracts may still contain yet to be discovered vulnerabilities. While you may want to provide liquidity to a particular protocol or bridge over funds, here are some tips to keep in&nbsp;mind:</p>  When supplying liquidity, don’t keep all of your funds on one protocol or stored in the&nbsp;bridge.  Make sure to regularly review and revoke any contract approvals you don’t actively&nbsp;need.  Stay up to date with security intelligence feeds to track protocols you’ve invested&nbsp;in.  <p>Coinbase is committed to improving our security and the wider industry’s security, as well as protecting our users. We believe that exploits like these can be mitigated and ultimately prevented. Besides making codebases open source for the public to review, we recommend frequent protocol audits, implement bug bounty programs, and actively work with security researchers. Although this exploit was a difficult learning experience, we believe that understanding how the exploit occurred can only help further mature our young industry.</p> References   <a href="https://github.com/iphelix/exploits-defi/tree/main/nomad">Exploit PoC</a> by Peter Kacherginsky  <a href="https://dune.com/coldfire/nomad-bridge-exploit">Dune Dashboard</a> by Heidi&nbsp;Wilder.  <a href="https://twitter.com/samczsun/status/1554252024723546112">Initial Exploit Analysis</a> by&nbsp;samczsun   Indicators <p>Initial exploiters:</p> Ethereum: 0x56d8b635a7c88fd1104d23d632af40c1c3aac4e3<br>Ethereum: 0xf57113d8f6ff35747737f026fe0b37d4d7f42777<br>Ethereum: 0xb88189cd5168c4676bd93e9768497155956f8445<br>Ethereum: 0x847e74d8cd0d4bc2716a6382736ae2870db94148<br>Ethereum: 0x000000000000660def84e69995117c0176ba446e<br>Ethereum: 0xb5c55f76f90cc528b2609109ca14d8d84593590e<br>Ethereum: 0xa8c83b1b30291a3a1a118058b5445cc83041cd9d <p>See <a href="https://dune.com/coldfire/nomad-bridge-exploit">Dune Dashboard</a> for a complete listing of exploiter addresses, transactions, and live status of stolen&nbsp;assets.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/nomad-bridge-incident-analysis-899b425b0f34">Nomad Bridge incident analysis</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com">The Coinbase Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Already, public and private sector organizations acquire extensive personal information and exchange it amongst themselves… The automation of payment and other consumer transactions is expanding these dangers to an unprecedented extent.”</p> <p>In today’s surveillance capitalism, it’s clear that we need cryptography now more than ever.</p> <p>------ 📣 Forta | Help Make Web3 a Safer Place <a href="https://bankless.cc/Forta">https://bankless.cc/Forta</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; 🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://podcast.banklesshq.com/">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>------ BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:&nbsp;</p> <p>🚀 ROCKET POOL | ETH STAKING <a href="https://bankless.cc/RocketPool">https://bankless.cc/RocketPool</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM <a href="https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>❎ ACROSS | BRIDGE TO LAYER 2 <a href="https://bankless.cc/Across">https://bankless.cc/Across</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🦁 BRAVE | THE BROWSER NATIVE WALLET <a href="https://bankless.cc/Brave">https://bankless.cc/Brave</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🌴 MAKER DAO | DECENTRALIZED LENDING <a href="https://bankless.cc/MakerDAO">https://bankless.cc/MakerDAO</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🔐 LEDGER | SECURE STAKING <a href="https://bankless.cc/Ledger">https://bankless.cc/Ledger</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>------ Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro 6:00 David Chaum 11:30 60s Technology 20:00 60s Culture 23:55 A New Direction in Cryptography 33:30 The Fork in the Road 41:50 Minimum Disclosure 48:25 Traffic Analysis 56:05 Surveillance Capitalism 1:02:00 The State of Data Today 1:12:00 New Ideas and Society 1:15:40 Advice to Crypto</p> <p>------ Resources:</p> <p>David on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/chaumdotcom?s=20&amp;t=u3ULosGOPIOTPZobdnMKkw"> https://twitter.com/chaumdotcom?s=20&amp;t=u3ULosGOPIOTPZobdnMKkw</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>David’s Website: <a href="https://chaum.com/">https://chaum.com/</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>----- Not financial or tax advice.

<p>Today it was announced the United States Treasury imposed sanctions on virtual currency mixer Tornado Cash, adding it to the OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) SDN list, the list of Specially Designated Nationals with whom Americans and American businesses are not allowed to transact.</p>



<p>We agree with our partners at Coin Center and Blockchain Association that there are concerns about how today’s announcement impacts the civil liberties of United States citizens. We are following developments closely and look forward to continuing our ongoing and productive conversations with regulators and policymakers on behalf of Zcash.</p>



<p>Our mission at Electric Coin Co. (ECC) is to empower economic freedom, and to that end, we contribute to and support a fair, open currency to protect the freedom, dignity, consent, and security of people all over the world.</p>



<p>Sensible policy guidance and education are at the core of our work with socio-political stakeholders, and ECC advocates that privacy is essential for personal, business, and national security. Our partner network in these endeavors includes think tanks, academic research centers, and nonprofits that provide thought leadership and advocacy for issues that affect Zcash users.</p>



<p>Zcash is compliant and fully compatible with global AML/CFT standards, including all final FATF recommendations, the European Union’s Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, and the United States’ Anti-Money Laundering regulations. It is approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), a key requirement for listing on major exchanges, like Gemini and Coinbase.</p>



<p>In 2020, ECC commissioned the RAND Corporation to <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR4418.html">conduct research</a> into Zcash usage for illicit purposes. The research revealed no evidence of any substantive use of Zcash for money laundering, terrorism financing or trade in illicit goods and services. The report also found, “the governance of Zcash and its branding as compliant with the relevant AML/CFT regulations may make it less susceptible to exploitation for illicit or criminal purposes.”</p>

 Major trends among communities and some lessons on how to build during a bear&nbsp;market. <p>If you weren’t able to make it to #EthCC5, we’ve got you covered. The following were some of Findora’s biggest takeaways: new trends, buzzwords, and lessons for how to grow during a bear&nbsp;market.</p><p>No one likes a downturn — but the attendees of EthCC didn’t let it get in the way of a good time. Bear markets are the best time for projects to prove themselves, and Findora isn’t letting this opportunity slip&nbsp;away.</p><p>Even though <a href="https://ethcc.io/">EthCC</a> is a community conference, they held a hackathon and had several solid entries. The ZK-Moles Scavenger hunt was a fun idea that led to some key collaboration and insights discussed below. Findora managed to connect with several future partners, including Ledger, and FRA has enjoyed a surge in price since the convention.</p><p>This is great progress, especially during a bear market. It shows you don’t need to just button down the hatches if the market tanks, you can still grow and build, if you know how and have true value to offer. People, and investors, are taking notice of projects that are pushing through the adverse market conditions.</p><p>It’s the kind of attention any project would want when liquidity starts to evaporate. Though Findora won’t speculate on future market trends, we do think understanding the present is key to success. So, here are some big takeaways Findora community members got from EthCC5 that we think will benefit any project that is building through a bear&nbsp;market.</p> Build Communities through Fun, not&nbsp;Profit <p>There’s an inverse relationship in Web3 between how fun a project is and how much profit it&nbsp;makes.</p>The Fun-Money Matrix<p>It’s just a general trend: during DeFi summer, people worked hard to maximize their yields. Yes, it was a lot of stress, but it was profitable until the winter&nbsp;came.</p><p>In a bear market, when you can’t chase yields, the better investment comes from chasing fun instead of only-up&nbsp;numbers.</p><p>Take this example from Aleo. They had a great presentation at EthCC where they used Zk technology and true randomness to create a <a href="https://github.com/Entropy1729/aleo_roulette">roulette game</a> demonstrating how the technology can be applied. Online games can use ZK to keep people from feeling that the house will always win — it lets games be won by rational&nbsp;actors.</p><p>Will Aleo make money off of this? No, but they’ll build a community because it was a fun idea and they made the code open-source.</p><p>Similarly, Findora’s scavenger hunt during EthCC got a small but dedicated following. We had someone who lived in Paris who couldn’t believe we had hidden NFTs in a place he couldn’t find. This game attracted other communities who thought of new spin-offs.</p><p>For instance, Findora community members brainstorming with <a href="https://wittycreatures.com/#/init-game">Witty Creatures</a> holders, came up with the idea of combing social NFTs with ZK-geocaching. We could create Ethereum maps that lead to Zk-treasure that people have to hunt. Players could wear physical social NFTs so that as they gathered around the same spot, they can strike up a connection and meet new&nbsp;people.</p><p>There are plenty of games with great game mechanics that don’t take much in the way of developer resources to make. True GameFi is probably years away since that’s how long it takes to develop a big, billion-dollar game. But by creating simple but fun games that rely on solid game-mechanics not graphics, it’s possible to jump-start the push toward GameFi, demonstrate your project’s concept, and build community.</p> Privacy and ZK Were Major&nbsp;Themes <p>Since Consensus 2022, there seems to be more and more focus on zero-knowledge projects.</p><p>For instance, the Merge isn’t the only scaling solution Ethereum may have. Both Matter Labs and Polygon announced the release of ZK-Rollups. And there was a lot of excitement surrounding the Starknet hackathon from day 1 of the convention. Findora was able to meet and network with several developers as a&nbsp;result.</p><p>Some <a href="https://ys.finance/">Yellow Submarine</a> community members, a cross-chain ZK project built on Findora, received very positive feedback when they pitched to Ethereum developers. They understood how important it could be for EVM chains to have private crosschain transfer built into existing&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>The ZK niche continues to carve out a bigger space at each crypto convention.</p> Give More than&nbsp;MOUs <p>MOUs are out — and Web3 projects need more before they will devote resources to exploring a partnership.</p><p>The loss of liquidity is making projects more choosy about who they work with. It isn’t enough anymore to pledge you’ll work together — people want to know upfront what you can cant can’t do. Having this readily available will be important as projects search for partners and compete for what funding is&nbsp;left.</p> The Merge is&nbsp;coming <p>Being and Ethereum conference, there was a lot of talk about the Merge. Many projects and talks were about that and the effect it might have on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Ethereum developers recently shipped the Merge on the <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/ethereum-inches-closer-the-merge-with-sepolia-testnet-launch/">Sepolia testnet</a>, and it was recently announced that it would be deployed on the <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/160112/ethereum-developers-announce-date-for-goerli-testnet-merger?utm_source=findora&amp;utm_medium=online">Goerli testnet</a> next, starting between August 6th-12th. It looks like after many years and multiple rebrands, Ethereum’s move to proof of stake is finally upon&nbsp;us.</p> The Latest Buzzword is&nbsp;Here <p>The new buzzword in crypto, which was thrown around a lot at EthCC, is the “public&nbsp;good.”</p><p>The idea of a public good is something like a highway or trans-ocean internet fibers or other infrastructure. Everyone benefits equally from its creation, but there isn’t enough profit incentive to create it, so a group, like a government, sets it up&nbsp;instead.</p><p>The new idea is to sponsor public good projects through&nbsp;DAOs.</p><p>The idea is certainly high-minded but also feels to some like another glittery marketing mantra. The skeptics would argue that all things, in crypto or not, are done for profit. Projects like Bitcoin or Ethereum that are meant to be equally beneficial have clear winners and losers. Whether using PoW or PoS, some will have more rewards than others, centralization is always a possibility, and all endeavors must make a return to be worth&nbsp;it.</p><p>The “Public Good” is another high-minded principle, but how well can people really live up to it? That remains to be seen. Perhaps principles are supposed to be out of reach to keep us growing. Whatever one’s opinion of the legitimacy of such a concept, it’s clear the newest buzzword to make crypto broadly appealing is the “public&nbsp;good.”</p> Saying Au Revoir to&nbsp;EthCC <p>Findora made many great connections and added some amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/EasyNode/status/1553870368707944448?s=20&amp;t=403Olyy0FrHG4_PAjyJRpw">new validators</a> to the&nbsp;network.</p><p>It became clear to many that Findora is in this for the long haul and has a strong network that is getting stronger. This is partly why the price of FRA has more than tripled in the weeks following the conference and how we can attract new partners.</p><p>Maybe that’s another great takeaway from EthCC and bear markets: when the markets get tough, the tough get building. And if you can show others you have true value to offer, that you are here for the long haul, and you aren’t flummoxed by price fluctuations — they’ll be excited to build with you&nbsp;too.</p><p>EthCC was a great conference, and we’re looking forward to the progress everyone will make by the time we all meet again next&nbsp;year.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation/findoras-five-takeaways-from-ethcc5-fd75f581681c">Findora’s Five Takeaways from EthCC5</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation">Findora Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Editor’s note: this article was originally published on <a href="https://cryptomode.com/zprize-launches-competition-to-advance-zero-knowledge-research-with-findora/">cryptomode.com</a> and is reposted here with the author’s permission. <p>Just in case you missed it, <a href="https://www.zprize.io/">ZPrize</a> is a recent initiative that offers rewards for solving ZK issues and advancing ZK research, partnering with privacy projects like Findora to promote adoption in&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>Nearly six years ago, <a href="https://z.cash/">Zcash</a> started building the first private money system. At the time, it took nearly 60 seconds just to generate a single proof. Zero-knowledge technology has advanced private money a long way since then, and ZPrize is here to ensure it continues its progress.</p><p>ZPrize offers prizes to individuals or teams who can submit an advancement in zero knowledge research or solve specific issues. Thanks to sponsors like Findora, they now have a $7 million reward pool through&nbsp;ZPrize.</p><p>Findora researchers can proudly point to their own contributions in speeding up these proofs. What started as a ZK cryptography research project at Stanford University, Findora has evolved to implement Bulletproofs and TurboPlonk, with improvements in efficiency. Findora researchers have continued working hard to push the limits of ZK technology and in turn, have made it a more practical tool for&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Now Findora is partnering with ZPrize to continue the work of expanding ZK research and development.</p> What is&nbsp;ZPrize? <p>ZPrize is a contest platform dedicated to “accelerating the future of zero-knowledge cryptography.” Styled after XPRIZE, it features a prize program where teams compete to solve problems and win rewards. For example, there is currently a $750,000 prize for WASM prover optimization that anyone can apply to solve. All winning entries will be put into an open-source library so that everyone can benefit from the&nbsp;work.</p><p>ZPrize is supported by industry leaders like the Ethereum Foundation, Aleo, Polygon, Mina, and Findora. Through its sponsors, ZPrize has amassed a prize pool of $7 million to be distributed over dozens of prizes to teams that add the next piece to the ZK&nbsp;puzzle.</p> Findora and ZPrize in The Story of Zero-Knowledge Technology <p>It is likely that Satoshi wanted Bitcoin to be private but knew that the technology needed to make it private was not yet ready. Zero-knowledge cryptography finally gives us the ability to bring more privacy to public blockchains.</p><p>Findora believes that many Web3 applications will eventually be powered by zero-knowledge proofs. Part of what makes ZPrize so special is that it brings together otherwise competitive ZK projects and gives them a surface to work together to advance the state-of-the-art in&nbsp;ZK.</p><p>Findora shares ZPrize’s belief that in order to go far, it’s best to work together. This is part of why Findora has made its <a href="https://github.com/FindoraNetwork/zei">Zei Library,</a> an extensive collection of arguably the most advanced ZK cryptography, open source, and available to ZPrize contestants. To that extent, Findora is part of an alliance of projects sharing their research and breakthroughs to achieve the next generation of ZK solutions.</p><p>Through ZPrize, the vision for crypto and web3 can be fully realized with ZK, which will allow for the creation of systems that protect decentralized self-sovereignty, restore privacy, and return to users control of their own&nbsp;data.</p> About <a href="https://findora.org/">Findora</a> <p>Findora scales Ethereum privacy with next-generation zero-knowledge proof technology. It is a leading privacy-preserving smart contract platform for Web3, giving developers the tools they need to build a new financial internet. Founded in 2017 and born out of next-generation cryptography research, Findora finally launched publicly in 2021 and is poised to use privacy to make DeFi a safe place for individuals and financial institutions.</p> About ZPrize <p>ZPrize hosts competitions that will accelerate zero-knowledge cryptography. It is a collaborative effort that includes over 32 partners and sponsors, including Aleo, Jump Crypto, Polygon, Polkadot, Manta Network, and Findora.

 <a href="http://findora.org">Findora</a> is an open-source, permissionless, decentralized public blockchain. In that spirit, we have extensively shared with the community our product milestones, partnership announcements, research papers, community campaigns, event planning, etc.&nbsp;. We know it’s a lot to sort through, so here’s a quick primer to quickly grasp the basics and read our most important articles. <p>We categorize the articles into the following five&nbsp;topics:</p>  Technology Milestones  Community &amp; User&nbsp;Guides  Staking and Validators  Ecosystem Progress  Thought leadership  <p>This primer will be continually updated to reflect the most recent developments. We hope this makes it a little easier to navigate all the content about&nbsp;Findora!</p> Technology Milestones <p>Findora scales Ethereum privacy. But how does it do&nbsp;that?</p><p>Findora leverages revolutionary blockchain architecture with advanced cryptographic technology. Using both a UTXO ledger and an EVM ledger bridged through atomic transfer (Prism Transfer), Findora is a layer one blockchain optimized for zero-knowledge compatibility and programmability and is one of the most production-ready zk projects in web3. It acts as a privacy oracle for any EVM-compatible chain rather than just an L2 scaling solution — even though Findora can fill that need too in terms of scalability.</p>  Great places to start: <a href="https://wiki.findora.org/docs/findora_basics/introduction">wiki</a>&nbsp;, <a href="https://www.notion.so/Project-X-Findora-Grants-Application-Onboarding-Package-2bc3296c43c2484db2863cba97e0a517">linktree</a>, <a href="https://findora.org/developer/">developer portal</a>, <a href="https://www.notion.so/Onboarding-7cb750c54d7c46588e970a75c1ab1c6c">Media Factsheet</a> &amp; brand&nbsp;assets.

<p>There are no clear Bitcoin competitors when it comes to value-oriented blockchains.</p><p>Bitcoin has over <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/blockchain-stats">180 million users</a>, and the network averages hundreds of thousands of daily transactions, facilitating cross-border payments. However, as more people regard Bitcoin as a full-fledged digital asset akin to gold or real estate, the question of who can compete with the orange giant on other terms comes to mind.</p><p>One particular reason behind Bitcoin's global adoption is the pseudonymity that its users enjoy. Beyond being a value store and viewed as a viable long-term investment, Bitcoin allowed people to move money without needing banks and traditional financial infrastructure. Although people could transact under pseudonymous identities—the creator(s) of Bitcoin went by the alias Satoshi Nakamoto—this increasingly represents a challenge.<br>In this write-up, we will explore the concepts of transparency furthered by Bitcoin and most blockchains, and their numerous drawbacks. Additionally, we will analyze the nature of <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bitcoin-tumblers-privacy-coins-and-prifi-private-crypto/">privacy-centric</a> blockchain solutions, whether they’re truly Bitcoin competitors, their potential users, and (briefly) how <a href="http://pantherprotocol.io">Panther Protocol</a> plays a part in this discussion.</p> Why is Bitcoin transparent? <p>Bitcoin aimed to achieve a complete decentralized financial system, one without a centralized body of trust in the middle. Without go-betweens like banks that hold control over users' funds, Bitcoin proposed a replacing system that could drive trust on the network, making every single payment network in the world a Bitcoin competitor.<br></p><p>To do this, Bitcoin puts an emphasis on full transparency and verifiability. Satoshi Nakamoto, shared his vision of the project on October 31, 2008, releasing the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin whitepaper</a>. This whitepaper outlined a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. <br></p><p>Bitcoin is an open and permissionless blockchain, which makes all the information on the blockchain accessible to anyone. With complete transparency, Bitcoin ensured that network participants (miners, nodes, users) couldn’t collude to manipulate the state of the network. This total transparency also meant that anyone could verify the holdings of each address and the size of all transactions at any given time.</p> What are the benefits of transparency in blockchain? <p>Although the network supports pseudonymity, Bitcoin's transparency has arguably bolstered trust in decentralized blockchain networks, leading to the massive adoption of cryptocurrencies globally. A financial system where anyone can access every record stored on the blockchain is attractive to the everyday person, especially as trust in traditional finance models continues to erode.<br></p><p>The <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/are-bitcoin-transactions-traceable-coin-security-privacy/">transparency</a> of the Bitcoin network has also helped discourage certain criminal elements from using the blockchain. While regulators were slow to get the cryptocurrency drift, they eventually caught up and have begun to enforce regulations guiding cryptocurrency trading. Due to public blockchains’ transparency, it is easy for law enforcement agencies to track movements of illicit money and maybe tie the wallet addresses to identities. <br></p><p>Transparency, along with permissionlessness has created many blockchain enthusiasts across several sectors. Many have advocated blockchain use in online voting, an exercise that demands utmost transparency. Supply chain operations have also adopted blockchain technology to achieve transparent farm-to-shelf or manufacturing-to-consumer product lifecycle tracking. Digital ownership, decentralized identity, file storage, and other concepts have since adopted the blockchain due to its transparency.</p> The emergence of privacy-centric “Bitcoin competitors” <p>Although Bitcoin's transparency can be considered a strength, concerns over user privacy have led to the creation of several privacy-conserving solutions that aim to provide total anonymity to their users. Coin tumblers or mixers were the earliest of these methods but, as adoption grew, network congestion led to higher transaction fees, which made them too expensive to manage.<br></p>Privacy blockchains compared with public blockchains (<a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/2019-privacy-token-review-c28b6ceef637">Source</a>)<p>Then came privacy coins. These private cryptocurrencies used different cryptographic tools to shield transaction information and user identity. A famous example and one of the most successful private coins is Monero ($XMR). Monero adopted <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ring-signatures-vs-zksnarks-comparing-privacy-technologies/">ring signatures</a>, stealth addresses, and ring confidential transactions (RingCT) to provide complete anonymity to its users. Monero's success is well-known and has given rise to a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-irs-offers-a-625-000-bounty-to-anyone-who-can-break-monero-and-lightning">bounty</a> by the United States government to anyone who can crack the network’s cryptography.</p><p>Zcash came into the fray almost simultaneously, using zero-knowledge proofs and shielded transactions to provide anonymity. Zero Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zksnarks-through-the-lens-of-the-cypherpunks/">zk-SNARKs</a>) allowed users to present transaction receipts without revealing any information about the nature of the transaction and its participants. However, Zcash was not private by default like Monero, allowing users to transact without privacy at their behest.</p><p>Other privacy coins like Grin, Horizen, ARRR (Pirate Chain), and Verge have also successfully maintained blockchain privacy. However, regulators continue to subject them to scrutiny. Notably, projects like Monero and Pirate chain act in an open-source fashion with pseudonymous teams.</p> What are the downsides of transparency in blockchains? <p>As explained earlier, users have continued to raise concerns about Bitcoin's radical transparency. The primary grouse is the lack of user privacy which, albeit is already a problem for the network, can continue to increase exponentially as the network grows.</p> The threat of hackers <p>One primary problem of the lack of privacy is the exposure of individuals' financial information to bad actors. Hackers and fraudsters can easily monitor their targets' on-chain transactions and construct fraudulent schemes around the available information. </p><p>A criminal can easily access thousands of public addresses, which they can screen for potential victims. While you can view transaction records on a private blockchain solution, you cannot find any additional information on any transaction or the amounts and addresses involved. Some privacy coins like <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/">Monero</a> do not disclose wallet balances through public addresses.</p> Government suppression <p>Another challenge that blockchain transparency has led to is the common habit of government suppression through tracking and freezing crypto assets. For example, in February 2022, Canadian truckers began to protest the government's decision to make COVID-19 vaccinations compulsory for them. They even started a fundraiser towards pursuing legal action. After unsuccessful attempts to quash their peaceful protests and intentions to challenge the decision in court, the Canadian government began a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60383385">crackdown</a> on the fundraising efforts and all that contributed to it.</p>Many consider this speech by Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland on the Canadian truckers issue a demonstration of why financial privacy and autonomy are highly necessary. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ti7LryfAiF4">Source</a>).<p>In this case, not only did the government freeze regular bank accounts, but they also went after centralized cryptocurrency exchanges like <a href="https://decrypt.co/93243/kraken-cannot-protect-you-from-canadian-government-freezing-crypto-ceo">Kraken</a>, forcing them to comply with the directives to freeze crypto assets. Privacy, of course, is impossible on centralized exchanges, as they must comply with strict KYC/AML regulations. </p><p>The government also extended a similar request to <a href="https://financialpost.com/fp-finance/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-wallet-nunchuk-scolds-ontario-court-over-order-to-freeze-crypto-assets">Nunchuk's</a> self-custodial wallet provider. However, their attempt was unsuccessful as self-custodial wallets encourage privacy and do not store information on users' assets or identities.</p><p>Governments tracking the finances of their citizens or political enemies is not unheard of, and cryptocurrency transparency only makes this more accessible. When a public address is linked to your identity, the government can easily find out whatever they need to know about your financial dealings whenever they want.</p> Your privacy is important <p>Apart from the threat of hackers and government suppression, keeping your finances private is an individual right and just makes sense to most users. After all, it’s fairly rare for people to openly discuss their financial detail, let alone with strangers. </p><p>Sadly, blockchain transparency, while it serves to drive trust and accountability on the network, also exposes everything about a user's holdings, the value of their assets, and all deposits and withdrawals. Traditional bank accounts are, in fact, more private than public blockchains, as they are only privy to their owners and law enforcement agencies (on special occasions), giving the account owner some measure of privacy.</p><p>A major downside regarding privacy is the possibility of users’ identities being tied to their wallets. Once a user’s identity is tied to their wallet, it’s possible for them to be exposed to consequences (even <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/crypto-nft-owners-targeted-kidnaps-home-invasions-robberies-2022-2?IR=T">life-threatening</a> ones) since the value of the assets is open for anyone to see.</p><p>While individuals should prioritize their privacy, financial institutions dealing in crypto<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/economic-analysis-of-private-defi/"> can hardly stay ahead of the competition if </a>all the details of their trades or deals are out in the open. Transparency in blockchain robs them of any competitive advantage they may have.</p><p>Therefore, the quest for "bitcoin competitors" starts when people are yearning for privacy and freedom.</p> Who should consider privacy-maintaining blockchains <p>Private cryptocurrency solutions are becoming increasingly popular, and different categories of individuals have embraced them recently. Privacy and data security activists are one group that readily embraces the use of private cryptocurrencies. This is also helpful as it drives across a statement supporting private blockchain solutions focused on restoring users' control over their digital information.</p><p>Whistleblowers and political activists should also adopt privacy blockchain solutions, seeing that governments will never cease to scrutinize their affairs. Political activism, after all, requires financial support, especially under oppressive governments. Privacy blockchain solutions provide a clear path for ordinary people to support political activists without endangering their finances.</p><p>The case of the Canadian truckers taught a bitter lesson to communities and associations that are politically suppressed. Traditional finance, and even Bitcoin, are too open and can be turned into weapons. While Bitcoin encourages pseudonymity, most points in which it can be exchanged for official currencies require users to provide verifiable identity documents to use their services. </p><p>So-called fiat on-ramps need to comply with existing regulations such as KYC/AML that force them to freeze assets belonging to offenders. Privacy solutions, on the other hand, can help politically oppressed communities raise funds and escape any form of financial backlash due to the anonymity these protocols provide.</p><p>Financial institutions in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3">Web3</a> can also retain their competitive advantage and transact without being subject to scrutiny from competitors and regular individuals using privacy solutions. </p><p>Luckily for all the above, there are several different ways to achieve privacy and still benefit from the permissionlessness of blockchain technology.</p> Bitcoin Competitors: Methods to achieve on-chain privacy <p>Since we established the downsides of blockchain transparency and the need for privacy, let’s have a look at Bitcoin competitors that don’t compromise user privacy. </p><p>There are majorly four different mechanisms that achieve on-chain privacy. However, it’s worth noting here that although these mechanisms offer on-chain privacy that Bitcoin lacks, they come with their own set of limitations.</p><p>For example, privacy coins often have trouble with on-off ramps, miss out on some centralized exchange listings, access to the DeFi ecosystem, and so on. Similarly, other bitcoin competitors like coin mixers support only one asset type at a time and only in a determinate amount (e.g. only in batches of 1 BTC at a time per mixer), thus severely limiting their privacy prospect.</p> Method #1: Create private ways to transact (private chains) <p>The most popular method through which on-chain privacy can be achieved is by creating private chains, hosting privacy coins. Unlike public blockchain networks such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, privacy coins can offer greater transaction obscurity.</p><p>Privacy coins preserve users’ privacy by concealing sensitive information involved in transactions from the public eye. They thereby enable users to make transactions without revealing wallet addresses, transaction amounts, senders’ and receivers’ wallet addresses, etc. Some popular examples of privacy coins are Zcash and Monero.</p> Method #2: Private blockchain networks with private ecosystems <p>Private blockchain transaction networks do offer on-chain privacy but miss out in terms of offering DeFi innovation, smart contracts, or an ecosystem. Public blockchain networks, on the other hand, are massively ahead in terms of offering a range of decentralized financial services such as lending, borrowing, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stablecoin">stablecoins</a>, etc. because of smart contracts. </p>An overview of privacy solutions in crypto (<a href="https://thecontrol.co/an-overview-of-privacy-in-cryptocurrencies-893dc078d0d7">Source</a>)<p>This limits the use of privacy coins to simple transactions, making them less attractive in comparison. Solutions such as <a href="https://scrt.network/">Secret Network</a>, <a href="https://www.oasislabs.com/">Oasis Labs</a>, <a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/~buenz/papers/zether.pdf">Zether</a>, and others attempt to solve this by creating ecosystems that enable default privacy.</p><p>Offering private DeFi services is a massive leap forward in innovation when it comes to leveraging blockchain technology. DeFi services are a serious contender to Bitcoin since Bitcoin misses out on smart contract capabilities, thus lacking a DeFi ecosystem. However, Bitcoin’s inability to plug into DeFi does cause the current DeFi ecosystem to lose access to a major source of liquidity. Although this is partially solved through wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), it’s still far from reaping the full benefits of Bitcoin. </p><p>Something can be said, however, about the way private smart contract blockchains create siloed ecosystems. The most popular blockchains, albeit public, have created thriving environments which these solutions try to take users away from, creating a zero-sum game in the opinion of some.</p> Method #3: Utilizing mixers <p>Yet another way of achieving on-chain privacy on public blockchain networks such as Bitcoin is to use <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/06/20/crypto-mixers-what-are-they-how-are-they-used">coin mixers</a>. Coin mixers or tumblers allow you to make untraceable transactions while keeping your dealings away from the public eye, preserving your identity and obscuring sensitive information on the transactions you have made.</p><p>However, just like the past bitcoin competitors, they also have their disadvantages. Coin mixers have their own set of limitations and pose some unique challenges. For example, most crypto mixing services also operate in legal obscurity and might get you in trouble if your jurisdiction introduces a law against them and applies it retrospectively. Additionally, some of the models used by coin mixers can be <a href="https://protos.com/bitcoin-mixing-coinjoin-wasabi-chainalysis-samourai-privacy-wallet/">bypassed</a> with the help of blockchain forensics and analytics firms.</p> Method #4: Find a way to infuse existing systems with privacy <p>The most innovative and user-friendly way to achieve privacy without reinventing the wheel could be to infuse existing systems with privacy. This is where Panther comes into the picture, providing an on-chain privacy solution that fits right along with existing <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-defi">DeFi</a> applications.</p> Panther Protocol: Interoperable privacy for DeFi <p>Panther Protocol seeks to restore privacy and trust across different blockchain networks. The solution creates a level playing field for individuals and institutions alike, helping them foray into decentralized finance while eliminating privacy concerns.</p><p>Panther utilizes zero-knowledge proofs with zkSNARK technology, which allows users to present genuine transaction proofs while keeping sensitive details confidential. Panther also adopts a multi-asset shielding feature that breaks the on-chain trail as users deposit their assets into a pool and mint 1:1 collateralized <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-multi-asset-shielded-pools-enabling-heterogeneous-mixing-of-assets-ec165854bf0f/">zAssets</a>, which allows them to transact privately.</p><p>Unlike most privacy solutions, Panther Protocol is not limited to a particular blockchain network. Panther uniquely offers <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/interoperable-privacy-building-privacy-bridges-to-all-of-defi-2eaa89c9c7ac/">cross-chain solutions</a> with a privacy toggle, allowing users to deposit their favorite cryptocurrencies, mint the corresponding zAssets, and transact across different blockchains.</p><p>Regarding compliance, Panther Protocol balances the equation with zero-knowledge reports that allow users to share data with trusted third-party providers, thus preserving their privacy and remaining compliant with existing regulations. </p> Conclusion: Privacy might not be enough for a project to call itself a Bitcoin competitor <p>It’s impossible to draw a clear winner when it comes to whether privacy coins are truly Bitcoin competitors. On one hand, Bitcoin is the foundation of the crypto economy and the most valuable asset, keeping its crown as a market leader. Competing cryptocurrencies, private or not, on the other hand, aim to offer additional features and some advantages over Bitcoin, but are unlikely to ever take its current place.</p><p>In essence, there are no confirmed winners and losers since the crypto economy is still in a nascent stage. The market will dictate which cryptocurrency is the most useful, and it currently hasn’t decanted for privacy, although privacy proponents argue that their features are more than needed by Bitcoin. However, we may not discard the fact that Bitcoin believers might not consider these features necessary in the first place.</p><p>It seems like we will have to wait and see whether the market starts putting a higher emphasis on Layer-1 transaction privacy to make a final decision.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.<br><br>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

<p>As we conduct research into Proof-of-Stake (POS) and develop a recommendation for Zcash, an outstanding key area is how the issuance schedule for new ZEC would interact with PoS security. In this post, we take a step back from PoS itself, and analyze how issuance and fees support long-term network sustainability. We introduce a proposal, which we call the Zcash Posterity Fund (ZPF), for modifying ZEC issuance in order to improve long-term financial sustainability of the network, while maintaining the 21M ZEC supply cap and approximate issuance rate. This proposal is independent from PoS or any consensus protocol recommendations and could be adopted with the current PoW consensus protocol with the same benefits and drawbacks. We will be gathering feedback from across the Zcash ecosystem about this proposal.</p>



 Why now? 



<p>We believe this proposal could be a beneficial precursor to three promising lines of development for ZEC:</p>



  Improvements to transaction fee mechanisms can use the Zcash Posterity Fund to improve resilience and predictability of the network.  A transition to PoS can rely on this proposal to ensure key properties of the supply and issuance schedule are preserved.  New functionality such as Zcash Shielded Assets can use this proposal for new fee mechanisms that have good incentive alignment for ZEC sustainability.  



<p>Because all three of these nascent improvements are underway, we want to float this proposal now to see if it can benefit all three efforts.</p>



<p>Additionally, this proposal introduces a way to direct funds towards sustaining the network into the future, so adopting the proposal earlier enables that funding mechanism to begin accruing value earlier.</p>



 Funding the network 



<p>The core innovation of Bitcoin which all cryptocurrency inherits is that the network funds itself. In Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many public crypto networks, the built-in funding is paid out to block producers. In Zcash, this funding is split between block producers and the <a href="https://z.cash/zcash-development-and-governance/">Zcash Development Fund</a>, which contributes to education, technology development, and other activities that support and enhance ZEC.</p>



<p>Generally, funding to support a network can either come from within the protocol itself, for example in mining rewards, or from other sources, such as when an organization has raised capital elsewhere and funds development work on the protocol or products.</p>



<p>External funding is important and can have a large impact. However, there’s no guarantee when or where these sources will appear, that these funding sources have incentive alignment with ZEC holders, or that they will remain as dependable sources of funding over a longer period. For all of these reasons, we believe it’s important for ZEC users to focus on maintaining or improving the intrinsic sustainable funding mechanisms in the protocol itself.</p>



<p>This post and the Posterity Fund proposal focus on the sources and amounts of network funding and are agnostic as to the recipients, so they are applicable to the current mining &amp; Dev Fund structure of ZIP-1014, or future changes to infrastructure &amp; development funding, consensus mechanisms, or other changes to funding recipients.</p>



 The Zcash Posterity Fund 



<p>We propose a change to the Zcash issuance system we call the Zcash Posterity Fund to help reduce uncertainty about the long term sustainability of Zcash while maintaining the key properties we believe most ZEC users prioritize. The proposal maintains these properties (along with their benefits and drawbacks):</p>



  The 21M ZEC supply cap,  A disbursement rate that continuously halves every four years,  A non-discretionary issuance rate.  



<p>Meanwhile, this proposal would change these high level features from the current Zcash design:</p>



  The halving epochs would be replaced by a smoothly declining disbursement curve,  Fees which deposit into this mechanism would be distributed over time in block rewards.  



 Zcash Posterity Fund definition 



<p>The specific high level definition of the Zcash Posterity Fund proposal is as follows:</p>



<p>If the proposal is activated, a new Fund would be entirely managed by the protocol. (There are no private keys, wallets, individuals, or organizations controlling this protocol-managed Fund.)</p>



<p>The initial balance of the Fund when created is equal to the number of not-yet-issued coins, or equivalently 21M ZEC minus the current outstanding supply.</p>



<p>Starting from the block of activation, the current block reward rules no longer apply, and instead block rewards come from ZPF Disbursements.</p>



<p>The proposal does not define the recipients of disbursements, which should remain unchanged if this proposal is accepted. Meanwhile, the proposal does restrict the amount of disbursement:</p>



  Disbursements may be no more than a fixed percentage, X%, of the Fund’s current balance in a given block.  The parameter X% is calculated from the block target time so that without any incoming Fund deposits, the balance of the Fund reduces to half over a four year period.  If future changes to consensus rules alter the block target time, or other aspects of transaction finalization timing, those changes must update this X% parameter to fit the “four year half life” rule to the best practical approximation for that new protocol.  Future consensus changes should not alter the balance of the Fund other than by instituting new deposits from the extant supply.  Future consensus changes should not increase the disbursement rate X% beyond the “four year half life” rule.  



<p>The final piece of the ZPF proposal is that it now becomes possible to transfer Funds from the circulating supply back into the Fund via Deposits. Future protocol-enforced fee mechanisms may require fees to do this. This base proposal is not specific to any particular deposit mechanisms.</p>



 Visualizing changes to issuance &amp; supply schedules 



<p>If this change were adopted and there were no deposits, the disbursements would alter issuance away from halvings into a smooth curve. We can visually compare current issuance to disbursements without deposits for a hypothetical activation height:</p>


 
Current issuance vs Zcash Posterity Fund disbursements.<br>This uses a hypothetical activation height after the second halving. 


<p>If there are significant deposits into the Fund, the slope of the disbursement curve would be increased above the line shown. In any period without deposits, the curve would continue to have the same rate of exponential decay with a negative slope.</p>



<p>The impact on the overall supply schedule in the absence of deposits is barely visible at a long time scale:</p>


 
Current supply schedule vs Zcash Posterity Fund disbursements (w/out deposits).<br>This chart uses the same hypothetical activation height as the previous chart. 


<p>In the presence of deposits, the supply will always be equal or less than the line above. With sufficient deposits the supply growth rate can even become negative during that period.</p>



 The Posterity Fund and sustainability 



<p>The essential element of the Posterity Fund is to enable deposits from the circulating supply, which allows a feedback loop from current usage to future funding:</p>


 
<br>Comparing Tokenomics between status quo vs the Zcash Posterity Fund proposal 


<p>Both the status quo and this proposal have a capped supply of 21M. We can think of the proposal as introducing a single new element, deposits, which enable a feedback loop between the circulating supply and future funding.</p>



<p>This does not “solve” long term sustainability by itself, but it provides a framework that focuses the problem of sustainability on finding sufficient sources of deposits to maintain the network. If over longer time scales of years, the rate of deposits is equal to or larger than payouts, the system can run indefinitely. Meanwhile, if over shorter time spans of months or less, the deposits are below the payout rate, the protocol can weather that period for quite some time.</p>



 Sustainability of the status quo 



<p>So far the Zcash network funds itself using the Bitcoin design. New coins are issued on a schedule that approaches a limit of 21M units over time:</p>


 
<br>BTC &amp; ZEC supplies over time 


<p>The issuance over time follows the Bitcoin halving schedule design:</p>


 
<br>ZEC issuance 


 Challenges with the status quo 



<p>As newly issued coins are circulated to users, the amount of future issuance is depleted to maintain the 21M ZEC cap. As this amount dwindles, network funding must come from other sources and the only other current source is transaction fees paid directly to miners.</p>



<p>Transaction fees are dependent on transaction demand, which is highly unpredictable. We believe transaction demand can often become dominated by external events leading to spikes or troughs of usage. This may be ameliorated when there is a large diffuse network of users, but even at the scale of global economies there are extrinsic events that cause payment demand to fluctuate in a highly correlated, yet unpredictable, fashion. Anchoring the operation of the network to the unpredictability of transaction demand makes it difficult to predict how resilient the network can be, which interferes with long term committed planning. This is important for users and especially for the network infrastructure operators themselves, who need to decide how to invest capital into infrastructure improvements.</p>



<p>An additional wrinkle for Proof-of-Work and potentially other non-finalizing protocols, sometimes called “fee sniping”, is that with direct fees as the only revenue source, there’s a miner incentive to rollback blocks with large fee transactions to put those fees into their own block. This could derail safe progress of the chain.2 </p>



<p>The Zcash Posterity Fund proposal addresses this uncertainty by smoothing out disbursements over time. While it does not guarantee that deposits will be enough to maintain or grow the Fund balance to sustain the network indefinitely, it removes short term uncertainty about the rate of disbursements. This allows users, infrastructure operators, and development fund recipients to commit to longer term plans which makes the network itself more resilient.</p>



<p>These kinds of concerns, and this kind of proposal, are also present in Bitcoin and have been discussed throughout its history. The Bitcoin OpTech newsletter summarizes <a href="https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2022/07/20/">a recent discussion</a> about these issues among Bitcoin developers.</p>



 Sustainability of deposits 



<p>The Zcash Posterity Fund design reduces network sustainability to a question of sufficient deposits. If deposits over some time period are greater than disbursements, the network is “paying it forward” and supporting future operation and development. If those deposits are smaller than the disbursements, the network is depleting its resources to continue its current operation and development. So with this framework, the key focus for network sustainability is finding a design and usage that contributes sufficient deposits over time on average.</p>



<p>Deposits can come from various fees for using the network. A straightforward example would be to require a portion of current transaction fees to be deposited into the Fund with the remainder going to the miner.</p>



<p>If this proposal were adopted, the community could observe the trend of whether or not deposits over a long enough time window outpace disbursements. If they are below disbursements and there is concern about the Fund balance dwindling too low3, the community would have some amount of time to find sources of larger deposits.</p>



<p>Finding more deposits might come from a variety of strategies. We note that for any set of features, functionality, and use cases, increasing the network capacity would lower transaction fees on average, which can entice more usage of the existing use cases. So long as the existing use cases have some traction and some rate of organic growth limited only by cost, increasing network scalability may often be a good option. Aside from that general strategy, increasing usage by improving existing products and use cases, developing functionality for new use cases, and marketing to potential new users of existing use cases may all be good strategies.</p>



 Next steps 



<p>Now that we’ve shared this proposal, our intent is to gather community feedback and perform market research on this proposal. If the proposal seems to have wide support, we would build on that understanding in a few ways:</p>



  We would tailor our Proof-of-Stake research with an assumption that the Zcash Posterity Fund would constrain the design of issuance. Without obvious support for the Posterity Fund proposal, how to adapt ZEC issuance to PoS protocols remains a more open ended question.  We would begin refining this high-level proposal into a concrete Zcash Improvement Proposal.  We may produce a follow-on proposal for altering transaction fees to improve resilience, UX, and privacy, similar to <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/3473">this proposal (Zcash ticket #3473)</a>.  We would encourage new protocol proposals that impact ZEC tokenomics to consider integrating some kind of deposit mechanism. The prominent example is Zcash Shielded Assets.  



<p>Do you have feedback or questions about this proposal? Let us know by discussing in this <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/the-zcash-posterity-fund/42703">forum post</a> dedicated to the Zcash Posterity Fund proposal.</p>



 



  All of the issuance/disbursement and supply charts were generated using <a href="https://github.com/nathan-at-least/zec-issuance-plots">this code</a>.  This concern was first expressed to me by Greg Maxwell at Scaling Bitcoin in Montreal. This concern may be specific to any dynamically available protocol, and may be addressed by finalizing protocols. It may also be addressed by different fee mechanisms as this article proposes.  &nbsp;When the fund balance is large, it is probably acceptable to allow disbursements to outpace deposits: we can think of this as using a portion of the max supply to subsidize a lower cost of usage (e.g. lower transaction fees) for the current users to stimulate adoption and growth.

<p>Dear Panthers,<br></p><p>August is here. We're making steady progress, feeling confident in the results we're achieving, and improving our awareness and understanding of our surrounding environment. <br></p><p>We're thrilled to tell you everything about our work this month and what's to come, so let's jump into our monthly update.<br></p> Tech and Product  Advanced Staking <p>First of all, we're happy to share that after a successful <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wave-3-of-incentivized-advanced-staking-testing-begins-on-july-7th/">round 3</a>, smart contract testing for Advanced Staking (version 0.5 of the protocol) is now complete. With this finished, the last round of testing shall begin, leading to an upcoming <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth">DAO</a> proposal to vote for the upgrade's implementation on Polygon and the Ethereum Mainnet.<br></p><p>Similarly, we have started testing Multi-Asset Shielded Pool (MASP) NFT support. We will share more about our findings in this regard in due time.<br></p> The road to v1 <p>As mentioned above, Advanced Staking constitutes the protocol's version 0.5. This is because the components that make it possible play a fundamental structural role in Panther's design.<br></p><p>Along with Advanced Staking testing, our team has started planning the Trusted Ceremony surrounding the launch of v1 contracts. We have also commenced work on specific v1 tasks, such as developing a single-sided AMM used for users to exchange PRPs for $zZKP. <br></p><p>We plan on publishing a detailed semi-technical piece about this soon. Along with it, the necessary documentation and testing of different circuits need refining.<br></p> Ecosystem and community   Trust Wallet and Huobi integrations <p>This month, $ZKP got listed in one of the largest cross-chain wallets - <a href="https://trustwallet.com/es/">Trust Wallet</a>. Users from Trust Wallet can now store, send and receive $ZKP. <br></p><p>$ZKP also became completely available with full capabilities on <a href="https://www.huobi.com/">Huobi</a> as the exchange removed its Pioneer Zone. Non-KYC'd users can now trade $ZKP as long as they are in a non-restricted country. <br><br></p> Panther zTalks #3: Progress Towards v1, DeFi Integration, Research <br> <p>In this 3rd episode of Panther zTalks, we had Saif Akhtar (Head of Product), Andrew Zaichenko (Product Manager), Carlos Cano (Content Creation), and Joris Koopman aka ZORK (Community Manager). <br></p><p>We discussed, among other things:<br></p>  The latest news of the Panther ecosystem.  The progress of Advanced Staking testing.  Progress towards Panther’s v1.  The community's reaction to round 3 of testing.  Panther’s DeFi integration.  Interchain bridging breakthroughs.<br>  <p>Check it out:<br></p> Still leading the CoinMarketCap Community ranking<br> <p>Thanks to our community, Panther Protocol ranked 1st for the second time in the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/community/">CoinMarketCap Community</a> Rank sorting projects by engagement growth. <br></p><p>We’re also expecting to interact more with the CoinMarketCap community in the near future.<br></p> Dr. Anish Mohammed at EthCC Paris <p></p><p>Our Co-Founder, Chief Scientist, and CTO Anish Mohammed participated in EthCC Paris with his talk “Economic Analysis of Private DeFi”. In it, he breaks down the economic argument for providing privacy. He delves his strategies to understand the marginal cost of privacy, and looks at it from a few different perspectives.</p><p>If you'd prefer to read our rendition of the talk in written format, you <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/economic-analysis-of-private-defi/">can go here.</a></p>"Along with incentives, a dynamic pricing of privacy is also vital. If users have incentives to pay extra for higher privacy (therefore incentivizing strategies that provide privacy to others), it’s possible to lower the price of privacy for all, making the system more robust and attractive." AMA with Bittrex Global <p></p>An AMA you can't miss!<p>Anish also participated in an AMA with the Bittrex Global community to discuss $ZKP and DeFi privacy.

<p>On-chain coin mixing is often labelled as a nefarious service that is making it easier for criminals to hide their illicit activities. This is a gross twist of the truth, and is similar to the stigma Bitcoin has faced since its inception.In its early days, Bitcoin was used for the transaction of goods on the black market, and this association has been tied to it ever since. However, any criminal who understands Bitcoin would realize that it is perfectly traceable, and therefore a poor means to hide your activity. The reality nowadays is that cash is overwhelmingly popular for criminal transactions, and Bitcoin is not under the same scrutiny that it was before. The scrutiny is now on coin mixing services, but for the wrong reasons. These services are striving to make Bitcoin transactions as private as possible, not for the sake of criminality, but for the sake of the individual’s right to privacy. The truth is that the general population has grown accustomed to asking authorities for their privacy, when it should be the other way around, ethically speaking. Coin mixing services like Wasabi are striving to restore this constitutional right.</p><p>The core ethos behind Bitcoin promotes economic empowerment, and the rebalance of power between the individual and the state. This is a concept that is all too unfamiliar for most but is gaining traction as people have experienced their basic freedoms t being taken away during the pandemic. On top of that, out-of-control inflation is now evaporating the wealth of all those who are unaware of how to allocate their wealth properly. These are circumstances that came as a result of unbalanced centralized power at the hand of corporate and government entities. We will always need a degree of centralization in society - it’s just that we need solutions, like Bitcoin, to mitigate the excess of such. Coin mixing mitigates the extent of centralized influence over Bitcoin. If we mitigate this, then we risk not being able to benefit from what Bitcoin has to offer.</p> How do we set the record straight? <p>Not enough people understand the value proposition behind Bitcoin. If they did, then the motivation for coin mixing and coinjoin services would become much more clear. Hence, &nbsp;the first step to destigmatize these services would be through education get people thinking appropriately about Bitcoin to begin with. How to do that is the tricky part. Likely the best that any one of us can do is to keep improving our own understanding of what Bitcoin is all about, and share that with the people that are most relevant to us. Bitcoin is ultimately a shared vision, one that not one person alone will fully understand until it is a shared reality that has arrived.</p><p>The second thing we can do is to educate people about the importance of their privacy. It is understandable that this is so lost on the general population. Before the internet, it was not as easy to keep track of everyone’s activity. Now everyone keeps a computer in their pocket everywhere they go in the form of a cellphone, which means that even your physical location can be tracked at any given moment. Our technologies have seen extremely rapid progress in the 20 years since the internet started going mainstream, and public awareness has not kept up with the ramifications. What are the ramifications? As far as privacy is concerned, they are that detailed information about everyone has inevitably made it into the hands of big tech, and the nation-state powers that be. What this translates into is something approaching a surveillance-state, and the inevitable manipulation of human behavior that it allows.</p><p>A third step is to educate people on the tools they have at their disposal to maintain their privacy. These tools can be anything from using a virtual private network (VPN) service to learning how to mix your Bitcoin transactions. Coin mixing itself is a stretch for the everyday user to start using as it has been reserved for the more technologically savvy. That is why organizations like Wasabi are providing user-friendly solutions to help bridge the gap between the lack of concern people have for their privacy, and being able to access the tools they need when they realize how important their privacy really is.</p> The destigmatization of coin mixing <p>Perhaps one of the most significant drivers of change today is the increased digitization of society, which is epitomized by the advent of Bitcoin. Bitcoin represents an upgrade to the technology of money. Bitcoin also represents a form of “freedom technology” that can break us free from archaic legacy systems that have delayed humanity’s progress. Those legacy systems are clawing for survival as they face their impending downsizing. We don’t need massive corporate structures and government entities to disappear. What we need is a means to enforce an upgrade in their ethical, and practical performance. Bitcoin, as empowered by coin mixing, is one of the best tools we as the people have to enforce our demand for dramatically improved governance and leadership. </p><p>This is why it is important that coin mixing becomes destigmatized. It will take a collective effort to bring our public knowledge up to speed on the urgency of Bitcoin’s adoption, to educate people on the need for coin mixing, and to remind ourselves to take back our constitutional right to privacy. The sooner we can get our heads straight about respecting our own privacy, and the truth behind Bitcoin, the sooner humanity break free from the trappings of the past.<br></p>

 Shade Protocol — Bonds Audit&nbsp;Complete <p>Greetings community,</p><p>Shade Protocol development has continued to progress rapidly with core contracts set to be launched on Secret Network mainnet in fall of 2022. Prior to the launch of the mainnet contracts, Shade Protocol will be releasing Shade Bonds — a privacy-preserving DeFi instrument where users can purchase digital assets from the ShadeDAO by depositing protocol desired cryptocurrencies into a smart contract.</p><blockquote><a href="https://docs.shadeprotocol.io/shade-protocol/apps/bonds">Learn About Shade&nbsp;Bounds</a></blockquote><p>Bonds are a powerful mechanism by which the ShadeDAO will be able to grow its set of protocol owned assets which can then be utilized to generate liquidity for Shade Apps as well as yield for the protocol. Because bonds are capable of directly interacting with the minting contracts for <a href="https://docs.shadeprotocol.io/shade-protocol/apps/silk">SILK</a> and <a href="https://docs.shadeprotocol.io/shade-protocol/">SHD</a> as well as the accrued ShadeDAO treasury assets, the security of the bonds smart contracts are of the upmost importance.</p><a href="https://www.certik.com/">https://www.certik.com/</a><p>Because of our insistence on putting security first, the core protocol contributors are proud to have partnered with <a href="https://www.certik.com/">Certik</a> to have the bonds smart contracts audited for vulnerabilities.</p> Audit <a href="https://www.certik.com/projects/shade-protocol">https://www.certik.com/projects/shade-protocol</a><p>Linked below is the full pdf of the Certik’s Bond audit findings:</p><p><a href="https://2763075352-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FGSBEdPwWy2UsGV3OHPY5%2Fuploads%2FTCcsJl0kZ2khV5Xu34AH%2FBonds.pdf?alt=media&amp;token=6e3fdd9b-0601-42b8-86a6-fa9b8d9f3a34">Full Audit&nbsp;PDF</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/securesecrets/shade/tree/dev/contracts/bonds">Github Code Under&nbsp;Audit</a></p> Findings <p>The Certik security assessment was completed August 1st, 2022. The vulnerability found 1 major, 1 medium, and 2 minor vulnerabilities.</p><p>The major vulnerability was tied to the centralization of bond issuance — because bond issuance is such a powerful mechanism, the auditors were concerned around the centralization of permissioning tied to issuance:</p><p>These centralization concerns will be resolved with the launch of Shade Protocol Governance on mainnet in the fall. The admin role that Certik observed as having direct power over bonds will be directly controlled by Shade Protocol token governance.</p><p>The medium vulnerability was tied to an assumption on oracle price decimals — if the oracle returns an unexpected amount of decimals, there is a chance for dangerous behavior to occur with the interaction between the bonds contract and the depositor.</p><p>Shade Protocol resolves this concern as the handling of inconsistent decimal amount are handled via the Shade Oracle (not the bonds contract) — the oracle will execute the logic to convert data feeds to 18 decimals so that any contract that interacts with the oracle can expect a consistent 18 decimal wrapping, thus resolving this specific&nbsp;concern.</p><p>A minor vulnerability was tied to a lack of input validation which could result in unexpected behavior at&nbsp;runtime.</p><p>The team resolved this concern via the inclusion of the following:</p>contract.rshandle.rshandle.rs<p>The last minor vulnerability was tied to logic dependencies leveraged by oracle, shade admin, issued_asset, and airdrop. Certik advised careful examination of the security of these functional dependencies. This risk was acknowledged by the&nbsp;team.</p> Conclusion <p>With the completion of the Shade Bonds audit, Shade Protocol aims to release the next 10% of the SHD airdrop — launching side by the side with bonds. Front-end UI/UX are the final piece to be completed in order for bonds and part two of the airdrop to be released.</p><p>Shade Protocol puts the security of users above all else, which is why we will continue to internally and externally audit all key contracts that are part of the Shade Protocol&nbsp;suite.</p><blockquote>Speed is great, but accuracy is&nbsp;final.</blockquote><p>We look forward to safely launching bonds — the first of many core privacy-preserving products to be launched by Shade Protocol.</p> Join The Shade Protocol Community <p><a href="https://docs.shadeprotocol.io/shade-protocol/">Documentation</a> | <a href="https://shadeprotocol.io/">Website</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/Shade_Protocol">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/ShadeProtocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://medium.com/@shadeprotocoldevs">Medium</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/kBRQJRsP">Discord</a></p>

<p>The purpose of this document is to give an objective comparison between blockchain-related technologies and the ID ecosystem. We compare and contrast the differences and similarities between the two technologies and in so doing, we hope this document will help the reader gain a deeper understanding of the mechanics behind the ID ecosystem.</p><p>When we refer to blockchain, we are mainly referring to Bitcoin and Ethereum-based technologies, although many of the comments apply to Blockchain in&nbsp;general.</p><blockquote>A pdf version of this article in tabular format can be found on our website&nbsp;<a href="https://idz.com/downloads/comparison-blockchain-vs-the-ID-ecosystem.pdf">here</a>.</blockquote> Blockchain vs ID Ecosystem  Interoperability <p>Blockchain</p><p>Different blockchains have different algorithms and protocols. A token on one network doesn’t work on the&nbsp;others.</p><p>For example, to use Bitcoin on Ethereum, you need Wrapped Bitcoin. To use ETH on Polygon, you need&nbsp;WETH.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>All ID clouds have the same structure. The user experience is coherent wherever users&nbsp;go.</p><p>For example, if a user uses IDZ as the ID provider and switches to another provider later, s/he will continue to be able to use the same assets as if nothing&nbsp;changed.</p> Speed <p>Blockchain</p><p>Transactions are not instant with blockchain as they need to be verified, included in new blocks and distributed to other blockchain nodes.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Transactions are instant as there is no need to incorporate them into blocks and perform&nbsp;mining.</p> User Experience <p>Blockchain</p>  Given that the different networks are not interoperable, the user experience is affected.  Given that the network speed is dependent on the transaction volume, throughput fluctuates according to the network&nbsp;status.  <p>ID Ecosystem</p>  User experience is always coherent not reliant on the ID provider the user&nbsp;uses.  Performance is always consistent as the system can scale dynamically in line with&nbsp;demand.   Scalability <p>Blockchain</p><p>Blockchain is not scalable. Data is only getting heavier and even with faster computers and processors, blockchain will never manage to reach the desired balance between scalability, speed and security. Centralised off-chain solutions become a necessity for the network to be functional.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Given that the ID ecosystem is cloud-based and interoperable, it is scalable.</p><p>For example, any new provider can scale the same open-source architecture without affecting the user experience.</p> Security <p>Blockchain</p>  Transactions are secure. Security keys are in the user’s&nbsp;wallet.  Users can enhance the security by using a hardware or a cold&nbsp;wallet.  No measure of transaction security. When a transaction is signed by a wallet, there is no record of the type of wallet used (whether it is browser-based, app, hardware, etc.).  Some wallets operate in browsers as plug-ins. This imposes security risks, as browsers don’t typically contain technology to allow the secure storage of user-sensitive data.  <p>ID Ecosystem</p>  Transactions are secure. Security keys are with the&nbsp;user.  Users can enhance the security by buying an IDZ enabled&nbsp;device.  ZINDEX (or security index) enables users to set different levels of security from low to&nbsp;extreme.  IDs operate as standalone apps.   Privacy <p>Blockchain</p><p>Transactions are public by&nbsp;nature.</p><p>For example, users can check each other’s balances and&nbsp;assets.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Transactions are private by&nbsp;nature.</p><p>For example, users can’t check each other’s balances and&nbsp;assets.</p> Cost Structure <p>Blockchain</p>  Gas fee to miners, i.e., cost per transaction. The fees could add up to high figures depending on the user’s activity during busy&nbsp;times.  Different services can have additional subscription tokens, nonetheless, gas fees are unavoidable.  <p>ID Ecosystem</p>  Subscription fee to ID cloud provider, i.e., all in one fee. No gas&nbsp;fees.  Different services can have additional subscription assets. No gas fees&nbsp;payable.  IDZ envisages that all products and services will become subscription-based in the near future, all manageable from within one’s&nbsp;ID.   Environmental Impact <p>Blockchain</p><p>Blockchains that utilise proof of work algorithms are notoriously resource-intensive and require an ever-increasing amount of computing power. This has a detrimental impact on the environment.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>ID ecosystem transactions are environmentally efficient because there is no need to perform CPU-intensive work to verify transactions.</p> Data Storage <p>Blockchain</p>  Blockchains (not wallets) store links/pointers to the data that is stored in different off-chain data storage solutions (such as&nbsp;IPFS).  While pointers to the data are difficult to find, they are made public on the blockchain.  IPFS networks break the content to “small parts” and store it in “un-encrypted”. If any of the IPFS servers that hold any part of the data goes offline, and there are no copies of the data (unless complex IPFS-clusters are utilised), users will not be able to access their&nbsp;content.  <p>ID Ecosystem</p>  IDs store the actual data&nbsp;itself.  Third parties (not the users) have pointers to the user’s data which never leaves his/her&nbsp;ID.  The content is stored encrypted as one piece (i.e., not broken to small&nbsp;parts).   Ownership Definition <p>Blockchain</p><p>Blockchain networks define ownership according to the following principles:</p>  Storage: the data sits in storage network (e.g., IPFS), not with the user. Users own pointers to access the data. Users can share these pointers with third&nbsp;parties.  Encryption: user assets are not typically encrypted and instead stored “off-chain”.  Keys with the&nbsp;user.  Open source.  Always immutable.  Public by default. Blockchain could be private if used by companies (i.e., not for public&nbsp;need).  Decentralisation of nodes and&nbsp;miners.  <p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>IDZ defines ownership according to the following principles:</p>  Storage: the data sits on the user’s device or a cloud space fully controlled by the user. Users can give third parties access to the&nbsp;data.  Encryption: asset encryption with unique keys for the whole ecosystem. The data always sits encrypted with the user as one piece, not elsewhere. Users can share access to the data with third parties. For example, in Exchange App, the app only stores pointers to the data which never leaves the ID without the user’s consent. <a href="https://idz.com/use-cases#exchange">Refer to the Exchange use-case.</a>  Keys with the&nbsp;user.  Open-source.  Immutability is optional (depending on access rights). Having the immutability optional ensures flexibility which in return ensures better&nbsp;control.  Always private.  Full control (see&nbsp;below).   Control <p>Blockchain</p>  Wallet address doesn’t store any actual data. It only keeps the links to the data stored elsewhere. Users’ data doesn’t sit with&nbsp;them.  Non-programmer users can’t create crypto assets and smart contracts by themselves.  You can’t delete data on blockchains. It will always be there. If someone manages to get hold of your seed phrase, they can always access the data. If a person passes away, his/her data will forever be on the network with a seed phrase that can decrypt&nbsp;it.  Re-keying of the seed phrase is not possible. If the seed phrase is compromised, users need to move all the assets to another wallet as quickly as possible.  You can’t migrate your wallet address to another network. For example, you can’t use your ETH address on Solana&nbsp;network.  Zero knowledge is optional and rarely utilised as the data is&nbsp;public.  <p>ID Ecosystem</p>  Users give access to apps to use certain data in their ID as opposed to apps giving users access to the data they store for them. Users can manage access to apps at any time. If a user never uses an app again, the data will always be with him and he will not leave any data in any unwanted&nbsp;places.  Non-programmer users can create any assets or contracts in seconds by themselves without the need of any third&nbsp;party.  You can delete the data in your ID. A person can even write a “will” that will trigger the deletion of the data with erasure at a given time in the&nbsp;future.  Re-keying is possible.  You can import, export or migrate your ID and data as you&nbsp;like.  Zero-knowledge is inherent in the ID ecosystem. Assets are encrypted with unique keys under the control of the&nbsp;user.   Decentralisation Definition <p>Blockchain</p><p>Blockchain networks believe that active decentralisation is a prerequisite for data ownership and&nbsp;control.</p><p>Decentralisation is mainly defined as the decentralisation of the machines that process that&nbsp;data.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>IDZ believes that decentralisation is a passive outcome for ownership and control of&nbsp;data.</p><p>Decentralisation is mainly defined as the ability to conduct any transaction peer-to-peer, without the involvement of any external parties. It implies centralising all the powers in the users’&nbsp;hands.</p> Crypto Wallet vs&nbsp;ID  Default name <p>Blockchain</p><p>Wallet addresses are impossible to remember, and users need to copy and paste&nbsp;them.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>IDs are memorable by default. However, user can choose an address-style ID to make it impossible to remember.</p> Vanity names <p>Blockchain</p><p>Can be purchased as an&nbsp;NFT.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Can be purchased as an&nbsp;asset.</p> Identity concept <p>Blockchain</p><p>Avatars to be used in the Metaverse and unique usernames.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>You are your data. ALL your data IS you. Not limited to just avatars and usernames. IDs are for the real world, not only the Metaverse.</p> Identification <p>Blockchain</p>  Federated (using wallet address).  A signed asset can be used as an identifier (e.g., using a certain asset to grant access to an account/channel).  <p>ID Ecosystem</p>  Federated (using the&nbsp;ID).  ‘Identify’ and share an Asset as an identifier (e.g., using a certain asset to grant access to an account/channel).  <p>IDZ envisages that the terms &amp; conditions of websites and apps will become a contract which governs the exchange of certain assets between IDs (between the user and the service).</p> Offline accessibility <p>Blockchain</p><p>Not applicable.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>You can encrypt your files and save them locally only. You can always access your local file even if you are&nbsp;offline.</p> Portability <p>Blockchain</p><p>Wallet addresses are tied to the network. <br> <br> For example, you can’t migrate your Solana address to use it on the Ethereum&nbsp;network.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>IDs are not tied to the ID provider. They can be portable given that ID clouds have the same structure.</p> Purpose of&nbsp;use <p>Blockchain</p><p>Wallet addresses are developed to be used with decentralised networks&nbsp;only.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>IDs are developed to be used with all services, websites and apps, centralised or decentralised.</p> Corporate ID management <p>Blockchain</p><p>Not applicable.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Corporates can create IDs and assign them to employees. These IDs can contain all the necessary data for the employees to perform their duties (files, access to apps, access to offices, business expenses, etc.).</p><p><a href="https://idz.com/use-cases#employment">Check the employment agreement — Optimal corporate experience.</a></p> Funds excessiveness &amp; leftovers   To purchase tokens, you need to have excess funds in your wallet to proceed. So, if an asset is $10 and the gas is $0.5, you need $10.75 to&nbsp;proceed.  After purchasing an asset, users are often left with leftover funds in their wallets which can’t be&nbsp;used.  <p>ID Ecosystem</p>  To purchase an asset, you need the exact amount of currency asset in your ID to proceed. If an asset is $10, you only need $10 to&nbsp;proceed.  You can use a definite number to buy a fixed-price asset without leaving any leftovers in the&nbsp;ID.   Crypto Assets vs&nbsp;Assets  Nature and&nbsp;type <p>Blockchain</p><p>Crypto assets are public and unstructured. They need programming knowledge to be created unless a platform (e.g., OpenSea) is used to create them. This limits the size of the asset universe.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Assets are private and structured. The structure is public for all (see below). No need for programming knowledge to create any kind of asset. Consequently, the asset universe is unlimited. Anything can be an asset, whether it is public or private. For example, user’s music files, consultancy services, pictures, browsing history, health data from wearables, medical records,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Most notably, there is a chat asset so users can own and control their communication.</p> Hardware as an&nbsp;asset <p>Blockchain</p><p>Not applicable.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Assets can be anything even hardware devices. 01 watch is the first hardware asset in the ID ecosystem. Users need to own the digital asset for the physical watch to be&nbsp;active.</p> Asset connectivity <p>Blockchain</p><p>Assets are independent of each&nbsp;other.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Assets talk to each other. If you make changes to one asset, all the other assets which are linked to it will change&nbsp;too.</p><p>For example, if your bank and school get your address from your utility provider (e.g., electricity company), they can use it in their assets. A change in the address held by the utility provider causes the address to change elsewhere. <a href="https://idz.com/use-cases#future-hotel">Refer to the hotel use case&nbsp;example</a>.</p> Structure <p>Blockchain</p><p>Assets don’t follow a public structure.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Asset structure is public, allowing users&nbsp;to:</p>  Create standard assets by simply populating fields (e.g., loyalty cards, tickets).  Request specific properties in known assets (e.g., requesting age property from the driving license&nbsp;asset).   Biometric assets <p>Blockchain</p><p>Not applicable.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Biometric assets ensure that only genuine owners can activate and use these assets. No one else other than the genuine user him/herself can use these assets. This has the following benefits:</p>  <a href="https://idz.com/use-cases#passport">Official identification: passport use&nbsp;case.</a>  <a href="https://idz.com/use-cases#signing">Binding agreement: digital signature use&nbsp;case</a>  Apostille service elimination: no need for official witnesses anymore.   Mutability <p>Blockchain</p><p>Not applicable.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Yes, if&nbsp;desired.</p><p>For example, the fitness asset gets updated on a regular basis by the data it receives from the different wearables that collect the user’s fitness data, r<a href="https://idz.com/use-cases#doctor">efer to the “at the doctor” use&nbsp;case.</a></p> Asset as a&nbsp;message <p>Blockchain</p><p>Not applicable.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Users can chat with each other by creating chat assets. In the chat asset, they can send and receive text, files, assets and contracts.</p> Crypto Smart Contracts vs Contracts  Structure <p>Blockchain</p>  Crypto smart contracts rely on code. Programming knowledge is necessary for users to be able to build them. They are complicated for non-programmer users.  For two parties who don’t have any programming experience, a third external party is a&nbsp;must.  <p>ID Ecosystem</p>  ID ecosystem contracts rely on pre-built formulas and models. Users can select from the dropdown lists the IDs and assets involved and build contracts in&nbsp;seconds.  No external third parties are required when building a contract between two parties who don’t have any programming knowledge.   External information in contracts <p>Blockchain</p>  Users can use Oracles to insert external variables in their code which would affect the valuation or execution of the contracts.  Oracles are complicated for non-programmer users, as they need relevant coding experience.  <p>ID Ecosystem</p>  Users can use the key-value-pair section to insert variables in their formulas and models which would affect the valuation or execution of the contracts.  Anyone can use and developers can contribute to the key-value-pair page   Transparency <p>Blockchain</p>  Crypto smart contracts are complex for non-programmers. Only developers can know the possible outcomes of a contract if they decide to dig into the&nbsp;code.  Given that it is not necessary for the contract code to be published on blockchain explorers, users must trust the developer who created the contract.  <p>ID Ecosystem</p>  Contracts are transparent for all users. No grey areas in the middle. Users can know all the possible outcomes of a contract in&nbsp;advance.  For example, if a tenant wants to check all his rights before and after signing the rent contract, he can simply check all the formulas included in the contract, what he can and can’t do, and what the landlord can and can’t do, all without needing to read a whole legal agreement.   Mutability <p>Blockchain</p><p>Crypto smart contracts are immutable.</p><p>For example, if a contract between an employer and employee needs to be amended to reflect a pay rise, a new contract needs to be written from&nbsp;scratch.</p><p>Ethereum supports smart contract versioning.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Contracts are mutable with the consent of all parties involved.</p><p>For example, if a contract between an employer and employee needs to be amended to reflect a pay rise, they can simply amend the old contract.</p><p>ID cloud providers support contract versioning.</p><p>Users can also build immutable contracts if they&nbsp;wish.</p> Escrow and binary execution <p>Blockchain</p><p>Non-programmer users can’t check which assets the contract requests and/or sends to&nbsp;them.</p><p>Many users fall victims to scam contracts which drain all their wallets without sending any assets in&nbsp;return.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Contracts act in a binary manner that ensures justice for all parties involved.</p><p>For example, check the exchange use&nbsp;case.</p> Contract as a&nbsp;message <p>Blockchain</p><p>Not applicable.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Users can chat with each other by creating chat assets. In the chat asset, they can send and receive text, files, assets and contracts. Contracts can be executed on the spot inside the&nbsp;chat.</p> Privacy <p>Blockchain</p><p>Crypto smart contracts are&nbsp;public.</p><p>For example, if a user sells his house, all users could know about&nbsp;it.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Contracts are&nbsp;private.</p><p>For example, if a user sells his house, the information is kept private, not available to the&nbsp;public.</p> Speed of execution <p>Blockchain</p>  Crypto smart contracts are slow as they need to be verified by different nodes.  Users can get scammed by a contract that requires all assets at once, as they can’t verify the code and the assets involved.  <p>ID Ecosystem</p>  Execution is&nbsp;instant.  Full execution of the whole contract (regardless of the number of assets involved) is one click away. Users can check all the assets involved before they share. Check the cinema use&nbsp;case.   Identity verification in contracts <p>Blockchain</p><p>Not applicable.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p>  Biometric assets can be used to sign contracts. This ensures users it is really the genuine people who are signing the contract as they are the only ones who are able to use these&nbsp;assets.  For example, a user can use a biometric passport asset issued by a government body which only s/he can activate/use to sign a contract.   Contract execution by&nbsp;hardware <p>Blockchain</p><p>No.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Yes.</p><p>For example, a user can unlock his/her car (i.e., execute the contract that governs locking/unlocking the car) with his 01&nbsp;watch.</p> Payment reference and discount&nbsp;coupons <p>Blockchain</p><p>There is no payment reference, so users rely on the transaction hash to confirm the payment. It will not be viable to rely on transaction hash if blockchain were to be adopted by all&nbsp;people.</p><p>Some services offer “notes” with payment, these notes are usually public and subject to&nbsp;abuse.</p><p>Users can’t apply discount coupons for the assets they want to purchase. Early adopters of a token can’t benefit from a discount that applies to them&nbsp;only.</p><p>ID Ecosystem</p><p>Payment references are available and&nbsp;private</p><p>Discount coupons are available and&nbsp;private.</p>

Together, we hope to create an interoperable — and private — future for&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>LayerZero, an omnichain interoperability protocol, powers Omni X. It allows Omni X to “launch new omnichain NFT collections, wrap existing NFTs into omnichain equivalents and buy any NFT from one network while paying for it from another,” according to a recent<a href="https://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/omni-x-launches-website-and-announces-omnichain-nft-marketplace-beta"> press release</a>.

NFTs are usually trapped on the chain on which they are minted, which could be disastrous for use cases like credentialization, financial instruments, and proof of ownership.</p><p>Using public blockchains means they can’t provide the necessary privacy to protect user data and business secrets, and without interoperability, many future use cases won’t be practical. But by building together, Findora and Omni X can create a revolutionary new infrastructure for NFTs that provide the foundation for the next generation of NFT use&nbsp;cases.</p> Cheers to the&nbsp;Future! <p>Findora is a leader in Web3 privacy through advanced zero-knowledge cryptography, and though Omni X has just launched, we’ve been impressed by what we’ve seen.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Today we’re releasing an update for our desktop browser (v1.42), which includes two exciting additions that give Brave Wallet users more choice with crypto transactions:</p>
 
 
<p>Aurora, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) built on the NEAR protocol, is now available as a preloaded blockchain for all Brave Wallet users, enabling access to fast, low-fee transactions</p>
 
 
<p>Desktop Wallet users can now purchase the Basic Attention Token (BAT) on Solana and Polygon, via the Ramp network</p>
 
 

 Aurora EVM now available as a preloaded blockchain&nbsp; 
<p>First announced at <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus2022/">Coindesk Consensus</a>, Brave is offering more choice to Brave Wallet users with the addition of a new pre-loaded chain: <a href="https://aurora.dev/">Aurora</a>, an <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/">Ethereum L2</a> that taps into the scalability of the <a href="https://near.org/">NEAR protocol</a>. Aurora provides up to 1000x lower gas fees, and up to 50x faster transactions than Ethereum.</p>
<p>As an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), Aurora offers a familiar user experience and compatibility with dozens of <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/">ERC-20 assets</a>. It also brings higher throughput at near zero-cost transactions, allowing users to take full advantage of new, more sophisticated <a>decentralized apps</a> (DApps). This means more accessible DeFi and <a>NFTs</a>, and better DApp discovery for Brave Wallet users.</p>
<p>Users can easily bridge to Aurora via the <a href="https://rainbowbridge.app/transfer">Rainbow Bridge</a>, which currently offers the ability to transfer tokens to / from NEAR, Aurora, and Ethereum. Once assets have been transferred to Aurora, users will find popular decentralized protocols and DApps that have been deployed on the network—such as <a href="https://curve.fi/">Curve</a>, <a href="https://dodoex.io/">DODO</a>, <a href="https://gnosis-safe.io/">Gnosis Safe</a>, and <a href="https://beefy.finance/">Beefy Finance</a>—and new native products like <a href="https://bastionprotocol.com/">Bastion</a> and <a href="https://www.trisolaris.io/">Trisolaris</a>. Together, these protocols have amassed $258M in total value locked (TVL) in smart contracts on Aurora.</p>
<p>As the Aurora ecosystem evolves, Brave’s native token (BAT) will also become available for use in DeFi via integrations in decentralized exchanges, lending markets, and more. We also have plans to bring Aurora network token swaps and streamlined bridging to Brave Wallet. Stay tuned!</p>

 Buy BAT on Solana and Polygon, via Ramp 
<p>In today’s desktop release, we’re also adding more ways for Brave Wallet users to buy the <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">Basic Attention Token</a> (BAT), via our partnership with <a href="https://ramp.network/">Ramp</a>. Wallet users can now buy wrapped BAT on <a href="https://solana.com/">Solana</a> and <a href="https://polygon.technology/">Polygon</a> using the fiat-to-crypto feature, powered by Ramp.</p>


    


    

 
     
        
        
        
        
     
 
<p>By expanding the number of chains that support BAT, we’re continuing to grow the scope of the attention economy beyond the native use case of <a>Brave Rewards</a>. With each new partnership, BAT becomes easier and more flexible in DeFi and crypto marketplaces.</p>
<p>Ramp’s mission is to make Web3 accessible for all by offering fiat-to-crypto buying solutions in 140 countries and for <a href="https://support.ramp.network/en/articles/432-supported-crypto-assets">more than 45 assets</a>. Together, Brave and Ramp are making the process of buying crypto easier than ever, with affordable options and a streamlined user experience.</p>

 Follow our Wallet Partner announcements 
<p>Brave will announce <a>new partnerships</a> and integrations—and introduce new utility for both Wallet and BAT—almost every month. Stay tuned for more updates.</p>
<p>Not using Brave Wallet yet? It’s easy to get started…</p>
<p>If you already use the Brave browser, just click the  in the address bar. If you’re not using Brave, <a>download it for desktop, Android, or iOS</a>, and ditch Big Tech for good. It only takes 60 seconds to switch.</p>

<blockquote><p>Is Meta monopolising the Metaverse? Mark Zuckerberg is being criticised by industry experts for potentially trying to take over the whole virtual reality industry.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recently filed a complaint against the tech giant for acquiring Within, the company that produced the VR game Supernatural. The reason behind the case was that Meta already owned the ever-so-popular VR game Beat Saber, which very well could have been a direct competition to Supernatural.</p></blockquote>



<p>The recent decision of the FTC to file a complaint against Meta has raised various reactions, and Mark Zuckerberg’s company denied the charges by claiming that “the FTC case is based on ideology and speculation, not evidence.”</p>



<p>Contacted by EM360, our CEO and founder, Kavya Pearlman, commented that “Looking at this case in isolation and the surface level may lead to the conclusion that it is just a normal case of Merger &amp; Acquisition (M&amp;A). But to understand why this type of acquisition is detrimental to building healthy competition, we have to dig deeper into Meta’s acquisition and other anti-competitive practices”.</p>



<p>Kristina Podnar, chair of the <a href="https://metaverserealitycheck.org/">Metaverse Reality Check</a>, welcomed FTC’s efforts to keep the Metaverse a fair playing field where all the companies, big or small, have an equal opportunity to progress. “I welcome FTC’s action as I see it as coming at a critical time with regards to frontier technologies,” says Kristina. “Most governments are challenged to define and sustain a sound regulatory framework that balances business creativity and innovation with citizen privacy and safety.”</p>

Research is ongoing to explore different approaches, including the use of Single User Reply Blocks as well as the concept of drop boxes. Finally, now that the network is live, work on mixnet parametrisation has been kickstarted, to ensure that the mixing delay, volume of cover traffic, packet size and placement of the mix nodes within layers provide optimal privacy for the Nym users at the current stages of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>If you want a run-down of the many events our team members attended during the summer, make sure to check out our recent <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-summer-events-recap-9d199bb21bac">blog&nbsp;post</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-july-updates-d4f975bee0b0">Nym July Updates</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>For Team Nym this summer has been hot in more ways than one. We have been busy building the privacy infrastructure and ecosystem of the future (<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/announcing-nym-shipyard-136fcb93fcb5">launching Shipyard</a>, <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-wallet-release-1-0-7-a331869d30c7?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------">introducing new wallet release</a>s, <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/announcing-nymconnect-in-beta-f84ed8598f26">launching NymConnect</a>, continuously fine tuning the reward sharing parameters of our mixnet), but we’ve also continued our efforts to contribute to the global privacy conversation both online and in&nbsp;person.</p><p>Here’s a roundup of Nym’s privacy&nbsp;summer.</p> 1. Crypto Valley Conference <p>On the third of June COO Alexis Roussel was talking about DAOs and privacy On the Crypto Valley Conference in&nbsp;Zurich.</p> 2. RightsCon <p><a href="http://rightscon.org">RightsCon</a> is the world’s leading summit on human rights in the digital age. This year Chelsea Manning and Harry Halpin were in conversation with Melissa Chan, where they discussed mixnets, the future of privacy, and the implications of new technologies for whistleblowers.</p><p>Watch the event back here: <a href="https://youtu.be/YVgTSgRHyVA">https://youtu.be/YVgTSgRHyVA</a></p> 3. Monerokon <p><a href="https://monerokon.com/">Monerokon</a> is an annual meeting of privacy advocates, cypherpunks, scientists, and philosophers and is designed to disseminate scientific and technical advances in privacy and financial technologies. This year Max Hampshire represented Nym at the event and gave a talk at the lightning session.</p><p>Watch it back here: <a href="https://youtu.be/qGIUZVTM1dc">https://youtu.be/qGIUZVTM1dc</a></p> 4. PETS <p>The annual <a href="https://petsymposium.org/">Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS)</a> brought together experts from around the world to present and discuss recent advances and new perspectives on privacy technologies. The 22nd PETS was a hybrid event with a physical gathering held in Sydney, Australia, and a concurrent virtual event hosted by the Macquarie University Cyber Security Hub. Nym is a proud sponsor of the event, and Nym CFO Andrei Serjantov gave an opening&nbsp;speech.</p><p>We also had a virtual booth during the event, where online participants could interact with us and learn more about&nbsp;Nym.</p> 5. CDPC Conference LatAm <p>It was fantastic to see the <a href="https://cpdp.lat/en/latin-american-conference-on-artificial-intelligence-and-data-protection/">CPDP Conference in Latin America</a> underscoring the importance of privacy as a global issue. NCPDP LatAm 2022 was dedicated to “Artificial Intelligence and Data Protection in Latin America“ and we were happy to participate in&nbsp;it.</p><p>Nym was on the opening plenary and hosted a panel titled “Tackling surveillance and its business model” with our CEO Harry Halpin and Nym advisers Renata Avila, CEO of the Open Knowledge Foundation, and Andrés Araúz, candidate in last year’s Ecuadorian presidential race. It was a pleasure to share this panel with Rafael Bonifaz, Sally Burch, Octavio Rossell and Gustavo&nbsp;Amaturo.</p> 6. Festival der&nbsp;Zukunft <p>The <a href="https://www.festivalderzukunft.com/english.html">Festival of the Future</a> in Munich is an event for visionaries, entrepreneurs, scientists, artists, nerds, creatives, experts, and optimists who care about the&nbsp;future.</p><p>It took place at the Deutsches Museum — one of the world’s largest science and technology museums and one of the leading locations for technical and scientific culture. The new Forum of the Future was a creative meeting place with a VRLab, changing special exhibitions, and spectacular events. The focus of the event was on experiencing and trying out high-tech innovations and finding joint answers to the question: which innovations will make the planet a better&nbsp;place?</p><p>Nym’s Security Consultant Chelsea Manning gave a well-received presentation at the festival, and Nym was delighted to have a presence&nbsp;there.</p> 7. Hope&nbsp;2022 <p>At the end of July Nym was in New York for <a href="https://www.hope.net/">HOPE 2022</a>, which celebrated the contributions of scientists, educators, and technologists during the extraordinary upheaval of the last three&nbsp;years.</p><p>Ahmed Ghappour, General Counsel at Nym Technologies, led a workshop at the event, presenting a brief overview of the history of the successes and failures of privacy in cryptocurrency and blockchain. He also demonstrated the tracing and de-anonymization of actual transactions in real time, and presented tools and techniques for guaranteeing strong&nbsp;privacy.</p> Wondering where you can meet us&nbsp;next?  BIP001 <p>On July 28–29, Nym is heading to BIP001 (Partisan Edition) in Ukraine to support the local community in these difficult times!</p><p>Our COO Alexis Roussel will give a presentation on the topic: “Mixnets, the right to anonymity, and the future of democracy” on the 29th of July in Uzhgorod.</p><p>Join us!

<p>Our plan for delivering ABCI++</p><p>The Tendermint project is one which, relative to other software in the space, is long in the tooth. While Tendermint remains the industry standard in consensus engines, its journey has seen many iterations of the core development team. This lack of continuity has led to subsequent knowledge loss, the latest playing a key role in the <a href="https://medium.com/the-interchain-foundation/discontinuing-tendermint-v0-35-a-postmortem-on-the-new-networking-layer-3696c811dabc">discontinued v0.35&nbsp;release</a>.</p><p>In response to this, a group of experienced Tendermint contributors, from across the Cosmos Ecosystem, have formed the Tendermint Council. The Council’s objective is to accelerate development, guide product direction and provide continuity for Tendermint, working alongside both users and core contributors.</p><p>The immediate focus of the Council is the delivery of the much anticipated ABCI++. This is a collection of ergonomic changes to the interface between the application and Tendermint that will give the application far greater control of how the consensus engine conducts state machine replication. More information of what exactly ABCI++ does and what it unlocks will be released in a subsequent blog&nbsp;post.</p><p>The new release structure will start with getting the lowest risk pieces of ABCI++ into the hands of users first. PrepareProposal and ProcessProposal methods will be delivered on top of v0.34 as the next release. We aim to begin integrating this release with the Cosmos SDK within the next couple of weeks. This will be followed by FinalizeBlock and the vote extension logic.</p><p>Our goal is to fully deliver ABCI++ by the end of 2022, while focusing on quality of life improvements, performance and stability. As part of this, we have decided to <a href="https://medium.com/the-interchain-foundation/discontinuing-tendermint-v0-35-a-postmortem-on-the-new-networking-layer-3696c811dabc">discontinue support of v0.35</a>. Features from v0.35, such as the improvements to state sync and the storage engine, will slowly be assessed and ported into upcoming releases.</p><p>Follow the latest developments of Tendermint on&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/discussions">GitHub</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/the-tendermint-council-and-the-path-to-delivering-abci-d6deb9e0fc7f">The Tendermint Council and the path to delivering ABCI++</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network">Cosmos Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Tl:dr: We’re launching Ethereum staking to US domestic institutional clients on Coinbase Prime. Using our industry-leading cold storage, clients can now generate yield by staking&nbsp;ETH.</p><p>By Aaron Schnarch, Vice President of Product,&nbsp;Custody</p><p>Fully-integrated staking on Coinbase&nbsp;Prime</p><p>Coinbase Prime provides institutions with an end-to-end staking experience. Clients can create a wallet, decide how much to stake, and initiate staking from the ETH asset page on their Coinbase Prime&nbsp;account.</p><p>Securing client funds is our highest priority. We hold withdrawal keys in our cold storage custody vault at all times, meaning staked ETH and accumulated yield are always safe. To further ensure the security of client accounts, staking transactions must first complete consensus before they are executed.</p><p>ETH vs&nbsp;ETH2</p><p>The term eth2 has been used frequently to describe an upgrade to the Ethereum network that aims to improve the network’s security and scalability. This upgrade involves a shift in Ethereum’s security model from mining (“Proof-of-Work”) to staking (“Proof-of-Stake”).</p><p>Once a client stakes their ETH, our system uses the ticker ETH2 to represent those staked ETH tokens. Note that there is no separate/new “eth2” token or asset. The price of ETH and ETH2 is identical. Once the upgrade to the Ethereum network is complete, the tickers ETH and ETH2 will merge into a single ticker: ETH. The merge is currently expected to occur in September 2022, so moving forward you likely will see the term ETH2 fall into&nbsp;disuse.</p><p>Why institutions are&nbsp;staking</p><p>Staking can offer passive income on assets already held in custody by providing useful work in the form of security to the underlying blockchain. The Ethereum blockchain rewards stakers that do a good job, but also punishes those that fail in their duties, for example by having downtime. This is why it’s important to stake with a reputable and effective provider to earn maximal rewards while minimizing risk.</p><p>Staking rewards for most assets can be thought of similarly to compound interest, not unlike in traditional markets when dividends are reinvested. Because staking rewards are paid in the token being staked, users may “reinvest” those tokens to receive a higher payout at the next period. Furthermore, staked tokens are typically stored within their respective wallets, meaning that users earn yield without rehypothecation.</p><p>Staking on Coinbase&nbsp;Prime</p><p>With Coinbase Prime, institutional customers have the ability to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WosdC1EQ1Rs">stake their ETH </a>and a number of other assets to begin generating yield. Staking is also supported for Solana, Polkadot, Cosmos, Tezos, Celo, and more. Read more about institutional staking in our <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/institutional/research-insights/resources/education/staking-101-for-institutions">Staking 101 for Institutions</a> article.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-prime-grows-its-staking-offering-with-eth-23c90eab5118">Coinbase Prime grows its staking offering with ETH</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com">The Coinbase Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Let’s explore entities in more detail.</p> About Validator Entities <p>As a validator entity, you can host:</p>  A custom avatar to reflect your identity and brand  Contact details: currently supports an email address, twitter handle and website URL  A short bio of who you are, limited to 300 characters or less.  And, crucially, a list of validator nodes that you are managing.  <p>The entity details will appear on the community page. The entity’s bio can be opened in an overlay, and the list of validators are displayed by clicking the entity’s Validators button.</p><p>Clicking the Validators button will open a subsection of the page that only displays details for that particular entity:</p>A temporary validator entity node list hosted on the Community page.<p>This list of an entity’s validators uses the same components used in the main <a href="https://staking.polkadot.network/dashboard/#/validators">validator list</a>, with pagination, filters, identity syncing, favorite toggling, and metrics all supported; there are no compromises with validator entity lists.</p> Entity Setup Instructions <p>To add your entity, just submit a PR on the staking dashboard’s <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard">Github repo</a>. Within your PR, simply provide an avatar SVG and add your details to a JSON file.</p><p>Detailed instructions on how to add a validator entity are documented in the dashboard’s Readme document on Github, <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard#validator-entity-setup-guide">found here</a>.</p> Ensuring Fairness <p>Validator entities are shuffled every time someone visits the dashboard, so there is no preference or bias towards a particular entity.</p><p>In addition, the validator nodes themselves are shuffled every time they are visited, for the same reasons.</p> Next Steps <p>With this month’s update the aim is to spread the word of this new feature, hoping that a vibrant list of validator entities will be added in the near future.</p><p>We are keen to expand the community page itself with ordering and filtering functionality as adoption increases.</p><p>As always, feedback and suggestions are always welcome. You can easily post feedback on the <a href="https://staking.polkadot.network/dashboard/#/feedback">Feedback</a> section of the dashboard.</p><p>Lastly, reach out to Ross for additional assistance at <a href="mailto:ross@parity.io">ross@parity.io</a></p>

<p>Below are some updates on the various projects, tooling, and resources the Mina ecosystem and community have worked on over the last month.&nbsp;</p>
 Updates 
<p>*Please note that each ecosystem update may contain forecasts, projections, targets or other forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on the relevant ecosystem partner’s estimates and assumptions based on information available at the time such update is made. Accordingly, plans, goals and other statements may not be realized as described, and actual results may differ materially from those presented in such an update. In addition, the Mina Foundation is not responsible for updates made by community contributors or ecosystem partners, whose work is important to the development of the Mina ecosystem and is independent from any of the initiatives that the Mina Foundation is working on.&nbsp;</p>
 Chainsafe – Lerna Jabourian, Project Manager 
<p>Chainsafe is working to make the network more resilient, via the reimplementation of Mina in Rust as a web node.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of updates, we were able to<a href="https://github.com/ChainSafe/mina-rs/milestones"> finish Milestone 2,</a> thanks to code reviews from the O(1) Labs team. Overall, we’ve been mainly focusing on performance and code quality-related changes for the last month on mina-rs and also integrating changes from the hard-fork, including:</p>
 
 A few performance related refactors and pushing improvements to upstream dependencies 
 Implementing reading the genesis ledger and accounts details in the Mina node 
 Implemented a tool to ensure compatibility of the most recent Mina blocks from across the network 
 Integrating changes from the recent hardfork into the mina-rs codebase 
 
<p>For a list of recently merged PRs, <a href="https://github.com/ChainSafe/mina-rs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+is%3Amerged">see our Github repo</a>. We also always welcome anyone to reach out to us in terms of code reviews, suggestions and contributions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Mina Foundation – Brian McKenna, Head of Product; Claire Kart, Head of Marketing; Christine Yip, Head of Community 
<p>The Mina Foundation is helping serve and support the Mina ecosystem, specifically by allocating resources, supporting network health and security, and supporting participants on their path to the Mina ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting this month, we will be sharing updates as part of this blog so the community has a better understanding of what is being worked on by the Foundation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Product</p>
<p>Most recently, the Foundation is working with a team of community contributors on On-chain Signalling, to enable Block Producers to signal on-chain their support and readiness for a proposed hard fork upgrade.</p>
<p>On a high level, Phase 1 of the project has been delivered, which allows a Block Producer to submit a ‘voting’ transaction in the memo and also allows those results to be calculated and published via an API. The most recent progress includes:</p>
 
 Set up Archive Node and created voting transaction&nbsp; 
 Developed query to retrieve voting results from Archive Node&nbsp; 
 Deployed backend to connect to Archive Node&nbsp; 
 Made progress on frontend to display backend results 
 
<p>The next phase will be to calculate the votes on a stake-weight basis and make the API consumable by the community for release in parallel with the next testnet upgrade.</p>
<p>Events</p>
<p>We’re excited to share that Mina will be at ETHMexico City from August 19-21! There will be a Mina Protocol booth with teams from across the ecosystem attending to support builders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The global zkApps Developer Meetup tour is still ongoing, with successful meetups over the last 2 months that have concluded in Paris, Budapest, Berlin, Istanbul and Tel Aviv. We have met over 225 builders, community members and individuals wanting to learn more about Mina so far, and can’t wait to meet more.</p>

<p>There are many more in-person meetups in the next few months – <a href="https://minaprotocol.com/community">check out the event calendar on the Mina Community page</a> to see where we’re heading next!</p>
<p>zkApp Developer Resources</p>
<p>Creating supporting resources to make it really easy for developers who are new to Mina and zkApps to get started is important. We’ll start with identifying opportunities and places where we can add more educational resources, then decide on the format, and work on producing it. If you have any suggestions, feedback, or ideas, please let us know in the #zkapps-developers or #zkapps-general channel on <a href="http://bit.ly/MinaDiscord">Discord</a>!</p>
<p>The team has also been working with different ecosystem contributors on a zero knowledge video series, which will soon drop on YouTube. Be sure to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWzKMFfIlMzHUXKSnYot5HA">subscribe to the Mina YouTube channel</a> so you can be notified.</p>
<p>Quarterly Community-Nominated Grants</p>
<p>The Mina Foundation deeply values all contributions and strives to recognize those who went above and beyond to make a significant impact on the Mina ecosystem, with community-nominated grants. Each quarter, community members who made invaluable contributions to Mina are receiving grants – including but not limited to tools, scripts, blogs, videos, newsletters, events, community-led groups, and <a href="https://bit.ly/3nDrA7H">more</a>.</p>
<p>We set up a new process to help us better evaluate contributions and award QGP grants, and within a shorter period of about 2 weeks, we received 100+ nominations for the Q2 grants! We’re proceeding to the next steps and are asking members to fill out a questionnaire about their work, to make sure that we’re not missing anything and are recognizing members for their contributions.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://bit.ly/3OxDmLZ">nomination form</a> is open for any entries for the 2022 Q3 grants. Please nominate Mina community members who have been helpful to you/built something helpful that you’re using (ex. Block explorers, wallets, scripts, dashboards, tutorials, blogs, etc.) for a grant. Feel free to also nominate your own work – we want to recognize everyone’s contributions to the Mina ecosystem!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 =nil; Foundation – Mikhail Komarov, Founder 
<p>For context, =nil; Foundation is working on bridging Mina to Ethereum and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most recently, we’ve gotten to preparing the second phase of the audit – a proof system audit. This will certify that the auxiliary proof generator actually generates a valid Placeholder proof of successful Mina’s state proof verification. The third and last phase of the audit will be an in-EVM verification part audit, so after it is done, the project will enter its production-ready stage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re also experimenting with reducing the circuit size which has to be proved by exploiting a “tick-tok” nature of Mina’s state proof recursion. In case that works, the verification cost will reduce. Third of all, we’ve put together all the architecture and a roadmap to make Mina’s bridge a bi-directional one (and more).</p>
<p>Some key milestones reached recently include:</p>
 
 Auxiliary proof generation performance improvements because of the massive parallelization introduction (via special parallelization-exploiting version of a cryptography suite of ours: e.g. <a href="https://github.com/NilFoundation/actor-zk">https://github.com/NilFoundation/actor-zk</a>). Takes almost 5 times less time now. 
 Potential verification cost reduction (because of the tick-tock nature of Mina’s state proof recursion I mentioned earlier). Not sure about the numbers for now, but it all depends on if we figure this out with O(1) Labs team members. 
 
<p>I would say that one of the most important commits made this month is about <a href="https://github.com/NilFoundation/crypto3-blueprint/commit/bbfd29d9d4430153631343431c521a6eda35094e">introducing Mina’s Kimchi proof system-based IR support for the circuit definition framework of ours</a>. This enabled us to move towards simplification of Mina’s state proof verification circuit (less verification cost) and made the code more suitable for the audit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 O(1) Labs – Emre Tekisalp, CEO 
<p>Improving Node Stability</p>
<p>The latest beta release 1.3.2beta1 has been out for almost a month and is being tested on devnet. The last stable release, 1.3.1, has been running smoothly on Mainnet for well over two months. We’ve been focused on shipping performance improvements and addressing outstanding issues. We hope to promote 1.3.2 to stable in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Berkeley QA Network</p>
<p>The Berkeley QA Network is ongoing and the QA task force is diligently participating and helping to address issues that occur. In the past month, we’ve redeployed the Berkeley QA Network and with the help of the community, found an issue. As a result, there has been some operational downtime on the QANet; however, O(1) engineers have identified the root cause and are working to roll out the fix. If you would like to participate in the QA network please chime in on the #devnet channel on <a href="http://bit.ly/MinaDiscord">Discord</a>. We plan to make a few more redeployments to the QA network in the coming weeks so look out for more enhancements and fixes.</p>
<p>zkApp Protocol Readiness</p>
<p>O(1) Labs has worked on implementing key zkApp protocol features such as support for tokens, supporting zkApp events &amp; sequence events, and zkApp composability (one zkApp calling another.) As we near feature completion, we are working on finalizing the acceptance criteria for each aspect of the protocol. The O(1) Labs engineering and testing teams have created a suite of acceptance tests and are writing test cases using sample zkApps.</p>
<p>SnarkyJS &amp; zkApps</p>
<p>zkApp proving performance is now <a href="https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/pull/11053">200%-1,000% faster</a> for non-recursive use cases!&nbsp;</p>
<p>The O(1) Labs’ engineering team recently added support for preconditions, recursion, and events to SnarkyJS. Preconditions are available now; recursion &amp; events will appear in the next release of SnarkyJS. Developers will be able to make use of these features on Berkeley Testnet. We’re currently writing documentation for these to be published on <a href="https://docs.minaprotocol.com">docs.minaprotocol.com</a> in the coming weeks. Follow the new <a href="https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md">SnarkyJS changelog</a> to see detailed updates as they occur.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proof Systems</p>
<p>While a draft Rust API for Kimchi was released some time in June via the <a href="https://github.com/o1-labs/proof-systems">proof-systems repo</a>, the decision was made to restructure the API to align the interfaces with the proven Snarky (oCaml) circuit writing API, which is used throughout the Mina protocol. While this change will delay the release of an API for Kimchi, it will improve the maintainability and will result in a cleaner transition to future Rust versions of Pickles and Snarky.&nbsp;</p>
<p>zkOracles</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to have welcomed a very talented Rust engineer with a background in MPC research who will be leading the implementation on zkOracles. In his first few weeks onboarding and ramping up on the project he has identified a few potential optimizations. We’ll continue to iterate on the design for zkOracles and look forward to beginning implementation work in the near future. In the meantime, the SnarkyJS team is working on an alternative oracle approach for developers to consume data from external sources within a zkApp in the near term.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 ONTAB – Behzad Malek, CEO 
<p>Ontab has been working on the new uptime tracker for the Mina Foundation Delegation Program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within the last month, a <a href="https://uptime.minaprotocol.com/">beta version of this new uptime tracker</a> was released, which scores block producers’ uptime based on their SNARK worker activity, instead of sidecar data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 3 major changes included in the new uptime tracker:</p>
 
 We look at verified submissions only. 
 We only accept submissions with the state_hashes that more than 34% of the community agrees on. 
 We finally account for submissions with state_hashes that are close (weight &lt;=2) to the canonical blockchain in the last 90 days. 
 
<p></p>
<p>In other exciting news, we also released notes on the SNARK-based uptime tracking system API, which can enable Mina ecosystem participants and community members to access in data from the new uptime tracking system and incorporate into tools and services like community built leaderboards.</p>
 
 Test endpoint: <a href="http://3.237.77.215/">http://3.237.77.215/</a> 
 Documentation: <a href="http://3.237.77.215:5001/apidocs/">http://3.237.77.215:5001/apidocs/</a> 
 
<p>We would like to collect feedback on the new uptime tracker and the API from the community, to continue improving on them. Please share any feedback with us on the #delegation-program channel on <a href="http://bit.ly/MinaDiscord">Mina’s Discord</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Mina Notifier Bot – EA#0741 
<p>Created by community member EA#0741, <a href="https://t.me/MinaNotifierBot">MinaNotifierBot</a> is a Telegram bot for MINA blockchain monitoring, which supports a huge variety of functions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of its capabilities, the bot is similar to the explorers, while being a more convenient personalized tool. The bot solves the problem of informing users about events taking place in the Mina Blockchain in the most convenient way for the user. It is a product for the community, and I hope it helps the stable and healthy growth of the ecosystem as a whole. It also provides transparency and information support for the project and simplifies the experience for new users.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The bot was released in the mid-June with some basic functionality:</p>
 
 ability to add any user address to monitoring and view address info and manage settings 
 notifications about sending or receiving tokens 
 delegation notifications 
 whale alerts and ability to set custom thresholds 
 general settings management 
 ability to contact bots’ developers on any questions 
 
 
 
 zkRollup on Mina – trivo#0001 
<p>Community member Trivo#0001 (who is also a zkApps Builders Program cohort 1 participant) is working on a zkRollup for Mina.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first step of the zkRollup is to develop and provide a framework that gives developers the power to leverage fast performance while still maintaining Mina’s amazing privacy and succinctness properties.</p>
<p>The main goal of a rollup is to batch a lot of transactions into a single one, while still maintaining the security and decentralization of the underlying layer 1 – which in our case is Mina. Developers will be able to use the rollup as easily as any other framework or developer tooling, so the developer can focus on the important part – building the actual application – and not worry about throughput (tps), performance and any associated problems and hurdles that come with it. End users will be able to use any application built on top of a rollup without any additional hurdles while being exposed to increased performance which results in much better user experience.</p>
<p>A lot of the work over the recent weeks has been going on in the background and on the design side. I have gotten myself more comfortable with the recently released “recursion-API”, which will allow any rollup or application on Mina to easily merge SNARK proofs recursively (the part that other projects are still actively working on, but it is available on Mina NOW!). On the design front I have evaluated different possibilities of scaling the rollup and tried running a few (very) early benchmarks to get myself a better overview of what it will take to increase transaction throughput. One PR that I can point out is <a href="https://github.com/Trivo25/mina-zk-rollup/pull/20">this one</a>. In this PR I started to refactor major parts of the repository, do a lot of cleanup and needed documentation.</p>
<p>As I continue working on this, I welcome other community members to engage in discussions, ask questions and give feedback!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Community-Organized Developer Meetup &amp; Workshop with Extropy.io – Karol#4597 
<p>Karol#4597 is a community member who has organized a developer meetup and zero knowledge workshop in London, which will take place this week on July 30 at 9:30AM UTC+1. Spots are open still, <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/mina-zkapp-developer-meetup-zero-knowledge-workshop-by-extropyio-tickets-384657168947">sign up to attend</a>.</p>
<p>My goal is to increase the adoption of ZKPs and the Mina Protocol. I strongly believe that if more people would understand how the ZK technology work, they would see more clearly the potential that the protocol unlocks. In order to achieve that goal, I mainly focus on two areas: community education and zkApp development. Working at Extropy, alongside ZK experts, allowed me to often combine the two.</p>
<p>Recently we have run an online meetup, focusing on zkApps development. This Saturday (July 30), the first community-run workshop/developer meetup is being organised to allow anyone to learn more about the technology. This is an <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/mina-zkapp-developer-meetup-zero-knowledge-workshop-by-extropyio-tickets-384657168947">in-person meetup that will take place in London</a>. We would love for people to join, and to give feedback about the content (what was clearly explained, what wasn’t) and the event itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I saw a lack of such meetups run by the community so I thought to give it a try, and hopefully, inspire others to do so as well! If someone is interested in wanting to organize a similar meetup, I would suggest to start by engaging with the community on the <a href="http://bit.ly/MinaDiscord">Mina Discord</a> channels and getting familiar with the resources and documentation.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://minaprotocol.com/blog/ecosystem-updates-july-2022">Mina Ecosystem Updates – July 2022</a> appeared first on <a href="https://minaprotocol.com">Mina Protocol</a>.</p>

<p>At Panther, we are lucky to have community members always eager to participate in bringing privacy to DeFi.</p><p>Different aspects of our mission require distinct but coordinated efforts and, within them, plenty of roles arise for our community to fill. Each role has its duties and rewards, which creates a crucial balance that we strive to maintain. We attempt to make all roles equally enticing. It’s up to you to decide which one interests you the most.</p><p>Let’s examine a few strategies for you to get involved in Panther right now or in the future and help us enable privacy and trust in DeFi:</p> Strategy #1: Vote on DAO proposals <p>The <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/dao/governance/dao">Panther DAO</a>, not our team, has the final say on all major decisions in Panther. As such, all $ZKP holders can vote on DAO proposals conducted through <a href="http://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth">Snapshot.org</a>.</p><p>DAO proposals range from definitions on our roadmap (e.g., <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x969138dfe31faeb2cde3b10fe4e3fe40d3ad571974d1e566b5257229488a937b">launch Staking</a> or <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x6723c96c0ded4557fc70a4a8e3be54edd2c359895df3c88e7c645fcb0447063e">deploy to Polygon</a>) to <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x5b854f288f407562265f6fd701e8e50564e4e936d36fb3784664195f763434a0">bug fixes</a> and <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/launchdao.eth/proposal/0x2440b546cecc6292c56f55539942f10108831a1d6eff3b90a3603a9a157dbeae">launch timing</a>. We request community before every move, so voting is the best way for you to take an active role in the future of Panther.</p>All $ZKP holders with staked tokens can participate in voting.<p>Your $ZKP must be <a href="https://staking.pantherprotocol.io/">staked</a> to count towards voting power, regardless of the network (Ethereum or Polygon). We always announce new DAO proposals on <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/">Panther’s blog</a> and through social media.</p> Strategy #2: Become a member of our community <p>Panther frequently relies on our community members on Discord, Telegram, and Twitter to get feedback on many of our initiatives and help disseminate the word about what Panther is building. In exchange for that, we make sure our community members are always in the loop regarding our more recent releases, undertakings, and marketing activities. </p><p>Our policy of full transparency is conducted through these official channels. We invite you to join them in order to become a full-fledged member of the Panther community:</p>  Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">https://t.me/pantherprotocol</a>  Discord: <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c">https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c</a>  Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">https://twitter.com/ZkPanther</a>  <p>We have also established a number of local Panther communities through our Ambassadors in order to reach users, investors, and believers outside the anglosphere. The local communities currently live are:</p>  French: <a href="https://t.me/PantherFranceOfficiel">t.me/PantherFranceOfficiel</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpantherFR">twitter.com/zkpantherFR</a>  Spanish: <a href="https://t.me/pantherespanoloficial">https://t.me/pantherespanoloficial</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpantherES">twitter.com/zkpantherES</a>  Turkish: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocolturkish">https://t.me/pantherprotocolturkish</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/zkpantherTR">twitter.com/zkpantherTR</a>  Japanese: <a href="https://t.me/PantherJapanOfficial">https://t.me/PantherJapanOfficial</a>  Italian: <a href="https://t.me/PantherItaliaOfficial">https://t.me/PantherItaliaOfficial</a>  Russian: <a href="https://t.me/PantherRussianOfficial">https://t.me/PantherRussianOfficial</a>  Africa: <a href="https://t.me/PantherAfricaOfficial">https://t.me/PantherAfricaOfficial</a>  India: <a href="https://t.me/PantherIndiaOfficial">https://t.me/PantherIndiaOfficial</a>   Strategy #3: Providing liquidity in Uniswap <p>Liquidity is very important in a DEX setting.</p><p>High liquidity allows investors to trade quickly, smoothly, and with less slippage. Liquidity providers earn fees from trades executed through liquidity pools. When a project has plenty of liquidity, volatility is better absorbed, making its price movements less abrupt.</p><p>Although anyone can create a Uniswap pool for any pair of assets, most of the time, it’s best to join existing pools that already enjoy some liquidity. There are currently four $ZKP liquidity pools live: a <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/0x909E34d3f6124C324ac83DccA84b74398a6fa173/ETH/3000?chain=mainnet">ETH-ZKP pool</a> (in the Ethereum Mainnet), and <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/0x9A06Db14D639796B25A6ceC6A1bf614fd98815EC/0xc2132D05D31c914a87C6611C10748AEb04B58e8F/3000?chain=polygon">USDT-ZKP</a>, <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/0x9A06Db14D639796B25A6ceC6A1bf614fd98815EC/0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174/10000?chain=polygon">USDC-ZKP</a>, and <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/0x9A06Db14D639796B25A6ceC6A1bf614fd98815EC/ETH/10000?chain=polygon">MATIC-ZKP</a> pools (in Polygon).</p><p>All of them are Uniswap v3 pools, meaning you must select a price range in which to concentrate your liquidity. You will earn fees for trades only when $ZKP is within your selected price range, and the narrower it is, the faster you will accumulate fees.</p> How to provide liquidity for $ZKP in Uniswap <p>To become a liquidity provider and earn fees in Uniswap, follow the steps below. Note that we only recommend for advanced users to do this, as you need to be aware of <a href="https://www.blockchain-council.org/defi/impermanent-loss/">impermanent loss</a>, know what you’re doing, and be prepared for the possibility of financial losses.</p><p>To provide liquidity in Uniswap:</p><p>1. Go to <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/">Uniswap’s dApp</a> and connect your wallet to the correct network.</p><p>2. Select the “Pool” tab, and click on the “New Position” button. Alternatively, follow one of the links above to the pool to which you want to provide liquidity.</p><p>3. Select the token pair you want to provide liquidity to. In this case, we selected $USDT/$ZKP. You might need to manually add $ZKP as a custom token to your Uniswap interface if you’ve never traded it in the decentralized exchange.</p><p>4. The “Edit” button (highlighted in yellow) in the screenshot below allows you to select a fee tier to deposit liquidity into. While you can choose a higher fee tier, users prefer to trade in pools with lower fees and more liquidity. For this reason, most users choose to adhere to the default option.</p>Adding liquidity to Uniswap pairs (in here, $ZKP/USDT).<p>5. As explained above, the fields highlighted in red are the bounds of the price range into which you will concentrate your liquidity. Highlighted in green is the button to provide liquidity at a full price range (zero to infinity). This is not recommended, however, as fee income will accumulate very slowly. You might want to set a wide but finite range to optimize your participation in the pool without worrying about $ZKP’s price range.</p><p>6. At last, type in how much $ZKP you want to provide. You will need to the pairing asset ($USDT in the image) in an amount that equals the same value. Uniswap will calculate the exact quantity you need to enter after you input your $ZKP amount.</p><p>7. You might need to approve your Metamask to spend $ZKP and your pairing asset if you have never used them in Uniswap. If you don’t see the “Approve” buttons, just skip this step.</p><p>8. Click “Preview” and “Add” to finish adding liquidity.</p> Strategy #4: Participate in product testing (Panther Zafari) <p>Panther Zafari is the name of Panther’s Incentivized Testnet. It <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testing-for-zkp-advanced-staking-is-now-live-19b51bc6b42b/">debuted</a> on May 19th, 2022, inviting our community to join the team’s efforts to test $ZKP Advanced Staking in the Mumbai Polygon Testnet, with rewards amounting to a total of 100,000 $ZKP.</p>We have received an enormous amount of feedback from all participants in Zafari for Advanced Staking testing. Decentralizing testing is a powerful way to dramatically increase our testing capabilities at a manageable cost.<p>Testing happens in the Polygon’s and Ethereum’s Testnets, with instructions in each test round’s announcement. Test $ZKP tokens are provided through a faucet when necessary.</p><p>The <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testing-for-zkp-advanced-staking-is-now-live-19b51bc6b42b">first</a>, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/round-2-of-incentivized-testing-for-zkp-advanced-staking-is-now-live-94aaff689332">second</a>, and <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wave-3-of-incentivized-advanced-staking-testing-begins-on-july-7th/">third</a> testing rounds for Advanced Staking are currently closed for new participants. Later Zafari rounds and testing of other features will be made public through our blog, so keep a close eye to avoid missing the next Zafari announcement!</p> Strategy #5: Become a partner <p>Strategic partnerships are essential for a nascent project’s success in the blockchain industry. Although competition is a major force that drives innovation, cooperation can be even more impactful in this space.</p>Panther aims to be the focal point through which Interchain private transactions are made possible. We prioritize our partners to deliver this critical private infrastructure.<p>Panther is always on the lookout for <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/tag/partnerships/">partnerships</a> that contribute toward our goals for privacy in DeFi. If you’re involved with another project in the blockchain space and you believe we can mutually benefit from joining forces, you can reach out to our team through <a href="mailto:partnerships@pantherprotocol.io">partnerships@pantherprotocol.io</a>. We’re also always looking forward to hearing from:</p>  Other members of the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/privacy-finance-why-panther-is-different-and-necessary-e423b2993df9/">PriFi</a> scene.  Projects wanting to infuse their protocols with privacy.  Infrastructure/data protocols.  Builders looking to use Panther’s primitives (see our section on upcoming SDKs/APIs for more about this!)   Strategy #6: Apply to be a Panther Ambassador <p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/introducing-the-panther-ambassador-program-7cfc198a20a2/">Panther Ambassadors</a> are leaders all over the world who play a pivotal role in disseminating Panther amongst broader audiences. Thanks to them, the Panther community can continue to grow and provide feedback to improve our products, systems, and procedures.</p><p>Besides our team, Panther Ambassadors are the first to access product previews and exclusive events. Ambassadors work independently but can count on our team’s support as necessary for their endeavors. </p><p>Here are some examples of activities a Panther Ambassador can perform:</p>  Creating and moderating local communities  Organizing local events and meetups  Translating or creating Panther content, including but not limited to:  Twitter threads  Blog posts  Videos  Memes (yes, please)  Infographics  Podcasts  Assisting with the promotion and moderation of social media accounts. In fact, as of July 2022, we made a move to allow notable Panther Ambassadors to help moderate our Discord and Telegram channels, as opposed to a third-party firm. This has had the side effect of drastically increasing moderation quality and moderator knowledge!  Connect us with other players in the space for potential partnerships and collaborations.  Offer input to the Panther team on certain strategic decisions.   How are Panther Ambassadors compensated? <p>At the moment, for a few hours a month, Ambassadors may receive a monthly compensation varying on account of one’s cost of living and the extent of their contributions, among other factors. This program is designed to help motivated and driven ambassadors thrive as they increasingly support Panther.</p><p>Ambassadors can be reimbursed for pre-approved expenses incurred while representing Panther. They are also qualified to receive exclusive Panther swag you’ll receive for personal use and distribution.</p> How does one become a Panther Ambassador? <p>While Panther Ambassadors are still very much a part of our community, we are currently not actively looking for them. However, if you have a proposal for us, feel free to message the Panther team through our official <a href="https://discord.com/invite/WZuRnMCZ4c">Discord</a> and <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn">Telegram</a>.</p> A lot more is coming <p>Panther is building a whole infrastructure to enable privacy and trust in DeFi and Web3. This is done through a complex ecosystem of products and services and, as such, in the future, you will be able to participate in Panther in many more ways. Some of them will be:</p> Providing liquidity to Multi-Asset Shielded Pools <p>By using Panther’s privacy solutions, you contribute to Panther’s privacy set and assist in making shielded transactions even harder to track. Depositing assets into <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-multi-asset-shielded-pools-enabling-heterogeneous-mixing-of-assets-ec165854bf0f/">MASPs</a> is a straightforward way to participate and strengthen the privacy offered by the protocol. Here is how it works:</p><p>After locking their assets into a vault, users receive fully-collateralized zAssets with which to privately transact through Panther’s Multi-Asset Shielded Pools. As the number of transactions within a pool increases, it becomes increasingly harder to uncover the sender of any transaction. MASPs will reward those that add tokens even if they don’t make shielded transactions, as locking their assets also contributes to shielding.</p><p>MASPs are a part of Panther’s v1, which will be released sometime in 2022.</p> Advanced Staking <p>Currently, users are <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wave-3-of-incentivized-advanced-staking-testing-begins-on-july-7th/">testing Advanced Staking</a>, which is a mechanism that will help the Panther team test the way MASPs accrue and control rewards. Advanced Staking introduces the first zAsset, $zZKP. For this very reason, Advanced Staking requires a great deal of the infrastructure necessary for MASPs to be ready and deployed. </p><p>Our team has come to call Advanced Staking by the nickname “Panther v0.5,” a succinct way to describe what this feature means on Panther’s roadmap. The release of Advanced Staking is a huge milestone and just a few weeks away, so stay tuned!</p> Building on top of Panther <p>Panther is building public goods for a future where privacy is the default throughout in DeFi. By interacting with our smart contracts, developers can build more complex systems that rely on Panther as a basic building block. We commit to making this as easy as possible by releasing comprehensive and easy-to-understand <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/home/">documentation</a> on our smart contracts.</p><p>Our robust DeFi privacy suite relies on a number of state-of-the-art <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zksnarks-through-the-lens-of-the-cypherpunks/">cryptographic primitives</a> not widely available in a ready-to-use form. Our team intends to make them available through SDKs (software development kits) for developers to build privacy-oriented applications and dApps.</p> Interact with the Panther DAO <p>Since our launch, Panther has made decentralization one of our highest priorities and a key principle. The <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth">Panther DAO</a> regularly conducts votes to approve the deployment of Panther’s new developments. As time passes, the responsibilities of the Panther Foundation and Stellium will be progressively passed over to the Panther DAO. </p><p>We are currently setting up the stage for users to get more actively involved in Panther’s governance and contribute to it more broadly.</p> Become a Service/Trust Provider <p>Some of Panther’s features rely on the participation of <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf">Service Providers and Trust Providers</a>. Service Providers are entities offering applications that interact with <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol/protocol/panthers-core-components/zassets">zAssets</a> or <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol/protocol/panthers-core-components/zk-and-non-zk-reveals">Panther Reveals</a>. Trust Providers are entities capable of providing attestations (verifiable statements) in the form of Panther Reveals, revealing the least possible (or none at all) underlying information. Through these attestations, Service Providers can build trust with their users.</p><p>As these features become commonplace, the Panther team will open the door for more and more Trust and Service Providers to join the ecosystem.</p> Ask not what Panther can do for you… <p>At the end of the day, Panther can only go as far as its community takes it.</p><p>On our end, our job is to build the best system possible that aligns all incentives for Panther to <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/economic-analysis-of-private-defi/">compete with other centralized and decentralized alternatives.</a> Our ultimate goal is to build an ecosystem that supports users contributing, building, and improving their privacy without the need to be told so.</p><p>By joining early, you get to be one of the very first to reap the benefits of participating in a larger mission.</p><p>We hope to see you around our communities very soon!</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

<p>Communication is the foundation of the Internet. Social media, news, shopping, and educational platforms are all underpinned by the ability to communicate across the world, at any time, with anyone. We form relationships, we learn, we grow, and we share our lives and our secrets online – and up until now, we’ve done it by selling our identities to the most powerful companies in the world.</p>



<p>The xx network is a revolution in the way we build and use the communications platforms that make the Internet so ubiquitous in our daily lives. The xx network provides private communications infrastructure that isn’t owned by a corporation, individual, or government. On top of that, the xx network can’t scoop up your data or your identity, and it can’t be censored – nor be discovered – even by the most determined actors. Ensured by cryptography, the xx network is owned and operated by its users, meaning you can run the servers and make the decisions.</p>



<p>The xx coin represents your voice in the network. It’s used to vote, exchange value, and incentivize you to run a server or node, and it gives uncensorable access to the most private decentralized communications network in the world. The full rundown on <a href="https://xx.network/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/xx-economics-v1.2.pdf">the xx network’s tokenomics can be found here</a>, and we’ve put together a high-level overview of the xx coin below for those of you who are interested in helping build a truly protected digital society.</p>



 What is xx coin? 



<p>xx coin is the native digital currency of the xx network. This secure digital currency can be traded among individuals and institutions and all xx coin wallets are embedded with quantum-secure keys which will protect your assets in the event of a quantum computing breakthrough.</p>



<p>On top of that, xx coin plays an essential role in incentivizing network participation and decentralized governance through xx network’s multifaceted, tokenized reward structure.</p>



 xx Governance &amp; Rewards 



<p>The xx chain uses a Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) protocol to secure the network economically. The network’s decentralized governance mechanisms allow every xx coin holder to propose, second, and vote in the referendums that shape the network. These referendums may modify the code of the network, add new features, change economic structures, and control just about every aspect of the platform.</p>



<p>More specifically, the xx network will use nominated staking to incentivize all coin holders to participate in node selection, operation, bonding, and governance. There are four main ways to contribute to the xx network and start earning xx coins:&nbsp;</p>



  <a href="https://xx.network/nodes/">Run an active node</a>: xx coin holders can become an xx network node operator and earn xx coins in exchange for helping secure the network. Prospective validators must stake a minimum of 5,000 xx coins and attract nominations and stakes from the community to be elected. Once elected, every validator is equal, meaning their xx coin staking rewards are not proportional to the validator’s stake, but rather determined by a point-based system that measures each validator’s relative blockchain performance (uptime, block production, etc.). Today, it takes over 100k xx in nominations to become a node on the xx network blockchain.  <a href="https://xxnetwork.wiki/How_to_Nominate">Nominate an active node</a>: xx network users who do not want to become validators can stake their coins and nominate validators in order to vote on governance proposals and nominate nodes in the network. These Nominators earn interest on the tokens they have staked on active nodes every “era” according to an interest rate curve and the specific commission and performance of the node.  <a href="https://xxfoundation.org/archive/xx-foundation-announces-the-xx-dapps-grant-program/">Build an xx app</a>: The xx Foundation has launched a special grant initiative to jumpstart the development and deployment of privacy preserving&nbsp; dApps using the xxDK. The program will award individual grants of up to 1,000,000 xx coins for each successful submission, from an initial pool of 10,000,000 xx coins, and the Elixxir team will also be involved as advisors for every grant project accepted at this stage.  <a href="https://xx.network/welcome/">Grow the xx ecosystem</a>: the xx network’s treasury was created to fund bounties and rewards for ongoing development of the xx ecosystem through activities proposed by the council, the tech committee, or the community at large. <a href="https://discord.gg/Y8pCkbK">Join the xx Discord</a> and <a href="https://t.me/xxnetwork">Telegram</a> to learn more about new community initiatives and contribute new ideas for how to grow the xx ecosystem.  



<p>xx nodes are essential to the security and core operations of the xx network, and node rewards are composed of a share of the fees paid into the network plus an inflationary reward of newly minted xx coins. That said, we understand that running a full node requires some expertise, time, and money to acquire and maintain the requisite computing hardware and minimum bond amount. That’s why we’ve incorporated node nominations and other reward mechanisms – so every active xx user has the ability to participate in xx network’s governance and development and earn xx coins for their contributions.</p>



 xx coin Ecosystem Usage 



<p>The xx network was founded on the belief that no matter where you are in the world, you should be able to communicate and transact privately without worrying about whether your digital footprint can be viewed or compromised by any external party. That’s why our open-source technology is designed to enable two primary functions: private communications and secure payments, both of which are planned to rely on a mix of free and paid “postage,” the unit that quantifies the amount of computing power and bandwidth required to transmit data privately across the xx network.</p>



  Private communications: Usage of the xx network’s private communication layer is designed to be accessible to anyone with a suitable mobile phone. The system is currently designed to be free to use for xx user accounts who stake or burn a small number of xx coins in order to acquire free postage.&nbsp;  



<p>This allotted free postage is sufficient for most users’ day-to-day messaging needs. However, organizations and independent developers who want to deploy and operate dApps and smart contracts on the xx network will need to pay for additional bandwidth using xx coins. In the future, we will roll out additional mechanisms for acquiring and using free postage in order to benefit regular xx users, but the demand for xx coin will continue to grow as more privacy-minded businesses and builders use the xx network to communicate en masse.</p>



  Secure payments: Every xx coin on the network is held in an account or wallet that is seeded with the strongest type of quantum-secure cryptography known. This ensures that, unlike traditional banking or other cryptocurrencies, not only are your individual coins protected from the rapid development of quantum computers, but just as importantly the infrastructure securing your coins is protected from systemic risk.  



<p>While xx network messaging is currently free to use, the xx community may adopt a postage system in which all xx coin holders would have rate-limited access to the network depending on their needs. As envisioned, all xx accounts would automatically accrue free postage gradually over time to ensure that xx network remains universally accessible. Advanced messaging functionality, enterprise adoption, and integration with other blockchains or dApps will require additional postage gained by purchasing xx coins. The xx network’s unique network architecture is structured in a way that enables every new node to provide additional transaction processing power and relay capacity. This means that as the number of xx nodes increases, both security and performance improve. These scaling characteristics thereby enable a virtuous cycle of growth, in which validator revenue increases as network utilization increases, which then allows the network to onboard and support additional nodes and further increase capacity.</p>



 xx coin Distribution 



<p>One of the xx network’s goals is to broadly distribute coin ownership in order to enhance network security and establish egalitarian incentives across the xx network’s entire privacy-enhancing ecosystem.</p>



<p>1 billion xx coins were created during genesis following the xx network’s mainnet launch on November 16, 2021. Less than 5% of these were immediately put into circulation at genesis, and token distribution was allocated according to the below distribution.</p>



<p>xx coin Distribution</p>



Allocation% SupplyVestingPurposeBetaNet Rewards5%Coins earned have a 1-year lockup from the month they are earnedAllocated to BetaNet node operators and community airdrops. All remaining xx coins will be used to pay nodes running the canary test network.Staking Rewards30%No lockup or vest but are subject to a 28-day unbonding period when unstakedAlgorithmically distributed to stakers in the xx network to incentivize users to stake in the MainNet.&nbsp;Coin Sales30%1-year lockup for coins purchased during BetaNetAllocated for public and private sales. Roughly 12% have already been sold or used to fulfill obligations to early SAFE and options holders, and all remaining coins after the public sale will be re-allocated towards staking rewards (70%) and the Foundation (30%).Team &amp; Partners25%3-year vesting period, 10% of locked coins are stakeable for rewards on the MainNetAllocated to project creators. Many team coins will initially be used to stake members of the BetaNet node community.Foundation10%20% initial vesting period; 3-year vesting for remaining 80%Allocated to grow the xx network ecosystem via partnerships, marketing and promotions, exchange listings and distribution, dApp development and events.



<p>From the start, over 90% of the xx network coin holders voluntarily locked their coins into 6-12 month vesting schedules starting at genesis and are staking those coins for rewards. xx coin will follow a deflationary supply curve for the first 5-6 years it is in circulation, with a small percentage of coins automatically burned at regular intervals in the xx network’s on-chain treasury. Afterwards, the xx network will gradually transition to an inflationary model with a maximum annual coin supply inflation rate of 6.5%, which will be distributed via block rewards to all xx coin holders staking on active nodes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>xx coin’s inflation rate will follow a curve, starting with higher inflation to support the early network before tapering down to maintain the network. The majority of the inflationary reward is given to the nodes and coin holders and a portion is transferred to the on-chain treasury, which is controlled by xx coin holders.</p>



 xx coin and the Future of Privacy 



<p><a href="https://xx.network/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/xx-economics-v1.2.pdf">xx network’s economic model</a> is designed to accelerate the inherent utility of a scalable, quantum-secure coin and leverage the growth and versatility of the platform’s native private messaging functionalities. In that respect, we believe the xx coin is essential to the future of online privacy.</p>



<p>We believe that your financial life and activity should be enriched and not threatened by technology, and our entire privacy-enhancing ecosystem is underpinned by xx coin, in terms of both on-chain governance and dApp development and usage. The positive flywheel effects made possible through the xx network’s quantum-resistant, stake-based consensus protocols enable the user growth and scale required to create a truly global, truly decentralized community of users.</p>

         New Economies, New Stories                 <p>By Allison Keeley</p><p>Photography: WENDY HUYNH</p><p>Published July 28, 2022</p>            <p>How Trevor McFedries is creating new incentives for creatives</p>       



 
 
   
<p>Trevor McFedries’ ’89 light-blue BMW was a mess. Standing at a garage in the West Adams neighborhood of Los Angeles, he was waiting for an update on repairs he knew he couldn’t afford when his phone buzzed. His heart leaped. It was 2017, and this call could change his life. McFedries was almost broke. He’d run through his savings while pitching his big idea to 60 investors who’d gone cold, and one who’d given him a few hundred thousand dollars, which was quickly disappearing into keeping his big idea alive. The caller was Stephanie Zhan, a partner at Sequoia Capital. McFedries hurried into the parking lot away from the shop noise and he started talking.</p>



<p>He told Zhan that he wanted to explode out the opportunities for art and culture to be monetized, changing everything about how creative work is done and who is compensated—from the incentives to create, to the mechanisms for making art, to the distribution of wealth. He would start with his own company, Brud, which he envisioned as a more modern Marvel, where stories are shaped and told by communities empowered to co-produce content and share in the profit, all built on a new version of the web. McFedries told her he based Brud’s first project on his years working as a producer and DJ, collaborating with stars like Katy Perry and Steve Aoki and working at Spotify and JJ Abrams’ production company, Bad Robot: Brud would reinvent celebrity. Not to replace McFedries’ famous friends entirely, but to build a more egalitarian system alongside them.</p>



<p>He already had a solid proof-of-concept for how to do this, he told Zhan. He’d designed a character named Lil’ Miquela, or Miquela Sousa, a 19 year-old creative based in Downey, California, that Brud launched on Instagram in 2016. Her account followed a proven influencer formula: candid selfies of her eating ice cream and going to the movies, and confessional videos talking about falling in love or venting about the challenges of making music. At the time of the parking lot call, it was not totally clear to fans that Lil’ Miquela was CGI. Lil’ Miquela was a modest, mysterious Instagram presence with a sprinkle of freckles and notably full lips. Zhan had heard about her as a low-key phenomenon: Was she real? Was she fake? Did it matter? And why were her bangs such an awkward length?</p>



<p>Awkward was the point, explained McFedries. Lil’ Miquela had been designed anticipating a new kind of relationship between celebrities and the public, one in which a celebrity is aspirational, but the artifice is clear. The bangs are both a signifier of authenticity, like magazine spreads reading, “Stars: They’re Just Like Us,” as well as somehow too perfect and air-brushed. Her ethnically ambiguous look was intended to resonate with a diverse generation that expects to see itself reflected in culture like no previous one. “I knew from the beginning that Trevor was special—he had a deep understanding of consumer psychology and an instinct for creating pop culture,” Zhan says. “He was often ahead of the game, and always had a sense for what was next.”</p>


 Lil’ Miquela 2022 


<p></p>



<p>What was next, according to McFedries, was actually going to be two innovations. The first was this new kind of celebrity. McFedries saw, and still sees, some celebrities as auteurs, with powerful new ideas, but he also sees many celebrities as the center of an ecosystem in which the real value comes from the edges: songwriters, designers and writers. But celebrities, and the companies they work with, keep most of the value. If you replaced the middleman celebrity with a virtual celebrity, McFedries imagined, you could distribute value to the people on the edges. By 2016, he knew the technology to create a believable, relatable avatar like Lil’ Miquela existed, and he sensed that consumers would be willing to interact with her. From the manufactured stars of his childhood—he cites the cartoons Alvin and the Chipmunks and Jem and the Holograms, and the human duo Milli Vanilli—McFedries saw that people could love an illustration or a band with a fake backstory. And now that interactions with “real” celebrities were almost exclusively through phone screens—perfect for an avatar—he saw that technology and consumer psychology had converged.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second innovation was a new kind of process. McFedries was into cryptocurrency by 2013 and felt like its ability to assign value to new kinds of products, services and transactions made it uniquely suited for his ultimate goal: To distribute wealth to people on the edges. He figured the how of it all would be worked out as he went, but McFedries had a vision for digital goods running on a blockchain that could allow this virtual celebrity, or any piece of creative work, to be made by a collective working collaboratively as part of an organization across platforms and benefiting directly from the content’s sales or licensing. McFedries’ vision was more opportunity and wealth for the armies of creatives who currently make a fraction of the wealth that a movie, album, TV show or celebrity generates. “I’m really concerned with building better futures for innovators and creative people,” McFedries says. He bet that those improved futures would be built atop virtual economies. He felt that the economies themselves were inevitable—digital tokens were already being accepted as money—and became obsessed with making sure these new economies would not incentivize the same dynamics of traditional economies. He wanted to shift value to the edges of creative communities, even if he wasn’t yet totally sure how that would happen. “There are so many talented people that don’t have a shot,” McFedries says, “so I think about it every day.” Zhan could see the trajectory from Lil’ Miquela to Marvel, but more so, she said she trusted McFedries to create something that could appeal to many.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And she was right to. Today, Lil’ Miquela, who McFedries created alone before joining with collaborator Sara Decou, has 3 million Instagram followers. She is repped by the Hollywood agency CAA, appearing as a CGI avatar in a Calvin Klein video kissing Bella Hadid, modeling for Prada on her Instagram, and releasing singles on Spotify with millions of streams. Sequoia came in as an early investor, backing Brud in 2018, the same year Lil’ Miquela was named one of Time magazine’s most influential people on the internet. By 2021, Brud was valued at $125 million before it was acquired by blockchain game designers Dapper Labs. Today, Lil’ Miquela is one of many avatars creating a new ecosystem of content. But for McFedries, she was his first crucial step toward the new creative economy that he’s building now.</p>

<p>As a skateboarding, X-Men-loving Black kid growing up in Davenport, Iowa, McFedries said he was both a “techno-optimist” and “socio-anarchist.” Davenport is a port town on the Mississippi River; McFedries’ grandfather drove a tugboat and his other grandparents were auctioneers. His mother had tried to make it in Los Angeles as a model and actress, but after McFedries was born, she and his dad split up and she returned home to the Midwest with her 1-year-old. A single mom, she worked in factories for years before studying nursing at community college and later working as a nurse. McFedries remembers how Davenport was so completely defined by its economy—even down to its smell. “Often at night in the summer, you would just smell rotting pigs in the sewers,” he remembers, a result of runoff from the Oscar Mayer plant. That was oddly coupled with the pleasant, familiar smell of the Wonder Bread factory that he would pick up on cross-town drives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>McFedries loved Davenport. He started coding as a hobby and helped his grandparents auction items on eBay, but he had to go to Iowa City to find his scene at a record store. He knew the world was so much bigger outside Davenport, and he wanted to be part of it. Through pop culture—the movie “Hackers,” the WIRED writing of Kevin Kelly—McFedries immersed himself in the nascent internet culture of the ’90s: information wanted to be free, technology could change the world for the better. He was also drawn to more anti-capitalist ideas, listening to a lot of Rage Against the Machine and hardcore punk. He was listening to bands that emphasized overthrowing systems and empowering the poor, “literally eco-terrorists were like playing punk rock about tearing it all down,” he says. Then, in 2002, in the middle of high school, his mother suggested he move to Los Angeles to live with his father. He was a talented athlete, and she said he’d have more opportunities to play sports in college if he moved to a big city. “It was always clear that Davenport wasn’t the center of what’s happening,” says McFedries. “I think I wanted to participate in that center, but I think the only vehicle for me to understand how to do that as a young person was through athletics.” So, at 16, he started making friends and playing football at Beverly Hills High School.</p>



<p>His new friends invited him to their homes, and suddenly he found himself sitting on the couches of the West Coast elite. Some of his friends’ parents were helming massive companies shaping American fashion and culture. He says at first, “there was still this kind of idea that these titans of industry surely must have a skill set that you didn’t.” But, listening to them tell stories, McFedries realized the key to getting paid to be creative was capital, not skills. He saw that they already had money to cushion them by the time they took creative risks. “And so I was like, okay, I need capital,” he says, “and I need the opportunity to take those kinds of risks. I feel like I’m as capable as they are.”</p>



<p>After high school, he received a football scholarship to San José State and began studying software engineering, but he dropped out to move back to Los Angeles and build a reputation—social capital— that he could leverage for actual capital. Like many L.A. strivers before him, McFedries wanted to be seen as a man who had vision, who could forecast a trend or choose the right music or art before, or better than, anyone else. And he could. He DJed Katy Perry concerts and the entire 2008 Warped Tour. That same year he put out a top 10 album as a member of the group Shwayze. He worked in A&amp;R for Photo Finish Records and directed music videos for Steve Aoki and NERVO. He hosted an iHeartRadio show for Dim Mak Records and became a spokesman for VitaminWater. He worked with singers BANKS and Ke$ha. He was an artist advocate at Spotify and an entrepreneur-in-residence at Bad Robot. As McFedries closed in on 30, he decided he’d generated enough social capital to start trading on it. At the same time, he’d developed a new understanding of celebrity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Celebrities are “a team sport,” he says, but only players connected to the biggest names win. The limited opportunity for financial success in creative industries broadly disincentivizes people from joining creative fields, McFedries says. If only a tiny segment of poets, artists or fashion designers can make a living, why try? Why create, especially without a cushion of capital to fall back on? McFedries says flourishing in a creative field is about where you live, and who you know. McFedries can name friends who might’ve been great art directors but, without a path to opportunity, they ended up hanging drywall in Iowa. He can think of bands that might’ve been on par with Red Hot Chili Peppers, but without the social capital of Southern California to propel them, they stalled in Davenport. McFedries doesn’t just see this as a problem for artists; he sees it as a problem for American culture writ large.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This idea of capitalizing on talent, this idea that, as a nation, we should be identifying people who are talented and maximizing their skillset, obviously is one that we fall short of where we should be in the United States.” Without incentives to create, “there are no new ideas,” he says, no new stories from new kinds of people with new perspectives. Instead, old ideas are repackaged, retold and resold by those who own the rights, with the same traditional narratives and limited cast of characters. “All I’m thinking about all day is how to create better incentives for creative people,” McFedries says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Rihanna or Ariana Grande, or whoever they are,” he explains, are “effectively the vehicles for a lot of creative people, whether it’s choreographers or songwriters or producers.” He figured if you could create a digital vehicle, and have it collectively owned by its creators, “there actually would be more margin for creative people and for the business itself.” He envisioned a future of virtual stars who speak any language, with stories and styles built not around the tastes of a few industry executives, but curated by countless creative people, all with a financial and artistic stake in the virtual celebrity. “You could create these celebrities that could create a ton of value,” McFedries says. So he founded Brud in 2014 to prove that avatars could connect with fans and drive value for collaborators.</p>



<p>And it worked. By April 2018, Lil’ Miquela had almost a million followers, enough to beget brand sponsorships and account monetization. She’d shown that, unlike one celebrity who only needs so many makeup artists or choreographers, Lil’ Miquela could do endless work on any number of platforms, creating exponential opportunities for people to work on projects featuring her. McFedries started to expand his team, and in 2018, he invited Nicole de Ayora on board as director of operations. The two bonded over having grown up in small towns and how that shaped their understanding of the internet. “We both really relied on the internet as a way of connecting with people outside of our small communities,” says Nicole. “It was a way of escaping a lot of what we were experiencing at a young age.” She was eager to join McFedries and his small team, now working to grow Lil’ Miquela so the avatar could do more than work with brands and post compelling selfies. The team at Brud wanted her to be able to tell meaningful stories to more people around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brud filled its offices with photographers, writers and CGI artists, and Lil’ Miquela’s online identity grew more elaborate, with new friends and more complex stories. At the same time, she was bumping up against the limits of her world—the platforms on which she was interacting with her fans. The influence of algorithms was becoming more obvious to consumers, hemming in people’s experiences by choosing what they would see, as opposed to people just seeing what popped up in a chronological timeline, or via their own curiosities. McFedries saw this as creating distance between creators and fans. The platforms themselves were increasingly seen as the new economy’s new middlemen, shilling ads, collecting data and soaking up profits. There was pushback against these practices, in the form of laws focused on protecting consumers’ data. In 2018 the General Data Protection Regulation law went into effect in the E.U. and in 2020 California followed suit with its own Consumer Privacy Act. McFedries and de Ayora were looking for a solution that let fans connect and participate more directly. They imagined a future where contributors and fans owned Lil’ Miquela and her projects outright, as a collective, where a limitless amount of creative work could be done across the world, simultaneously and collaboratively. He needed an online cooperative system, not a company, one that could serve thousands of people making all kinds of contributions.</p>



<p>He knew there was a work model for this, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization or DAO. A DAO is a collective that uses cryptocurrency tokens to vote on how to run itself, from putting value on anything created or contributed, to deciding how any profits are distributed. Today, there are thousands of DAOs, some controlling up to billions of dollars in assets, focused on topics including sports gaming, cryptocurrency and governance. The DAOs could solve these collaboration and ownership needs. But as he’s wont to do, McFedries had an even bigger idea. He wanted to enable people to be paid for work typically seen as intangible or non-monetizable. He wanted people to get paid for things like being fun at a party, offering a suggestion on a photo shoot or encouraging a friend with a smart insight.</p>



<p>To bring these ideas together and test them, McFedries co-founded the Friends With Benefits DAO in 2020. He wanted to see if, by inviting the right people to make the right vibes and creative projects, many more people than the DAO could accommodate would want to join, thus driving up the value of the tokens and giving those vibes a tangible worth. “Having a point of view is hard to measure,” says McFedries, “and should be valued. And we should create economic systems that value those things, because otherwise, we’re just perpetuating the same structures of the past.” McFedries has compared a DAO to a Facebook community where the people posting content, those responsible for making the platform interesting and attractive to more people, also share in the value those posts create—rather than that value accruing to a central corporate entity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To flourish financially, the DAO must flourish creatively. McFedries knows creative work is most likely to surface in spaces where people have real relationships and feel supported to try new things. He is working to foster trust and engagement by setting up community principles, organizing people around potential creative projects, with chapters in London, New York and Los Angeles. Today Friends With Benefits has a waitlist and about 6,000 active members, including musicians Erykah Badu and Azealia Banks, as well as lawyers and software engineers. So far, they’ve collaborated to make real-world art and digital art in the form of NFTs. They’ve started a fellowship program for creatives from underrepresented communities, which will offset the entrance free of more than $3,000, and they’re discussing launching a beverage businesses, writing essays on the history of decentralized “benevolent anarchic” organizations (like Alcoholics Anonymous) and forming friendships, all value that McFedries says is being captured in the DAO’s token.&nbsp;</p>


 Trevor McFedries stands against whitewash in Paris. 


<p><br>But even as Friends With Benefits proves his value-to-vibes idea, building new things is always going to get messy, McFedries admits. In 2021, the service that hosted the Friends With Benefits cryptocurrency token was hacked and the token lost 99 percent of its value, essentially making the collective worthless. But the members regrouped, issued a new token and today its price is $11.80, down from a high of just over $186. That, coupled with how Friends With Benefits has been labeled “<a href="https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/greater-la/trash-electricity-cryptocurrency-backyard-restaurant/friends-with-benefits-tokens">the digital Soho House</a>,” means it’s under pressure to live up to the hype. If it doesn’t create notable work, or it’s not fun, the tokens will lose their worth and the DAO becomes just another Discord chat with some meetups. But living near this edge, where value is being assigned to new things in new ways, some of which are still being tested, doesn’t faze McFedries. After reading “Debt: The First 5,000 Years of Money” by the late anarchist anthropologist David Graeber, he found himself asking, “like what the fuck is value?” and he followed that destabilizing thought to a liberating conclusion: It’s whatever we collectively decide it is. “One of the reasons that I love crypto, or an internet of value, is that we have really antiquated vehicles for representing value,” he says. He believes crypto enables better instruments for assigning value to all things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Web3 proponents are sometimes dismissed as wanting to decentralize the web just enough to get some of the power that corporations and celebrities now have for themselves. For example, some people dismiss Lil’ Miquela as just another spokesmodel, and Brud as manipulative of her fans. But with Dapper Labs’ purchase of Brud, McFedries has a mandate to figure this out and help build the tools and habits to make DAOs mainstream enough to realize their promise. He’s the CEO of the new Dapper Collectives. A near-term order of business is handing Lil’ Miquela over to her fans. McFedries and his team are turning Brud the company into Brud the DAO, which he says is scheduled to open to the public at the end of August. Lil’ Miquela will be at its center. Brud will ask members to help write her storylines and contribute to her computer-generated design and 3D artwork. Fans, now collective members, will receive writing and design credits tracked through on-chain resumes. There will be incentives for DAO members to share content to be sold, and then all token-holders will get a cut. As de Ayora, now CPO of Dapper Collectives, puts it, “At the end of the day, we created Lil’ Miquela but they gave her value and meaning.”</p>



<p>For the next while, McFedries cautions, things will look much as they do now, with platforms like TikTok or Instagram capturing a lot of the value of the DAO’s creative work. But if DAOs and other components of Web3 take off, “there will be virtual goods and economies that would be bigger than (people) could ever dream of…we’re starting to cross that chasm now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of this is taking McFedries, and maybe the rest of us, toward his biggest goals: sustainable financial futures for creative people and connecting everyday people, like the ones he grew up with in Davenport, with the kinds of opportunity he saw when he moved to Beverly Hills. “If you can…reach out across the divide, and give them the opportunities and the language…, we can have this improved capitalization of talent,” he says.</p>



<p>There are success stories in these new budding economies: an FWB artist went from being broke to buying a house during the pandemic. A writer sold an NFT of his essay for about $150,000. Outside FWB, artists have found that DAOs have kept them in the creative game longer than they’d imagined possible. McFedries knows this is just the start of something, a potential alternative to the systems that he sees countless people trapped in. He also knows it’s an urgently needed alternative. He thinks constantly about all the people who never earn the real value of the work they do. All the people who can’t afford to take the big risks his high school friends’ parents did, or who never left Davenport and instead watched its factories close. He knows he got lucky when he moved to L.A., to the center of a scene he fit into and shaped—and that most people never get that chance. Ask him how often he’s hit with the realization that his friends back in Davenport might’ve been just as successful as the creators he knows in L.A. and he doesn’t hesitate: “It really happens every day,” he says. “And that’s why I want to make big things.”</p>

<p>As we mentioned in our <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-1-0/">last blog post</a> regarding release 5.1.0, the Zcash network is processing a significantly increased number of shielded transactions. The network remains stable and secure, transactions are being processed normally, and we are making additional performance improvements to both the <code>zcashd</code> wallet and full node as part of release 5.2.0.</p>



<p>We also have a cross-functional team working on performance improvements to our mobile wallet SDKs. Upcoming releases will focus on performance improvements in the SDK, which should translate to improved performance of third-party mobile wallets.</p>



 Node performance improvements 



<p>Transactions are fully checked by nodes when they are received on the network, whether they appear first in the mempool or in a block. However, some of these checks are expensive, so it’s best to perform them once and cache the results. If the checks are successful, they are not performed again.</p>



<p>As of this release, Sapling and Orchard zk-SNARK proofs are now leveraging this caching mechanism to avoid redundant verification costs and reduce block-verification time. This speeds up block propagation on the network (as this release is adopted by users) and improves the performance of nodes which produce block templates for miners.</p>



<p>In addition, this release backports more efficient caching and SHA256 implementations from upstream Bitcoin.</p>



 Wallet performance improvements 



<p>The wallet now performs trial decryption of Sapling outputs in batches and parallelizes these batches to improve scanning performance.</p>



<p>In addition, some inefficiencies in the <code>zcashd</code> wallet were identified and fixed in this release.</p>



 RPC interface changes 



<p>This release adds a version field to the <code>gettransaction</code> RPC call so that users do not need to make an extra <code>getrawtransaction</code> call just to receive the version of a transaction.</p>



<p>The<a href="https://z.cash/support/schedule/"> Zcash Schedule page</a> will be updated to reflect the 5.2.0 release.</p>

<p></p><p>In order to reach its long-term goal of becoming a universal currency, bitcoin needs to acquire two qualities that are essential to every form of sound money: privacy and fungibility. In the case of privacy, it’s important that the identities of the BTC transaction sender and receiver remain unknown to every unwanted third party. For fungibility, every bitcoin amount needs to have the same degree of acceptance for payments, regardless of the money’s origins. In other words, we need to make this global digital currency work just like physical cash.</p><p>This article will explain the current asymmetry between privacy and fungibility, while also introducing the ways in which the new Wasabi 2.0 wallet can bridge the two worlds. The problem: privacy vs fungibility.</p><p>Given the open ledger architecture of the Bitcoin network, watching all transactions is one of the features which guarantees the integrity of the financial policy. Seeing the amount getting sent in every transaction reassures every node that nobody breaks the rules by introducing unwanted inflation into the monetary system. And in some cases, revealing the identity behind an address creates an extra level of trust – as is the case of big exchanges, investment funds, charity foundations and fundraisers. Yet the issue is that every time &nbsp;the identity of an active address is revealed, everyone else’s privacy gets damaged. This is why obfuscation mechanisms are required.</p><p>CoinJoins are a great way to increase the privacy of bitcoin senders, as they break the link between the current owner and the previous transactions. However, this obfuscation technique is observable on the public blockchain, almost always finds itself in a numeric minority as compared to other transactions and can therefore create fungibility issues.</p><p>In a perfect world, privacy should improve fungibility. But if there are only a few privacy users, then they can get rejected by other participants. In order for privacy to create fungibility, a certain tipping point needs to be reached: bitcoiners must mix their coins in an overwhelming majority and thus successfully obliterate any claim that using privacy hides criminal actions. Similarly, Bitcoin at large has managed to break away from its Silk Road reputation by onboarding more users with no criminal record, who transact in good faith in a completely legal way.</p><p>Another side of the debate concerns the fact that fungibility is a pretty utopian concept for technical, practical and economic reasons. Technically, not all bitcoins are created equal: they carry different cryptographic hashes, get added to the supply by different competing miners and change hands in different patterns that may please some users while displeasing others. Practically every Bitcoin node has its own blacklist and every miner can choose to not include transactions that come from unwanted addresses. Bitcoin enables censorship by design and it’s only through incentives and social norms that fungibility can work.</p><p>But then again, cash also gets tainted by every user’s fingerprints and may get censored according to serial numbers. Yet it’s thanks to everyone’s agreement that a one - dollar bill is equal with every other one - dollar bill &nbsp;regardless of its origins that we have economic fungibility and privacy is one of the socially-accepted benefits.</p><p>Last but not least, there’s the economic dimension of BTC fungibility. There are two extremes involved in this debate: the users of non-custodial wallets and the regulated custodians (exchanges, banks, and mutual funds). If all the coins get withdrawn from custodians, then there won’t be any government-controlled entities to undergo financial censorship – and therefore bitcoin becomes fungible within the technical and practical limits described above. On the other hand, the coins can also become fungible is the custodians get their hands on every unit – ironically, centralized KYC exchanges like Kraken and Coinbase are actually pretty good mixers which also grant the funds a fairly certain degree of fungibility. But fungibility must not come at the expense of turning bitcoin into an Orwellian money system, in which custodians have absolute control.</p><p>The bad news is that the amount of bitcoins deposited on exchanges has been constantly high for the last 5 years. These exchanges have become increasingly draconian in terms of rejecting specific transactions, and established policies against transaction privacy even in the absence of clear regulatory frameworks. The good news is that there is balance between the custodially-owned and the sovereign bitcoins and the amount of coins on exchanges doesn’t seem to increase too greatly. But since none of the ownership extremes is winning and we want a situation in which privacy generates fungibility, we need to start building bridges. In this design, we must consider the properties of cash and build both the tools and the social norms which help us always agree that every bitcoin unit is equal to any other one. Wasabi 2.0 marks a promising beginning in this direction. </p> Bridging Bitcoins with Wasabi 2.0 <p>Launched in 2018 on the 10th anniversary of the Bitcoin White Paper, Wasabi 1.0 has proven to every privacy enthusiast that BTC is the only currency that they should be using. The combined power of the non custodial experience, the automatic routing of the internet connection via Tor, the sovereign setup which puts users in control of their public key without having to trust a third party and the easy CoinJoins still makes blockchain analysts scratch their heads in an attempt to make guesses. Furthermore, users can also access their hardware wallets in Wasabi – thus granting them a greater amount of privacy than most of the native applications. Nonetheless, the design of Wasabi 1.0 isn’t perfect. Users can still make privacy-damaging mistakes such as reusing addresses or combining private UTXOs with tracked ones for disastrous outcomes that reveal a lot of information. Another big mistake is also that of recombining UTXOs after a CoinJoin – it basically defeats the purpose as the previous state of the coins gets reconstructed and a careful analyst will simply bypass the CoinJoin part to keep on following the money. Then there are the deterring reasons which have &nbsp;kept users away from Wasabi. The biggest one being the minimum amount to CoinJoin: back in late 2018, 0.1 BTC was approximately $400; but at the new all-time high of $69k, one tenth of a bitcoin was equivalent to $6900.</p><p>Many users didn’t CoinJoin with Wasabi specifically because they could not afford to but thanks to the WabiSabi protocol that’s embedded in version 2.0, smaller amounts are welcome to get mixed with the bigger ones coming from whales. Also, there’s the privacy FUD which made bitcoiners fear the idea of mixing. It’s exactly the “your BTC might get dirtier” argument that influencers such as Trace Mayer have been pushing for years. The idea behind CoinJoins is to make every monetary unit just as clean and just as dirty – and therefore fungible. Wasabi 2.0 definitely makes it easier for every user to CoinJoin, thanks to the auto-pilot experience which automatically makes the best decisions for your privacy. The software is open source and you’re strongly encouraged to verify it, so every ounce of trust gets replaced by the certainty of good faith.</p><p>Last but not least, the issue of zkSNACKs' censorship-friendly CoinJoin coordinator needs to be addressed. This is where everyone must understand the difference between the free open source software and the company behind it. Wasabi 2.0 is a non-custodial privacy wallet which doesn’t know who you are and empowers any individual or organization to run their own coordinator. If the default coordinator must abide by certain rules that don’t please certain privacy advocates, it doesn’t mean that these privacy advocates can’t tailor the software to suit their needs. As a matter of fact, having multiple coordinators for CoinJoins is largely beneficial for bitcoin privacy.</p><p>To zkSNACKs, the main priority is to be able to incentivize the 80+ developers and code contributors to keep on working towards building the best privacy wallet technology. Everyone is free to use Wasabi 2.0 however they please, there are certainly use cases that a registered company can’t support or endorse, and this is why you can switch the CoinJoin coordinator without needing to fork the code or make any other modifications. The bootstrapping of alternative Wasabi 2.0 CoinJoin coordination servers is instantaneous and easy.</p><p>As a side effect of the blacklisting of certain UTXOs that are associated with criminal activities, the fungibility of the mixes might get boosted. Previously, exchanges and other regulated businesses would flag incoming transactions whose immediate history is associated with CoinJoin rounds specifically because they needed to verify that the money doesn’t come from illegal activities. Now that the ZK Snacks coordinator will automatically decline UTXOs that exchanges don’t like, the exchanges themselves will have no excuse to reject any CoinJoins from this coordinator. This means that the CoinJoins will have the potential to go mainstream and help users transferring BTC from Coinbase to Kraken without informing the two entities about the ways in which some of the money might have been previously spent.</p><p>Wasabi 2.0 is a bridge for three reasons: it makes privacy easier, more affordable, and more acceptable. Anyone will be able to use the wallet correctly without making rookie consolidation mistakes that ruin the CoinJoin effort. Everyone will be able to use the open-source software with the CoinJoin coordinator that they like the most and poses the smallest amount of compromises. And thanks to a &nbsp;less popular move, exchanges will have no valid reasons to reject or even flag CoinJoin transactions.</p><p>Wasabi 2.0 bridges regulated institutions and cypherpunks. It bridges privacy advocates with the software that they’re going to want to use to coordinate their own mixes. And ultimately, it bridges privacy and fungibility. Thanks to Wasabi 2.0, bitcoin might just become as private and fungible as physical cash.<br><br></p>

<p>As cryptocurrencies opened the door for a new generation of users of financial products, we’re witnessing the increasing extent of regulations that are gradually coming into play. On one hand, the crypto ecosystem and participants see KYC/AML practices as a threat to privacy, data security, and <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-road-to-decentralization-part-1-setting-our-foundations-2e7e3874c09e/">decentralization</a>. Meanwhile, regulators are more concerned with terrorism financing and other activities that involve money laundering.</p><p>Regulatory compliance is an everyday discussion for those working in crypto and the traditional financial sector. As the rate of financial crimes <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/04/05/2416357/0/en/Feedzai-s-Financial-Crime-Report-233-Increase-in-Online-Fraud-Attack-Rates.html">continues to rise</a> and financial systems progressively digitalize, governments are trying to eradicate money laundering, terrorism financing and prevent financial breaches.</p><p>In this article, we will make a case for and against the concept of two of the most well-known regulatory practices, KYC and AML, and explore innovations that restore the public's trust in regulation and achieve compliance without sacrificing users’ right to privacy.</p> What are KYC/AML practices? <p>KYC and AML practices are standard regulatory policies guiding the operations of financial institutions. They are part of the laid-down rules for businesses that offer financial services to the public within a particular geographical area, e.g., cryptocurrency exchanges.</p><p>KYC and AML are terms often used interchangeably, yet they do not share the same meaning. KYC is only one of the several steps that financial institutions and businesses in general take to comply with AML regulations.</p><p>KYC, short for Know-Your-Customer, refers to the checks and steps that a business conducts/takes to know who their customers are, confirm their identities, and understand the risk that each customer poses to the business. Usually, the first phase of KYC procedures requires collecting customer information, followed by customer due diligence, which involves identity verification, watchlist screening, and risk assessment. For high-risk customers or high-value transactions, KYC via enhanced due diligence policies comes into play.</p><p>AML, short for Anti-Money-Laundering, is the wider set of steps that financial institutions and businesses take to prevent bad actors from moving their illicit gains. Principally, AML regulations hinder global criminal activities like terrorist financing and block the movement of funds owned by drug rings, human traffickers, and other criminals. Typical AML programs involve transaction monitoring, Know-Your-Customer practices, identifying and reporting suspicious transactions to regulators, record keeping and auditing, etc.</p> Why are crypto believers often against KYC/AML? <p>KYC and AML practices are common in crypto, with centralized exchanges readily adopting them to comply with global financial regulations. It is not unusual for big exchanges like Coinbase or Binance to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/05/12/so-many-locked-out-binance-users-say-their-accounts-have-been-frozen-for-months/">suspend accounts</a> and pause withdrawals for some users due to suspicious account activity under the pretense of complying with these regulations.</p><p>These measures, as well as the large amounts of data users need to provide to comply, as well as data breaches in the space, have raised concerns in the crypto space, where user privacy and decentralization are founding concepts and seen as the highest standards. However, critics have a hard time explaining how else bad actors could be discouraged from 'cleaning' illicit money through cryptocurrencies.</p> Arguments for &amp; against KYC/AML <p>As the popular saying goes, every coin has two sides. The common KYC/AML practices solve many regulatory and compliance issues for financial institutions but create problems with data laws, data security, and privacy.</p> In favor of KYC/AML  Regulation <p>Money laundering and other financial crimes usually have to go through banks, and one way to prevent or combat these crimes is to regulate the money flowing through institutions. Without KYC/AML, bad actors would have a field day when moving proceeds from illegal businesses. Because of this, most jurisdictions frown at platforms that require no identity disclosure.</p> Compliance <p>As regulators in the financial sector and governments seek to combat financial crime, terrorism financing, and the movement of illicit money, they hold banks and exchanges responsible for their customers' actions. When a financial institution partners with individuals or organizations without being fully aware of their past and present business dealings, it leaves them prone to being hit by lawsuits and fines. Between 2008 and 2018, financial institutions have had to pay over $25 billion in <a href="https://go.fenergo.com/global-regulatory-fines-2018.html">penalties</a> due to KYC/AML violations and other slipups related to global sanctions.</p><p>No business has the ultimate goal of losing money to such avoidable incidents; hence, the strict implementation of KYC/AML. If only for their own benefit, institutions try to remain compliant with financial laws. In this sense, you could say that incentives are set in place for marketplaces, banks, and crypto exchanges to stay on top of the activity going on within them.</p> Against KYC/AML  Privacy <p>Most of the benefits of effective KYC and AML practices go to the businesses enforcing them, while users are left with several doubts and questions. Today, many see KYC and AML requirements as data harvesting endeavors, with concerns over data safety, security, and usage growing. Many believe that in providing personal information to pass KYC verification exercises, users give away their privacy rights.</p><p>Once too often data breaches from these platforms have ended up in the hands of malicious actors. Users’ sensitive data getting <a href="https://www.upguard.com/blog/biggest-data-breaches">hacked</a> or leaked from big organizations has become almost a <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/data-breaches-are-almost-the-norm-for-many-businesses-these-days">norm lately</a>. Because of this, many have genuine concerns regarding data protection and questions about the rationale of KYC practices.</p><p>In the crypto space, pseudonymity is precious, but most big exchanges require customers to fulfill KYC verification to access their services or increase their capabilities. Most users also believe these businesses leverage their personal information in untoward ways, such as to sell them to advertisers.</p> Data Security <p>As we have seen above, data breaches are fairly common. This worries more than one user, as criminals can access sensitive information like credit card details or addresses by hacking into financial institutions' databases. </p>The top 50 biggest data breaches from 2004 to 2021. (<a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/visualizing-the-50-biggest-data-breaches-from-2004-2021/">Source</a>)<p>Since KYC/AML practices require users to provide sensitive information to third parties, individuals are worried over companies' ability to keep their data safe and away from the reach of fraudsters. It’s worth noting that data is often not just reviewed once and then discarded, but goes on to form part of data bases forever.</p> Data Laws <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>) law came into force in 2018, forcing regulated institutions to review their operations regarding customer data. <br></p><p>On the surface, the GDPR appears to contradict KYC/AML practices. Yet, the regulation only insists on the right ways to collect, use, and secure customer data, in which some KYC/AML procedures fail the compliance test. In other words, these procedures often do not store and handle user data following legal specifications.</p>Scope of GDPR. (<a href="https://www.onelogin.com/compliance/gdpr">Source</a>)<p>The seven principles of the GDPR are as follows:</p>  Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency.  Purpose limitation.  Data minimization.  Accuracy.  Storage limitation.  Integrity and confidentiality (security).  Accountability.  <p>KYC and AML practices depend on data sharing, especially between companies and third parties, e.g., foreign entities. Also, some businesses outsource their KYC procedures. </p><p>Data sharing and KYC outsourcing directly contradict the GDPR, which only permits data transfers for important reasons of public interest. Some institutions alo hold customer information for unspecified periods after their partnerships have ended, directly contradicting the storage limitation principle of the GDPR.</p> ZK proofs &amp; decentralized identifiers: The future of KYC/AML <p>As the concepts of KYC/AML practices and privacy concerns continue to be debated, organizations are beginning to devise new methods to remain compliant with KYC, AML and GDPR laws. Companies have begun to deploy innovations like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption">homomorphic encryption</a> and secure multi-party computation to enhance customer privacy and allow access to the information needed for KYC and AML procedures.</p><p>The crypto space, however, continues to be skeptical about these new methods, as they fail to give users control over their digital identity. Instead of them, other more decentralized options are under development, some of which can allow users to gain more control over their data.</p><p>For example, self-sovereign identity on the blockchain has been endlessly quoted as &nbsp;“the future of digital identification”. Other cryptographic innovations like <a href="https://hackernoon.com/eli5-zero-knowledge-proof-78a276db9eff">zero-knowledge proofs</a> (ZK Proofs) and <a href="https://tykn.tech/decentralized-identifiers-dids/">decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs) also lead the way in the race to replace traditional KYC/AML procedures.</p> How ZK Proofs will replace KYC/AML <p>Popular for its successful implementation in creating privacy on the blockchain, the concept of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) is a proven way of confirming a transaction/ownership without revealing sensitive information about its underlying data. Identity solutions based on this, such as Polygon’s <a href="https://blog.polygon.technology/introducing-polygon-id-zero-knowledge-own-your-identity-for-web3/">Polygon ID</a>, utilize ZKPs.</p><p>ZKP-based KYC solutions are superior to their traditional counterparts in that traditional KYC solutions require users to share their information across several platforms repeatedly. With ZKPs, users can present all needed documents to a trusted KYC provider to verify their identities and issue a ZKP. This proof can then be used for subsequent KYC verification exercises without sharing the information therein.</p>Proving a true statement without revealing the data by leveraging zero-knowledge proofs. (<a href="https://anteelo.com/zero-knowledge-proof-its-role-in-the-blockchain-world/">Source</a>)<p>ZK Proofs are on-chain activities, and blockchain ledgers are immutable, which implies that whatever information the zero-knowledge proof holds is true and has remained unchanged since its verification. Trust is restored between KYC providers, businesses, and the end-users, and individuals can remain in full control of their data. </p><p>ZKPs also allow for selective disclosures: in special circumstances only, and with users' consent, a KYC provider may disclose users' information to a trusted third party like law enforcement agencies. For example, <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Panther Protocol</a> enables users to leverage features such as Panther <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol/protocol/panthers-core-components/zk-and-non-zk-reveals">Reveals</a> which generate zero-knowledge reports to voluntarily disclose compliance with select counterparties.</p> How Decentralized Identifiers can replace KYC/AML <p>A decentralized identifier, DID, refers to a cryptographically verifiable framework that consists of information (documents, certificates, and other personally identifiable information) unique to an individual or organization. With a <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/03/05/decentralized-identity-using-blockchain/">DID</a>, users can store identifiers like government-issued identity documents, etc., in a private wallet built on a public blockchain.</p><p>Traditional KYC practices require users to submit information which in turn is verified by a centralized registration authority. Decentralized identifiers do a similar job, with the difference that the user can control how much information they give out. Entities can then verify the information provided via a blockchain-based ledger to determine its authenticity.</p>The standard elements of a DID doc. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_identifier">Source</a>)<p>With DIDs, users can prove they are above a certain age limit, for instance, without disclosing their exact date of birth. Since users can create identifiers using trusted systems on the blockchain, private data exchange between individuals and businesses is possible. Thanks to this, traditional KYC/AML practices can give way to a more practical framework, where businesses can remain compliant with regulations and collect data without threatening privacy, data security, and breaching data laws.</p> Closing Thoughts <p>Most crypto users are increasingly concerned with identity verification or KYC procedures. However, most importantly, they are concerned with whatever happens to their data after it is collected. Especially when it comes to users’ sensitive data associated with their financial transactions, KYC procedures are being questioned by privacy and security advocates. </p><p>With cryptographic concepts like zero-knowledge proofs and decentralized identifiers (DID), individuals can pass KYC checks without giving out sensitive information and yet achieve regulatory compliance.</p><p>By leveraging zero-knowledge technology, banks, cryptocurrency exchanges, and other regulated institutions can access customer information without violating their privacy, prevent data breaches, and stay compliant with data protection laws — a win-win situation for everyone.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

<p>Privacy in DeFi is much needed. </p><p>In an ecosystem that grows bigger and more composable every day, the possibility for attackers to take advantage of blockchains' transparency to attack users increases. In contrast, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/miner-extractable-value-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly/">automatic MEV attacks</a> become more common by the day. If we want adoption to increase by orders of magnitude, users need to be guaranteed a base degree of privacy.</p><p>So, why has nobody succeeded (<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/privacy-finance-why-panther-is-different-and-necessary-e423b2993df9/">yet</a>) in providing a base level of privacy? In this article, based on <a href="https://twitter.com/anishmohammed">Anish Mohammed</a>'s (Panther Co-Founder, CTO, and Chief Scientist) <a href="https://youtu.be/_6O_C6fiuQg">talk at EthCC Paris 2022</a>, we'll look into:</p>  The economic challenges behind private DeFi.  How to price privacy correctly.  The adversarial games that keep the clock ticking for blockchain privacy.  What a solution to the current challenges might look like.  <p></p> Illustrating the base difficulties of privacy in DeFi <p>To understand why DeFi privacy is inherently challenging, let’s look at one of the most widespread, straightforward models –Automated Market Makers.</p><p>In an <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-an-automated-market-maker-amm">AMM</a>, there are two pools of assets, which users trade against. By withdrawing assets from one side of the pool and adding to the other, users drive price fluctuations for both assets, which stabilize the system through arbitrage opportunities.</p><p>Privacy for AMMs is difficult because obscuring balance and trade amounts from possible attackers is insufficient: by looking into on-chain data, it’s still possible to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.01193.pdf">reconstruct</a> the history of transactions.</p><p>To mitigate this, some proposed strategies include:</p>  Batching: It’s possible to merge a set of transactions into a batch. Rollups are essentially batching mechanisms with scalability and possibly privacy advantages.  <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html">ZK rollups</a>, which can provide privacy and batch transactions by default. In a batching scenario, an attacker doesn’t have information about individual transactions anymore, only about their average.  Adding randomness in price: Akin to a noise-generation function, adding an element of uncertainty —essentially an error margin— can increase privacy. This occurs on each block, as a random offset is added to the price the constant function would give based on the pool’s parameters. An attacker would be <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1101.pdf">no longer able</a> to estimate the pool’s balance or trade amounts from the price difference between two blocks. This solution's costs mainly affect liquidity providers, as the user exchanging assets would know the price before making the trade.  Differential privacy: <a href="https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~franklin/ecs289/2010/dwork_2008.pdf">Differential privacy,</a> similarly to added randomness, muffles information about individual transactions while guaranteeing that the general properties of the dataset are not changed. This could be applied to many parts of the DeFi algorithm, with one <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1101.pdf">implementation</a> already theorized. Large trades within a block could be broken down into smaller trades and reordered, maintaining the average impact and protecting a user against being front-run.  <p></p> Problems with batching (including batching in rollups) <p>One obvious issue with batching is that, by being unable to execute in real-time, DeFi users miss out on time-critical strategies, which become unfeasible with batching. In other words, in the time that it takes for a batch to gather all participants’ transactions, MEV attacks or other traders get a larger-than-usual window of opportunity.</p><p>Additionally, due to averages and the inability of traders to know the order of transactions in a batch, some participants will enjoy better prices than others. We can think of this as an associated inefficiency.</p>Graphical representation of the problem discussed above. While, on average, users within a rollup or batch cause the same overall impact on the system, their personal outcomes can be very unpredictable and vary wildly.<p></p> Problems with differential privacy in decentralized settings <p>Privacy under a decentralized setting has inherent cost disadvantages against privacy in centralized systems. It is harder to achieve privacy in decentralized systems because:</p>  Decentralized consensus has a cost. In a setting with no trusted parties, efforts need to be concentrated on making sure that the system is attack-proof. In other words, centralized systems only need to worry about executing a task and maintaining public trust, while decentralized systems have to bear the non-negligible cost of keeping decentralized.  Unlike what is usually believed, communication overhead can also have a significant cost, especially for time-critical applications. Decentralized consensus requires that all participants are informed of everything going on, while a centralized service provider simply keeps a single, efficient internal database. The former requires constant communication between hundreds or thousands of participants, while the latter is virtually free of that overhead. An aggravating factor is that, at times, communication costs <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.04234.pdf">do not rise linearly</a>; they worsen as the number of participants in a system increases.  <p>The above considerations create an economic dilemma: assuming either no regulatory requirements such as GDPR, or that their impact is negligible, the cost of maintaining a private system is higher than that of maintaining a system without privacy. Similarly, decentralized privacy is more expensive to achieve than centralized privacy, albeit a centrally-controlled private system creates obvious less-than-ideal power dynamics.</p><p>Adversarial dynamics can be seen in <a href="https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/ai/adversarial-machine-learning">technology</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08862">healthcare</a>, and other areas of daily life. Corporations that (advertently or otherwise) collect data from users <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/10/20/how-is-big-data-analytics-using-machine-learning/">get to benefit</a> from machine learning applications to improve their products and targeting.</p><p>Because of this, even in centralized competition, the honest competitor faces a disadvantage. However, there is a hope that, in a decentralized solution, the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ciocentral/2012/04/16/the-big-cost-of-big-data/">lack of overhead</a> and cost spread can drive the “privacy disadvantage” to be lower than the added costs of collecting and processing data.</p><p></p> The need to price privacy <p>To succeed, at least from an economic standpoint, a decentralized privacy system must:</p>  Spread its costs as much as possible. It’s possible that a decentralized private system will never be the cheapest option available, but the cost could become bearable enough for its advantages to beat the associated costs (e.g., if the cost would be $0.1 per transaction). Users need to bear these costs for the system to be truly decentralized.  Privacy comes in many layers. The costs of privacy will naturally be higher in extremely private applications. Nonetheless, each user’s risk tolerance will determine whether a weaker privacy solution is sufficient to shield them against their most likely attackers. Privacy tools should ideally be as flexible as possible to allow this privacy price discovery and maximize participation.  Derive its privacy from user-driven actions. Similar to how Bitcoin miners earn from verifying blocks, a decentralized ecosystem can reward users for participating in a protocol, which aids overall privacy. In this system, users being rewarded for “feeding” a privacy algorithm substitutes the need to add artificial randomness.  <p>In the condition set above, private system users “pay” for the rewards that the rest receive for creating the right conditions. As such, it’s even possible to devise a system in which there are several “tiers” of privacy, each with a separate cost, to create even more desirable conditions. This is illustrated in the table below, following the example of how data could be used to improve targeting and products:</p>While a “sweet spot” can be desirable for most, there are certainly cases in which a user may desire no privacy. Or, on the opposite, they might desire for their data to be fully scrapped of all utility to gain privacy.<p></p> A tool to solve seemingly contradicting needs <p>The privacy problem in DeFi presents the need for a tool that satisfies radically different –even contradictory– needs. </p><p>On the one hand, the radical transparency of Layer-1 blockchains has helped them arrive at their current growth stage in a decentralized fashion. On the other, privacy is the only way users can be fully safe utilizing them. </p><p>There is one way in which DeFi users can access total privacy that is fully compliant while retaining full control and ownership of their data. And as this technology and its game-theoretical design are no small feature, they are often referred to as moon math.</p><p></p> Introducing zero-knowledge proofs <p><a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Proof%20Systems/The_Knowledge_Complexity_Of_Interactive_Proof_Systems.pdf">First introduced in 1989</a>, zero-knowledge proofs are a relatively new concept in the context of mathematics, cryptography, and computer science. In the last decade, the advancements in this field have been numerous. These breakthroughs allowed many practical applications to be developed, especially in the cryptocurrency space.</p><p>For those not already familiar with the term, a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a proof for a statement that does not convey more knowledge than the mere fact that the statement is true. </p><p>Imagine magician A wants to prove to person B that A can leave a room without using the only door, but doesn’t want to reveal his secrets. A can simply ask to be let inside the room, for B to lock the door and keep an eye on it from outside, and then somehow A will appear outside the room. This proves the claim was correct, but no extra information about A’s methods was revealed: a zero-knowledge proof.</p><p></p> What are ZKPs good for? <p>Zero-knowledge proofs have been some of the most powerful tools to build crypto privacy solutions. Currently, they’re being utilized to scale blockchains by applying ZKPs to batch transactions off-chain, having privacy as an auspicious side-effect. Although, as we have seen, rollups create issues of their own.</p><p>The gains in scalability due to using rollups can be significant, as demonstrated by the table below:</p>Currently, ZK rollups are the scalability solution that affords the highest transaction output. (Source: <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html">vitalik.ca</a>)<p>The current applications for zero-knowledge proofs have just barely scratched the surface of what’s possible for them. As a general-purpose tool, ZKPs can be used in any situation that requires users to provide proof of status/ownership. They also enable them to prove the above without disclosing the underlying data, which from an economic and privacy perspective means that:</p>  DeFi users can be protected by default privacy (or access it in different layers) and then progressively pay for subsequent disclosures.  These solutions can be accessed in a scalable, more affordable manner.  A system with the right incentives can rely on ZKPs to create private batched transactions.  <p>It remains a matter of speculation what the creation of such a system can achieve in a real-world setting. However, if executed correctly, it could result in an end-to-end private experience of utilizing DeFi for users, as well as a mechanism to put a price on privacy organically.</p><p></p> Conclusion <p>As we have seen, there is no such thing as a free lunch when it comes to blockchain privacy.</p><p>Competing on price with centralized systems is non-trivial, as existing privacy-preserving tech applications are not efficient enough. Alternatives like zkSNARKs and scalability solutions, however, make it more likely that this problem can be solved when approached from the right angle.</p><p>In a race to the bottom between privacy-preserving and non-privacy-preserving solutions, incentives are key to making the former stand a chance against products that can grow and iterate faster, becoming stronger.</p><p>Along with incentives, a dynamic pricing of privacy is also vital. If users have incentives to pay extra for higher privacy (therefore incentivizing strategies that provide privacy to others), it’s possible to lower the price of privacy for all, making the system more robust and attractive.</p><p>We are at a breaking point for the development and application of ZKPs. The next few years will be key in determining how far privacy in DeFi goes when aided by them.</p><p></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

 Introducing Coinbase Security Prompt — a safer and easier way of signing into&nbsp;Coinbase <p>Siyu Liu, Senior Product Manager; Chetan Rane, Product&nbsp;Manager</p><p>Tl;Dr: We are excited to introduce the Coinbase Security Prompt: a faster and safer way for our users to verify their identity &amp; activities when interacting with the Coinbase ecosystem.</p><p>At Coinbase, we believe that our users need to have access to the best security possible without sacrificing ease and convenience. Providing a safe, secure, and easy-to-use platform that users trust is our continuous commitment to all of our current and future customers. That’s why, we require all Coinbase accounts to use 2-Factor Authentication (2FA). 2FA is a security layer on top of username and password. Accounts with 2FA enabled require users to provide their password (first “factor”) and a 2FA code (second “factor”) when signing in. While Coinbase offers both hardware key and authenticator app support on both web and mobile for 2FA, many customers appreciate the convenience of&nbsp;SMS.</p><p>Thinking about that, we’re now going one step further in keeping our users’ accounts secure via Coinbase Security Prompt, a simpler, faster and safer 2FA method that improves overall account security. How? Instead of sending an SMS code, the new Coinbase Security Prompt sends users a push notification to their Coinbase mobile app, asking if they are trying to sign in. Now with Coinbase Security Prompts, users can authenticate a login action with a simple tap on their&nbsp;phone:</p><p>Our customers will automatically have a stronger security without losing the ease and convenience of using their phones, from anywhere. It reduces the risk of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHnaz-qWvJs&amp;list=PL0zEUTVaoPOzxJvrFFNwpNyCoi_M-k3DE&amp;index=3">phishing attacks</a> by providing detailed information about where the request is coming from, such as the location or browser&nbsp;type.</p><p>Starting in July through the rest of 2022, all of our eligible* users will gradually start to be automatically enrolled to complete their 2FA via Security Prompts. Users who are still receiving SMS codes as their 2FA method can get access to Coinbase Security Prompts by <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/other/what-mobile-devices-does-coinbase-support">downloading the Coinbase&nbsp;app</a>.</p><p>*Eligible users are those who have an active mobile login session, trying to login from a second device and are using our latest Coinbase app&nbsp;version.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/introducing-coinbase-security-prompt-a-safer-and-easier-way-of-signing-into-coinbase-502d7b377c64">Introducing Coinbase Security Prompt — a safer and easier way of signing into Coinbase</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com">The Coinbase Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Thank you for your message. I will copy the questions and put the answers after them.</p>
<p>Is the categorization unique to Bitcoin (or UTXO blockchains)? That is, consider a non-UTXO coin, or even, a privacy coin, would all 4 categories remain, or how would it change?</p>
<p>Indeed, not all privacy attack categories can be applied to other blockchains. Some of the attacks are specific to Bitcoin. For instance, the multi-input ownership heuristic relates to the UTXO-based blockchains; however, in privacy coins such as Zcash or Monero, it is not considered. Zcash and Monoro tried to solve the problems by ZKP (in Zcash) and RingCT (in Monero). Therefore, the attacker can not assume that all the inputs belong to the same user. Actually, in Zcash shielded pool, none of the inputs can be detected. However, it can perfectly work in Zcash’s non-shielded pool because the non-shielded pool is similar to Bitcoin, where everyone can see the inputs.</p>
<p>What is the story behind using RFC6973 as a criterion for (sort of) defining and standardizing what are the particular characteristics of privacy for internet protocols?</p>
<p>We used RFC6973 for this paper since the Internet protocol documents are widely used in the DIDs community. We tried to map these privacy issues to what the community considers.</p>
<p>Are there other criteria widely discussed in the space, and if so, how was RFC6973 selected for the research?</p>
<p>Indeed in blockchain privacy, we have to refer to the related scientific papers; however, the terminology provided by Pfitzmann and Hansen in <a href="https://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de/literatur/Anon_Terminology_v0.28.pdf">Anon-Terminology</a> is an excellent source for privacy criteria. These criteria can be adopted and reformulated in the blockchain area.</p>

         New Partnership: From Spring Reflections to Summer Health            <p>Ellen and her team are making health care accessible with one simple text.</p>  <p>By Alfred Lin</p><p>Published July 25, 2022</p>       



      Alfred and Ellen at Sequoia Base Camp.      



 
 
   
<p>We had heard about a young powerhouse executive at Hims &amp; Hers, but we didn’t get to meet Ellen DaSilva until April 2020. Our originally scheduled coffee meeting, planned to discuss her potentially joining Sequoia’s Scout program, moved to Zoom in the midst of the chaos and lockdowns of COVID. It would have been understandable if she had canceled or postponed. It also would have been understandable if the tone of the meeting was pessimistic, awkward or dark. But that wouldn’t be Ellen. Even with a bunch of curve balls thrown at her, her effervescence came through Zoom. She spoke with enthusiasm for consumer health businesses and clearly believed people were being underserved by most current options. We were blown away by her clarity of thought, and invited her to be a Scout.</p>



<p>A year later, Ellen and her husband welcomed their second child. A casual reach out to send warm wishes to her and her family led to a mutual gripe session over Zoom about our health system, and in particular, pediatrics. As a mother, Ellen has spent hours at urgent care and waiting by the phone for her primary pediatrician’s office to call her back for a quick consult. Again, it would have been understandable for her to feel dejected—but that wouldn’t be Ellen. All she saw was opportunity.</p>



<p>Ellen observed, researched and asked, “Why?” During that brief conversation with her, we learned that the average American waits more than two hours at the emergency room, and—as Ellen had recently experienced firsthand—two weeks to see their primary doctor. Particularly for families with young children, the time adds up quickly: the average parent accesses their pediatrician an average of <a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/health-management/Pages/Well-Child-Care-A-Check-Up-for-Success.aspx">10 times per year in the first two years of their child’s life, and 4 times per year thereafter</a>. As she dug into these stats and more, Ellen was full of enthusiasm about finding a better solution.</p>



<p>After those spring reflections in 2021, Ellen continued to learn more about our health system from both parents’ and pediatricians’ perspectives, speaking to as many people from each group as she could find. By summer, she was asking herself two questions: Was she ready to dedicate her life to helping people access care, perhaps starting with pediatrics? And if so, how could she best accomplish her mission? These were the musings of Ellen DaSilva on maternity leave.</p>



<p>Fall was back to work at Hims &amp; Hers, an organization where she had started as employee #8 and helped it grow into a public company. At first, she was glad to be back, seeing familiar faces and getting some professional​​—and adult—interactions. (We all love our kids, but they drive us nuts, too.) While it was energizing to reunite with friends and colleagues, the same nagging question kept popping up in Ellen’s mind. How can we radically simplify access to pediatrics care?</p>



<p>As the cold November winds settled into NYC, Ellen asked herself what she would regret more: Pursuing that dream and striking out, or continuing her steady climb in the world of major public healthcare companies but never taking a swing? Founding moments start with the daring to overcome your fears—and Ellen knew she would regret not trying far more.</p>



<p>After telling her family and friends around Thanksgiving, Founder Ellen incorporated Summer Health in December 2021, and Sequoia was fortunate enough to become the company’s first outside shareholder. With that initial check of $1M, Ellen built out the alpha version of her product to test her hypotheses, recruited co-founder Matthew Woo and a small crackerjack team of seven, and rebuilt and launched the beta product while onboarding the first parents and pediatricians. Just more than six months in, families in all 50​​ states are now able to connect with a Summer Health provider via a simple text message—and get treatment, prescriptions, referrals and more in just 15 minutes. This velocity in execution speaks for itself, both for Ellen as a highly effective founder and for Summer Health as a highly compelling offering that’s instantly seen clinical and customer demand.</p>



<p>Today, we are thrilled to <a href="https://www.summerhealth.com/">make the product available to everyone through the public beta</a> and announce that Summer Health has raised $7.5M in total seed funding, co-led by Sequoia Capital and Lux Capital. But while this is a milestone worth celebrating, we are most excited to see how Ellen and her team will continue working toward a universally powerful mission: to radically simplify access to care.</p>

     The Cobalt wallet is Horizen’s new web extension wallet that enables you to create, receive, and send tokens on TokenMint!&nbsp; 
<p>In this guide, we show you how to send ZEN to your Cobalt wallet to process your transactions and create your own tokens. ZEN is used as gas for TokenMint transactions.</p>
 About TokenMint 
<p>The TokenMint platform is designed to provide a seamless, simple, and intuitive user experience. In the alpha version, there are four components available to launch your token:</p>
 
 TokenMint Chain – a sidechain built on the Horizen network 
 <a href="https://tokenmint.global/">Token Generator</a>&nbsp;– a web app that allows a streamlined and easy process for anyone to create and mint a fungible token with custom tokenomics. 
 <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Cobalt wallet</a>&nbsp;– a web browser extension wallet that stores and manages tokens created on TokenMint 
 <a href="https://explorer.tokenmint.global/">TokenMint Block explorer</a>&nbsp;– a block explorer that tracks and displays all transactions on the TokenMint Chain.&nbsp; 
 
 Send ZEN to a Cobalt wallet 
<p>When sending ZEN from your Sphere wallet to a Cobalt wallet, you are actually sending a transaction to a sidechain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before you begin the send transaction, make sure that you have the Cobalt wallet’s address to send ZEN and the password to confirm the transaction.</p>
<p>Perform the following steps:</p>
<p>1. In your Sphere Wallet, click on the wallet you wish to send ZEN from.</p>
<p>2. Select the appropriate address by clicking on the info icon to copy it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are two icons: one to Receive and the other to Send.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Click the Send icon. (Red Up Arrow) The Send page appears.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. Make sure that the Sidechain transaction toggle is enabled, which displays the Sidechain field.</p>
<p>5. In the Sidechain field, use the pull-down menu to select the appropriate sidechain.</p>
<p>6. In the Send to field, paste the Cobalt wallet’s address.</p>
<p>7. In the Amount field, enter the amount of ZEN you want to send.</p>
<p>8. In the Transaction Fee pane, the Standard radio button is enabled by default. Click Custom if you want to specify a custom fee.</p>
<p>9. Optionally, in the Description field, enter a brief statement about this transaction.</p>
<p>10. Click Confirm. Then enter the wallet password to confirm the field appears.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note: If you enter the wrong password, an error message will appear.</p>
<p>11. Enter your Sphere wallet password. The Send page displays a success notification.</p>
<p></p>
<p>12. Click View on Blockchain to verify that the transaction is successful. The <a href="https://explorer.zensystem.io/">Block Explorer</a> webpage appears.</p>
<p>13. Click the Search button on the top of the page using the search criteria of address, transaction, or blocks if your transaction is not displayed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>14. Check the Cobalt wallet for the newly received transaction. You should see a transaction of received ZEN from Horizen mainchain.</p>

     TokenMint makes tokenization streamlined and accessible to everyone. Anyone can create their own token now! 
<p>TokenMint is a platform that allows anyone to easily and quickly create a token with custom tokenomics. No programming knowledge is needed for creating a token using TokenMint. The alpha version of the TokenMint platform offers the basics for creating a fungible token.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 About TokenMint 
<p>The TokenMint platform is designed to provide a seamless, simple, and intuitive user experience. In the alpha version, there are four components available to launch your token:</p>
 
 TokenMint Chain – a sidechain built on the Horizen network 
 <a href="https://tokenmint.global/">Token Generator</a> – a web app that allows a streamlined and easy process for anyone to create and mint a fungible token with custom tokenomics. 
 <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Cobalt wallet</a> – a web browser extension wallet that stores and manages tokens created on TokenMint 
 <a href="https://explorer.tokenmint.global/">TokenMint Block explorer</a> – a block explorer that tracks and displays all transactions on the TokenMint Chain.&nbsp; 
 
 How to Use Token Generator to Create a Token 
<p>To begin the process of creating a token, you MUST:</p>
 
 <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt-by-horizen/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Install the latest version of Cobalt wallet</a>, or you will not be able to use the token generator 
 Have <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/cobalt-wallet-user-guide-2/">ZEN in your Cobalt wallet</a>, or you will not be able to connect your wallet to the TokenMint website.&nbsp; 
 
<p>The TokenMint token generator is very easy to use.&nbsp; Simply head to the <a href="https://tokenmint.global/">TokenMint website</a> and follow these easy steps:&nbsp;</p>
<p>STEP 1. Launch the token generator from the <a href="https://tokenmint.global/">TokenMint website</a> by clicking Launch The App.</p>
<p></p>
<p>STEP 2. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt-by-horizen/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Download the latest Cobalt wallet</a> and connect your Cobalt wallet.</p>
<p>You must install the latest Cobalt wallet. Otherwise, the token generator won’t connect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have previously installed a Cobalt wallet, make sure you update the extension from your web browser settings menu. Please follow<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/cobalt-wallet-user-guide-2/"> this guide</a> if you need help.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You must have sufficient ZEN in your Cobalt wallet to pay for network fees. <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/cobalt-wallet-user-guide-2/">Follow this guide if you need help to know how to send ZEN to Cobalt</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>STEP 3. Once your wallet is connected, click Create a token and follow the steps shown on the app to create your token.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>STEP 4. After you create your token, you will be able to see your token in your Cobalt wallet and the <a href="https://explorer.tokenmint.global/">TokenMint block explorer</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p>You can now find your tokens on the TokenMint site. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Step 5. Mint your token! After your token is created, you will need to mint your token to the wallet of your choice. To begin, select Mint token. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Step 6. On the Mint token page, enter the desired amount of your token to mint and the wallet address you would like to mint to then select Confirm. Minting tokens currently cost 1 ZEN. The transaction can take up to 5 minutes to complete the minting of your token.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once the confirmation is complete, you will receive the identified quantity of tokens to your designated wallet and you are ready to send your tokens to the world!</p>

  <p>Thank you <a href="https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/u/simin">@simin</a> for the fascinating summary of your work. Welcome to the forum, and it’s so great to have you here.</p>
<p>There are at least two things that I find particularly interesting.</p>
<p>The first is the classification of Bitcoin privacy attacks. In your work, there are 4 categories, and under each section are several important threats. This seems like a careful design and is thus an important reference for the potential attacks that both developers and users need to stay aware of.</p>
<p>Is the categorization unique to Bitcoin (or UTXO blockchains)? That is, consider a non-UTXO coin, or even, a privacy coin, would all 4 categories remain, or how would it change?</p>
<p>The second relates to the discussion and key takeaways section, where you dive into how the threats map back to privacy criteria. It seems important since defining a problem is a prerequisite to identifying solutions.</p>
<p>For me, it is a great resource to have it spelled out specifically why users of the blockchain are at risk of privacy breaches. Having the criteria laid out side-by-side with the characteristics of the blockchain is fascinating.</p>
<p>With that said, I must ask: Being new to the space, I wonder what is the story behind using RFC6973 as a criterion for (sort of) defining and standardizing what are the particular characteristics of privacy for internet protocols? Are there other criteria that are widely discussed in the space, and if so, how was RFC6973 selected for the research?</p>

Consequently, anti-abortion laws will soon come into effect in many&nbsp;states.</p><p>American women are boycotting period tracking apps in droves. Women have taken to Twitter to <a href="https://twitter.com/ECMcLaughlin/status/1521467912162226176">warn fellow women to delete these apps</a>, where their data could be subpoenaed or sold.

Verida will also provide technical architecture and engineering support.</p><p>Verida provides the essential infrastructure needed for developers to build powerful multi-chain web3 applications with private data storage and identity. Using Verida’s private data storage network, all data is encrypted and only the user can unlock their personal information.

   <p>They said that Bitcoin isn't private, that you couldn't use it without telling everyone about your payments. They said that you had to be an expert before you had a chance to protect your sensitive financial information.</p><p>Well, what if I told you that they were wrong and that it’s gotten super easy to make Bitcoin payments without anyone being able to link them all to you? Interested ? Keep reading.</p><p>First and foremost, you have to download the latest and greatest Wasabi Wallet 2.0. For many that’s the actual step one, but hey, I know you’re cool and are already running the mighty Wasabi, so you can skip and reclaim your privacy that much quicker.</p><p>Maybe you’re a whale, or maybe you’re a pleb, but anyone worth a sat has got a wallet these days, so type in your recovery words to import your keys to Wasabi. If you’re one of those future-coiners who hasn’t got a wallet yet. First, slap yourself and try to wake up. But don’t stress it, you can easily create a new wallet in Wasabi directly. Write down the 12 words and you’re good to go!</p><p>Now comes arguably the toughest part. You gotta convince someone to send you some magical internet money. It ain’t easy, ‘cause nobody has enough sats, and everyone wants to stack some more. But I’m sure you’re a fine entrepreneur, so go be productive and earn yourself some treasure worth protecting. That part is easy as pi in Wasabi. Just click “Receive”, write who is sending you that hoard and show him that address. Voila, you've now got more sats than yesterday, that’s what I’d call a good day.</p><p>Earning sats is already difficult enough; if you think about it, waiting to spend it can be even more difficult. I know you really wanna have that delicious steak, that fast boat and that hidden citadel. But patience is a virtue (that most of us lack); however it’s all you need at this step. While you are dreaming about how delicious that steak is gonna be, Wasabi is doing magic for you in the background. Who knows what exactly is going on under the hood but the crazy thing is, in just a short amount of time, the coins that other people knew were yours are gone and you got new coins that nobody knows are yours. Magic indeed.</p><p>Now that you are fully equipped with truly anonymous money, you can frivolously spend it without worrying that those who paid you sats, know where you spend them. But oh well, maybe, just maybe, that short lesson in waiting has made you realize that indeed, you could continue fasting a little more, not buy that steak but hold on to those precious sats just a little longer instead. Who knows, your great grandchildren could buy themselves a spaceship to the stars with those sats.</p><p>Earn sats, wait, spend sats. Wasabi is made to help you do that and just that, without revealing your important financial data to everyone in the world.</p><p>Reclaim your privacy. Effortlessly. With Wasabi 2.0.</p>

<p></p><p>Nowadays, ring signatures and <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/kyc-aml-how-crypto-might-change-a-traditional-finance-standard-forever/#why-are-crypto-believers-often-against-kycaml">zero-knowledge proofs </a>are two of the most used and known <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/privacy-crypto-projects-bitcoin-competitors-or-not/">privacy enhancing technologies applied to cryptocurrency</a>. And, as cryptography is the heart and soul of the crypto scene (and the only reason scarce digital goods are possible), this is no small feature.<br></p><p>The top Layer-1 privacy blockchain networks, <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/">Monero</a> and <a href="https://z.cash/">Zcash</a>, both have adopted these tools — with Monero embracing ring signatures and Zcash employing zero-knowledge proofs.<br></p><p>Both zero-knowledge proofs and ring signatures have proved effective at maintaining user anonymity and privacy. Their sustainability and ability to remain ahead amidst fierce competition and innovation are celebrated among blockchain privacy enthusiasts. <br></p><p>To wade into the debate on which of them does a better job and is more cost-effective, we will look at the technology behind their operations, their applications on the blockchain, and their advantages and disadvantages.</p> An overview of ring signatures <p>Ring signatures are one of the earliest cryptographic inventions and, to date, one of the most effective. As its name implies, a ring signature involves a group in which all members own keys. These members form a ring, banding together to aid each other’s privacy.<br></p>Working of ring signatures in Monero, (<a href="https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5880940">Source</a>).<p>One of the earliest scenarios used to describe the way ring signatures work is the White House dilemma, which goes as follows:<br></p><p>Imagine there is a sensitive information leak from the Oval Office. The leaked information has no source, so everyone who works in the government house immediately becomes a suspect. Mr. President then points out that the information could only have been leaked by a staff member, but he has no idea of who it was. The secret is in the open, but no one can tell how it got out or who leaked it. If every staff member enjoys plausible deniability (i.e., there’s no proofs against them), then the outcome is akin to ring signatures.<br></p><p>With no clear suspects, there can be no culprits.</p> How do ring signatures work? <p>Ring signatures need an existing group of people on both sides of each transaction. One signature is enough to send a ring signature message, while the other group members function as decoys. Using our previous example, the sending group of people would be “the White House personnel” and the receiving one “the general public”, as the data leak was not sent to any one single individual. Since it is not computationally possible to single out the participants in the transaction through their keys, ring signatures preserve anonymity.<br></p><p>Although they bear similarities to group signatures, ring signatures differ on two grounds. First, the anonymity of the individual keys involved in a ring signature is irrevocable. Then, no additional setup is needed to determine a signing set, which means that any random set of keys can act as decoys with or without the knowledge of the key owners. In other words, any member of the network can form part of a decoy group with or without their knowledge.<br></p><p>Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Yael Tauman Kalai introduced the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_signature">ring signatures</a> in 2001 at ASIACRYPT. Since then, ring signatures have been used for several real-life applications, including privacy enhancement on public blockchain networks.<br></p>This video by Monero showcases how ring signatures work in the context of Monero, a privacy cryptocurrency that uses them. Real-Life Applications of Ring Signatures <p>When Ron Rivest et al. released the original ring signature paper in 2001, they mentioned a few real-life <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/user-types-and-use-cases-who-is-panther-for-how-can-they-use-it-c11ccafa4bbf/">use cases</a> of ring signatures. Here are a few suggested real-world applications.</p> Whistleblowing <p>As we saw in the White House dilemma, whistleblowing is tremendously helped by plausible deniability. However, if this were to be facilitated by technology, it could potentially be a lot safer for leakers.<br></p><p>Using ring signatures, individuals and victims can expose documents and materials that prove particular government and private cover-ups without exposing their identities. Even when you can tell that a government official was behind the leak, the exact identity of the signer will remain unknown.</p> Offline e-cash <p>One variant of the fundamental ring signature structure involves linkability to avoid the double spending problem. This concept allows observers to determine if one group member (for example, a bank) was responsible for any ring signatures, giving them legitimacy. <br></p><p>In this structure, while the sender's identity remains uncompromised, verifiers can determine if the signer has signed any previous or future messages, linking each ring signature to another under the same private key. With linkability, ring signatures can be used for offline e-cash transactions, keeping both sender and recipient anonymous while eliminating the double spending problem.</p> Deniable Signatures <p>Although deniable signatures are not mainstream, they have been outlined as a possible way to send and receive messages with third-party encryption. This kind of signatures would not be transferable to anyone except their original recipient, and observers would not be privy to information about both the sender and the receiver.</p> E-Voting Systems <p>E-voting uses ring signatures with both linkability and <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/are-bitcoin-transactions-traceable-coin-security-privacy/">traceability</a>. Not only will verifiers link to ring signatures from a particular private key, but they will also be privy to the signer's public key. Individuals can cast votes without compromising their identities to parties other than a trusted electoral umpire.</p> Private Cryptocurrencies <p>Monero is a <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bitcoin-tumblers-privacy-coins-and-prifi-private-crypto/">private blockchain</a> network that uses ring signatures along with Ring Confidential Transactions (an advanced form of ring signatures that also involves stealth addresses) to drive private crypto transactions.<br></p><p>Monero uses several public keys pulled with a triangular distribution method, and the signer's keys create a ring of possible signers. All the possible signers are equally valid, making the transaction output untraceable. This creates plausible deniability for each transaction output. <br></p><p>Monero also utilizes a cryptographic technique called the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SOk9dIOCk">Pederson commitment</a> to obscure transaction amounts, senders’ and receivers’ addresses. This helps Monero offer its users high privacy with reasonable efficiency and verifiable, trustless coin generation.<br></p> zk-SNARKs <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">Zero-knowledge proofs</a> are one of the most commonly adopted privacy protocols. A few privacy enhancing technologies have derived from it but, in particular, zk-SNARKs have recently been highlighted in the blockchain space, driving anonymity and scalability.<br></p>Working diagram of zero-knowledge proofs (<a href="https://appinventiv.com/blog/zero-knowledge-proof-blockchain/">Source</a>).<p>Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) proofs allow users to prove their ownership of specific information or that they have done something without disclosing underlying details. Individuals or entities can prove an action (e.g., having over $5,000 in the bank) without telling the third party what action they took (e.g., their exact balance), the recipient of such actions, and the item or items exchanged. <br></p><p>Zk-SNARKs do not only provide <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-a-zero-knowledge-proof-defining-zkps-in-different-levels/">zero-knowledge proofs</a>, but they also do it in such a way that signers and verifiers do not need to establish any interaction to prove or confirm transactions. Commitments that establish the authenticity of zk-SNARK transactions are published as hashes.</p> How do zk-SNARKs Work? <p></p>Securing a blockchain with a non-interactive ZK proof. (<a href="https://www.altoros.com/blog/securing-a-blockchain-with-a-noninteractive-zero-knowledge-proof/">Source</a>)<p></p><p>To understand the concept of <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zksnarks-through-the-lens-of-the-cypherpunks/">zk-SNARKs</a>, we first have to consider how zero-knowledge proofs work. Imagine a world in which people can prove that they own something or did something without telling you what they own or have done. Yet, you, as a third-party observer, can confirm that they truly own that item or that they are behind the action they claim to have carried out.<br></p><p>Zk-SNARKs use zero-knowledge proofs and ensure no interaction exists between the proving party and verifiers. With zk-SNARKs, users can convince the verifier that, in addition to showcasing that the information within the hash exists, they also know what lies therein.<br></p><p>After proving the existence and knowledge of the information, the succinct nature of zk-SNARKs implies that they can be verified in milliseconds and with a proof length of hundreds of bytes. In the early days of zero-knowledge proofs, both parties (provers and verifiers) had to communicate multiple times to establish trust. <br></p><p>With a non-interactive construction, only a single piece of information is sufficient to establish trust between both parties. Zk-SNARKs are also computationally sound statements, and they cannot be constructed without access to the private input that proves the transaction.</p><p>Let’s illustrate this all in a mundane example:<br></p><p>A zk-SNARK is alike owning a bracelet that certifies your belonging to a secret multi-billionaire society: if you wear it out on the street, other members would be able to identify you easily. However, they would not need to interact with you, you would not need to interact with them, and the information conveyed by the bracelet (e.g., your social status and other conditions to join the exclusive group) are immediately transferred to the “verifier”.<br></p><p>For example, <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Panther</a> leverages zk-SNARKs to restore privacy in Web3 and DeFi while providing financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in decentralized finance. Using zk-proofs, Panther enables users to prove their regulatory compliance without sharing underlying data. Panther does this through <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol/protocol/panthers-core-components/zk-and-non-zk-reveals">zk- and non zk-Reveals</a> that generate zero-knowledge reports for selective disclosures.<br></p>A realistic zk-SNARK example (<a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/zk-snarks-a-realistic-zero-knowledge-example-and-deep-dive-c5e6eaa7131c">Source</a>). Real-world applications of zk-SNARKs  Blockchain privacy <p>Several privacy-centric blockchain protocols have adopted zkSNARKs to enable user and transaction anonymity across the main chain, sidechains, and bridges. Zcash is one of the most popular, using shielded zero-knowledge proofs to keep users anonymous as they transact on-chain. <br></p><p>Another popular project that adopts zkSNARKs is <a href="https://horizenlabs.io/">Horizen</a>. In addition to driving privacy in the crypto space, these projects have also employed zkSNARKs to establish trust between users and law enforcement agencies.<br></p><p>Furthermore, <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io">Panther</a> also leverages zk-SNARKs to restore privacy in Web3 and DeFi while providing financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in decentralized finance.</p> Blockchain-powered auditing <p>zkAudits are gaining popularity, allowing auditors to independently verify information without disclosing the identities of senders and receivers. The now-bankrupt Celsius Network used <a href="https://horizenlabs.io/zkaudit/">zkAudits</a>, powered by Horizen, to prove liquidity and revenue in real-time without the help of third-party validators while also keeping the underlying transaction information anonymous.</p> Blockchain scalibility <p>With zk-SNARKs, blockchain networks can outsource an expensive computation and validate that the result is correct without redoing its execution. This opens up a category of trustless computing and an innovative way of blockchain scaling.<br></p><p>Similarly, zk-SNARKs can also allow change a blockchain model from everyone-computing-everything to one-party-computes-the-rest-verify.</p> Ring signatures versus zk-SNARKs <p>Ring signatures and zkSNARKs have both received fair criticism since going mainstream. While new developments have addressed most detected design flaws, a few linger on. The ring signature tool that Monero uses, for example has been faulted by research in recent years. Allegedly, Monero’s ring signature scheme could result in users potentially losing their <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/is-privacy-a-human-right-philosophy-economics-legality/">privacy</a> through tracing analysis. However, no one has ever been shown to crack Monero’s cryptography. This criticism is often issued along with pointing out that the blockchain is obscure enough to not have been tested at a macro scale yet.<br></p><p>There is also the danger of de-anonymization due to public pool decoys. If an individual uses a ring signature to move cryptocurrencies into a public pool, for instance, the decoy is then broken, which endangers the signer's anonymity.<br></p><p>Monero, currently holds a model that enables for 32 <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-moneros-decoy-selection-bug/">decoys per transaction</a> without performance degradation.<br></p><p>zkSNARKs, on the other hand, have received also been criticized due the following:<br></p>  zkSNARKs require a trusted setup for their creation (albeit Zcash has recently released a protocol upgrade, <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/halo-recursive-proof-composition-without-a-trusted-setup/">Halo</a>, and a shielding mechanism, <a href="https://github.com/monero-project/research-lab/issues/100">Orchard</a>, that eliminate the need for a trusted setup).  zkSNARKs are a resource-heavy tool.  Zcash's zkSNARKs-powered blockchain is not private by default.<br><br>  <p>Regarding trusted setups, the challenge here is that individuals could exploit the process that generates zkSNARKs to produce false proofs that look valid to any verifier. In the case of Zcash, for example, this could lead to the creation of new coins.<br></p><p>However, it’s worth mentioning that cryptographic researchers at the Electric Coin Company (ECC) have discovered a technique for creating zk-SNARKs without a trusted setup. <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1021.pdf">Halo</a> achieves practical zero-knowledge recursive proof composition without the need for a trusted setup.The &nbsp;ECC is already exploring the use of Halo within Zcash to both eliminate trusted setups and to scale Zcash at Layer-1 using nested proof composition.<br><br><br></p>Diagram explaining the working of a trusted setup.

<p>Last month we announced our <a>Wallet Partner Program</a> and a roster of six inaugural partners who integrated Brave Wallet connection in their DApps (ApeSwap, Arken, Bogged, DODO, Open Ocean, and Skiff). We are thrilled to announce six additional leading DApps (decentralized applications) spanning over 10 networks joining the program in July.</p>
<p>Partnering with the most widely-used decentralized applications in Web3 underlines Brave Wallet’s ease of use and rich set of features. These include decentralized swaps, multi-chain portfolio view, simple fiat-to-crypto purchases with Ramp and Wyre, and continuous updates and additions to make Web3 more accessible. Importantly, partners in the program benefit from co-promotion of their DApps among Brave’s 62+ million users via our blog, community channels, social media, and Brave Ads.</p>
<p>We are excited about the opportunities these partnerships can create for BAT utility and Brave Wallet users, including better access to decentralized finance (DeFi), privacy tools, lively social communities, and more. Each new addition deepens our commitment to providing the leading secure, multi-chain wallet, that we hope will onboard millions of users to Web3.</p>

 Beefy 
<p><a href="https://beefy.finance/">Beefy</a> is one of the largest and most-used yield-aggregators, with smart contract vaults that help users earn more yield on their liquidity positions across 16 different networks and dozens of decentralized exchanges. They hold the top position in terms of total value locked (TVL) among yield-aggregators on several major EVM-compatible chains and Ethereum Layer 2 solutions, including Polygon, Arbitrum, and Cronos.</p>
<p>“Integrating Beefy’s services into a platform like Brave with a community of millions is a perfect use case for increased adoption. Earning APY through DeFi opportunities shouldn’t just be for the few, and tapping into Brave’s ecosystem will help more people earn than ever before,” said Weso, Beefy’s Lead Developer and Strategic Partnership Coordinator.</p>

 Elk Finance 
<p><a href="https://elk.finance/">ElkNet</a>, the core product offered by Elk Finance, is a multi-chain bridge network that connects 19 EVM-compatible chains, allowing users to quickly and safely move their tokens from one chain to another. In addition to moving assets, Elk is adding cross-chain swaps, which offers users the choice to receive their bridged assets as a different token. “Our motto is Any chain, anytime, anywhere,” said the Elk Team.</p>

 Elpis Battle 
<p><a href="https://elpis.game/">Elpis Battle</a> is a turn-based RPG NFT Game implemented on the Binance Smart Chain network, which is developed by ZEGO Studio—a gaming studio in Southeast Asia. By combining cryptocurrency, NFT gaming, and DeFi, Elpis’s developers want to create a new kind of gaming experience for Elpis Battle players. Elpis is a world where players can not only explore stories about an imaginary kingdom but also create value, exchange, buy, and sell assets as participants in the economy of Elpis.</p>
<p>“A common vision toward bigger goals is the foundation of our partnership. We envision this cross-platform partnership will help users be able to manage, grow, and swap their crypto portfolio from a single wallet securely and comfortably,” said the Elpis Battle Team.</p>

 Lido 
<p>With over $5 billion in value locked between Ethereum and Solana alone, <a href="https://lido.fi/">Lido</a> is by far the most widely used liquid staking protocol available today. Lido makes it easy for anyone to participate in the proof of stake consensus while simultaneously allowing users to interact with DeFi protocols. This liquidity lets users find the best DeFi strategies for themselves while also securing some of industry’s biggest blockchains: Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Polkadot, and Kusama.</p>
<p>“A platform like Brave with a community in the millions will be critical for Lido to bring DeFi to the next generation and increase the resilience of the systems it is built upon. This was the entire reason that Lido and liquid staking was created in the first place and what has helped Lido become the leading liquid staking provider globally,” said Jacob Blish, Head of Business Development at Lido.</p>

 Tulip 
<p><a href="https://tulip.garden/#home">Tulip Protocol</a> was the first yield aggregation platform built on Solana with auto-compounding vault strategies. The DApp is designed to take advantage of Solana’s low cost, high efficiency blockchain. It allows vault strategies to compound frequently—which benefits yield farms with higher APYs—without&nbsp; requiring active management. It also has lower gas fees. Tulip now offers a wide variety of strategies for its users: Lending, Auto-compounding Vaults, Leveraged Yield Farming, and their newly launched Strategy Vaults.</p>
<p>​​"Tulip believes in simplifying yield for all end users. A partnership with Brave brings us closer to our ideals as we can help Brave Wallet users tap into single-click yield generation with our protocol. We’re excited to continue to work with Brave in the future," said Senx, Co-Founder at Tulip Protocol.</p>

 Venus Protocol 
<p><a href="https://venus.io/">Venus</a> is the leading DeFi market for lending and borrowing, and second largest decentralized application in terms of TVL on BNB Chain. Users can use their many pools (including XVS, BTCB, ETH, BNB) and a variety of stablecoins to borrow and lend assets at variable interest rates. Borrowers can benefit from on-demand access to a range of tokens with low interest rates, while depositors can earn yield on their idle assets. Venus currently supports 22 different cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>“By integrating Venus with Brave, two DeFi leaders come together to fling open the doors of financial inclusion to millions of users. It’s just the beginning for making open finance a reality around the globe,” said Brad Harrison, CEO of Venus.</p>
<p>For the current phase of the Brave Wallet Partner Program, Brave is approaching leading DApps in each vertical to invite them to the program. We also aim to adapt and scale the program to become public-facing later this year. Once this happens, additional DApps can submit requests to participate.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you’re a developer interested in simply integrating Brave Wallet into your DApp, we’ve created <a href="https://wallet-docs.brave.com/">detailed developer documentation</a>.</p>

  Read the proposal for Polkadot's next-generation governance system - currently known as Gov2 - to discover how it aims to advance the decentralization of the network.

<p>Polkadot’s first decentralised governance system was pretty interesting at the time: a tri-cameral (three-chamber) structure with a technocratic committee managing upgrade timelines, an approval-voted, elected executive “government” to manage parameters, admin and spending proposals as well as a general voting system for everything else which rewarded long-term stakeholders with increased influence. It was loosely based on parliamentary democracy and has been functioning reasonably well over the first 2–3 years of operation, helping ensure good use of treasury funds, keeping a fast clip with the rollout of upgrades, and managing the deployment of more critical fixes in a timely fashion. However, it has its drawbacks.</p><p>The elected executive (known as the Council) is centralised and generally not anonymous. This puts both the protocol in some degree of risk as well as the individual councillors who may find themselves pressured to act one way or another. The Technical Committee, while wielding substantially less power, has similar exposure and greater centralisation. In a world where authorities across society (both benign and malevolent), decentralisation is increasingly needed for both the safety and security of all participants.</p><p>Furthermore, there exists only a single “all or nothing” referendum model — all referenda carry the maximum amount of power. Partly due to this, there can only be one referendum voted at a time and these votes last multiple weeks by default. This, and the limited bandwidth of the Council means that overall the system favours deep consideration of very few proposals rather than broad consideration of very many. Rather than leveraging the power of the crowd, it inadvertently limits it in its efforts to manage the volume of potential decision throughput.</p><p>The nature of coarse-grained delegation means that the system has a degree of exclusivity built-in to it. Barriers to entry within the effective political framework are high, reducing inclusivity and diversity, hurting turnout and legitimacy.</p><p>It was always clear that the first version of Polkadot’s governance was just that: something to be iterated on over time. Now, I’m happy to be able to describe in detail our proposal for the next generation of governance within the Polkadot ecosystem.</p> Introducing Gov2 <p>Polkadot’s next-generation governance system, known while in development as Gov2, aims to solve the issues with the current system. First, what it doesn’t change: it does not break from the original Polkadot governance tenet, which holds that 50% of the total stake in the system should, if they have sufficient strength of conviction in their opinion, be able ultimately to command the system’s future. Similarly, it doesn’t break away from the Conviction Voting pioneered in Polkadot giving greater weight to those who are willing to lock their tokens into the system for longer. Furthermore, there is still use for a technocratic collective, albeit it is somewhat different in importance, size, composition and membership mechanics than the current Technical Committee.</p><p>Where it differs most is how it manages the practical means of day-to-day decision-making, making the repercussions of referenda better scoped and agile in order to dramatically increase the number of collective decisions the system is able to take. Let’s look a little deeper into how it works.</p> Lower the Barriers <p>Gov2 is actually a lot simpler in many ways than the current governance. There are no additional bodies which act as “first class citizens” in the governance such as the Council and Technical Committee. There is no alternating timetable of proposals. There is no public proposal queue. Instead, we only have one first-class decision-making mechanism: the referendum. The main difference in Gov2 is that there can be lots of them — perhaps even thousands —all happening simultaneously.</p><p>In Gov2, anyone is able to start a referendum at any time, and they can do this as many times as they wish. Anyone can also vote on these referenda. There are no explicit limits on the number of referenda which are open to vote on at any time.</p><p>But this could result in more things to vote on that a normal person with a reasonable amount of time could possibly evaluate. This could reduce both inclusivity and security. So, in order make this potential plethora of things to vote on manageable for mere humans, we introduce some interesting novel features to the referendum process.</p> Origins and Tracks <p>All referenda are based on a proposal, which is really just another way of saying “an operation” in Polkadot. This is the same kind of thing as what gets described and executed when you make a transaction and it gets included in a block. There are all kinds of operations which Polkadot can do, but a couple which you’re probably already familiar with are <code>transfer</code> which can move assets between accounts and <code>stake</code> which lets an account stake. There are very many others. The thing that makes this governance functionality special is not these proposals/operations, but rather the Origin with which they are executed.</p><p>You can think of an Origin as a sort of rich descriptor for a privilege level. It gets passed in when an operation is executed, and the operation’s logic will usually check that it is what it should be. When a regular transaction executes, the Origin parameter is set to a variant known as Signed. This implies that a specific account in the system authorised (generally through signing the transaction) the operation to happen, and it runs with this privilege, further implying e.g. that funds controlled by this account and this account only may be spent.</p><p>Governance-level stuff works to allow operations to run with other, more privileged, Origins. The most privileged of them all is the Root Origin, which is all-powerful. This is the Origin from which the proposals of all approved referenda in the old governance system were dispatched. In Gov2, we have many different Origins, all enjoying some exotic privileges, but with many being significantly less powerful and more niche than Root.</p><p>In Gov2, we allow the proposer to specify which Origin they would like their proposal to be executed with. Every supported Origin is associated with a single referendum class (i.e. a type of referenda), and most of these classes will correspond to exactly one origin, but there might be some which are comprised of multiple Origins. Each class has its own Track, which is basically a pipeline in which the proposal lives in and proceeds through, and it is completely independent from other class’s tracks.</p><p>Having independent tracks allows us to tailor the dynamics of referenda based upon their implied privilege level. Referenda which execute their proposals from more powerful (read: dangerous!) Origins will have more stringent safeguards, higher thresholds and longer consideration periods. The Root Origin has the highest such thresholds and safeguards. Those Origins which convey relatively little power (e.g. the Tip Origin, able to spend at most 10 DOT from the treasury), have accordingly shorter consideration periods and lower thresholds for approval.</p> Kicking off <p>When a referendum is initially created, it is immediately votable by anyone in the community. However, it is not in a state where it can end, or otherwise have its votes counted, be approved and summarily enacted. Instead, referenda must fulfil a number of criteria before they are moved into a state known as Deciding. Until they are in this state, they remain undecided.</p><p>The criteria which need to be met are threefold: Firstly, all referenda have a lead-in period. This is an amount of time which must have elapsed after proposal before deciding can begin. This provides for an initial notice period in which votes can be submitted to mitigate against the possibility of “decision sniping” where an attacker controlling a substantial amount of voting power might seek to have a proposal passed soon after proposing it, not allowing the overall voting population time to consider and vote.</p><p>Secondly, there must be room for the decision. All tracks have their own limit on the number of referenda which can be deciding simultaneously. The more potent the Origins allowed on the track, then the lower this limit. The Root level Origin has a limit of one, implying that only a single über-dangerous proposal may be being decided at once. Conversely, the rather underpowered Tipping track has far less stringent limits since any damage done through over-population of is minimal and it is far more useful to have many tips being decided at once over many Root-level calls. When there is space available, then it is the (otherwise eligible) referendum of the class which has the most votes in favour of approval which is elevated into the deciding state.</p><p>Finally, a Decision Deposit must be paid. Creating a referendum is cheap, with the deposit needing to be paid relating only to the on-chain storage needed to track it. However, having a referendum be decided upon carries greater risk and uses up limited space since we limit the number of referenda which can be being decided simultaneously on each track. Thus a larger (though refundable) deposit must be paid to mitigate against spamming or bloating the system.</p> Deciding and Confirming a Proposal <p>Once a referendum enters the state of deciding, then it is eligible to be approved. This eligibility lasts only a finite time (28 days on Polkadot), at which point if it is not approved then it is rejected by default. To be approved, it must fulfil two criteria (in which case we say it is passing) and it must continue fulfilling these criteria for a minimum of the Confirmation Period. Different tracks have different lengths of Confirmation Period, with the more powerful ones taking longer to confirm. This is additional defence against a whale voter attempting to “snipe” the referendum by placing a large enough vote that approval criteria are hit unexpectedly.</p><p>The two passing criteria relate to approval and support. Gone is the adaptive quorum biasing of past referendums. Now we have a more flexible system where these requirements may be customised at a much more fine-grained level. Approval is defined as the share of approval vote-weight (i.e. after adjustment for conviction) against the total number of vote-weight (for both approval and rejection). Support is the total number of votes in approval (i.e. ignoring any adjustment for conviction) compared to the total possible amount of votes that could be made in the system.</p><p>Each class of referendum has different requirements for these values. However what is most interesting is that these requirements are able to reduce over time on a well-defined schedule. What this means is that as the voting proceeds over the 28 days, we can configure things so that an increasingly lower amount of support and overall approval for the proposal are needed for it to pass. In general, they will always begin and end in roughly the same way, starting with the highest thresholds and ending with the lowest which are still in line with the overall tenets: at least 50% approval.</p><p>What happens in between determines how easy it is for an approval to be made before the 28-day deadline. With proposals which use less privileged origins (e.g. the Tip class, which is only able to command a payment from the treasury of up to 10 DOT) it is far more reasonable to drop the required turnout to a more realistic amount earlier than those which use highly privileged classes such as Root. Similarly, classes which command more political significance will tend to accept less controversy (and thus require a higher approval) early on.</p> After Approval <p>Proposals which are not approved after 28 days are considered rejected by default. At this point, the Decision Deposit can be refunded. If, on the other hand, the proposal manages to become and remain passing for the Confirmation Period during these 28 days, then it is considered approved and it is scheduled to execute from the origin is was duly proposed with, after some Enactment Period.</p><p>The Enactment Period is also specified when the referendum is proposed but is subject to a minimum value which is dependent on the track. Some of the more powerful tracks force a larger Enactment Period to ensure the network has ample time to prepare for any changes that the proposal might bring.</p> Interventions <p>Sometimes it becomes apparent that a proposal which is already being voted on (and perhaps is already passing) contains a problem and it is desirable to cancel it. An example of this would be a chain upgrade which was later discovered to contain some sort of issue. While this is not very common, it is also not entirely unheard of.</p><p>In Gov2, there is a special operation for intervening in this way known as Cancelation. This operation immediately rejects an ongoing referendum regardless of its status. It actually comes in two forms, with one just doing the bare operation and the other also slashing the initial proposer of the deposit(s) paid for the referendum.</p><p>Cancelation is itself a governance operation which must be voted upon by the network in order to execute. This poses a possible problem of timeline, and in order to be useful, getting a cancelation proposal passed must generally be quite a lot faster than any possible target proposal passed. As such, cancelation comes with its own Origin and track, which has a low lead-time and approval/support curves with slightly sharper reductions in their thresholds for passing.</p> Agile Delegation <p>In a perfect world, where everyone had unlimited time and virtuosity, everybody would research, discuss, consider and carefully vote on every proposal. However, in a perfect world we do not live. Not everyone has the time or inclination to make a well-researched vote on every matter. Out of this realisation, the Council was born into Polkadot’s original governance: a body delegated by voters to make up for the fact that many of them did not want to take part in the day-to-day of governance. However, with the Council gone in Gov2, we need an alternative means of ensuring “passive” voters are heard.</p><p>The original governance system had a feature called Vote Delegation, which we have retained and improved upon in Gov2. For those not familiar, this is similar to premise of liquid democracy: you are able to delegate your voting power to another voter in the system. When your delegate votes, they wield not just their own voting power but yours too. This works with conviction voting, allowing you to lock up your tokens in order to increase the level of voting power your delegate wields on your behalf. Of course the tokens in question never leave your control and you are free to switch delegates or regain direct control back whenever you please.</p><p>Gov2, however, improves on this with a rather special feature called Multirole Delegation. This allows you to specify a different delegate for every class of referendum in the system. If you do not want to delegate for a particular class of referendum then you can also retain direct control for that class.</p><p>This means you can delegate to one individual for any referenda on dealing out small tips to ecosystem contributors, another entity for referenda on more substantial treasury spending, another entity for purely technical network upgrades and parameterisations and finally retain direct control for any other decisions!</p> The Fellowship and Whitelist <p>Well-informed “expert” opinion plays an important role in any well-functioning governance system. A technocracy comes with its own rather serious flaws and thus we would not want “experts” to be placed in a position of command: it introduces risks of centralisation, unaccountable authority and lays the groundwork for what could become ultimately a ruling cabal. It was for this reason that Polkadot’s original governance’s Technical Committee has no “deciding power” but only the ability to reduce the voting period.</p><p>That all said, oraclising well-informed opinion and allowing it to help optimise the decision-making process, even if it has no direct effect on the decision-making outcome seems like a reasonable goal to strive for. Crucially, and for the sake of all involved, it must not be possible in any way for the expert body to subvert the overall stakeholder decision.</p><p>Root-Origin proposals are the sort which are needed for upgrades, fixes and rescues, but which necessarily have the power to arbitrarily break and corrupt the system. In Gov2, because they are so dangerous, we err on the side of safety and have extremely high levels of approval and support needed for early-passing and which reduce to their final levels only slowly. The lead-in and enactment periods are also large. In general the process is slow, and this is to give everybody in Polkadot the maximum amount of notice to ensure that bad proposals don’t make it through.</p><p>However, there are occasions where it is important to roll out a fix, upgrade or rescue logic in a shorter period of time. We may be able to assume there is broad consensus in these times, but the safeguards on the voting process above mean that executing such a fix can be difficult or impractical due to time constraints alone. Oraclising the idea that “the experts agree: this is both safe and time-critical” can be a very useful tool in forming a clear process which is well-considered in the general case but able to make decisions on a tight timeline when there is good reason to believe that circumstances require it.</p><p>There remain two big questions to answer here: how could the chain (a deterministic blob of logic with no inherent ability to express or observe concepts as “safe” and “time-critical”? And even if it could know of such circumstances, how do we adapt our logic without compromising our overall tractability and simplicity?</p> The Fellowship <p>The answer to the first question lies in a new governance body. For those familiar with the old governance system, this body can be thought of as the logic successor to the Technical Committee.</p><p>It is named the Polkadot Fellowship, and in totality is a sufficiently rich and sophisticated structure that it will form the subject of a whole other article. It will initially run on the Kusama network, since Gov2 will be deployed there for live-testing purposes, however it will be migrated over to Polkadot with the final Gov2 deployment and once there it will serve both networks via the Polkadot/Kusama bridge.</p><p>The Fellowship is a mostly self-governing expert body with a primary goal of representing the humans who embody and contain the technical knowledge base of the Polkadot network and protocol. Unlike the current Technical Collective it is designed to be far broader in membership (i.e. to work well with even tens of thousands of members) and with far lower in barriers to entry (both in terms of administrative process flow and expectations of expertise). Becoming a candidate member in the Fellowship is as easy as placing a small deposit.</p><p>In order to help ensure a high quality of collective decisions in light of such a broad membership, members are associated with a rank to designate the degree to which the system expects their opinion to be well-informed, of a sound technical basis and in line with the interests of Polkadot. The members of the Fellowship can vote on any given Fellowship proposal and the aggregate opinion of the members (weighted by their rank) constitutes the Fellowship’s considered opinion.</p><p>Beautifully enough, the technical means by which the Fellowship votes is actually exactly the same code (Substrate pallet) as the means by which the Polkadot stakeholders vote in a referendum and it has exactly the same facilities (multiple tracks, agile delegation, &amp;c).</p> Ranks and Pitfalls <p>Introducing the concept of rank is fraught with pitfalls. However, we are presented with relatively few options if decentralisation, accountability and safety for all involved are our requirements. We believe it is reasonable to utilise the openness, transparency and corruption-resistance that decentralised consensus brings to ensure that any “rulers” are not themselves above the “rules” and that rank comes with clear expectations, rules and accountability. The downsides of rank are not just bad for the network but also, in light of some recent decentralised-technology policy positions of politicians, are also bad for the participants: if rank allowed a small group of participants to have effective control over the network they could be considered in effective control of it and thus responsible for what happened on it.</p><p>As such, we adhere to three principles: firstly, the Fellowship must never have hard power over the network: it cannot change parameters, conduct rescues, or move assets. Concerning governance over the network, the only thing in its power is to reduce the effective timeline on which a referendum takes place.</p><p>Secondly, the rank system and weights must be designed so that we would not expect small groups of individuals to be able to capture and control overall decision-making capacity. While the Fellowship weights those with higher rank more in the aggregate opinion, the weight should not be so high as to make a small number of higher members’ opinions be insurmountable when compared to a coherent opinion coming from lower-ranked membership.</p><p>Thirdly, the Fellowship should be designed to grow and develop its membership and their aggregate levels of expertise and in doing ensure that its overall decision-making capacity gets stronger over time. For long-term success, the Fellowship must be an effective meritocracy where those with commitment, talent and expertise rise to greater levels of influence. To achieve this, we must give clarity and transparency to the process of entry and promotion through the ranks. To the highest degree possible, an individual’s identity should not form a consideration, only their ability.</p><p>In light of this, the Fellowship will have a constitution which describes in specific terms the requirements and expectations for individuals to attain and retain any given rank. Higher ranks are able to vote and promote lower ranks voting based on this constitution. Demotion happens automatically after a period in which a member is unable to defend their position to their peers. Suspension can happen only through general (Polkadot) referendum, providing a means of ensuring that controversy or unpopularity within the Fellowship does not (necessarily) result in expulsion. Furthermore, to guard against the chance of the Fellowship becoming a cabal, entrance into the top tiers of ranks also requires a full (Polkadot) referendum and cannot be bestowed merely by ones Fellowship peers.</p> The Whitelist <p>While the Fellowship may be able to represent Polkadot’s body of human experts on-chain and provide a piece of deterministic logic from which to source their aggregate opinion, it may be unclear how we can integrate this into the overall referendum system. In fact, this is achieved using a combination of concepts we already know and a wonderfully simple piece of on-chain logic called the Whitelist pallet.</p><p>The Whitelist pallet does one thing: it allows one Origin to escalate the privilege level of another Origin for a certain operation. In terms of Gov2, it allows the Fellowship to authorise a new origin (which we will call Whitelisted-Root) to be executed with Root-level privileges. You can think of it as a sort of Unix <code>sudo</code>, except that it only works with specific commands that the Fellowship have pre-authorised. What this means is that we can have a new track in Polkadot’s governance which is for proposals which will have been whitelisted by the Fellowship. If the referendum passes, then they will be executed inside of the Whitelist pallet with this Whitelisted-Root origin. The Whitelist pallet verifies two things: that this origin really is the Whitelisted-Root (i.e. that the referendum passed on this track) and that the proposal has indeed been whitelisted by the Fellowship. If so then it goes ahead and executes the operation with Root-level privileges.</p><p>With this we don’t need to change anything about how the referendum system works (yey!). We now have a new track (for the Whitelisted-Root origin) whose parameters allow for a shorter voting turnaround, safe in the knowledge that through an open and transparent process, a body of global experts on the Polkadot protocol has determined that this is both safe and time-critical.</p> Timeline &amp; Future work <p>Gov2 is set to launch on Kusama imminently, following final professional audit of its code. Once tested on Kusama, a proposal will be made for the Polkadot network to vote on.</p><p>An update to this overall governance system, codenamed “Gov2.5”, is planned for eventual deployment some months afterwards. It will two bring key features: firstly a “collect-call” feature for vote delegation, essentially allowing users (via their wallets) to offer their funds up for delegation without paying any transaction fees; instead the delegate would be able to optionally pay the transaction fees to get the funds delegated. Secondly, a free undelegation transaction will be introduced, able to be used in a limited capacity by all delegating users. Together these features enable wallets to offer a highly streamlined and zero-cost governance integration to their users, which we hope will entice more involvement in the overall governance process from users.</p>

<a href="https://www.smartcontractresearch.org#tldr-2"></a>TLDR 
 
 Blockchain technology enables decentralized and self-sovereign identities including new mechanisms for creating, resolving, and revoking them. 
 The public availability of data records has allowed attacks that combine sophisticated heuristics with auxiliary information to compromise users’ privacy and deanonymize their identities. 
 We review and categorize Bitcoin privacy attacks, investigate their impact on one of the Bitcoin-based identity methods namely did:btcr, and analyze and discuss its privacy properties. 
 
 
<a href="https://www.smartcontractresearch.org#core-research-question-3"></a>Core Research Question 
<p>How can we categorize Bitcoin privacy attacks, and investigate privacy issues in did:btcr?</p>

<a href="https://www.smartcontractresearch.org#background-5"></a>Background 
<p>Entities (e.g., users and organizations), use global unique identifiers such as telephone numbers, ID, or URLs. However, these identifiers are often issued and managed by central authorities. Blockchain-based decentralized identifiers have been proposed to prove an identifier’s ownership without having to rely on a trusted entity.</p>
 
 
Decentralized identifier (DID): A string that includes three main parts: the scheme, the DID method, and the DID method identifier, which should be unique within the DID method. 
 
DID document: Contains information about the verification methods and the service endpoints required to interact with the DID subjects. 
 
DID subject: The entity that is identified by the DID, and can be a person, an object or an organization. 
 
DID method: Defines how DIDs are created, resolved, updated, and revoked. 
 
 
<a href="https://www.smartcontractresearch.org#summary-6"></a>Summary 
 
 We review and categorize privacy attacks on the Bitcoin blockchain, which may reveal the links between addresses and real-world identities, and also correlate between different identities. 
 We address Bitcoin privacy attacks’ impact on the DID method did:btcr. 
 We adopted the privacy terminology from RFC 6973. 
 
 
<a href="https://www.smartcontractresearch.org#method-7"></a>Method 
<p>Four main steps for collecting and selecting relevant literature:</p>
 
 research questions identification 
 literature search 
 literature selection 
 data extraction 
 
 
<a href="https://www.smartcontractresearch.org#results-8"></a>Results 
 
 
<p>We categorized Bitcoin privacy attacks into four main categories (i) heuristics, (ii) side channel attacks, (iii) flow analysis, and (iv) auxiliary information.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 
 
<p>We showed how data analysis of Bitcoin public records, in combination with auxiliary information can be exploited using sophisticated heuristics, to reveal or correlate transactions, identities, or addresses of users.</p>
 
 
<p>This study has demonstrated that although BTCR provides some advantages such as protection against censorship, integrity, access, and a degree of decentralization; it still lacks methods to deal with the privacy issues identified in this paper.</p>
 
 
 
<a href="https://www.smartcontractresearch.org#discussion-and-key-takeaways-9"></a>Discussion and Key Takeaways 
<p>We investigate the privacy of the method did:btcr based on the criteria adopted from RFC 6973.</p>
 
 
Surveillance: Any kind of observation and monitoring of the users, whether the users are aware of the surveillance or not, can influence a user’s the privacy.
 
 Auxiliary information is obtained through the interactions with services using DIDs. 
 Blockchain is immutable, no way to delete the history. 
 
 
 
Correlation: The combination of different information, which relates to one user.
 
 Using the same DID or DID document for interacting with different services helps to trace and correlate user activities. 
 Using the same public keys in different DID documents can reveal the link between the corresponding DIDs. 
 The IP address of an entity can compromise the relationship of common controls, linking between different DIDs. 
 Timing analysis can correlate users’ activities using the same service endpoint in the DID documents. 
 
 
 
Identification: Relating the information to a specific user.
 
 If the Bitcoin address associated to a DID is later spent, it can link the address used for DID to other addresses owned by the user. 
 The visibility of the DID document can leak the metadata about the attributes and provide information about the service endpoints. 
 If the DID document is stored in the third-party server, the latter may identify the real DID owner. 
 If the DID document is stored on a user’s own server, it can correlate the user IP address with the DID document. 
 
 
 
Secondary Use: Collecting the information about a user without their consent and using it for purposes other than that which the information was collected for.
 
 Read/resolve makes it possible to trace the DID use if it is accessed by third party services (e.g., universal DID resolver). 
 The verifier can trace the transaction flow, check the history of the UTXOs! 
 DID real identity can be compromised if used in services that require information about the users or their activities (e.g., social networks). 
 
 
 
Disclosure: Exposure of information about a user which violates the confidentiality of the shared data.
 
 Privacy may be lost in the economic activities for the services authenticated by DIDs. 
 BTCR updates reveal the public key of the previous DID or changing the access control. 
 
 
 
Misattribution: Whenever a user’s data or communications are attributed to another, which can consequently affect the user’s reputation.
 
 Using indistinguishable mixing techniques can relate the users’ UTXOs to someone else. 
 
 
 
 
<a href="https://www.smartcontractresearch.org#implications-and-follow-ups-10"></a>Implications and Follow-Ups 
<p>Future research will consist of elaborating and developing new methods, or using existing privacy-enhancing techniques (e.g., mixing techniques, zero-knowledge proofs) to address the aforementioned privacy issues.</p>
 
<a href="https://www.smartcontractresearch.org#applicability-11"></a>Applicability 
 
 This work can improve privacy countermeasures for DIDs BTCR. 
 It can also provide comprehensive privacy attacks for privacy threat modeling. 
 Our future work contains privacy threat modeling based on LINDDUN. The paper will appear on <a href="https://ptmworkshop.gitlab.io/#/proceedings">PTM Workshop</a> under the name “User-Centric Public Blockchain Privacy Threats”.

 The Veil community is dear to us 

<p>At the Veil Project we consider all contributors to be part of the Veil family, whether an Original Generation team member, or one who joined us later, and they are very welcome to contribute again to Veil, whenever possible.</p>

<p>There are some staff who are no longer able to be involved as team members. codeofalltrades, dango and mados, we appreciate the work they have done, especially most recently, codeofalltrades, who has made significant contributions to the robustness of Veil’s core software. Cavespectre also has had to curtail his active development, as you may notice if checking Github.</p>

<p>While this blog has evidently been sadly neglected, it should change from this time onward. To catch up on other  staff changes, please welcome us77ipis (Github ID) Johns5937 (on Discord) for his recent and ongoing contributions as an evidently motivated Bounty Developer. We are currently considering a reduction in the ProgPow DAG GPU memory size and are aware of arguments for and against this. If you would like to weigh in on the subject, please feel free to join our Discord mining channel, and/or our Veil-Dev Discord if you are able to contribute to writing code and testing submissions on our test and development networks.</p>

<p>Also please welcome Zannick. Although we have not yet got around to creating a staff page for him, he has been a developer in the team since 2021, contributed some important bug fixes, reviewing other devs’ code submissions, and is working on the future RingCT staking upgrade.</p>

<p>Steel97 (Github ID) IVAN (on Discord), also no staff profile page yet, should be recognised for his neat replacement of the Veil block explorers, which brings efficiency improvements.</p>

 Light wallet is coming (with the Zelcore desktop wallet — later will be the mobile wallet) 

<p>Blondfrogs currently has a  major upgrade in progress for the inclusion of Veil in the awesome Zelcore wallet. This is a light wallet, so it does not require the Veil user to maintain the full blockchain history on their own computer. Furthermore, Veil’s inclusion will be using RingCT anonymous transactions! When this is available, it will be announced in our NEWS updates. Although Blondfrogs is an OG Veil developer, this submission he is working on is done in his capacity as a developer for the Zelcore team, so he is not expected, although is very welcome, to do other regular contributions to Veil’s code.</p>

  Brave's new system STAR protects user privacy by ensuring the data users contribute are never unique to that user. This property, sometimes called k-anonymity, ensures that the data collector can only see a submitted value if the same value has also been submitted by some number of other users.

<p>This is the nineteenth post in an <a>ongoing, regular series</a> describing new and upcoming privacy features in Brave. This post describes work done by Alex Davidson, Peter Snyder, eV Quirk, Joseph Genereux, Benjamin Livshits, and Hamed Haddadi. This post was written by Senior Director of Privacy Peter Snyder.</p>
<p>Researchers at Brave have developed <a>STAR</a><a>1</a>, a system that allows users to participate in private data collection, under cryptographic guarantees that their data will be readable only if other users have contributed the exact same values. Such systems are important for performing privacy-protecting, Web-scale measurements of software (sometimes referred to as analytics or telemetry).</p>
<p>STAR’s main goals are to provide strong privacy guarantees while still being usable and affordable for small-to-medium sized companies. Existing systems<a>2</a> are extremely expensive to deploy (making them unusable for all but the largest companies), require trusted third-parties or special hardware, and/or require millions of users to achieve useful results. STAR, by contrast, provides privacy guarantees similar to, or better than, existing systems, while being practical and affordable for projects and organizations serving anywhere from dozens to millions of users.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10074">STAR system</a> will be presented at the <a href="https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2022/">2022 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS)</a> in Los Angeles, and is being discussed for possible standardization in the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-dss-star/">IETF</a>. STAR is available in an <a href="https://github.com/brave/sta-rs">open source Rust implementation</a>, and will be used to protect user privacy in many current and future Brave products.</p>

 Privacy-preserving data collection through k-anonymity&nbsp; 
<p>Collecting data on how software is used in detail can be helpful for both developers and users. Developers can use this information to fix bugs and optimize code; users benefit from better software.</p>
<p>But capturing this user data carries the ethical and often legal responsibility of collecting it in a privacy preserving way. We emphasize that collecting data in a privacy-protecting manner is a necessary, but not sufficient, part of ethical data collection. Users should always be in control and aware when contributing data.</p>
<p>Brave’s new system STAR protects user privacy by ensuring the data users contribute are never unique to that user. This property, sometimes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity">k-anonymity</a>, ensures that the data collector can only see a submitted value if the same value has also been submitted by some number of other users. K-anonymity (and thus the STAR system) prevents the data collector from ever seeing values that are unique—this means the values can’t be used to identify users.</p>
<p>K-anonymity is one of many approaches for ensuring privacy during data collection<a>3</a>, each with different strengths and weaknesses. STAR adopts k-anonymity because:</p>
 
 It embodies an easy to understand approach to privacy. 
 It successfully allows the data collector to learn the “heavy hitters” (i.e., the most commonly shared values) without requiring very large user bases. 
 The applications targeted by STAR are not the kinds of cases where k-anonymity systems have been attacked in the past. 
 

 A simple k-anonymity example: ice cream 
<p>As an example of how k-anonymity protects user privacy, consider this fake example:</p>
<p>An organization wants to learn about their employees’ favorite ice cream flavor. But people only want to participate in this ice-cream survey if they’re assured the organization can’t learn whether they voted. Participants want anonymity.</p>
<p>People who cast ballots for chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry (or other common flavors) aren’t at risk—many&nbsp; people like these flavors, so the organization can’t learn much about who voted, if they voted for a common flavor.</p>
<p>However, votes for uncommon flavors of ice cream do risk revealing who gave that answer. If everyone knows a person’s favorite flavor of ice cream is olive—and if that person completed the survey—the organization will be pretty confident about who submitted that answer.</p>
<p>With k-anonymity, the “olive” answer would be removed before the data is ever analyzed.</p>
<p>At essence, k-anonymity is an approach to data collection that builds on the ice cream example: It allows the party collecting data to see common, popular values, but does not allow the data collector to see rare (and therefore potentially identifying) values.</p>

 K-anonymity is difficult in practice 
<p>K-anonymity is simple in concept, but difficult to build in practice. For example, who decides (and how) which values are common or rare without revealing the potentially identifying values in the first place?</p>
<p>One sub-optimal option would be to let a neutral third-party count the values first, before those values are shared with the data collector. But that only introduces a “shell game” of trusting privacy to the third-party instead of the data collector; the same privacy risk still exists.</p>
<p>There are many other similar difficulties when trying to implement real-world k-anonymity systems.</p>
<p>With STAR, we’ve found a way to achieve k-anonymity without these suboptimal verifications.</p>

 STAR achieves k-anonymity cheaply and securely 
<p>STAR is a practical, effective, and cheap way to build data collection systems that protect k-anonymity. STAR differs from existing systems by being the first deployed system to achieve each of the following goals:</p>
<p>Cheap to deploy: STAR is extremely fast and does not require special hardware. This means that STAR can be deployed by everything from small hobbyist projects to large, multi-million-user software projects. In our simulations, STAR is 24 times cheaper than the existing state-of-the-art approach<a>4</a>.</p>
<p>Easy to understand: STAR uses a unique combination of existing, vetted, and well understood cryptographic tools (i.e., symmetric encryption to encrypt data, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir's_Secret_Sharing">Shamir secret sharing</a> to enforce k-anonymity, and verifiable oblivious pseudorandom functions to boost randomness). Using existing cryptographic tools (rather than relying on novel cryptographic primitives) means more people can safely implement, deploy, and audit STAR systems.</p>
<p>Strong privacy guarantees: STAR delivers privacy similar or superior to existing state-of-the-art systems, including fallback protections in the case of server compromise<a>5</a>.</p>
<p>Accurate results with small user bases: STAR provides strong accuracy guarantees, even with small numbers of users. This is unlike other existing approaches<a>6</a> that provide accurate results only when thousands or millions of users contribute results.</p>
<p>Doesn’t require special hardware: STAR runs on standard computing hardware, and can thus be deployed on personal servers, standard cloud infrastructure, or any other stock hardware. This ensures STAR can be used by more projects, especially those with smaller budgets (unlike some existing systems that rely on special “trusted” hardware, such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/">AWS Nitro</a> or <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/software-guard-extensions/overview.html">Intel SGX</a>).</p>

 Using STAR to protect user privacy 
<p>Brave has developed STAR as a practical, real-world focused system for improving user privacy. While we hope others will use STAR to protect privacy in their own projects, the primary aim was to allow users to share data with Brave in a way that still preserves privacy.</p>
<p>To that end, Brave is making three commitments with STAR:</p>
<p>First, Brave will use STAR in its own products, in cases where we give users the option to allow data collection. For example, Brave’s <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409406835469-What-is-the-Web-Discovery-Project-">Web Discovery Project</a> uses a form of STAR to allow users to share browsing information to help build the Brave Search index. Similarly, we’ve incorporated STAR into the <a>“Privacy Preserving Product Analytics” (P3A)</a> system that allows users to share browser usage data with Brave.</p>
<p>More important, even with STAR’s protections, Brave users will always have the option not to share data with Brave. STAR is intended only to add additional privacy protections to data that users want to share, rather than to allow Brave to collect more data about users.</p>
<p>Second, Brave is developing STAR in the open, for other projects to use, adopt, or modify as they choose. Brave maintains both <a href="https://github.com/brave/sta-rs">Rust</a> and <a href="https://github.com/brave/sta-rs/blob/main/star-wasm/src/lib.rs">WASM</a> versions of STAR, and both are published under the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/">Mozilla Public License v2</a>.</p>
<p>Third, Brave is working to standardize STAR in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as part of the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/ppm/about/">Privacy Preserving Measurements</a> working group. Our goal is to ensure that there is a standards-based way for small organizations to collect data in a privacy-respecting way.</p>

<p>If you are acquainted with the everyday actuality of the crypto space, you surely have heard of staking. You likely also hold some staking misconceptions that need to change ASAP.<br></p><p>Besides being one out of several ways to earn passive income in crypto, staking is a vital piece of the blockchain puzzle. It keeps blockchain networks secure, allows the average user to participate in governing crypto ecosystems, and (as we’ll see below) much more.</p> What is staking in crypto? <p>The average observer who comes across the term 'staking' may assume it is a concept related to gambling. Indeed, the word 'stake' is used in betting circles to describe monies or properties placed on a bet. When you stake a certain amount on an outcome, you stand to earn rewards in multiples of the amount staked if your bet wins. If you remove the stake, on the other hand, the bet is canceled, and you will not earn any returns even if the bet wins.<br></p><p>Staking is a tad different in the crypto space. The term staking first emerged from the concept of the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/">proof-of-stake</a> consensus mechanism. However, it is worth noting that the term staking is increasingly used in a flexible, somewhat confusing way. This article will focus on clearing out staking misconceptions, confusion, and different meanings associated with the term staking.<br></p><p>Let's start with understanding the concept of proof-of-stake, where it all originated.<br></p> The origins –staking in proof-of-stake (PoS) networks<br> <p>Proof-of-stake is one out of several consensus mechanisms through which the participants of a distributed ledger can achieve the consensus needed to secure a common state of the network. A proof-of-stake blockchain network has several kinds of participants, such as users, delegators, validators, developers, etc. Staking involves validators and delegators.<br></p><p>To become <a href="https://phemex.com/academy/blockchain-validator-process'">validators</a> (and receive rewards for it) in a proof-of-stake network, users are required to lock up the network’s native asset in a smart contract. This process is called staking. Besides locking up their assets, validators are also required to store a copy of the network’s ledger and keep it updated as per network rules. <br></p><p>Additionally, there are often a number of assets required to be locked to participate as a staker. For example, in the upcoming Ethereum proof-of-stake network Beacon chain, users are required to lock at least 32 ETH to become validators.<br></p>Diagram showcasing the rewards associated with the staking process (<a href="https://cryptolad.co/how-to-stake-crypto/">Source</a>).<p>Validators are rewarded with tokens issued by the protocol’s inflationary mechanism. Similarly, validators can be penalized for not following the rules of the network. Thus, the process of staking incentivizes the validators to act honestly and follow the network’s protocols.<br></p><p>To directly participate in staking, a user needs to hold coins in a <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/get-started/custodial-non-custodial-bitcoin-wallets/">non-custodial wallet</a> and enter them into the staking contract, sometimes for a fixed period. <br></p><p>Users can also participate in staking indirectly through centralized exchanges (we’ll dive into this in a bit), which pool together funds from different users. It’s worth noting here that staking on centralized exchanges is done in a custodial manner. This means that the centralized exchanges act as a third-party responsible for the safety of tokens. Centralized staking can be both convenient (since it reduces the minimum entry level for users) and inconvenient (since users need to pay a commission and transfer ownership of their tokens), depending on each person’s preferences.<br></p><p>However, even in PoS staking, there’s a common misconception that all networks follow the same structure.<br></p> Staking misconception #1: not all PoS staking is equal<br> <p>So far, we’ve covered PoS staking focusing on Ethereum as an example. However, this is far from being the only model.<br></p><p>Some protocols also offer soft staking, where users do not need to lock their coins to earn rewards (e.g., <a href="https://www.algorand.com/">Algorand</a>). The protocol distributes rewards to active stakers according to an estimated annual percentage yield/rate. Algorand users are paid staking rewards for each new block by simply holding ALGO tokens in their wallets.<br></p><p>Some blockchain networks that use a PoS consensus mechanism also allow validators to participate in governance decisions that drive progress in the ecosystem. Crypto staking has evolved from a method of securely recording transactions to also facilitating governance and other features.<br></p><p>We should also note that to participate in staking to secure a network, users don’t necessarily need to actively participate in block validation. They in turn delegate their stake to validators in a non-custodial manner to earn staking rewards without active participation. This is called delegated proof-of-stake (dPoS).<br></p> Governance staking<br> <p>Governance staking requires users to “invest” in a protocol –a blockchain network, a DeFi protocol, etc– by means of purchasing its governance token. Users can then earn rewards for staking their coins, which also entitles them to governance votes, often directly proportional to the number of tokens staked. <br></p>Diagram showing blockchain governance process (<a href="https://www.mphasis.com/home/thought-leadership/blog/crypto-governance-adopting-a-decentralized-approach-to-governance.html">Source</a>).<p>Governance staking offers users a chance to participate in the governing of the projects they believe in, taking an active role in decision-making. By participating in governance, average users can shape the future of their favorite <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io">crypto projects</a> and still earn rewards for staking. Governance staking can happen in PoS and dPoS networks, protocols hosted on top of them, and even in centralized protocols. As you’ll see, this is key to understanding the many shapes the word “staking” can take.<br></p> Other common staking misconceptions <p>One of the main misconceptions of staking is, as we’ve mentioned, thinking that all staking is exactly the same. <br></p><p>You may have encountered mechanisms inspired by proof-of-stake staking in <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/institutional-defi-the-next-big-thing-a5b07193232b/">DeFi protocols</a>. Concepts like liquidity staking (staking to earn rewards for providing liquidity) and yield farming (staking one asset, sometimes interest-bearing assets, to earn rewards in another) draw inspiration from PoS staking and have become mainstream in the crypto space, with <a href="https://defillama.com/">billions of dollars</a> committed to protocols globally. <br></p><p>Although many might know exactly what each protocol refers to when mentioning staking, there are still a few misconceptions about the concept and what it entails.<br></p> Staking misconception #2: same name, different uses<br> <p>As we saw above, even in PoS chains, not all staking opportunities are created equally.<br></p><p>Even though the term staking originated from the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, the term staking has various meanings nowadays. For example, you could stake MATIC to earn rewards on Binance (a centralized exchange), stake ETH to become a validator on the Ethereum network, or even stake Curve tokens to participate in their protocol’s governance. Therefore, it’s important to clear up what each of these different projects actually mean.<br></p><p>On a broader level, the main difference between the many types of staking lies in the nature of each protocol. Blockchain networks incentivize users to stake to secure the network and validate transactions, issuing rewards to those helping validate news blocks. On the other hand, DeFi protocols do not need to validate blocks but strive for liquidity and <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/total-value-locked-tvl">total-value-locked</a> (TVL), so they encourage and incentivize liquidity staking. Centralized exchanges care about making a profit, and they can do so through fees, commissions, or finding creative ways to leverage the assets you deposit in them. <br></p>Risks of liquidity and lending staking vs. protocol staking. (<a href="https://www.figment.io/resources/misconceptions-about-staking-protocol-staking-vs-liquidity-lending">Source</a>)<p>All of the different mechanisms above utilize the same name and issue rewards, but they have different structures and ultimate goals. Therefore, you can define staking as a system in which a protocol issue rewards to users in exchange for them putting their holdings of selected tokens in stake. As we have mentioned this could be for any of the different purposes each protocol may have.</p> Staking misconception #3: losing and making money<br> <p>Another common misconception is that you can’t lose money through staking. Users tend to equate a staking program with the idea that, even if their assets depreciate, staking rewards will ultimately cover any reduction in the initial value of the coins staked. Not only is this belief misleading, but it is also financially irresponsible. You can earn valuable passive income, but also lose money in crypto staking.<br></p><p>This is true even when it comes to dPoS or PoS staking. If a validator fails to maintain network security or behaves dishonestly, they may lose a percentage of their stake through slashing. Also, crypto prices experience high volatility, and most proof-of-stake protocols do not allow immediate unstaking. To name a famous example, users who staked <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/4-valuable-lessons-from-terras-collapse-opinion/">LUNA</a> before the coin's price fell dramatically lost billions of dollars and could not unstake in time to not sell at a loss.<br></p> Is staking crypto safe? Benefits and risks <p>Just like all endeavors in the crypto space, staking has its upsides and potential downsides. Some of them are: <br></p> Benefits of staking   Governance: From voting on Treasury distributions to new hires, token holders can have a say in determining the project's direction and help shape its future. This, in theory, should inform protocols to make better product decisions and serve its community better over the long term.<br>  Rewards: Users can earn rewards proportional to the value of the staked coins. Projects incentivize staking as if to say 'thank you for continuing to be a part of this project and believing in us.' Some staking programs also give users access to tokens they can then use to unlock their staked principal or even deploy to the DeFi ecosystem.   Staking risks   Crypto prices are highly volatile. Therefore, in staking, users need to worry about potential downward price swings that may result in significant losses, outweighing any earned rewards.<br>  Staking and unstaking periods, which can cause liquidity problems for some users.<br>  In the case of centralized staking, not holding control over one’s coins.<br>  In the case of delegated proof-of-stake systems, users risk losing their tokens to slashing if their designated validator misbehaves.<br>  Just like in every crypto project, users run a risk of their designated project (centralized or decentralized) being hacked, exploited, or disappearing. <br>   Is staking crypto taxable? Let’s look at the precedents <p>Crypto staking generates passive income for users. Yet, the authorities have not finished deciding on whether staking rewards are taxable or how they should be taxed. Firstly, regulations differ from country to country. In the United States, the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/02/25/why-we-still-need-guidance-on-staking-rewards-taxation/">Internal Revenue Service</a> does not have a definite position on the tax regulations specific to staking rewards. However, the regulator has a clear stance on earnings that should be classified under an individual's gross income.<br></p><p>According to the Internal Revenue Code, paying for services and interests is part of an individual's gross income. Now, the IRS views staking rewards as compensation for validating a network or interests received for participation. Either way, staking rewards are classified as gross income and are therefore, taxable. <br></p><p>In the famous <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/shehanchandrasekera/2022/03/07/crypto-couples-victory-against-the-irs-comes-at-the-cost-of-regulatory-clarity/?sh=2fcb7ac748f9">Jarretts case</a>, the IRS refunded taxes collected from Tezos staking rewards. The Jarretts' lawyers argued that staking rewards were neither compensation for validating networks nor interests earned. Instead, they claimed that staking rewards were newly created assets. This, they argued, made the tokens alike an artist's painting, which is also taxable when sold, not upon receipt.<br></p><p>However, while several crypto accounts on social media used the Jarretts' case as a reference to prove that staking rewards should not be taxed, certain factors may render the judgment meaningless in the long run. <br></p><p>Firstly, a District Court heard the case, not a Tax Court. Also, since the Jarretts did not accept the refund, the case will go on trial in 2023. The IRS will push for clearer legislation, which may set a federal precedent that could render the Jarretts' argument null and void.<br></p><p>The discussion around tax laws on staking rewards will continue. The IRS, on one side, believes that staking rewards count as gross income upon creation. Crypto stakeholders (conveniently) argue that these new <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/the-bull-case-for-zkp-from-token-agnostic-privacy-to-full-user-empowerment-in-web-3-2af9c6b0010b/">tokens</a> are created, not earned as interest or compensation, which makes them only taxable when sold.</p> What else is staking good for? <p>As we described throughout the article, there are many other things that can be done by staking. Since staking is basically locking up your tokens in exchange for rewards (whether they come in the form of tokens, governance participation, or something else) this showcases your commitment and investment in a project.<br></p><p>The novelty of staking as a concept and of the crypto ecosystem as a whole makes it likely that we will continue to discover new functionalities of staking. The possibilities are, in a sense, infinite. For example, Panther aims to release a staking system through which users can mint private versions of their assets in MASPs (Multi-Asset Shielded Pools), allowing users to break the on-chain link and transact privately. &nbsp;If you’d like to learn more about this system and participate in Wave 3 of Incentivized Advanced Staking, you can do so by reading this <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wave-3-of-incentivized-advanced-staking-testing-begins-on-july-7th/">blog post</a>.</p> In summary: staking misconceptions won’t go away, but now you know better. <p>As networks like Ethereum transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, it’s unlikely that staking will ever go away. Staking in crypto has its fair share of benefits and risks, yet, it is a reliable passive income generator for users with long-term goals and helps drive active participation in the crypto space. It also helps projects incentivize users to hold on to their tokens as opposed to selling them, which in turn encourages healthier market dynamics.<br></p><p>When it comes to staking misconceptions, it is unlikely that they will fully go away –after all, the diversity of staking solutions will likely continue to increase. However, we hope this article served its purpose: informing you of a powerful general-purpose tool, its background, and how to interact and benefit from it.<br></p><p>If you’re interested in more articles like this, please sign up to receive the Panther newsletter!

<p>Yesterday I was feeling frustrated with the digital world and picked up a book that had just come in the mail:&nbsp; Alexandra Rutherford’s “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Beyond-the-Box-Skinner-Technology-of-Life.pdf">Beyond the Box: B.F. Skinner’s Technology of Behavior from Laboratory to Life, 1950s-1970s</a>.” As I got to the chapter on token economies at <a href="http://www.carolyar.com/Illinois/Misc/Anna.htm">Anna State Mental Hospital in Illinois</a>, it all became crystal clear – the dopamine hits of social media are the tokens. They use them to program us.</p>
<p>So, I decided to back-off my social media footprint even further and rework what I imagine “success” to be. I keep telling myself it’s not a numbers game; it’s an intention game. My friend Cliff taught me that; he’s a smart guy, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKR1kKh86sA">check out his channel</a>. So now I have to have the gumption to put that belief into practice, even though I’ll admit it’s hard letting go of the idea that you have some big audience out there somewhere. None of it it is real, though, just a reflection.</p>
<p>I’m in the process of downloading an archive of my 20,000+ Tweets and will be deactivating @philly852 this weekend. Let people know if they wonder where I went. I do quietly hope some people will notice that I’ve gone despite the intense shadow-banning. Jason is working on a space housed on the blog where people who really want to unpack what I’ve been researching regarding mixed reality and gamified social impact finance can gather to compare notes. We’ll do a video about it once we have it up and running. I’m hoping we can store my tweets on the blog, because there are a lot of good links to primary source material for those who may be inclined to follow the trail we’ve been blazing.</p>
<p>The video below is a bit of a grumpy outpouring, but I do go on to read two of the chapters of the book aloud with commentary. The comment section is very lively, too! This is actually really important stuff and highly relevant. We don’t have to look to China or Tel Aviv or London – a lot of this mess was cooked up right in Cambridge, MA by the likes of Fred and his many colleagues intent on devising technologies to manipulate rats, pigeons, and beagles to do their bidding. Sometimes that involved steering bombs and being irradiated to death.</p>
<p>If you want to read it yourself, the link above is to a PDF of the book.</p>

<p>We would like to congratulate Cody Burns for his election to the Zcash Community Grants committee. Professionally, Cody is an enterprise blockchain architect at a professional technology consulting firm where he focuses on multi-party systems, digital identity, and works on implementing zero-knowledge systems at scale. Cody has worked with distributed systems since the early 2000’s in the US military (leaving government service in 2009) and he has worked publicly with cryptocurrencies since 2014. Cody is currently a board member of the Ethereum Classic cooperative and a participating member of the Ethereum Enterprise alliance. Cody’s stated motivation for candidacy in the ZCG committee is to advance projects which are legitimate in business purpose, technical aptitude, and are an advancement to the Zcash ecosystem. Cody is familiar with the needs and requirements of enterprise blockchain and security considerations and he views Zcash as being at the bleeding edge of distributed systems funding. All of us at the Foundation are looking forward to working with Cody.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Foundation would like to thank Hudson for his contributions to Zcash. Hudson is a talented individual who has played an active role within the Zcash ecosystem, sitting on the ZCG committee (previously known as the Zcash Open Major Grants) for two terms. Hudson has been instrumental in helping the committee form and we look forward to his continued engagement in the Zcash ecosystem.</p>
<p>The Foundation would also like to thank all <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/37e58fc6-f224-11ec-bf24-f6d18567a65e/voters/list">ZCAP members that participated in this election</a> process. This poll had the highest turnout (92%) of any ZCAP poll to date, and we hope we can continue this trend as we work to expand the ZCAP.</p>

         The Listeners                <p>By Lacy Warner</p><p>Photography: MARK DAVIS</p><p>Published July 14, 2022</p>            <p>For Deepika Bodapati and Tanay Tandon of Athelas, paying attention is a superpower.</p>       



 
 
   
<p>Four years ago, Deepika Bodapati was up late, staring at her computer and doing something rather unusual for a founder of a startup soon to achieve unicorn status: she was reading all the support tickets that came through her company, Athelas’, website. “Once in a while, we’ll have our employees’ parents write in,” Bodapati says with a laugh. “But I read every single thing because I just thought it was super interesting.” As Bodapati waded through the queries and suggestions, studying how her sales team handled issues, she noticed one woman, Dr. Deanna Kelly, writing in again and again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She was very persistent,” Bodapati recalls. Dr. Kelly, Chief and Director of the Treatment Research Program at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center, was asking to study the Athelas One device, claiming she could help Bodapati further develop and test the machine. Bodapati knew that she and her co-founder, Tanay Tandon, were looking at an arduous application process for their second FDA clearance and would need all the support they could get. So Bodapati did what she was best at: she picked up the phone and listened to what Dr. Kelly had to say. This approach has come to define her ability to build both a better product and a better business.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Listening has always been central to Bodapati’s creative process. Listening closely to both the data and her intuition led to the Athelas One, which is the only FDA-approved, internet-connected finger-prick device that tests white blood cell and neutrophil counts at home and then shares that information directly with healthcare providers. The Athelas One is a small black cylinder, similar in appearance to an Alexa device. In a traditional lab, pathologists take a drop of blood, put it on a slide, smear and stain it and place it under a microscope to determine cell counts. Athelas One uses computer vision and machine learning to automate the process, and then sends the information to a healthcare team. Athelas is a leader in producing portable devices for remote patient monitoring (RPM), a growing sector of the global healthcare market that may be worth more than $175.2 billion by 2027. The need for such an industry was revealed during the pandemic, but RPM can benefit anyone from patients with chronic diseases who need to consistently track their medical data, to elderly or disabled individuals for whom a trip to the doctor’s office can be cumbersome.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As lifelong scientists, the founders knew Athelas One needed data proving, beyond doubt, that it worked consistently and accurately; as entrepreneurs, they knew a trial, as soon as possible, would be essential for the company’s development. When the duo participated in Y Combinator, they found themselves among a handful of potential competitors—but none of them had run a clinical trial yet. Bodapati and Tandon knew this could make them stand out to potential customers, partners and collaborators. “There was no option,” Bodapati says. “There would be no company if there was no trial.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Setting up a clinical trial is complicated, and, through an acquaintance, Bodapati had a lead on a hospital in Juarez, Mexico, a city of 1.5 million across the border from El Paso, Texas. In 2016, Bodapati and Tandon conducted their first clinical trial for Athelas One.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bodapati says that the hospital instantly saw the value in the Athelas One device for their patients. “We were able to set up a table, where, on one side we had our device, and on the other side was the nurse who was drawing blood to compare with the Athelas One samples (to make sure they were accurate). And then we told them, ‘Free blood testing for anyone for the next three days.’” Bodapati sat at a table in the hallway with the Athelas One and its finger-pricking lancets and glass test strips, and Tandon sat in another room reviewing the results on a computer monitor. The response was overwhelming. Patients came from all over, alone at first, and then the next day with their families. One patient, at the hospital for a routine appointment with their doctor, had blood drawn at the Athelas table on a whim—a whim that would be life altering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Tandon saw this patient’s blood cell images on his laptop, he knew instantly that something was wrong. Over several days, he’d been reviewing hundreds of blood test results, all displaying the normal range of white blood cells, between 6,000 and 8,000, but this patient had a count of well over 40,000. Tandon immediately got up to show Bodapati the results. The two also saw that the cells were immature, which indicated mass proliferation of leukocytes, a type of white blood cell. Tandon and Bodapati knew what this meant: the patient had leukemia. But because Athelas One had yet to receive FDA approval as a diagnostic tool, they couldn’t speak directly to the patient. They were, however, able to alert the hospital staff that the patient needed to be tested for cancer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bodapati remembers flying back to California days later and sitting quietly next to Tandon, both of them struck by the force of what had happened. She felt the weight of the results, presented in such a personal way to someone they’d seen face-to-face. Though the two were mainly silent on the flight, Bodapati was listening to something—an inner voice describing not only the future of her company, but possibilities for the good she could do, the change she could drive in the healthcare industry more broadly. “Imagine if you could do that all the time with really cheap tools?” Bodapati asks. “You go in, you sign your name, you prick your finger. You get told right there. You don’t have to go to your appointment, then go to a different place and get your lab drawn.” It took another three weeks for the hospital to confirm the patient’s leukemia diagnosis that Bodapati and Tandon saw in minutes. Tandon was haunted by the fact that the patient had come in for a regular doctor’s appointment, “But because healthcare today is not quantitative, it’s traditional, you come in, you get some symptomatic analysis and they’ll tell you to go home and rest.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That’s when it clicked,” Bodapati recalls, referencing that solemn flight. “It’s this concept of making tools so cheap, so usable, that people can do it all the time. Only then can you actually get preventive care.”</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Alfred Lin, a partner at Sequoia Capital who collaborates closely with Athelas, happened to already be questioning the landscape of available medical testing technology when he met the co-founders while they were participating in the Y Combinator startup accelerator. Lin’s father was undergoing chemotherapy, and Lin was frustrated that the most reliable method of testing whether his father had an infection was to take his temperature. If a chemotherapy patient has a fever that spikes above 101.3, they’re told to go to the emergency room. But to Lin, the thermometer felt like an inadequate diagnostic tool, based on what always happened next. “I just found that so silly. What if it’s 101.2 and it’s not .3?” Lin asks. “The first thing that happened every time I took my father to the emergency room was they take his temperature, his blood pressure and look at his vitals. And then the next immediate thing they did was to take a full blood count.” Lin, like Bodapati and Tandon, felt there had to be a faster, more accurate way of putting the needs of the patient first: “Tanay and Deepika were on a mission to figure out a more comprehensive test than a thermometer,” Lin says</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Sometimes the signals Bodapati is listening for come from places like support tickets; other times they’re literally knocking on the door. The company wouldn’t be where it is today had Bodapati and Tandon not been pursued by their first test user, a Stanford University student and basketball player named Michael Morris. “Michael was an inventor at heart,” Tandon tells me, “A lot of the ideas around how we could make the device user-friendly came from him.” Morris was also a cancer patient who needed constant monitoring of his white blood cell count. When he heard about how two of his college classmates were experimenting with a machine that might help him, he showed up at their office in Mountain View—a barely refurbished liquor store—ready to be their guinea pig. Tanay and Bodapati had been building since their high school science fair days, and—with Tanay’s background in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and Bodapati’s time spent internering at her uncle Dr. Sanjiv Gambhir’s molecular imaging research lab at Stanford—the two friends were able to make a prototype for an in-home blood testing kit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“[Morris] brought this energy with him that would just take over the office,” Tandon says. “And it was so helpful for the early team of 4 or 5 people to see an actual patient talk about how important this was, and how much you wanted to track these critical metrics.” Using Athelas One consistently over the next couple of months, Morris noticed a disturbing trend in his cell count. His cancer therapy wasn’t working anymore. “He asked us to go to a doctor’s appointment with him,” Bodapati reveals. “It felt so personal because he was showing the doctor his results, and telling him that the cancer was back.” In that office, supporting her friend—a sick man holding tightly to his wife’s hand—Bodapati saw again how valuable Athelas could be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Soon after this moment, the FDA sent Bodapati and Tandon an additional information request for Athelas One, a kind of auditing the agency does to further analyze efficacy. The Jaurez trial proved to Bodapati and Tandon that Athelas One worked, and that they were right to believe in their new business. But the FDA wanted more, including other trials. Though it’s fairly standard to receive such a request, the 40-plus line questionnaire was daunting, demanding another 8 months of data collection and an additional trial, which still wouldn’t guarantee FDA approval. Yet Bodapati says Morris’ belief in the device kept them going, with the paperwork and the eventual second trial that led to their FDA approval. His constant presence energized the staff, and his input on how to better Athelas One for its users was crucial, she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2017, Michael Morris passed away. “Michael really believed in it,” Bodapati says, naming him as one of their first true advocates; a guiding light urging them forward. “He told us, ‘It’s too late for me, but make sure you bring it to other people.’”</p>



<p>Bodapati has been hearing those words ever since.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Flights have been their own recurring theme during Bodapati and Tandon’s long friendship. They first bonded on a flight as teenagers when competing on the elite science fair circuit, an extracurricular they participated in with such intensity that they joke about it being a competitive sport. (As a preteen Bodapati even invented a test strip that could detect whether vegetables were contaminated with salmonella and E. coli. It was her first foray into microfluidics, working with and studying how fluids move in miniature devices and the spaces within them, which later came to play a large part in the development of Athelas One.) The experience of going from competitors to friends and collaborators eventually brought Bodapati and Tandon together as co-founders. “I know his strengths. He knows my strengths. We knew one another when we were competing, so it was the rawest form of each other,” Bodapati says. Lin even recalls the two of them finishing each other’s sentences, describing Tandon as verbose while Bodapati is a grounding presence. If Bodapati is the listener, then Tandon is the talker.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bodapati has been honing her listening skills since childhood—both in her family home and in her uncle’s Stanford research lab. Her parents were small tech business owners with companies in the United States and India, and because of the time difference, they were often on the phone with their teams abroad while dropping Bodapati off at school. Sitting in the backseat, Bodapati could hear the chatter of business deals considered, strategies debated, negotiations made. Bodapati’s brother, Sunil, also remembers, “After dinner, we would hear them get on the phone to kick off early meetings with the India team, and we were able to listen to how they approached deals, how they structured them. We were there when deals went through, there when deals fell through, there when employees quit. So we got to see what it was like to go through the highs of the lows [of running a business] in a very visceral way.”</p>



<p>Bodapati tells me that sometimes the training was more explicit, though; her father would encourage the family to have what he called “pitch night,” teaching the kids how to really sell their latest science experiment. “My dad would always tell us, ‘You can’t just explain the science; convey it in a way that is compelling—what’s the practical implication of the project?’” Sunil, who is the CEO of his own healthcare startup, Enable Medicine, says that while he and his sister learned business from their parents, it was their beloved uncle, Dr. Gambhir, who instilled in them a love of science.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Gambhir, chair of radiology at Stanford and a pioneer in advancing techniques for molecular imaging and early detection of cancer, died of cancer in 2020 at 57. Bodapati tells me that she believes if her uncle were still alive he would be awarded for his work with a Nobel Prize. He wanted not just to innovate, she says, but also to truly improve the lives of those affected by cancer. Bodapati’s years spent working in her uncle’s lab and listening to his stories and advice, led her to want to revolutionize preventive care, to improve people’s lives holistically.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2013, Dr. Gambhir’s work and research became deeply personal: his teenage son, Milan, was diagnosed with the aggressive brain cancer glioblastoma multiforme—the exact tumor type Dr. Gambhir had been studying. Tragically, Milan died two years later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bodapati shares the story his uncle told the lab the first time he returned after Milan’s death and how she internalized it, becoming ever more motivated to create positive change, even from terrible loss. Dr. Gambhir gathered his staff at the office and told them a fable credited to several Native American tribes: a grandfather is teaching his grandson about life and reveals that every person has two warring wolves within them. One wolf represents resentment, petty jealousy and sorrow, while the other is hope, compassion and faith. The grandson asks his grandfather which wolf wins in the end; the grandfather responds, “Whichever one we feed.” With that, Dr. Gambhir turned to his colleagues, bowed his head and said, “Let’s remember that’s what we’re doing here.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Dr. Gambhir continued to research early cancer detection, he became a leader in developing tools that could passively monitor patient health by collecting data in minimally intrusive ways, like a smart toilet that tests stool and urine for early signs of disease. Gambhir dreamed of a proactive healthcare system, one preventive and holistic, rather than focused on fixing problems individually as they arise. Today, Bodapati is working to make this a reality. “Part of who I am now is because of the work that I did with him and his lab,” Bodapati says. Sunil underscores his sister’s feelings: “You know that if you can move the needle in a significant way for human progress, then you kind of have an obligation to do that.”</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>On the opposite side of the country, in the suburbs of Baltimore, Dr. Deanna Kelly, Director and Chief of the Treatment Research Program at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center, was trying to develop or find a point-of-care device that would help her treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients gain access to the antipsychotic drug clozapine. One of clozapine’s side effects is neutropenia—too few white blood cells to fight off infection—and tracking a patient’s white blood cell count requires regular testing. When the FDA cleared clozapine for use, it did so with the mandate that patients get labs drawn every week for the first 6 months, then every two weeks for the next 6 months, then once a month for their course of treatment, which, for most patients, is a lifetime. This would be a difficult task for anyone, let alone someone suffering from paranoia and delusion.</p>



<p>For the last 20 years Dr. Kelly had been working with clozapine, and believed it would be life-changing for many people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. She believed that the drug could be the difference between a patient living in a closed facility or leading an independent life with a steady job and stable relationships. “Often doctors believe that though this drug would be life changing for their patient, it’s just too much of a liability to have them on it’” Bodapati says. “Or patients feel that even though they know the drug is good for them, they simply can’t manage all these steps.’”</p>



<p>Dr. Kelly says up to 30 percent, or more, of people diagnosed with schizophrenia are labeled “treatment resistant,” and it doesn’t take much for a patient to receive such a designation. “The guidelines tell us that [after] two failed trials of antipsychotics, someone should be considered treatment resistant,” Dr. Kelly says.</p>



<p>Dr. Kelly and her colleagues at University of Maryland College Park were experimenting with electrochemical detection for monitoring blood levels and neutrophil counts, but they weren’t getting far. “Once I heard about Athelas, I was like, I don’t know if this is too good to be true,” Dr. Kelly recalls. “Then I kept reaching out and kept thinking this is going to be a major advantage and a major breakthrough to revolutionize our care.” Fortunately for her, Bodapati listened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Kelly was thrilled when Athelas One received its second FDA clearance for at-home use. This allows the results to be instantaneously sent to a doctor and a pharmacist, who then ships the medication directly to the patient—meaning the patient has to do little more than prick their finger in the privacy of their own bedroom. Dr. Kelly says some of her patients are poor, lack transportation, or have cognitive impairments, things that make participating in a traditional healthcare system nearly impossible. “The way Athelas did it was clever: merging these results that you get back to the [risk evaluation management] system, coupled with the ability to order in a pharmacy. That’s a game changer.”</p>



<p>Bodapati and her team worked to get Athelas One in California state hospitals, specifically in forensic facilities and county medical facilities that treat a significant number of homeless patients with drug-resistant schizophrenia. By this time, HLS Therapeutics, one of the makers of clozapine, heard about Bodapati and Tandon’s work and offered the duo a rare opportunity to partner, broadening their reach into mental healthcare and beyond oncology in ways they never expected.</p>



<p>Cliff Weitzman is CEO of the text-to-speech audio reader Speechify, and has been part of a support network for a friend who hasn’t responded to most antipsychotics. Weitzman describes this experience as hopeless. “What Athelas gave us was hope. When this happens, you lose control. When someone breaks their arm you can see it, but when it’s mental it’s scary” he says. “They might stop eating, stop drinking, stop being able to function. You lose all control, and that’s very scary. And there’s nothing you can do. And then you go to doctors, and there’s nothing that doctors can do either. “&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wietzman took time off work and flew all over America to speak with top psychiatrists. After that year, he discovered the potential of clozapine in a Facebook group. “The first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth doctor you talked to does not bring up clozapine,” Weitzman says. “We went on Facebook groups of patients who have similar problems, and the only success stories we heard often were from patients who use clozapine. And we’re like, well, what is clozapine?” Weitzman believes that clozapine wasn’t even considered by the patient’s medical team because it’s not only difficult for the user, but it’s also a burden for the doctor prescribing it. “It’s a lot of work because the doctor every week has to go to the portal, click the button, make sure that the regulation is there. Doctors don’t want to do that. That’s not why they went to medical school.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Athelas One had broken down the primary barrier to doctors prescribing clozapine. “Now it’s a realistic thing that we can use,” says Weitzman. He believes the company has the ability not only to help millions of people with previously untreatable diagnoses, but also to offer relief to their support networks, helping them to reconnect with their loved ones. “You’ve gone from a state of scary, helpless, hopeless, to empowered, assisted, supported, hopeful. So it gives hope. That’s a very special thing that very few companies can say they succeed in doing.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>When the pandemic hit, Bodapati found herself listening again, this time for insight on how Athelas could transition from diagnostic to preventive care. “We realized we had an opportunity where the world is on pause, and we’ve collected all of these interesting lessons from getting this FDA clearance and then launching in some of these incredible health systems and clinics,” says Tandon. “We can continue to operate as a traditional biotech or we can synthesize this knowledge and turn it into something a lot bigger that can really serve the population that we touch and help them work through COVID, but also create this transition to preventive health.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bodapati spotted an opportunity when she was on a sales call with a psychiatrist named Dr. Gustavo Alva from southern California. Bodapati asked him to tell her about his other patients, those who weren’t on clozapine—what were their needs? Dr. Alva said he had thousands of patients, a large percentage of whom were on medications with side effects like weight gain, hypertension and Type 2 diabetes. When Bodapati asked how he was monitoring his patients’ long-term health, he replied that it was often left up to the primary care doctor. Bodapati didn’t hesitate. She asked Dr. Alva to connect her to some of his patients who would be open to chatting so she could discern if Athelas could help. On the calls, she heard that they often didn’t see a GP, just their specialist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on these calls, Bodapati and Tandon started building a suite of predictive, internet-connected tools that worked together to monitor a patient’s health. Shortly, she went back to Dr. Alva and asked him how valuable it would be if she could give specific patients glucometers, weight scales and blood pressure cuffs that all recorded the patient’s results at home and sent the results to a healthcare team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before the call ended, the two had roughed out a path toward a collaboration that led to an order for more than 800 patients. The Athelas team got to work, reaching out to potential patients, getting them the devices and onboarding them. Then the Athelas team set the patients up with a nursing team. “Once we got them on the program and they were continuously testing, [Dr. Alva]&nbsp; told us how powerful it was to engage these chronically ill patients from their homes. It was something he had been attempting for decades,” Bodapati says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bodapati and Tandon then developed an app that allows the patients to record their information and schedule appointments. “That’s how our product grew,” says Bodapati. “And overnight, our average deal size went from 10 patients to 600.” The co-founders have also created a pill tracker that works in tandem with the Athelas One for any patient for whom tracking their medication is a burden—a device that can help the provider as well as the patient to determine whether the medication is working or if it’s not being taken correctly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As soon as Bodapati attempted to bill for the remote patient monitoring Athelas was now offering, she started to wade through the insurance coding maze and realized how opaque the current medical billing system really is: “As a business, you need to know how much money you’re making, and as the CEO of the business, you need to have that information within 30 seconds. It was very clear that the doctors had no idea,” says Bodapati “You don’t really know where your money is coming from, how it’s segmented. It’s a black box.” Again, Bodapati saw a need and developed a solution; Athelas is now an innovator in remote patient monitoring and in revenue cycle management (RCM), helping private practices and provider groups bill appropriately and consistently. Now Bodapati says that RCM has become a core part of Athelas’ future, joining a $126.1 billion industry.</p>



<p>Lin sees a future of Athelas that goes beyond monitoring the sick to one connecting all people with preventive care. Now Bodapati is scaling up teams and connecting with as many hospital systems and provider groups as she can, having already partnered with Palomar Health System and Horizon Family Medical, which, she says, together represent approximately 100,000 patients. “What’s been most rewarding working with Deepika and Tanay, when they get close to their vision, they’re always very, very good at expanding it,” Lin says.&nbsp;Bodapati believes that improving the healthcare industry and making it more accessible is simply a matter of finding the people who need help and listening to them. What she doesn’t mention is the hard work, the designing, fabricating and testing that the listening leads to. This work has shepherded Athelas to become, in Bodapati’s words, the sensor and software infrastructure for running a modern healthcare business, with a unique value proposition of identifying “hard to discern” commonalities between stakeholders. Her insights are the key to this success. “We found that people are so much more willing to innovate, systems are willing to innovate, insurance companies are willing to innovate. Patients are willing to try new technologies,” Bodapati says. “We would talk to patients, asking them, ‘What can we do to make this the easiest possible experience for you?’ And they’ll tell you exactly what they need and what they want. Once you unlock that, it becomes really powerful. Because then you just keep building and building and building.”</p>

 <a href="https://tokenmint.global">TokenMint</a> is an easy-to-use platform for anyone to launch a token using custom tokenomics without having to know a single line of code. It streamlines and simplifies the tokenization process, making creating a fungible token easy and quick.&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are excited to announce that TokenMint is now live on mainnet!&nbsp; The Alpha version of the TokenMint platform offers the basics for creating a fungible token.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 About the TokenMint Platform 
<p>The TokenMint platform, comprising four key components, is designed to provide a seamless, simple, and intuitive user experience:</p>
 
 TokenMint Chain – a sidechain built on the Horizen network 
 <a href="https://tokenmint.global">Token Generator</a> – a web app that allows a streamlined and easy process for anyone to create and mint a fungible token with custom tokenomics. 
 <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Cobalt Wallet</a> – a web browser extension wallet that stores and manages tokens created on TokenMint 
 <a href="https://explorer.tokenmint.global">TokenMint Block explorer</a> – a block explorer that tracks and displays all transactions on the TokenMint Chain.&nbsp; 
 
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://testnet.tokenmint.global">TokenMint Testnet</a> remains active for anybody that wants to test and try out the platform. Over 550 tokens were created by users on the testnet, and the user feedback we received helped us improve the platform for the mainnet launch. These improvements include UX/UI features, bug fixes, and additional security measures.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Tokenization will serve as one of the main driving forces behind the wave of innovation in blockchain and growth in the adoption of decentralized applications in coming years. A platform like TokenMint can play an important role in making tokenization accessible to mainstream users. </p>
<p>Notably, no programming knowledge is required for creating a token using TokenMint so users can get started right away. Our long-term goal for the platform is to achieve provable tokenomics while enhancing user privacy, a move that will further break down the barriers between tokenization and the masses.”</p>
<p>– Rob Viglione, co-founder of Horizen and Horizen Labs.&nbsp;<br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We leverage agile methodologies to bring immediate value to our community through early and continuous delivery of our software. The TokenMint alpha release is just the beginning, as our product and engineering teams will continue to rapidly iterate on it with shorter delivery cycles that immediately address the evolving needs of Web3 and the crypto movement.&nbsp; We look forward to having TokenMint drive forth additional mainstream adoption.”</p>
<p>– Zain Cheng, VP of Engineering, Horizen Labs.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
 Token Creation Fees 
<p>Currently, it costs 10 ZEN to register a new fungible token on TokenMint and 1 ZEN to mint. We are running <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/HDE-Proposals/issues/67">a limited number of community tasks</a> on HDE that offer reimbursement on the token creation fees along with a small reward.&nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/HDE-Proposals/issues/67">Create a token on TokenMint mainnet for free now.</a></p>
<p>Future versions of TokenMint will integrate a wider range of features like NFT support and marketplace, interoperability with our EVM sidechain, and zk-SNARKs, a privacy technology that will enable provable tokenomics and preserve user privacy.</p>

 Apply for grants to run the first Nym Privacy-Enhanced Apps! <p><a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/">Welcome to Shipyard</a>, the new Beta space for Nym! Shipyard is a place to build and stress-test Privacy Enhanced Applications (PEApps), which are service providers that use the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/a-simple-introduction-to-mixnets-6783a103d20e">Nym mixnet </a>to provide anonymity for their&nbsp;users.</p><p>In order to parameterize the Nym mixnet to offer strong anonymity, we need to get some apps running via the mixnet. Many existing apps like Telegram can be privacy-enhanced, a ‘PEApp’ — but we need to run two components called gateways and network requesters to make your regular apps work with Nym. <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/gateways-to-privacy-51196005bf5">Gateways</a> are the first hop into the mixnet, and <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/tech-deepdive-network-requesters-e5359a6cc31c">Network Requesters</a> are the hop out that takes the user to an app. Scroll down to learn about grants to set these&nbsp;up.</p> Nym Shipyard is&nbsp;for… <p>INFRASTRUCTURE WIZARDS who want to run gateways and network requesters to make the mixnet accessible for a broad set of existing applications and users. These are needed to make the mixnet broadly usable and Shipyard is giving Service Grants to set these up - <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/docs/service-grants">Apply&nbsp;Now!</a></p><p>DEVELOPERS who want to build new PEApps in the Nym privacy stack and contribute to building out a vast ecosystem of usable tools where privacy is the default. Hear about the upcoming major grants program or chat directly with Nym Developer Relations: <a href="http://eepurl.com/h6uPSD">Sign up</a> or <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Join Discord</a> #peapps&nbsp;dev</p><p>EARLY ADOPTERS who are eager to take advantage of the privacy offered by Nym and are willing to try out experimental beta software (that cannot be fully relied on for strong anonymity…yet!) To learn about and try new releases <a href="http://eepurl.com/h6uPSD">Sign up</a> or <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Join Discord</a> #product-and-peapps</p> Grants for running the first gateways to&nbsp;privacy… <p>The first tranche of Shipyard grants is for gateways and network requesters — which combined allow wallets, apps and chats like Telegram to run on the&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Together, gateways and network requesters provide the bridge into the mixnet and enable ordinary users to begin using the Nym mixnet. In order to slowly onboard users, Shipyard will be granting people running gateways and network requesters for apps and wallets that already work with Nym, like the <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/">Nym wallet</a>, <a href="https://electrum.org/">Electrum wallet</a>, <a href="https://keybase.io/download">Keybase</a> and <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a>.</p><p>To qualify for a grant you must commit to setting up a gateway and a network requester that whitelists these initial applications, configure your gateway to gather minimum stats and maintain it for a minimum of 6 months. Instructions will be provided of course! (<a href="http://eepurl.com/h6uPSD">Sign up here</a>). In the meantime, get familiar with <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/overview/">Nym docs</a>, <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/gateways/">gateways</a> and <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/requester/">network requesters</a>.</p><p>The use of these applications via the Nym mixnet will be experimental at first and will gather stats on usage and traffic patterns directed towards a particular application so we can parametrize the mixnet to provide strong anonymity. (There is no other data gathered — this is a privacy system so we simply don’t have&nbsp;it!)</p>*Note: the deadline to set up and first payment date has been pushed back by a week to give sufficient time for operators to download new binaries and get set up. The table above was updated accordingly.<p>These first grants are essential for Nym to start being usable to a broader set of people, and for the Nym core team to stress test and optimise the&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>NOTE in order to get payment you need to get the code up and running for your app of choice by the 15th of August payment deadline! To get full monthly payment per month you need to have 100% uptime and decent performance.</p><p>The Nym network has reserved a limited budget for apps, so funding will come to whoever sets up apps first if there is an overload of applications — so apply early and get that code&nbsp;running!</p>  Apply now*!  <p>…and be among the first to provide mass access to network level&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>*edit: application is now&nbsp;closed.</p> For Developers — Upcoming Build&nbsp;Grants <p>Shipyard also invites more ambitious service provider grant applications for integrations with a broader set of wallets and applications. These could just be apps that already have SOCKS5 support. Apps that require re-compiling and coding can of course apply for more! For the highly skilled and ambitious among you, a fork of a popular app like Signal that runs on Nym could go way above&nbsp;$3000.</p><p>Service grants are just the beginning and part of a much larger grants program that will roll out over the next quarter. Stay tuned for announcements, including large grants aimed at research and larger projects that are looking for funding on top of Nym from the Nym Innovation Fund.</p> Relevant links:   <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net">Shipyard</a>  <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/docs/service-grants">Service grants</a>  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/gateways-to-privacy-51196005bf5">What is a gateway?</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/gateways">Docs</a>  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/tech-deepdive-network-requesters-e5359a6cc31c">What is a network requester?</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/requester">Docs</a>  <a href="http://eepurl.com/h6uPSD">Sign up</a> to the Shipyard grants email&nbsp;list  <a href="https://nymtech.net/nym-whitepaper.pdf">Nym Whitepaper</a>   Socials:   <a href="http://@nymproject">Twitter</a>  <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a>  <a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a>   <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/announcing-nym-shipyard-136fcb93fcb5">Announcing Nym Shipyard</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p><p>WabiSabi is a novel communication protocol for creating bitcoin coinjoin transactions with arbitrary amounts. It is a concept with roots going back to the early days of bitcoin, even the earliest beginnings of digital payments. Over the last two years, we have researched, designed and implemented this protocol. Now that we have finally released Wasabi Wallet 2.0, here is the history of this monumental advancement in bitcoin privacy.</p><p>Wasabi Wallet 1.0 solved a lot of difficult problems out of the box. Tor was natively integrated, protecting user IP addresses. Block filters were used to synchronize wallets without anyone else learning about the transaction history. The best available zerolink coinjoin protocol with Chaumian blind signatures provided privacy on the blockchain.</p><p>However, the Chaumian blind signature protocol had limitations that lead to a bad user experience and excessive blockspace usage. The minimum denomination was too large for many users, denying them access to the service. But for others it was too small, resulting in many coins in the wallet, which is expensive. If a user wanted to consolidate many inputs in the same coinjoin transaction, he had to tell the coordinator which belonged together. Even though the coordinator could not link the inputs of one user to the equal amount output he received, it was public knowledge which non-equal change output the user received.</p><p>Some of these concerns were improved with marginal upgrades to the protocol during the Wasabi 1.0 life cycle. However, in order to truly solve these issues, a fundamental solution was required. But at this point, we did not know what technology existed that could be applied at scale.</p><p>A group of developers, cryptographers and enthusiasts got together in the Wasabi Research Club, a weekly meeting to define, discuss and solve this complex problem. Initially, a different academic paper was chosen as the topic for each week. We invited the authors of each paper to join us, and many did, giving ample opportunity to ask questions. One of the researchers, usually Aviv Milner, started the call with a short presentation to introduce and summarize the paper. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPwc75tPMdsgTYlu9dJZlosCm0s7WmIpF">recordings</a> of these calls are available on the Wasabi Wallet YouTube channel.</p><p>A breakthrough moment was when Jonas Nick suggested that keyed verified anonymous credentials might be a great fit for our specific use case. There are numerous different cryptographic schemes in this category, like Brands’ credentials, Mercurial signatures, anonymous credentials light and keyed verified anonymous credentials. The specific paper Jonas brought to our attention was <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1416">The Signal Private Group System and Anonymous Credentials Supporting Efficient Verifiable Encryption, written by Melissa Chase, Trevor Perrin and Greg Zaverucha</a>.</p><p>This cryptography allows a central server to issue tokens which can have many attributes. Each of these attributes can be blindly committed to, then selectively revealed at a later point. These tokens can be transferred anonymously. The trick we use in WabiSabi specifically, is that one attribute of these credentials is a blinded value of sats. Pedersen commitments are used so that the coordinator never learns how many sats one token has attributed, but he can still ensure that nobody is creating more money than he spent.</p><p>These anonymous digital bearer certificates are the access rights to the new bitcoin transaction that is being built. The coordinator issues tokens and gives it to anyone who provides an input. And later, any anonymous user who provides such a token, can write an output address and amount to the transaction. These tokens ensure nobody is writing more outputs than inputs, without the users having to sacrifice their privacy to the central server.</p><p>At this point, we had a pretty solid idea of the problem and how flexible anonymous eCash tokens can be used to solve it. This was a sufficient advancement to document in a new paper, <a href="https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WabiSabi/releases/latest/download/WabiSabi.pdf">WabiSabi: Centrally Coordinated CoinJoins with Variable Amounts</a>, which was peer reviewed and published. This paper was finalized mainly by Adam Ficsor, Yuval Kogman, Lucas Ontivero and István András Seres.</p><p>A crucial next step was to implement the cryptography that makes the system possible. Lucas Ontivero, Yuval Kogman and David Molnar dedicated months to building, testing and reviewing this critical part of the codebase. An independent security firm was hired to audit the code base and several outside contributors have reviewed it as well. In the following months, Wasabi’s client and server code were upgraded and sometimes entirely rewritten to support this new protocol.</p><p>With the protocol designed, the cryptography implemented and the client and server code well on its way, we realized that some of the most difficult questions are still unanswered. Now that the coordinator no longer dictates the minimum value of inputs and what output values to register, what exactly should the client do now? With great power, comes great responsibility. For the first time in the history of bitcoin coinjoin, the client can basically do whatever it wants. This turned out to be rather uncharted territory, with conflicting ideas of how to approach the subject.</p><p>Anonymity likes company meaning that it’s a good idea to hide in a crowd. So a coinjoin transaction should have many coins with the exact same amount of sats. However, every transaction should have many different equal amounts. One of Yuval’s many insights was to use low Hamming weight standard denominations. Only a few of these amounts are required to sum up to any arbitrary value. Specifically, these standard denominations are powers of two, powers of three, and 1, 2, and 5 times the powers of ten. Between 5000 sats and 1 bitcoin, there are 41 of these standard denominations. If all clients prefer to create outputs in only those standard denominations, then there are going to be a higher number of equal amount inputs and outputs.</p><p>These developments are why Wabisabi has improved upon the original Zerolink protocol of Wasabi 1.0 and how Wasabi 2.0, powered by Wabisabi are breaking records everyday for facilitating some of the largest coinjoins ever while provided even the newest Bitcoin user access to the highest level of privacy.</p>

<p>Given the information that follows, I think it’s worth considering architecture as a form of social technology. This villa exhibits a complex interplay of encoded mythological and religious themes that revolve around truth, knowledge, and memory. People with a deeper understanding of esoterica may be able to draw out additional meaning as to why this location was selected as a gathering place thirty years ago. The detailed descriptions authorized by the church are available <a href="http://www.pass.va/content/scienzesociali/en/about/casina.html">here</a> and <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Casina-Pio-IV-Historical-and-Iconographic-Guide.pdf">here</a>. Its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casina_Pio_IV">Wikipedia entry notes</a>&nbsp;of the design: “the Casina’s rich and at times obscure iconographic programme, features the efficacy of baptism, the primacy of the papacy and the welcomed punitive powers of the Church.”</p>

<p>Stigliz’s project for Sarkozy asserted that social well-being be prioritized. The era of bio-capitalism and investments in prescribed social behaviors was getting off the ground. Assisting Stiglitz in this effort was the Bengali economic theorist and Harvard professor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amartya_Sen">Amartya Sen</a> whose career centered: development finance; social choice, whereby individual preferences were guided to generate collective decisions; and capabilities, taking into consideration people’s abilities to pursue their choices. Sen has served on Berggruen’s philosophy prize selection <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/martha-nussbaum-awarded-1-million-berggruen-prize-philosophy-culture">panel</a>.</p>
<p>Read this selection from their report keeping the following factors in mind. Well-being metrics will quantify ALL our relationships, social and environmental. By assigning everything a numerical value our lives are made visible to the machine. This information will be used to inform the actions of autonomous intelligent systems in mixed reality. Everything will be compelled to interact with these systems on the basis of the data that comprises unique digital identities, digital twins. Blockchain transactions connected to cyber-physical systems will enclose our lives in mechanical energies. This is the new rule of law – smart contract law. Global financial interests, guided by artificial intelligence prediction markets, will place bets on our ability to attain indicators of “success” specified. Submission to the machine is being framed as good for society and the planet, appealing to progressives, and economically efficient, appealing to free-market libertarians. This is how the Earth may be remade as a planetary computer. This is the “wellness” economy.</p>
<p>“Another key message, and unifying theme of the report, is that the time is ripe for our measurement system to shift emphasis from measuring economic production to measuring people’s well-being. And measures of well-being should be put in a context of sustainability. Despite deficiencies in our measures of production, we know much more about them than about well-being. Changing emphasis does not mean dismissing GDP and production measures. They emerged from concerns about market production and employment; they continue to provide answers to many important questions such as monitoring economic activity. But emphasizing well-being is important because there appears to be an increasing gap between the information contained in aggregate GDP data and what counts for common people’s well-being. This means working towards the development of a statistical system that complements measures of market activity by measures centered on people’s well-being and by measures that capture sustainability. Such a system must, of necessity, be plural – because no single measure can summarize something as complex as the well-being of the members of society, our system of measurement must encompass a range of different measures. The issue of aggregation across dimensions (that is to say, how we add up, for example, a measure of health with a measure of consumption of conventional goods), while important, is subordinate to the establishment of a broad statistical system that captures as many of the relevant dimensions as possible. Such a system should not just measure average levels of well-being within a given community, and how they change over time, but also document the diversity of peoples’ experiences and the linkages across various dimensions of people’s life. There are several dimensions to well-being but a good place to start is the measurement of material well-being or living standards.” <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Report-by-the-Stiglitz-Commission-on-the-Measurement-of-Economic-Performance-and-Social-Progress-2009.pdf">Page 6</a></p>
<p>The language around establishing consistent standards of data to capture the diversity of experiences across dimensions of people’s lives is very much in keeping with the premise of developing social simulations that can be used for systems engineering of large populations. The dimensions Stigliz’s commission recommends tracking include: 1) material living standards (income, consumption and wealth); 2) health; 3) education; 4) personal activities including work; 5) political voice and governance; 6) social connections and relationships; 7) environment (present and future conditions); 8) insecurity of an economic as well as a physical nature. These are all metrics that will be used to assign and manage improvement pathways towards “equity.” Remember that the next time you are nudged to complete an online survey.</p>

<p>Source: Berggruen and Sarkozy (Who Is Half <a href="https://hungarytoday.hu/hungarian-roots-nicolas-sarkozy-france-23rd-president-2007-2012/">Hungarian</a>) in 2013 at the 21st Century Council Gathering in Zurich</p>
<p><a href="https://cep.lse.ac.uk/_new/people/person.asp?id=970">Richard Layard</a> of the London School of Economics Centre for Economic Performance first developed metrics around the “<a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/Research/research-impact-case-studies/2021/understanding-and-improving-subjective-wellbeing">science of happiness</a>” that were used to finance mental health services in the UK. By establishing that economic losses due to “mental health” amount to <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/spotlight/healthcare/2022/05/how-poor-mental-health-costs-the-economy-billions">billions of dollars</a>, the social impact sector has created an enormous cost-offset for pay-for-success social prescribing. The following excerpt is from a 2006 Guardian article, “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/jun/21/mentalhealth.socialcare">Spread A Little Happiness</a>,” about Layard’s pilot “happiness centres.”</p>
<p>“Imagine the situation. You have had a relationship breakdown. It has left you depressed, alone and turning to alcohol. Work is impossible. But, thankfully, your local NHS “happiness centre” is just around the corner. Part sanctuary, part psychology laboratory, happiness centres are a sort of Ikea for the mind, where the feelgood factor is flat-packed for you to take home. A branded chain of open-access outposts offering the latest talking therapies for some of the most common and distressing mental illnesses. No long waits. No need for a referral – simply turn up and get help.”</p>
<p>This is what ongoing mental health screenings are about; what ACEs scoring is about; what emotion-sensing digital surveillance is about; what social-emotional training in schools is about. The power structure is gathering baselines and sucking up data for prediction markets in future behavior management. That quote is sixteen years old. Today, your “Ikea of the Mind” drop-in center could easily be a tele-therapy chatbot or a cognitive behavioral therapy game in a VR headset.</p>
<p>Please understand, I am in no way dismissing or trying to minimize the reality of mental stress in society today. It is a serious concern. What I am trying to say is that these programs are dual use, and we’re moving into the phase where artificial intelligence really wants to learn what makes us tick as complex, emotional beings. There is a fiscal and pragmatic logic behind this pivot to tele-“wellness” management.” The plan is to use us to explain to AI how to be more like us. That’s human-centered design – that and cognitive warfare, the Sixth Domain.

<p>In 2019, the Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems of the Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers">IEEE</a>), a professional association with over 400,000 members in 160 countries headquartered in New York City and Piscataway, NJ, prepared “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ethically-Aligned-Design-IEEE-Human-Well-Being-Autonomous-and-Intelligent-Systems.pdf">Ethically Aligned Design: A Vision for Prioritizing Human Well-being with Autonomous and Intelligent Systems</a>.” Their intent was to outline social policy imperatives in the face of pervasive computing with the goal of supporting human well-being. The effort was chaired by <a href="https://homepages.laas.fr/raja/">Raja Chatila</a>, a professor of robotics and ethics at <a href="https://www.isir.upmc.fr/">Pierre and Marie Curie University</a> in Paris.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, our goal should be eudaimonia, a practice elucidated by Aristotle that defines human well-being, both at the individual and collective level, as the highest virtue for a society. Translated roughly as “flourishing”, the benefits of eudaimonia begin with conscious contemplation, where ethical considerations help us define how we wish to live. Whether our ethical practices are Western (e.g., Aristotelian, Kantian), Eastern (e.g., Shinto, 墨家/School of Mo, Confucian), African (e.g., Ubuntu), or from another tradition, honoring holistic definitions of societal prosperity is essential versus pursuing one-dimensional goals of increased productivity or gross domestic product (GDP). Autonomous and intelligent systems should prioritize and have as their goal the explicit honoring of our inalienable fundamental rights and dignity as well as the increase of human flourishing and environmental sustainability.” <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ethically-Aligned-Design-IEEE-Human-Well-Being-Autonomous-and-Intelligent-Systems.pdf">Page 4</a></p>
<p>Looks like the eudaimonia protocol may involve scary ghostlike presences pulling the strings of your smart appliances to gaslight you into accepting the programmed new normal. I often link to this piece by Van Diamondfinger, “<a href="https://main.oxfordamerican.org/magazine/item/1243-domestic-front">The Domestic Front</a>.” The guy must know what’s coming; it dates to 2017. Still, it’s worth fifteen minutes of your time. Keep the image below in mind as you read it.</p>

<p>Page six of the document indicates that metrics assessing “flourishing” will be aligned to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and will require universal access to communication networks. Otherwise how can the autonomous intelligent systems aid us on our self-improvement pathways? Then on page eight the document discusses the importance of well-being metrics, the very same ones laid out by Stiglitz’s commission. The authors go on to say that social norms of different communities need to be documented and made computable, otherwise the intelligent agents won’t be able to serve their intended purpose.</p>
<p>“At the present time, the conceptual complexities surrounding what “values” are make it difficult to envision A/IS that have computational structures directly corresponding to social or cultural values such as “security,” “autonomy,” or “fairness”. It may be a more realistic goal to embed explicit norms into such systems. Since norms are observable in human behavior, they can therefore be represented as instructions to act in defined ways in defined contexts, for a specific community—from family to town to country and beyond. A community’s network of social and moral norms is likely to reflect the community’s values, and A/IS equipped with such a network would, therefore, also reflect the community’s values.” <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ethically-Aligned-Design-IEEE-Human-Well-Being-Autonomous-and-Intelligent-Systems.pdf">Page 171</a></p>
<p>In charter cities, the idea is that communities will be created from scratch under the presumption, likely inaccurate, that all residents have opted-in and personally endorse the structured social norms coded into the infrastructure at the time of incorporation. I’m picturing a cross between a busy-body homeowners association, intentional community, monastery, or college dorm. Ok, really I’m thinking about B.F. Skinner’s Walden Two and its real life counterpart, <a href="https://www.twinoaks.org/">Twin Oaks</a> in Louisa, VA. In the clip below former Twin Oaks community member turned Smith College behavioral psychologist <a href="https://www.abainternational.org/constituents/bios/davidpalmer.aspx">David Palmer</a> makes a case for cooperative living where the use of shared resources creates economic efficiencies that might even “save the world.”</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ98MoUyjnM">Source</a>: Reflecting on Walden Two With Dave Palmer</p>
<p>The one not so insignificant issue, however, is human behavior management. The ideal of the charter city would be to develop a machine for “sustainable” living, even “flourishing.” This would be accomplished through sophisticated development of behavioral economics to guide society towards optimization metrics with such subtlety that even residents might forget that the choices being made were not entirely their own.</p>
<p>I haven’t had a chance to read Alexandra Ruthorford’s 2009 book, “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Beyond-the-Box-Skinner-Technology-of-Life.pdf">Beyond the Box: B.F. Skinner’s Technology of Behavior From Laboratory to Life, 1950s to 1970s</a>,” but I ordered a copy and added it to my summer reading list. Linked is a PDF if you’re partial to a free, digital format. It would seem that Skinner’s legacy, expanded upon by the many social science researchers affiliated with <a href="https://www.ideas42.org/about-us/">Ideas42</a>, is being manifested in the linkage of DeFi (decentralized finance) to Internet of Things connected living situations for which displaced people receiving “aid” are on the front lines as Leo Saraceno has laid out in great detail through his work at <a href="https://siliconicarus.org/author/leo-saraceno/">Silicon Icarus</a>.</p>
<p>This is another excerpt from the OECD social impact measurement policy paper that discusses the need for system change / social change:</p>
<p>“Further, social entrepreneurs are under growing pressure not just to deliver on their mission, but also to create system change. For example, one of the pioneering and most eminent incubators of social entrepreneurs, Ashoka, views its purpose as transforming inequality by changing mind-sets globally. This implies heightened information needs in order to understand complex social problems and evidence social change. Undeniably, such large scale and ground-breaking aspirations require the ability to learn and build from failures. However, instances where charities or social enterprises are lauded for being transparent and open about failure remain seldom. The discomfort and stigma around failure need to be addressed if social impact measurement is to help uncover and address the drivers and impediments to social change.” <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Social-Impact-measurement-for-the-Social-and-Solidarity-Economy.pdf">Page 56</a></p>
<p>I propose that the framing used here is operating on two levels. The first is the one most readers would see, and that is about assessing effective strategies for mass social control and steering – systems change. The second, which I doubt would register for most readers is the use of so-called evidence generated through trial and error, and made legitimate through pay-for-success finance structures, to LEARN human social systems and transmit that learning into the hivemind as impact data. The images below show how ordinary people are tasked with collecting impact data in and around the homes of their peers and how Ocean Protocol then uses that data to advance the development of artificial intelligence. Aggregation of information about group dynamics and the use of it for social physics and prediction markets is based on work carried out by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_L._Moreno">Jacob Moreno</a>, father of <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2014/10/j-l-moreno-a-psychologists-30s-experiments-invented-social-networking.html">sociograms</a> and psycho-drama in the 1930s, and Alexander “<a href="https://littlesis.org/person/366499-Alex_Pentland_aka_Sandy_Pentland">Sandy” Pentland</a>, pioneer in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2010/0830/e-gang-mit-sandy-pentland-darpa-sociometers-mining-reality.html?sh=545b5e9b7c7f">interactive media</a> at MIT in the 1990s.</p>

<p>The evolution of artificial agents requires ongoing data transfer from our human experience into the emerging <a href="https://www.proquest.com/openview/2094cd55db808e343750e6eda4b3851d/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=1818062">World Sensorium</a> (Global Brain). The desire is that this data be structured to maximize utility and potential for pattern recognition. That means humans, in addition to other beings and objects, need to be assigned unique identifiers, which is why there are so many options bubbling up: ID2020, health passports, digital driver’s licenses, blockchain education transcripts and medical records, crypto play to earn games, and programmable money for refugees. Eventually all those side chains will interlock into comprehensible digitally-twinned individuals and societies.</p>
<p>According to the IEEE authors, their intent is for affective computing to be deployed in such a way as to neither amplify or dampen human emotional experience. It’s strange to contemplate that these engineers really want us to accept and internalize interacting with machines as if they were peers is a sane way to live. Though, if the goal is to nudge us towards a post-human existence, digital mediation of all social and environmental transactions towards some optimization scheme would be in keeping with the de Chardin / Huxley / Vernadsky / Reiser imagined World Brain evolutionary imperative.</p>
<p>Among the many concerns raised in the <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ethically-Aligned-Design-IEEE-Human-Well-Being-Autonomous-and-Intelligent-Systems.pdf">report</a> are: the potential for psychological manipulation of humans by intelligent systems (page 85); artificial intelligence impersonating humans (page 86); interference by non-human agents in human interpersonal relationships (page 96); the threat posed by coercive nudging (page 97); loss of individual autonomy (page 103); the use of intelligent toys for surveillance and profiling of children (page 120); weaponization of smart home technologies (page 145); labor displacement due to automation (page 152); the inability of intelligent systems to adapt to dynamic social norms (page 173);&nbsp; and how lack of understanding by the masses regarding how the technologies actually work will lead to poor implementation and bad outcomes (page 213).</p>

<p>IEEE has taken on the role of looking out for our interests by promoting digital identity as the key driver in the attainment of human rights, good governance, and self-determination in mixed reality. It is interesting that they keep bringing up democracy and political freedom, even though the authors must know the planned future is that of <a href="https://e-estonia.com/">Estonian e-citizenship</a>, a world where where one’s identity is defined less by the geographic location of your physical body than the accumulated SBTs (Soulbound Tokens) that define your avatar doppelganger.</p>

<p>Centering international human rights is key, because they need for one consistent legal system to extend across their borderless digital empire. The same set of smart contracts must function throughout the Metaverse no matter where you reside. On page 200, IEEE speaks of the Ruggie Principles, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Read the following with the understanding that the goal is for the government to become fully corporatized so as to eventually operate without human management as DAOs, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations.</p>
<p>“The Ruggie principles have been widely referenced and endorsed by corporations and have led to the adoption of several corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies in various companies. With broadened support, the Ruggie principles will strengthen the role of businesses (read DAOs) in protecting and promoting human rights and ensuring that the most crucial human values and legal standards of human rights are respected by A/IS technologists.” <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ethically-Aligned-Design-IEEE-Human-Well-Being-Autonomous-and-Intelligent-Systems.pdf">Page 200</a></p>

Picture citizens of an incorporated charter city that has its own legal standing to manage everything contained within its boundaries – citizens as wards of a machine, or collection of nested “machines.”</p>

In such a culture people are supposed to be highly motivated, because moral incentives are integrated into every aspect of life: work, community, education, consumption, and family. Benello says workers have to be socialized into the culture; growing up Basque isn’t sufficient (<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/From_the_Ground_Up/GiYdUqx1m6wC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=mondragon+mitterand&amp;pg=PA95&amp;printsec=frontcover">Page 96</a>). Yet he praises the systems engineering approach to workplace management, stating that cooperatives reward labor, rather than capital, with profit and control. This, according to <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/author/B/C/au46055523.html">Benello</a>, empowers workers rather than infantilizing them (<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/From_the_Ground_Up/GiYdUqx1m6wC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=mondragon+mitterand&amp;pg=PA95&amp;printsec=frontcover">Page 96)</a>. I have many concerns as to the applicability of such a model in a world of ubiquitous computing, tokenized “participatory democracy,” platform cooperatives, and digital nudges. Rather than uplifting community agency in work, education, and living spaces, it feels far more likely that we’ll end up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi">Tamagotchi</a> pets trapped in cybernetic biospheres.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I can’t do that Dave.”</p>
<p>The well-being framework that the IEEE used was based on the OECD’s Better Life Initiative’s 2013 document, “<a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/9789264191655-en.pdf?expires=1656981699&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=7FED247A8BE1A8F6FB9CE39F8AAF71D4">Guidelines on Measuring Subjective Well-being</a>.” IEEE is developing its own draft standard for well-being metrics for autonomous intelligent systems through its working group <a href="https://sagroups.ieee.org/7010/wp-content/uploads/sites/275/2019/01/IEEE-P7010_WellbeingMetricsforA_IS_ShortPaper_December272018For_Submission_reviewedbyIEEELegal-1.pdf">IEEE P7010</a>. As a person who lives in a poor city with serious problems in the areas of housing and food insecurity, addiction, low-wage employment, mental health issues, and community violence, the idea that these technocrats are going to adopt some survey so that machines will interact with us in ways that actually improve the conditions of people’s lives is quite infuriating. It is hard to know that people are being harmed to lower baseline scores to make the odds better for bets on future improvement, but we cannot look away and pretend that’s not what’s happening. For more on my perspective you can read <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2019/03/03/philadelphias-5th-district-city-council-race-a-call-for-a-town-hall-on-social-impact-investing/">a piece that I wrote</a> about poverty in Philadelphia’s 5th Councilmanic District in 2019.</p>
 California and the Border Crisis 
<p>To bring all this back to the Berggruen Network and California’s Blueprint for “good governance” and close out this exploration, we must understand that displaced people are a central feature of the social impact economy. Much of the infrastructure to support this new economic model was developed in Silicon Valley and funded through tech-related “philanthropy,” of which the <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2019/01/04/silicon-valleys-social-impact-deal-maker/">Silicon Valley Community Foundation</a> is a major player. I find it interesting, given these investigations into Mondragon Corporation and the tradition of Spanish cooperatives, that the father of Laura Arillaga-Andreessen; Marc’s wife,&nbsp; pioneer of west coast impact investing, and <a href="https://www.sv2.org/person/laura-arrillaga-andreessen/">former SVCF truste</a>e, just happened to be the son of Basque immigrants who moved to Inglewood.

<p>An influential presence in the tech-impact space is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/andreessen-horowitz-is-making-the-move-to-san-francisco-at-long-last/">Marc Andreessen</a> and his A16z blockchain portfolio with holdings in <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/04/02/celo/">Celo</a> and <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/07/27/investing-in-valora/">Valora</a> – all based in San Francisco. There’s the research taking place at Singularity University where management of data is inexorably moving us towards a Kurzweil post-human future, and of course Google and Linux Foundation and Unity and Salesforce and countless others. Sufficeth to say, many of the strings being pulled on the global stage around UBI and ubiquitous computing are being pulled from locations in California. Much of the groundwork for Web 3.0 has been laid by Bay Area faux-gressive techno-libertarians. California is a leader in the development of policy infrastructure for blockchain ID, micro-finance, digital payments, and human capital management. It’s in malleable mixed-reality, beyond the relative concreteness of the material world, that neuro-technicians of defense edu-tainment will do their best work concocting devastating cognitive warfare magic.</p>
<p>Seeing rising rates of homelessness in California, it is important to understand that the conditions are being created for social-impact “smart” <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/highland-park-tiny-home-village-homeless/2726687/">towns of tiny homes</a> where everyone can be put on pathways of self-improvement to train autonomous-intelligent systems and build character through remote gig work. It’s like the Jesuit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuit_Missions_of_Chiquitos">reducions</a> in Brazil and the Franciscan missions – captive neophytes converted through wrap around services to a holographic “faith.”</p>
<p>The state’s major health systems like <a href="https://www.csh.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CSH-Health-Center-Role-in-Housing-Innovations-Sept-2021-WEB.pdf">Kaiser Permanente’s “Thriving Communities”</a> are positioning themselves to get into the wellness markets in a big way. Authorized tiny house encampments are increasingly managed by faith-based welfare NGOs, fancied up with a “small-is-beautiful” aesthetic. Paint them with quirky murals and add some picnic tables, maybe a few raised garden beds, and the liberals feel good about it. Even though when you scratch below the surface, it’s obvious such a lifestyle is never going to be satisfying for anyone long term.</p>

<p>I spoke about this outside Project Home, a Catholic charity in Philadelphia that launched the city’s first pay for success finance deal for supportive housing. I was doing some informational picketing with intrepid, now deceased housing rights activist <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-jennifer-bennetchs-family">Jennifer Bennetch</a>. A <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2019/01/04/charter-public-health-and-catholic-charity-interests-help-launch-disruptive-pay-for-success-program/">blog post</a> I wrote on Catholic Charities of Santa Clara County, CA and impact investing provides additional context. It is important to make the connection between digital surveillance of displaced people abroad and internally-displaced residents here in the United States. Social impact finance creates profits from trauma and misery. Therefore the demand is to create as much of both as possible and slowly ameliorate those conditions, all the while collecting “evidence” on data dashboards.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Control of the Mexico-US border has been a polarizing issue for decades, and while less of an issue in California, the state does have&nbsp; the largest immigrant population in the nation. Industries have emerged from this manufactured disaster to process those kept in detainment, extracting practically free labor from captive workers. Some of those operators, like <a href="https://documentedny.com/2021/11/02/geo-group-owes-immigrant-detainees-nearly-17-3-million/">Geo Group</a>, are now moving into social work, since pay for success finance deals are being linked to anti-recidivism stats.</p>
<p>Geo Group’s western regional office is in Los Angeles. The state operates <a href="https://www.geogroup.com/LOCATIONS">a half-dozen facilities</a> in the state. Knowing many conservatives are inclined to free-market investments and have ties to faith-based organizations involved in social service delivery, I see a possible future where refugees from US-enabled drug wars, gang violence, and economic manipulation are brought into charter cities in Opportunity/Promise Zones or remote areas of the US and managed for impact data and sweat-shop cyber labor. Of course it’s not only immigrants who will be subjected to these new purpose-built social-impact “communities.” Soon the fate of many Central Americans will befall working and middle class people in the United States as their economic lifelines are cut, and society becomes increasingly unstable.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://www.geogroup.com/GEO-Care">Source</a>: Geo Care Services – Continuum of Care, Reentry, Electronic Monitoring</p>
<p>Remaking Opportunity Zones and Promise Neighborhoods as mini-charter cities would subsidize profit-taking in less than desirable real estate, “smart” construction developments, and third sector servicing of marginalized workers and children. The education, health, and credit union systems built into the Basque Mondragon model would go hand in hand with “pay for success” finance. Worker “satisfaction” is a metric that is being built into social impact deals, and that has long been a selling point for worker cooperatives.</p>
<p>That would be a possible Third-Way “solution” designed to appease activists across the political divide. The understanding would be that refugees and displaced people would “opt in” to the programs, living under coded laws of what are sure to be austere settlements of pervasive surveillance, perhaps with a cooperative veneer of collective participation through tokenomics. The Charter Cities Institute mentions their hope that Biden’s election would create a more receptive environment for their proposals:</p>
<p>“Despite political challenges, the upheavals of 2020 have presented a unique opportunity to advocate for change. There is a new president in the United States, who has expressed greater willingness to engage with the international community on refugee issues than his predecessor. Policymakers and humanitarians are rethinking their approaches to refugee encampments as a result of the preventable disease outbreaks that continue to result from living conditions in the camps. This is a time for bold thought and action in a world that, if current trends hold, will only see forced displacement increase. There is no replacement for political changes at the global and national levels, but one starting point to make these changes possible is through local initiatives.” <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/How-Charter-Cities-Can-Create-Better-Refugee-Responses.pdf">Page 29</a></p>
<p>Raul Diego’s “<a href="https://siliconicarus.org/2021/04/02/biden-picks-kamala-harris-to-carry-the-carrot-and-stick-in-central-america/">Biden Picks Kamala Harris to Carry the Carrot and Stick in Central America</a>,” offers important insights into Harris’s involvement in the creation of <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-launches-first-its-kind-criminal-justice-open">OpenJustice database</a> in California and what that means for her involvement in the border crisis – namely, more money funneled into the expansion of surveillance technologies like <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6439/text">Biometric Identification Transnational Migration Alert Program</a> (BITMAP), <a href="https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/183768.pdf">Central America Regional Security Initiative</a> (CARSI), and <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhsobimpia-004-homeland-advanced-recognition-technology-system-hart-increment-1">Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology System</a> (HART).</p>
<p>Politically, there is no appetite to slow migration or resolve the physical and economic violence that compels so many to make dangerous journeys north. We have entered the age of the data economy. People on the move, once they’ve been properly tagged, generate a lot of data. The goal is to get as many people as possible into the track-and-track supply chain for future management as human capital assets. I have a suspicion that the trauma generated by separation of immigrant families with children, has a lot to do with plans to ensure everyone’s biometric information is attached to a blockchain identity in the near future. They create the problem to guide you to the “solution” they wanted all along.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris was a junior US Senator during the years that the <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/12/22/silicon-valley-a-laboratory-of-smart-surveillance-and-privatization/comment-page-1/">Santa Clara County pay-for-success pilot programs</a> were put in place. Before that she had served as state District Attorney and District Attorney for San Francisco. During her time as San Francisco DA there was <a href="https://miningawareness.wordpress.com/2020/08/29/kamala-harris-covered-up-75-years-of-sex-abuse-of-little-boys-by-catholic-priests-including-priests-still-working-with-children/">public criticism that she suppressed information</a> held by her office relating to the sexual abuse of children by priests. The implication was that she was politically beholden to the Catholic Church. <a href="https://www.bishop-accountability.org/news2005_01_06/2005_01_19_Russell_SFArchbishop.htm">William Levada,</a> Archbishop of San Francisco at the time, was later appointed Cardinal by Pope Benedict the XVI whom he served as Prefect of the&nbsp;<a title="Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregation_for_the_Doctrine_of_the_Faith">Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith</a> between 2005 and 2012, the highest ranking American in Rome. Prior to coming to the Bay Area Levada had led the Portland, OR Archdiocese where he was also criticized for covering up abuse. Portland was the first Archdiocese to be <a href="https://www.archbalt.org/portland-archdiocese-75-million-settlement/">bankrupted</a> by settlements from abuse-related litigation.</p>
<p></p>

<p>It is all our responsibility as adults to face the real and serious consequences of the technologies that are being brought into the world and reflect on their potential for profound misuse based on historical precedent. We have to be able to comprehend the playbook and cut through their sweet talk of tokenized cooperation and innovative funding programs for the commons.</p>
<p>State-of-exception charter cities could easily become places where abuse and authoritarianism flourish. Consider the profound intergenerational trauma generated by the sexual abuse, forced child labor, and murder of indigenous youth through residential school prison camps modeled on <a href="https://carlisleindianschoolproject.com/">Carlisle</a>. In the twenty-first century we have that same drive towards domination and attempted erasure of social systems that counter the industrialized model, but now that ethos can be combined with powerful tools of prediction, profiling, and cognitive warfare harnessed to automated global finance markets.</p>
<p>It feels to me like what we are experiencing is ongoing AB market research to determine how best to sell “sustainable” confinement in such a way that it can thread the needle – appealing to the Left on the grounds of “green,” progressive care and to the Right’s inclinations towards faith-based crypto sovereignty.</p>
<p>There but for the grace of God go each of us. Who knows how far out on the horizon our date with displacement or a charter city may be. The one thing that seems certain is that massive disruption was baked into the plan long, long ago. That is why, in my opinion, with the time we have we need to throw as many wrenches as we can into the gears of Web 3.0 mixed reality, digital identity, “regenerative” finance, and human capital engineering. All that is sacred hangs in the balance.</p>

<p>While the deadline for the Beyond Inclusion Scholarship application is approaching (<a href="https://cyberxr.org/beyond-inclusion-scholarship/">Have you applied? It takes just a few minutes and you can start clicking here!</a>), VentureBeat reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/deantak">Dean Takahashi</a> covered the initiative aimed at removing entry barriers in the XR industry.</p>

<p>“Representation matters. We’re committed to reaching a candidate pool that is as broad and diverse as possible, which is why we are proud to support the Beyond Inclusion Scholarship Program,” said Rob Sherman, deputy chief privacy officer at Meta, in a statement. “As companies and organizations build for the metaverse, it’s important that people from underrepresented communities have a seat at the table from the beginning — influencing product strategies, policies and perspective.”</p>



<p>Here’s what our CEO, Kavya Pearlman, said to Mr Takahashi. </p>



<p>“To create fair and equal work opportunities, we need to eliminate financial barriers to entry in immersive technologies and provide equitable measures like fully funded scholarships,” Pearlman said. “We need corporations to fulfil their social responsibility and collectively go beyond just inclusion by committing to increase the representation of underrepresented identity groups. This benefits not just the marginalized community but the entire technology ecosystem.”</p>

    <p>We’ve wrapped up Q2 2022, and we are excited to continue the growth of the Horizen ecosystem through new product launches, including <a href="https://testnet.tokenmint.global/">TokenMint on testnet</a> and our new <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Cobalt wallet!</a> We have also added five new integration pairs and exchange listings.</p>
 Q2 Highlights&nbsp; 
<p></p>
<p>Now is an exciting time for our ecosystem. Since the launch of <a href="https://horizen.io/zendoo">Zendoo</a>, our team has focused on launching products and adding new capabilities to our platform. This quarter we focused on the launch of our tokenization platform, TokenMint, and EVM compatibility, and our community growth has seen a huge increase because of it!</p>
 Products and Engineering Development 
 TokenMint on Testnet 
<p>This quarter, we launched our no-code necessary tokenization platform, TokenMint, to testnet. TokenMint is an easy-to-use platform for anyone to launch a token using custom tokenomics without having to know a single line of code. It streamlines and simplifies the tokenization process which makes creating a fungible token very easy and quick.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The TokenMint platform lives on TokenMint Chain, which is a sidechain built on Horizen. The testnet launch of the TokenMint platform comprised the launch of:</p>
 
 TokenMint Chain – an independent blockchain built on the Horizen sidechain platform, Zendoo.&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Cobalt Wallet</a> – a web browser extension wallet that stores and manages tokens created on TokenMint.&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://tokenmint.global/">Token Generator</a> – a web app that allows a streamlined and easy process for anyone to create and mint a fungible token with custom tokenomics.&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://explorer.tokenmint.global/">TokenMint Block explorer</a> – a block explorer that tracks and displays all transactions on the TokenMint Chain.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Over 550 tokens were created by our community, and the user feedback we received from our community helped us refine TokenMint features for its upcoming mainnet launch this month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also airdropped our own testnet tokens called Test Zenny (TZNY) and testnet CAKE (TCAKE) as a way to reward community participation in testing and other community activities. Over 8000 unique addresses received TZNY as of July 5th.&nbsp;</p>
 Cobalt Wallet 
<p>Along with <a href="https://testnet.tokenmint.global/">TokenMint</a>, we launched the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Cobalt wallet</a>. Cobalt is a web browser extension for Chrome and Brave browsers that mints, stores, and manages all tokens created on TokenMint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cobalt currently only supports TokenMint tokens as well as ZEN transfers between Horizen mainchain and TokenMint Chain. The team aims to extend Cobalt’s capability to support interoperability among different blockchain ecosystems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 EVM Sidechain Progress 
<p>The sidechain engineering team worked on the launch of our EVM sidechain. This upcoming sidechain will enable people to easily create their own Ethereum-based dapps on our ecosystem or bridge to existing dapps on other EVM-compatible platforms. We are excited to launch this sidechain in the near future.&nbsp;</p>
 Community Growth &amp; Updates 
<p></p>
<p>The community saw incredible growth this quarter, especially on Discord. We saw a 111.7% increase in total Discord members since Q1. The excitement and feedback received from the community about our latest products were incredible. Our community was also able to get a special new Discord Role (Test Pilots) for helping us test TokenMint and Cobalt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we welcomed a lot of new members to our community, the engagement rate increased tremendously, especially on Discord, with a soaring increase of 2,453% in monthly average new active communicators.&nbsp; Our other social media community also saw a large increase in engagement with an 86.6% increase on Linkedin, 29.5% increase on Twitter, and 18.6% on Facebook. Our most liked content focused on the release of TokenMint to testnet and the announcement of the activities we planned around the launch! The team will continue to plan additional activities around the mainnet launch of TokenMint, so be sure to look out for these in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also had a bump in activity on <a href="https://hde.horizen.io/">HDE tasks</a>, with our most popular tasks being creating content about TokenMint and testing the platform. The number of people signed up to test the TokenMint platform exceeded the task limit within the first few days of the task release! <br><br>We also welcomed a couple of new members to the <a href="https://www.horizen.io/ambassadors/">ambassador program</a>. We are excited that our long-time community members, Ghost and DeFi Money Printer, chose to join the program to help our community through social platforms and helpful content creation!</p>
<p>We also saw growth on the web, with a 6.5% increase in overall site traffic, a 5.9% increase in organic keyword rankings, and a 5.8% increase in referring domains. Social referral traffic was up 234% in Q2, with a 170% increase in blog traffic, a 120% increase in HEAP traffic, and a 24% increase in HDE traffic.</p>

 Events 
 Paris Blockchain Week 
<p></p>
<p>The Horizen team was at Paris Blockchain Week April 12-14! Our booth was packed during all three days of the event. We discussed our upcoming EVM-compatible sidechain and NFTs, and learned about a lot of exciting new projects in the space. Liat also spoke on several panels about NFTs and blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>
 Consensus 
<p></p>
<p>The Horizen team was in Austin, Texas, for Consensus 2022, where we had a fantastic time! We had a booth set up where we were able to give live demos of TokenMint; many attendees stopped by and created their own tokens in only 5 minutes, learning how the token generator works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Horizen Co-Founder and Team Lead Rob Viglione presented <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cGfULIwRg&amp;t=3s">“From Cypherpunk to Solving the Blockchain Trilemma Through zkSNARKS”</a> at Consensus to a packed audience while also conducting a fireside chat on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2JjEdrpM9g&amp;t=1s">“How Zero-Knowledge Proofs Change the Narrative Around Privacy.”</a></p>
<p>Horizen, along with Horizen Labs, hosted a side event with our partner, Halborn Security at Consensus, where guests enjoyed food, drink, and networking! We saw many longtime community members at the event, and it was a good chance for much of the team to network and catch up with each other during the busy event week.&nbsp;</p>

 NFT NYC 
<p></p>
<p>This year, Zain Cheng Horizen’s VP of Engineering, presented on the future of NFTs during this major event in NYC. Zain’s panel discussion was one of our favorite talks during the event and covered his opinions on what the future of NFTs could look like.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Horizen Labs hosted a Happy Hour event during NFT.NYC and welcomed hundreds of guests and Horizen community members.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the third post referencing refugee labor, charter cities, faith communities, cooperatives and tokenization. You can read it in full <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fHzSgUXOVW97wRFCZbBV5Jlm0ce-yPGy_Tg5jpK9L7g/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> or access a PDF <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Mondragon-Series-Wrench-In-The-Gears-@Philly852.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz">Joseph Stiglitz</a>, former chief economist of the World Bank and Columbia University professor, paid visits to Mondragon in 2005 and 2018. He was looking at worker-owned cooperatives as a possible tool to resolve economic disparities created by capitalism. UN Sustainable Goal 8 is decent work and economic growth. In a 2020 New York Times article, “<a href="https://archive.ph/vAWSj">Co-ops in Spain’s Basque Region Soften Capitalism’s Rough Edges</a>,” Amal Chevrau of the OECD was quoted: “Mondragón is one of the landmarks of the social economy movement because of its scale.”</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mondragon-corporation.com/en/history/page/2/">Source</a>: Mondragon Timeline 2005, “Joseph Stiglitz (Fourth from the Left)</p>
<p>Peter Goodman, author of the piece, goes on to say the co-op model is suited to a new corporate outlook that asserts the importance of stakeholders, not just <a href="https://archive.ph/b7AtJ">shareholders</a>. The Business Roundtable affirmed this position in an August 2019 press release clarifying the <a href="https://archive.ph/FWZ7n">purpose of a corporation</a>. Cooperatives have been positioned as tools to meet targets for UN SDG 8 as seen in “<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/16094069211058614">The Mondragon Case: Companies Addressing Social Impact and Dialogic Methodologies</a>.” The following is taken from the OECD social impact measurement policy paper:</p>
<p>“Indeed, cooperatives have taken the lead in adopting appropriate indicators to capture their impacts in terms of social inclusion, well-being and community engagement. To be responsive the specificities and goals of Italian Work Integration, Social Cooperatives have developed a dedicated model with indicators on well-being and personal growth, which are operationalised through psychosocial perceptions of vulnerable people after their work experience in social cooperatives (e.g. trust in their abilities, happiness with their lives, enthusiasm and commitment to work). In Canada, the Urban Institute’s ABC of Co-op Impact identifies metrics to measure the community impact of cooperatives compared to other forms of businesses. Democratic governance and member empowerment in particular are identified as distinguishing features of cooperatives compared to for-profit companies. Similarly, the Centre of Excellence in Accounting and Reporting for Cooperatives has developed a set of key performance indicators along the domains voluntary and open membership, democratic member control, member economic participation, autonomy and independence, education, training and information, and concern for community.” <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Social-Impact-measurement-for-the-Social-and-Solidarity-Economy.pdf">Page 39</a></p>
<p>Here’s how the sausage gets made. To those who know nothing of platform cooperatives, tokenization, and impact finance it probably sounds benevolent and hopeful. I think, however, that if you review the topics and framing of these blog posts prepared by the Platform Cooperative Consortium carefully, you’ll see that their economy that “puts people first” has chosen that tactic, because the new economy demands everyone’s data.</p>
<p>Yes, they pay lip-service to the fact that you will own your own data and be able to participate in governance through awarded tokens, but the truth is that mixed reality is not a game created by the masses for their benefit. This is made very clear by the fact that the sole funder of the Platform Cooperativism Consortium is Google – a $1 million grant in 2018. The fact that this NGO’s headquarters is one block away from Union Square, a landmark for labor organizing and free speech in the United States, is a slap in the face to all who made sacrifices for workers’ rights.</p>

<p>The concept of <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w23780/w23780.pdf">Information Economics</a>, the impact of asymmetrical information on markets, was developed by Stiglitz. This fixation on resolving information inefficiencies precipitated the demand that everything be measured. One way to obtain measurements, and quantification of social relations for impact, within workplaces is to turn employers into platform cooperatives and then adopt a tokenized governance model to visualize the dynamics of internal operations, including adherence to stated corporate values.</p>
<p>It also drives the push for finclusion of the so-called un-banked. Eliminating anonymous informal transactions is an imperative for the data economy. It is a misguided quest for full spectrum dominance of all financial activity. Nothing is meant to exist beyond the reach of, the vision of, the machine. In “<a href="https://www.dgen.org/blog/decentralisation-at-work-cooperatives-on-blockchain">Decentralization at Work: Cooperatives on the Blockchain</a>,” Joshua Davila of <a href="https://www.dgen.org/about">dGen</a>, a Berlin-based consultancy working on “responsible” deployment of Web 3.0 technologies describes a DisCO (Distributed Cooperative Organization) Co-op model which is like a DAO with embedded aspects of eco-feminist economics. The effort is backed by <a href="https://www.tni.org/en/programmes">TNI</a>, the Transnational Institute, a program of the <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/36768-Institute_for_Policy_Studies">Institute for Policy Studies</a>, a liberal global NGO advancing the “green” economy, evidence-based drug policy, effective public services, people’s rights in trade, and opposition to structures of technological control (the irony).</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Gv8aQpptI&amp;t=54s">Source</a>: DisCo Coop Trailer</p>
<p>The author of the 2019 DisCO Manifest, “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/DisCO-If-I-Only-Had-A-Heart.pdf">If I Had A Hear</a>t” is UK artist <a href="https://ruthcatlow.net/">Ruth Catlow</a> whose work asserts the potential of networked technology for emancipation. The project prefers the words distributed over decentralized and cooperative over autonomous. Their goal is to create community algorithmic trusts, DisCO CATs, to keep track of work related to the commons including unpaid care work through love, livelihood and pro-bono credits. The latter, especially when combined with fair trade certifications, will create metrics for UN Sustainable Goal 5, Gender Equity. The first use case was a Madrid-based online service, <a href="https://www.guerrillatranslation.org/2018/09/22/the-open-coop-governance-model-in-guerrilla-translation-an-overview/">Guerrilla Translation</a>, that uses a platform built on <a href="https://holo.host/">Holo</a>, a pilot for Open Value Cooperativism advanced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Bauwens">Michel Bauwens</a> and the P2P Foundation through its <a href="https://www.tni.org/files/publication-downloads/commons_transition_and_p2p_primer_v9.pdf">Common Transition</a> project.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.guerrillatranslation.org/2018/09/22/the-open-coop-governance-model-in-guerrilla-translation-an-overview/">Open Value Cooperativism</a> tracks contribution to a project so that participants have a claim on future value created. This reminds me of the new use case being applied to impact investing – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hOhOdCbBlU&amp;t=36s">Hypercerts</a> by San Francisco-based <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/protocol-labs">Protocol Labs</a>. The model of credit streams was later applied to a regional cultural project in western Spain relating to weaving and two maker-space “Fab-Labs,” one in&nbsp; Zimbabwe and the other Cooperation Jackson in Mississippi.&nbsp; Cooperation Jackson’s Fab-Lab uses software created by the MIT Center for Bits and Atoms.</p>
<p>On the surface this model seems reasonable. I know several extremely talented artists and writers whose ability to continue their vital work relies on navigating an increasingly perilous maze of gig work and one-off fundraisers. Stability and camaraderie of like-minded people is something we all seek. But to me this new brand of networked emancipation will demand all participants and the communities, online and offline, in which they are situated submit to the roll out of Web 3.0.</p>
<p>This will bring with it all kinds of smart contracts that will embed themselves in every aspect of our lives. It is only with great effort that activists are going to be able to hold onto the fiction that blockchain tools are serving them rather than confining them. The poster children for DisCO are eclectic, artsy makers, but we shouldn’t kid ourselves the model won’t be grabbed by the tentacles of corporate ESG portfolios or used to manage refugee camps or faith-based <a href="https://www.focolare.org/en/works-and-activities/cittadelle/">Focolare towns</a>.</p>
<p>Bauwens founded P2P in 2006 in <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/p2p-foundation">Amsterdam</a> and is now focused on <a href="https://twitter.com/mbauwens/status/1543524718061436929">accounting</a> for “planetary survival.” That’s <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/09/05/blockchain-life-on-the-ledger/">life on the ledger</a>. His previous career was in e-commerce working for Belgium’s largest telecom company, Belgacom (now Proximus Group). Before that, he worked as a “<a href="http://www.experience-economy.com/page/view/87/michel-bauwens">cybrarian</a>” for the Cold War propaganda machine <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/inventing-public-diplomacy-the-story-the-us-information-agency">USIA</a> and as information coordinator for British Petroleum. He <a href="https://platform.coop/people/michel-bauwens/">collaborates</a> on “commons” issues with Vasilis Kostakis, a professor of Peer-to-Peer at Tallinn University of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallinn_University_of_Technology">Technology(TalTech)</a> in Estonia and Harvard’s <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/vkostakis">Berkman Klein Center, </a>and Amherst-based <a href="https://2020.berlinurbantech.com/www.creatingurbantech.com/en/conference/participants/person/david-bollie/index.3e0.delaye">David Bollier</a>, co-founder of Commons Strategies Group.

 Cybernetic Prosperity Gospel – Virtue and FreeDOM 
<p>The emerging economic system, embedded as it is within cybernetic enclosures, is taking on an anarcho-capitalist vibe where the far Left and far right, including the religious right, converge around a shared love of decentralization and the promise of techno-liberation. Somehow both sides think they can use a “tool” of state intelligence to accomplish their preferred economic and sacred ends. Color me dubious.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Left will enjoy a flat-horizontal social structure with weighted “woke” values embedded in its economic transacting for a while, but only until Aladdin comes on the scene. In the same way I think the religious right imagines a future of doing well by doing good and earning enough evidence-based charity tokens to pad their heavenly portfolio without stopping to think that the creator wouldn’t blockchain people and putting your faith in technology undercuts authentic spirituality.</p>
<p>I see the Acton Institute’s article <a href="https://www.acton.org/publications/transatlantic/2021/06/29/venerable-servant-god-jose-maria-arizmendiarrieta-patron">lauding</a> Arizmendiarrieta as the “patron saint of Spanish entrepreneurship,” as a clear example of the latter. Acton Institute is a Grand Rapids, Michigan based think tank that advocates Judeo-Christian values embedded in free-market economics. They are affiliated with the <a href="https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Atlas_Network">Atlas Network</a>, which is anti-regulation in outlook, and publish a peer-reviewed journal “<a href="https://www.marketsandmorality.com/index.php/mandm">Markets and Morality</a>.”</p>
<p>Grand Rapids, the <a href="https://www.experiencegr.com/articles/post/president-ford/">childhood home of Gerald Ford</a>, is the economic hub of western Michigan with <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/323562-Spectrum_Health">Spectrum Health System</a> its largest employer. <a href="https://www.amway.com/en_US/about-amway/history">Amway</a>, founded by the <a href="https://www.dbdvfoundation.org/news/how-and-why-amways-devos-family-gives-away-billions">influential DeVos family</a>, is located ten miles away in the suburb of Ada. The <a href="https://archive.ph/DKHjo">DeVos’s</a> are major donors, handing out millions upon millions in grants to nonprofits, many in Michigan, and to the Republican party. Betsy DeVos served as chair of the Republican Party of Michigan and was appointed Secretary of Education by Trump in 2016 where she advocated for charter school expansion and school choice. Among Acton Institute’s <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/52227-Acton_Institute_for_the_Study_of_Religion_and_Liberty">supporters</a> are DeVos, Eric Prince, the Kochs, and the <a href="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/4152914/2018_YearReview_BradleyFdn.pdf">Bradley Foundation</a> (Birch Society affiliate). Twelve miles from downtown Grand Rapids is Cascade Township, home of an <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/2021/10/aerospace-defense-contractor-making-26m-expansion-creating-34-jobs-in-grand-rapids-area.html">L3 Harris Technologies manufacturing plant</a> that saw a $2.6 million expansion last year.

<p>The founder of Acton Institute is<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sirico"> Robert Sirico</a>, a man on an unusual spiritual journey. If there were ever an embodiment of shifted polarization it would be him. Raised in Brooklyn with his recently-deceased brother and Soprano’s actor <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/07/09/1110670719/sopranos-tony-sirico-dies-paulie-walnuts-obit">Tony Sirico</a>, Robert separated from the Catholic Church as a youth and moved to the west coast where he became a Pentecostal minister. He then changed course and established a church ministering to the gay community in Seattle and Los Angeles. Later, upon reading Hayek and the biography of John Neumann, he turned away from those beliefs and came back to the Catholic Church, attending Catholic University and becoming ordained as a Paulist priest.</p>
<p>A major influence on his theoretical understanding was Catholic philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Novak">Michael Nowak</a>. Nowak, a <a href="https://www.firstthings.com/article/1991/06/liberation-theology-whats-left">strong critic of Liberation Theology</a>, wrote “The Spirit of Democratic Capitalism, which theorized that democracy was only possible within free markets and a plural, liberalistic culture. During his time on the west coast Robert Sirico was active in peace and environmentalist movements. His goal at Acton is to bridge the Left’s position on the climate with the Right to become better stewards – though to my way of thinking this has everything to do with emergent markets in ESG finance and sensor networks.</p>
<p>The story goes that Sirico was inspired by Pope John Paul II’s encyclical,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centesimus_annus"> Centesimus annus</a>, which revisited the 1891 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rerum_novarum">Rerum novarum</a> in the waning days of the Cold War. It affirmed social and economic justice but in opposition to Marxism. He came to Grand Rapids to found Action Institute with <a href="https://www.acton.org/about/staff/kris-alan-mauren">Kris Mauren</a>, a Johns Hopkins graduate in international policy with a focus on nonprofit management and measurement. The men sought to promote virtue and freedom and honorable business practices grounded in private property rights. The organization has 50 employees, a $12 million annual budget, and maintains satellite offices in Rome and Buenos Aires. <a href="https://www.iese.edu/faculty-research/faculty/maximilian-b-torres/">Maximilian Torres</a>, professor of business ethics and corporate organizational measurement, connects Acton to Mondragon’s Spain and the Vatican’s inclusive capitalism.

 Blockchain Poverty Cure? 
<p>In the spirit of the church’s social teachings, Sirico <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBX5SKpjpWE">launched</a> the Institute’s PovertyCure initiative at the&nbsp; <a href="https://townhall.innis.utoronto.ca/event/the-newman-centre-toronto-poverty-cure-series-the-entrepreneurial-calling-screening-and-panel-discussion-with-andreas-widmer/">Newman Centre of the University of Toronto</a> in 2018. The <a href="https://www.povertycure.org/about-us">program</a>, which now has over 400 international partners in 150 countries, applies Christian-centered entrepreneurship to the problem of global poverty, fostering voluntary civil associations outside the state to promote human flourishing.</p>
<p>In 2014, Acton underwrote the creation of a documentary <a href="https://www.povertyinc.org/">Poverty, Inc.</a>, to prepare the ground for this work. The film, which won dozens of festival awards and was <a href="https://blog.acton.org/archives/83352-acton-institutes-poverty-inc-wins-templeton-freedom-award.html">recognized</a> by the John Templeton Foundation, is a good example of <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/09/30/dont-let-impact-investors-capture-the-non-profit-activist-media/">impact media.</a> The website even includes an “<a href="https://www.povertyinc.org/impact-survey">impact survey</a>” to capture metrics.</p>
<p>People on the Right who follow my work may be thinking, “So, what’s the problem? I don’t see anything not to like.” Well it gets murkier once you dig into the interests behind the creation of the film. Mark Weber was the point person. He’s the business innovation lead for IBM. From his <a href="https://www.markrweber.com/bio">online bio</a>: “Mark focuses on cultivating the research-to-impact workflow within a hybrid cloud ecosystem for driving AI applications with pathways to integration and scale.” “As a researcher, Mark has published works on blockchain technology for supply chain finance, graph deep learning for anti-money laundering, and AI fairness for anti-discrimination in lending.” Weber earned his MBA at the Sloan School where he worked as a graduate assistant on MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative (DCI). Weber overlapped for a year with DCI founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianforde/">Brian Forde</a>, who relocated to his home state of California in 2017 to run for a Congressional seat in Orange County (Forde lost).</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://www.markrweber.com/bio">Source</a>: Mark Weber – Driving Business Innovation from Fundamental Science</p>
<p>While at DCI Weber helped build <a href="https://dci.mit.edu/b-verify">b_verify</a>, a blockchain commodities tracking platform developed in <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/366647-b_verify">partnership</a> with Boston University (Jesuit), the University of Pennsylvania, the Mexican government, and the InterAmerican Development Bank. The platform was ostensibly to create efficiencies in warehousing and storage of commodities, but as we know, all of this technology is dual use.</p>
<p>At this point very few people are willing to say out loud that the plan is to tokenize poor people and children as commodities, track them, and place futures bets on them as you would a silo of GMO corn. If you read my <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/01/19/conditional-cash-transfers-and-cybernetic-futures/">detailed investigation</a> into Mexico’s pilot of conditional cash transfers to low-income women and children in the mid 1990s, you’ll understand my concern. There is a reason Mexico and InterAmerican Development Bank are on the partner list.</p>
<p>Michael Matheson Miller also helped create the film. Miller is an Acton Institute research fellow and wrote the book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Contagion-Intrusion-Surveillance-Capitalism-ebook/dp/B09GSWYDW7">Digital Contagion</a>” with a focus on Big Tech and surveillance capitalism. Of course we know how the dialectic works – the planned “solution” being some version of “rebel city” digital sovereignty (branded Left or Right as needed) so we will elect to commodify our souls and join IBM’s blockchain supply network that’s being built out by Mark Weber’s colleagues. Miller’s podcast topics at “The Moral Imagination,” are meant to appeal to Libertarians. They hit all the buttons – classical education, awake not woke, principled entrepreneurship, crypto; totalitarianism, beauty and love. They know how to tell you what you want to hear, but they aren’t going to tell you everything.</p>
<p>Mark knows that there’s a game afoot. Sirico may talk a good game about human flourishing, but I’ll state again that Jesus would not blockchain people and put them under ubiquitous digital surveillance for supply chain tracking. That is not freeDOM. That is not liberty. If you want to pull out of charity so you can push entrepreneurship, understand that a poor person succeeding in this age of automation will be practically impossible UNLESS they agree to be used for anti-poverty washing data analytics and synthetic biology for the open air prison. What Acton Institute is doing is asking people to live in the game while pretending that there is no game.</p>
<p>I invite you to read the description of blockchain warehouse logs with IoT surveillance monitoring. Then read <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/04/22/guest-post-our-acton-academy-experience-surveillance-incentives-behaviorism-freedom-levels-and-edtech/">this open letter</a> to Jeff and Laura Sandefer and parents who have children enrolled in Acton Academy franchise micro-schools. Acton Academy is <a href="https://www.acton.org/audio/heros-journey-jeff-sandefer">loosely connected</a> with Acton Institute through its Texas oilman founder Jeff Sander. The mom said she was very concerned about the amount of personal data being collected on her children in school through digital platforms. The Sandefer’s response was that they could choose to leave and that the kind of data they were collecting wasn’t Communist. I guess we’re supposed to be glad for it. I suppose they don’t count on people understanding digital twins and blockchain mind files. The school franchise and the Institute are both named after <a href="https://www.acton.org/about/mission#:~:text=The%20Acton%20Institute%20is%20a,Acton%20(1834%2D1902).">Lord Acton</a> who is often quoted as saying “Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.” Indeed.</p>

<p><a href="https://dci.mit.edu/b-verify">Source</a>: b_verify Warehouse Receipts An Open Source Blockchain Protocol For Verifiable Records</p>
 
 
<p>The text above:</p>
<p>“The selected use case informing this research is the negotiable warehouse receipt for agricultural commodities. Warehouse receipts (picture student meta-data on blockchain) are legally defined title documents attesting to a particular quantity, type, and quality of a commodity (securitized human capital) at a specific storage facility. These instruments can be used to secure inventory as collateral for loans, to facilitate trade, and to settle expiring futures contracts.</p>
<p>Development agencies and multilaterals have championed the benefits of warehouse receipts for price discovery (reputation scoring for securitization of humans as Berggruen’s tokenized assets) and access to credit for even the poorest of farmers. One USAID program in Tanzania produced a doubling of the prices farmers were able to command for their harvest immediately upon the installation of a storage and warehouse receipt program. Strengthening the agricultural sector also improves food security and competitiveness at a national level.</p>
<p>Three problems prevent warehouse receipts from realizing their full potential for farmers and society: forged documents, high transaction costs, and the potential for disparities (similar arguments used to advance blockchain learning lockers/transcripts) between the receipt attestation and the physical goods. Applications using the b_verify protocol can help mitigate these problems.</p>
<p>First, high profile frauds involving forged or duplicated warehouse receipts have cost banks hundreds of millions of dollars; this makes banks wary of lending against them and traders wary of buying them. The b_verify protocol addresses this problem by posting warehouse receipt issuances as cryptographic commitments to the data structure of the Bitcoin blockchain as a secure, public source of record.</p>
<p>Second, assuming the receipts are authentic, the transaction costs involved in verifying and transporting paper records are extremely high, especially in countries with poor infrastructure. The b_verify protocol addresses this problem using a novel method of coordinating updates to the records using cryptographic proofs constructed by a designated server, which need not be trusted (picture automated contracts/payments for remote gig labor).</p>
<p>Third, again assuming authentic receipts, banks and traders worry about the quality and honesty of warehouse custodianship; perhaps the goods are removed illegally for example. While this problem cannot be completely eliminated by technology, access control measures and Internet of Things (IoT) integrations can be combined with the b_verify protocol (surveillance of students/workers like Wildflower Montessori wearables and artificial vision cameras) to reduce these risks. For example, outflows of grain from a silo could require authentication via a query of the blockchain record, while digital devices measuring the outflow can independently commit updates to the record without human interference.</p>
<p>An added feature of the b_verify protocol is the opportunity for the programmatic enforcement of covenants and contracts (also known as “smart contracts”). For example, using an application servicing the b_verify protocol, the pledging of collateral with a warehouse receipt could automate the transfer of the collateral to the lender upon a hard loan default. Covenants such as maximum debt-to-asset ratios or minimum allowed commodity price fluctuations could also be constructed within the b_verify system.</p>
<p>The verifiable activities of a given business over time, such as inventory turnover and repayment history, can also provide valuable insight into the health of the business, which is the chief consideration in assessing creditworthiness (also applicable to human capital).</p>
<p>Lastly, the transparency provided by this publicly accessible and verifiable system of record may contribute to safer, more transparent asset-backed securities and derivatives markets as these develop in emerging economies.” <a href="https://dci.mit.edu/b-verify">Source</a></p>
 
 
<p>Excerpt from one mother’s experience with an Acton Academy Microschool – compare with excerpt above:</p>
<p>“The next big red flag was the 360 reviews&nbsp;that kids were asked to fill out at the end of every session on the Acton tracker. Acton says these reviews are meant to ‘normalize feedback’. Except, I do not know any professional who is allowed to offer feedback directed at an individual’s character. The 360 reviews ask students to anonymously rate everyone in their studio on a scale of 1 to 10 based on how ‘tough-minded’ and ‘warm-hearted’ they are. They are given a space to write a sentence of evidence for their rating, and then are given space to write ‘stars’ for things they like about the person, and ‘wishes’ for what they wish that person would change. After seeing this, I sent an email to the owners of our school with evidence I have accumulated from professors in my Master’s work which demonstrated feedback, especially personal feedback, does not have the desired positive outcomes, and induces shame responses. The owners of our school and founders of Acton told me normalizing feedback was valuable; and, if Acton was not a good fit, there are other schools for my kids.</p>
<p>The results of the 360 reviews were one of the metrics used to determine a student’s&nbsp;freedom level. Before Acton, the only time I had heard the term ‘freedom level’ was to describe a social credit system where those with higher credits get greater access-a program that has been piloted on a wide scale under the guise of ‘building trust’ with authoritarian governments. Inside each studio are 5 freedom levels. Freedom is earned or lost by meeting certain expectations, and in the middle and high school studios, higher freedom levels are not given to those with low peer 360 reviews. In upper elementary, a student on the highest freedom level can choose anywhere to sit during work time, and can even choose not to work. On the lowest level a student has to sit in an assigned seat, cannot snack, and must get a minimum amount of work done.</p>
<p>And, these 360 reviews are not written on paper or given any relational connection. They are written and published online, on&nbsp;Acton’s ‘tracker’. The tracker is a major anchor for many ‘personalized’ learning programs. It holds the student’s record, or ledger, of their work, their 360 reviews, their ‘SMART’ goals, their ‘badges’ for completing a certain amount of work, and their ‘buck’ balance (more on bucks below). This tracker allows you to look at the progress, bucks balance, 360 review scores, and badge earnings of everyone in the studio. It asks you how many minutes you worked on math or reading. It asks you to upload screenshots of proof, and answer questions about topics. One of the ways Acton keeps costs low is to utilize education technology for Math and English Language Arts, so that no expertise is needed by educators for what they call ‘core skills’ learning.</p>
<p>The tracker and the education technology learning platforms are forms of&nbsp;surveillance. These are ways data can be harvested and utilized. My open letter to Acton describes exactly how schools, institutions, and those set on 21st Century education reforms benefit from harvested data. I asked Acton how they are using the data from the tracker, how they are protecting the data harvested from my children on the tracker and the EdTech companies they promote. I was told that I could trust them or go to a new school, and that only I could protect my children.”</p>
<p>“Acton students are told they have a minimum number of lessons to do online for math and ELA. If they succeed, they will earn a badge and will get paid bucks. If they do not, they will lose a buck each week for not completing the minimum. This rewards those who learn well online. Some kids can earn bucks at a much faster rate, and others can be highly stressed. Now, if a student runs out of bucks they must go to an isolated room and work on core skills all day, for as many days as it takes to earn another hero buck by completing a badge. To avoid this, my kids have a badge they leave 90% completed so that if it were to happen they could get a badge and get out ASAP.</p>
<p>Bucks are also taken if peers see you not following the classroom rules. Peers are supposed to offer a verbal warning, and then if the behavior persists the peer can go on to the Acton tracker and ask the person for a buck. Guides take bucks for not being on time and prepared and not being respectful. There is not a moment in the day when bucks are not in jeopardy. Which, by definition, means this is not a self-directed environment.</p>
<p>I made several attempts to discuss why their learning and behaviors are incentivized, as this is in opposition to research that has been published for 30 years stating incentivization has a net negative effect. I was told to trust them and that these systems were being used wisely.” <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/04/22/guest-post-our-acton-academy-experience-surveillance-incentives-behaviorism-freedom-levels-and-edtech/">Source</a></p>

<p>On June 17, 6pm UTC, shielded transactions submitted to the Zcash network increased dramatically. As a result, third party wallets have experienced lower performance. The network remained, and still remains, stable and operational, and transactions are being processed normally.<br><br>The ECC core team worked over the Fourth of July holiday to implement a new batch validation algorithm to further reduce verification time by another 80%. Their efforts saw release <code>zcashd</code> 5.1.0 go live.</p>



 Summary 



<p>This release is primarily targeted at improving the validation performance of Sapling and Orchard transactions as well as an incremental improvement to the scan performance of post-NU5 blocks. The release also made improvements to <code>getblocktemplate</code> performance and added Orchard information to <code>getrawtransaction</code> and <code>decoderawtransaction</code>. We will continue to address remaining scan performance issues in subsequent releases.</p>



 Notable changes 



 Faster block validation for Sapling and Orchard transactions 



<p>Block validation in <code>zcashd</code> is a mostly single-threaded process, due to how the chain update logic inherited from Bitcoin Core is written. However, certain more computationally intensive checks are performed more efficiently than checking everything individually:</p>



  ECDSA signatures on transparent inputs are checked via multithreading.  RedPallas signatures on Orchard actions are checked via batch validation.  



<p>As of this release, <code>zcashd</code> applies these techniques to more Sapling and Orchard components:</p>



  RedJubjub signatures on Sapling Spends are checked via batch validation.  Groth16 proofs for Sapling Spends and Outputs are checked via batch validation and multithreading.  Halo 2 proofs for Orchard Actions are checked via batch validation and multithreading.  



<p>This reduces worst-case block validation times for observed historic blocks by around 80% on a Ryzen 9 5950X CPU.</p>



<p>The number of threads used for checking Groth16 and Halo 2 proofs (as well as for creating them when spending funds) can be set via the <code>RAYON_NUM_THREADS</code> environment variable.</p>



 Option handling 



  A new <code>-preferredtxversion</code> argument allows the node to preferentially create transactions of a specified version, if a transaction does not contain components that necessitate creation with a specific version. For example, setting <code>-preferredtxversion=4</code> will cause the node to create V4 transactions whenever the transaction does not contain Orchard components. This can be helpful if recipients of transactions are likely to be using legacy wallets that have not yet been upgraded to support parsing V5 transactions.  



 RPC interface 



  The <code>getblocktemplate</code> RPC method now skips proof and signature checks on templates it creates, as these templates only include transactions that have previously been checked when being added to the mempool.  The <code>getrawtransaction</code> and <code>decoderawtransaction</code> RPC methods now include details about Orchard actions within transactions.  



 Wallet 



  Rescan performance of post-NU5 blocks has been slightly improved (overall rescan time for a single-account wallet decreases by around 6% on a Ryzen 9 5950X). Further improvements will be implemented in future releases to help mitigate the effect of blocks full of shielded outputs.  The <code>CWallet::UpdatedTransaction</code> signal is no longer called while holding the <code>cs_main</code> lock. This fixes an issue where RPCs could block for long periods of time on <code>zcashd</code> nodes with large wallets. Downstream code forks that have reconnected the <code>NotifyTransactionChanged</code> wallet signal should take note of this change, and not rely there on access to globals protected by <code>cs_main</code>.

<p>This is the second post referencing refugee labor, charter cities, faith communities, cooperatives and tokenization. You can read it in full <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fHzSgUXOVW97wRFCZbBV5Jlm0ce-yPGy_Tg5jpK9L7g/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> or access a PDF <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Mondragon-Series-Wrench-In-The-Gears-@Philly852.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>We’ll delve deeper in the next section when we discuss the model global cooperative Mondragon Corporation, but for now, make a note that while situated five hours across the peninsula on the Mediterranean side of Spain, Catalonia has synergy with developments in Basque Country.</p>
<p>For the past decade, the idea of applying collective ownership and governance principles to digital platforms has gained momentum, notably in the “rebel” ultra-smart city <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfkjDvn9Cs">Barcelona</a> where Francesca Bria, formerly of <a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/feature/innovation-methods/impact-investment/">NESTA</a>, vigorously promoted the digital sovereignty of citizens through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm82-sus1nE">cooperative ownership of data</a>. In this scenario the “renegade” Left is used as a counterweight to establishment neoliberalism, shoring up the technological imperative to dominate the natural world into synthetic submission. They promise that theirs will be a kinder, gentler AI that really, really cares about us and about solving inequality – in a Fabian Socialist / Libertarian paternalistic kind of way.</p>
<p>Illustrative of this mentality is a May 2022 article featuring the “rebel city” touting adoption by their Urban Innovation Lab of coastal <a href="https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/imi/en/noticia/barcelona-chooses-drone-technology-to-improve-its-management-of-public-spaces_1173724">drone surveillance</a> as a tool to “improve management of public space.” Sure, you can go to the beach, presuming you agree to follow an ever-changing list of rules. We’re supposed to feel reassured by the fact that the data is supposed to be anonymized. I don’t think people will forget, however, the use of drones to police social distancing over the past few years.</p>
<p></p>

<p>The following is taken from “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Digital-City-Barcelona-Francesca-Bria.pdf">Building Digital Cities From The Ground Up Based Around Data Sovereignty and Participatory Democracy: The Case of Barcelona</a>,” prepared by Francesca Bria in 2019 when she was Chief Technology Officer of the city having come from London where <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/people/francesca-bria">digital identity and social innovation</a> were her areas of expertise:</p>
<p>“They can run smart, data-intensive, algorithmic public transportation, housing, health and education – all based on a logic of solidarity, social cooperation, and collective rights.”</p>
<p>“Barcelona is actively forging alternative municipal alliances of rebel cities, becoming a key site of struggles to fight climate change, build more liveable and just cities, and regain technological sovereignty.”</p>
<p>“Barcelona’s digital city efforts have centred on opening up governance through participatory processes and greater transparency. At the core of Barcelona’s model is a large scale participatory experiment powered by a digital participatory platform, Decidim (“We Decide”, in Catalan), which enables citizens to shape government policies by suggesting ideas, debating them, and voting on them. Decidim taps into the collective intelligence of citizens to create policies that better respond to their needs.”</p>
<p>“We focused on aligning the technology with the city’s core policy objectives selected through a large-scale participatory democracy process. In the case of Barcelona, affordable housing, healthcare for all, sustainable mobility, energy transition, increased public space and the fight against climate change are the top priorities.”</p>
<p>“Now the renewable energy operator is experimenting with distributed energy grid technology and with applications that allow citizens to own their energy consumption data.”</p>
<p>“The use of an open sensors city infrastructure called Sentilo and big data analytics makes it possible to define and predict better public mobility policies, and measure the urban impact of evidence-based policymaking.”</p>
<p>“Now, for instance, the municipality has a large contract with Vodafone by which every month the company is obliged to give back machine-readable data to the city hall, while also making sure they encrypt the data to preserve citizens’ privacy.”</p>
<p>“Alternative models of service provision are being fostered via the creation of special funds for platform cooperatives and digital social innovation, supported by an EU initiative that has channelled €60m in the last few years towards experimenting with next-generation digital platforms that work for the public interest.”</p>
<p>“Barcelona leads a network of rebel cities, “Fearless Cities”, that is adopting tools and experiments in open democracy and data protection. The first conference was hosted in the city last year, bringing together more than 180 cities from 40 countries and five continents.”</p>
<p>“Barcelona is the coordinator of the <a href="https://decodeproject.eu/partners.html">DECODE</a> project, the biggest EU effort to establish a framework for data sovereignty, aiming to develop open source, decentralised, privacy-enhancing and rights-preserving technologies for citizens to decide what kind of data they want to keep private, what data they want to share, with whom, and on what terms. This proposes a new social pact — a New Deal on data that we hope will soon become a reality in many cities across the world.”</p>
<p>In addition to the city of Barcelona, DECODE’s partners include: <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/arduino">Arduino</a> – advanced cyber-physical infrastructure based in New York; <a href="https://www.apax.com/partnerships/thoughtworks/">ThoughtWorks</a> – Chicago-headquartered Agile software consulting acquired by Ronald Cohen’s Apax Partners in 2017; <a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/brief-history-nesta/">NESTA</a> – UK Social Innovation Lab; <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/thingful">Thingful</a> – search engine for IoT connected devices in a geography based in London;&nbsp; <a href="https://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London Information Security and Research Group</a> – end-to-end cryptography for societal uses; the <a href="https://centredeconomiesorbonne.cnrs.fr/">Economic Center of the Sorbonne</a> (CNRS); <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dribia">Dribia</a> – geolocation data analytics in Barcelona; <a href="https://eurecat.org/en/">Eurecat!</a> – industrial technology R&amp;D center with bio-tech in Catalonia; <a href="https://www.uoc.edu/portal/ca/in3/index.html">Open University of Catalonia</a> – Human Computer Interaction and Digital Commoning; <a href="https://nexa.polito.it/about-en">Nexa Center for Internet and Society</a> in Turin, Italy; Amsterdam – the other pilot city; <a href="https://www.dyne.org/">Dyne.org</a> – open-source software foundry in the Netherlands; <a href="https://www.ru.nl/icis">Privacy and Identity Lab</a> at Radboud University in Nijmegen, NL; and <a href="https://waag.org/en/about-waag/">Waag FutureLab</a> – promoting a Planet B proposal for decentralized tech in Amsterdam.&nbsp;The <a href="https://decodeproject.eu/what-decode.html">framework</a> DECODE lays out is aligned with assertions of <a href="https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/data-dignity/">data dignity</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/plural-property/">plural property</a>&nbsp;being promoted by RadicalXChange, developers of <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/05/28/soulbound-tokens-trust-networks-and-californias-big-test/">Soulbound Tokens</a>.</p>
<p>Bria has since left Barcelona to head the Italian National Innovation Fund and <a href="https://www.mwcbarcelona.com/agenda/speaker/francesca-bria">consult</a> with UN Habitat on smart cities. They mean for us to become “sovereign” citizens of the planetary computer. They’re giving us two options: 1) allow tech giants to control our data or 2) agree to become data commodities inhabiting a world of total surveillance. Both models are grounded in digital empire and conquest of natural systems. There are other options that would not require us to submit ourselves to the AI gods, and we need to be advocating for them now. With all the talk of social credit scoring, we should remember that vulnerable populations, including children, are on the front lines of the social impact data commodities game.</p>
<p>With a deft sleight of hand, platform cooperative refugees could wind up contingent remote labor even as they’re publicly lauded as empowered token-holders with a stake in the brutal fiction that is the twenty-first century data economy. That’s what the “impact economy” looks like. Don’t get caught up in their manipulative interactive digital storytelling. Unfortunately, most of us are pretty easy to fool. We don’t want to face the horror that we may ALL end up living in a cross between Black Mirror’s “<a href="https://medium.com/@heranmamo/taking-a-social-media-nosedive-and-underrating-common-relationships-in-black-mirror-9be23b3a5575">Nosedive</a>” episode and Ira Levin’s “<a href="https://746books.com/2020/09/22/no-467-the-stepford-wives-by-ira-levin/">Stepford Wives</a>.”</p>

 Mondragon, Focolare, and Capitalism’s Catholic Makeover 
<p>Currently one of the largest companies in Spain, Mondragon Corporation started out in the 1950s as an effort of Catholic social teaching by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Arizmendiarrieta">Father Jose Maria Arizmendiarrieta</a> who combined technical education with a worker-centered model that remade the metalworking industry that had been the community’s economic engine since the middle ages. Laminates was one of their products – sheet metal, which is interesting given the ties to Lamina1 and lamins I wrote about in a <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/06/17/ritual-gaming-and-berggruens-transformation-of-the-human-synthetic-pretenders-part-4/">previous piece</a>.</p>
<p>The priest’s legacy is one of a vanguard entrepreneur who sought to go “beyond a mercantile and economic society dedicated to satisfying the private interests of its investors” to “spearhead a complex social movement based on principles of self-management, subordination of capital to labour and Christian communitarian ethics,” establishing a cooperative model that by the 1950s “included real estate, sports, educational, cultural and health services.” Sociologist C. George Benello includes a chapter on Mondragon in his 1993 book, “<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/From_the_Ground_Up/GiYdUqx1m6wC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=mondragon+mitterand&amp;pg=PA95&amp;printsec=frontcover">From the Ground Up: Essays on Grassroots and Workplace Democracy</a>,” that traces Mondragon’s influence to the creation of a cooperative cabinet post in Mitterand’s France, projects with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9Imekv-gU8">Welsh Trade Council,</a>&nbsp;England’s <a href="https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1981/oct/19/common-ownership-companies">Job Ownership Movement</a>, and the establishment of progressive Catholic worker organizations in Detroit, Milwaukee, and Boston.</p>
<p>The United Nations designated 2012 as the International Year of Cooperatives.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://www.un.org/en/events/coopsyear/">Source</a>: UN International Year of Cooperatives</p>
<p>The online Christian newsletter <a href="https://aleteia.org/about-us/">Aleteia</a> published “<a href="https://aleteia.org/2014/02/23/mondragon-and-the-other-fr-jose-maria/">Mondragon and the Other Fr. Jose Maria.</a>” The article opened contrasting Arizmendiarrieta with St. <a href="https://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=5603">Josemaría Escrivá</a> who founded Opus Dei, an influential and secretive fraternity of Catholic lay people and affiliated priests. Opus Dei began in 1928 and expanded to include the <a href="https://opusdei.org/en-us/article/the-priestly-society-of-the-holy-cross-what-it-is/">Priestly Society of the Holy Cross</a> in 1943, the same year that Mondragon Technical College was started. Arizmendiarrieta was seventeen years Escriva’s junior; though the careers of the two Spanish priests coincided for three decades.</p>
<p>Elias Crim, author of the piece, sought to unite the distinct outlooks of the two men, one conservative and the other socially progressive (though within the existing capitalist model), under the umbrella of the <a href="https://www.focolare.org/chi-siamo/">Focolare Movement. </a>Focolare translates to “hearth” or “fireside” in English and has the goal of universal Christian brotherhood. It was started by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiara_Lubich">Chiara Lubich</a>, a teacher from Trent, northern Italy, in 1943. The group was first acknowledged by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_John_XXIII">Pope Paul XIII</a>, “the Good Pope” as the “Work of Mary.” During his period of leadership Paul XIII modernized the church; dialogued with communist nations and Eastern Orthodox churches; increased the number of bishops to 85 and appointed representatives from Africa, Japan and the Philippines. He also called the Second Vatican Council in 1962. Additional approvals were given to Focolare by his successor Pope Paul VI. The movement spread to over 180 countries and now and has over two million practitioners and twenty-five “little towns.” Among them is <a href="https://www.focolare.org/en/focolare-worldwide/america-nord-e-centrale/stati-uniti/">Marianapolis Luminosa</a> in Hyde Park, NY where the <a href="https://www.newcitypress.com/history/">New City Press</a> is based, one of twenty Focolare-affiliated publishers. That press has a new book series out titled <a href="https://www.newcitypress.com/magenta-project">MAGENTA</a> meant to build bridges and address “polarization.”</p>
<p>Focolare embodies “Evangelii Gaudium,” a new era of evangelization by lay people. There is a <a href="https://www.sophiauniversity.org/en/centro-evangelii-gaudium/">center for Evangelii Gaudium</a> at the University Institute Sophia, which became the <a href="https://www.focolare.org/en/download/italiano-scheda-cronologica-della-vita-di-chiara-lubich/">successor</a> to the Abba school in 2007. Lubich created the <a href="https://www.focolare.org/en/works-and-activities/studio-e-formazione/scuola-abba/">Abba School</a> in 1990 with support from The Pontifical Council for the Laity to promote the charism “spiritual gift” of theological unity and “<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/An_Introduction_to_the_Abba_School/xmgHAAAACAAJ?hl=en">cultural potentiality</a>.” The organization maintains an ecumenical outlook with an emphasis on <a href="https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/87978/1/MT70%281%29A3.pdf">Marian devotion</a>.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.focolare.org/en/movimento-dei-focolari/scelte-e-impegno/volontari/">Volunteers of God</a>” organized at a <a href="https://www.focolare.org/en/movimento-dei-focolari/a-people/movimento-parrocchiale/">Parish</a> level take <a href="https://www.focolare.org/en/chi-siamo/">vows</a> of chastity, poverty, and obedience. Since 1963, its base of operations has been <a href="https://www.focolare.org/en/download/italiano-scheda-cronologica-della-vita-di-chiara-lubich/">Rocca di Papa</a> outside Rome. Lubich created three “Gen” programs for youth and then combined them as the “<a href="https://www.focolare.org/en/movimento-dei-focolari/a-people/new-humanity/">New Humanity</a>” in 1966 followed by a “<a href="https://www.focolare.org/famiglienuove/en/">New Families Movemen</a>t” the following year.</p>
<p>While undertaking “solidarity” work in Poland in the late 1970s, Focolare members met in secret with Archbishop Karol Wojtyla who was so impressed with Chiara’s writings that he invited her to meet with him shortly after he became pope. The following except is taken from the <a href="https://www.focolare.org/en/news/2011/05/05/giovanni-paolo-ii-e-i-focolari-in-polonia/">Focolare website</a>:</p>
<p>“Before his election to Pontificate, Karol Wojtyla only knew Chiara through her writings. As soon as he became Pope he wanted to meet her. I was visiting Rome in that period and I received a phone call from the Pope’s secretary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Dziwisz">Stanislaw Dziwisc</a> who I knew very well. He told me that the Holy Father wanted to invite Chiara and I to his mass the next day at 7.</p>
<p>Chiara, <a href="https://www.focolare.org/en/news/2018/11/26/thank-you-eli/">Eli Folonari</a> and I left very early in the morning.As you can imagine we were very excited.&nbsp;When we arrived we saw that the platforms for the Conclave were still in place and so we had to take a longer path to get to the Pope’s apartment. That mass in the Pope’s private chapel is still vivid in my soul. There was such a special atmosphere of recollection, a presence of God. Along with the Pope, Don Stanislaw and the three of us there were only 2 or 3 Polish sisters.</p>
<p>After Mass the Holy Father greeted Chiara. I still remember with what high regard and great love he addressed her.&nbsp;He asked if he could have a map showing the different places where the Movement was present:&nbsp;“So that I can know where to lean on!”&nbsp;he said.&nbsp;It was the beginning of a special friendship,&nbsp;of an ever stronger unity between two people called on by God to do great works, two people to whom God gave two gifts for the Church and for all of humanity”.</p>
<p>The fact that Focolare’s global footprint expanded significantly under the protective wing of Pope John Paul II is notable. During his first decade as pope, the Catholic Church played an influential role in Polish politics as defined by Lech Walesa’s “Solidarity” trade-union social movement. In retrospect, what was portrayed as a grassroots worker movement had the involvement of US interests through the <a href="https://msuweb.montclair.edu/~furrg/furraft82.pdf">AFL-CIO and the CIA</a> as well as clergy whose goals were to advance a nationalist conservatism. In the end, Poland’s economy was opened just in time to be eviscerated by neoliberalism and globalization.</p>
<p>The government repression workers sought to escape simply transformed into capitalist disciplining, <a href="https://monthlyreview.org/product/from_solidarity_to_sellout/">leaving many Poles in poverty</a> during the closing years of the twentieth century. More market shaping for a post-human economic framework where benefit corporations can pretend to care about people while milking them for poverty-compliance data to run the information economy. We now see “solidarity economy” messaging and a focus on platform cooperatives setting the stage for social impact finance, stakeholder capitalism, and cybernetic circular economies. In the May 2020 report below, funded by the (Klaus) Schwab Foundation in partnership with the World Economic Forum, “solidarity economy” was used interchangeably with “social economy” throughout.</p>

<p>I find it very odd that this teacher from a rural area, Chiara Lubich, was catapulted to such prominence after WWII, eventually gaining audiences with religious leaders from around the world including: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Ramsey">Michael Ramsey</a>, Archbishop of Canterbury; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenagoras_I_of_Constantinople">Athenagoras I</a> of Constantinople who helped write the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic%E2%80%93Orthodox_Joint_Declaration_of_1965">Catholic-Orthodox Joint Declaration of 1965</a>; Bishop Klaus Hemmerle, Bishop of Aachen, Germany;&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikky%C5%8D_Niwano">Nikkyo Niwano</a>, founder of the Buddhist lay movement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rissh%C5%8D_K%C5%8Dsei_Kai">Rissho Kosei-kai</a>; and the Supreme Patriarch of Thai Buddhism <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vajira%C3%B1%C4%81%E1%B9%87asa%E1%B9%83vara">Somdet Phra Nyanasamvara.</a> She gave presentations all over the world from the United Nations to the Malcolm X Mosque. At a conference for the 50th anniversary of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Europe">Council of Europe</a> in Strasbourg, France she presented on “A Market-based Society, Democracy, and Solidarity.” They may speak of love, unity, and harmony, but it’s actually about leveraging markets to attain a global heart-mind synthesis those in power believe will lead to a new phase of bio-digital evolution and the emergence of a World Brain.</p>
<p>There are critics. It is said that Focolare adherents are expected to exhibit self-denial and center themselves almost exclusively on the words and ideas of Chiara Lubich. There was <a href="https://www.ncronline.org/news/accountability/french-cases-lead-focolare-promise-investigation-handling-abuse-claims">child sexual abuse</a>. Certain Catholics <a href="http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/7057%26eng%3Dy.html">were also skeptical</a> of the influence of Focolare and other organizations of the Neocatechumenal Way that held sway over John Paul II, though they held Opus Dei above critique. A number of Jesuits have <a href="https://www.catalunyareligio.cat/node/230907/pdf">actively opposed</a> Lubich’s beatification.</p>

 Selling Sacred Economies 
<p>In 1977 <a href="https://www.templeton.org/news/a-force-of-nature-driven-by-god-and-love-remembering-chiara-lubich">Chiara was awarded</a> the Templeton Foundation Prize for Progress in Religion in London, an event attended by Prince Philip. The presentation was made at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guildhall,_London">Guildhall</a>, the ceremonial administrative building for the City of London and its Corporation, which feels significant. John Templeton made his fortune as a contrarian mutual fund investor turned philanthropist who had a keen interest in character education, planned reproduction, free markets, genius, religion, and theoretical physics. He became a <a href="https://www.templeton.org/about/sir-john">UK citizen in the 1980s</a> after moving to Nassau in the Bahamas and was knighted for his charity work by Queen Elizabeth II in 1987. At the close of her <a href="https://www.templetonprize.org/laureate-sub/address-by-chiara-lubich/">acceptance speech</a>, Lubich quoted the Converso Spanish mystic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_the_Cross">John of the Cross,</a> who worked with Teresa of Avila to “reform” the Carmelite order in the late sixteenth century: “<a href="https://carmeliteinstitute.net/the-power-of-love-in-saint-john-of-the-cross/">Where you do not find love, put love and you will find love</a>.” They do seem to know the power of love.</p>

<p>Focolare members gathered in Sao Paulo, Brazil in 1991 to launch the <a href="https://www.edc-online.org/en/30-years-of-edc.html">Economy of Communion</a>, (EOC) a premise that involves private enterprise solving social problems. Business owners, workers, and customers dedicate a portion of their profits to uplift people out of poverty. The effort promotes “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKhiBjTNojHrxo92jVNuAs1HBLajFrqoh">vaccines for all</a>,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9SSOE_yzxk">climate-related investing</a>, and an examination of individual behaviors around people and the planet in a spiritual context.</p>

He’s been an advisor to UN Secretaries General &nbsp;<a title="António Guterres" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant%C3%B3nio_Guterres">António Guterres</a> and General&nbsp;<a title="Ban Ki-moon" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_Ki-moon">Ban Ki-moon</a> on the Sustainable Development Goals and played an advisory role in the <a href="https://www.jeffsachs.org/newspaper-articles/3xyaf9ldw8z6ksm5rty85wl99n74hm">transition of Poland’s economy</a> in the 1980s. Over a thousand corporations have signed onto the Economy of Communion. While their website isn’t all that impressive, the involvement of Fordham and Sachs says something. There’s also a rather strange 2018 paper published in the International Journal of Engineering and Technology sponsored by the Seoul National University of Science and Technology that calls the Economy of Communion “a new ideal economy.” That’s the actual title of the paper and it feels very cybernetic / circular economy / systems engineering. It’s clear how that outlook meshes with the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-council-for-inclusive-capitalism-with-the-vatican-a-new-alliance-of-global-business-leaders-launches-today-301187931.html">Vatican endorsement of Inclusive Capitalism</a> in December 2020 and the mobilization of Catholic investment dollars behind social impact investing.</p>

<p>Elias Crim, the Aleteia author, wrote about EoC in 2014 under the headline “<a href="https://aleteia.org/2014/02/09/economics-as-if-people-mattered/">Economics As If People Mattered</a>.” 2014 was also the year that the <a href="https://www.catholicimpact.org/our-story">Catholic Impact Investing Collaborativ</a>e (CIIC) was established. <a href="https://littlesis.org/person/341540-Patricia_Dinneen">Patricia Dinneen</a>, affiliated with the Boston Archdiocese and lead on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190104033400/https://www.viiconference.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/CRSImpactInvestingAdvisoryCommitteeMK1478FINAL.pdf?fbclid=IwAR20Sevju_bmJbTX62vrt29sPXYHwXt0SjGPAz0itPaPOyDTAqqPVOT5rd8">impact investing for Catholic Relief Services</a>, chairs that organization. Educated at the University of Pennsylvania, the London School of Economics, and MIT, <a href="http://www.globalsolutionssummit.com/uploads/3/1/5/5/31554571/dinneen.pdf">she</a> held positions in international telecommunications, the White House, and RAND before entering into private equity managing emerging markets in BRICs nations and heading the advisory council for the Emerging Markets Private Equity Association. The following is an excerpt from Crim’s article about Focolare and the origins of EoC:</p>
<p>“When Pope John Paul II’s encyclical <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_01051991_centesimus-annus_en.html">Centesimus Annus</a>&nbsp;appeared in 1991,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/business/fr91401.htm">some</a> American observers read it as a break with Church tradition, suggesting it somehow endorsed a particular set of economic arrangements—i.e., those of American-style free market capitalism, also known as neoliberalism. Focolare’s founder, Chiara Lubich, read the document rather differently—perhaps more presciently, in fact. &nbsp;She did not read the Pope as bestowing a blessing on “business as usual.” Instead, she saw him calling for a social economy that was capable of orienting capitalistic society toward the common good rather than individualistic consumerism.</p>
<p>The future pope’s &nbsp;interest in the meeting and in Focolare generally was due to the heightened awareness of this group to the interrelationship between spirituality and socioeconomic life. The Focolare movement’s special charism of unity, one which grew to include an “economy of the gift,” with its values of cooperation, sharing and justice, was extending outward from an initial focus on family life to an influence upon the larger community. This relational economy was indeed a form of capitalism but with a strong emphasis on the human person rather than on a deterministic confidence in an “invisible hand.” <a href="https://aleteia.org/2014/02/09/economics-as-if-people-mattered/">Source</a></p>
<p>Why is Crim so interested in this topic? Well, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elias-crim-08251319a/details/experience/">he’s</a> a Chicago-based writer who is currently founding editor of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ownershipmatters/">Ownership Matters</a>, a bi-weekly newsletter focused on impact investing, racial equity, and the solidarity economy. He previously managed a $2 million US Department of Education Grant for character education in Chicago schools; founded <a href="https://solidarityhall.org/#about">Solidarity Hall</a> a podcast and publisher featuring works on radical Christianity, the New Economy, and localism, and assisted Molly Burhans’s on her <a href="https://good-lands.org/">Good Lands</a> project to map Catholic holdings and make land “work for good,” featured in The New Yorker. Yes, we are supposed to believe a young college student just happened to be staying at a Rome hostel, cold-called Vatican officials, and got the chance to pitch her cartographic database skills. Ah, narrative shaping.</p>
<p>See how the story is used to package free-market exchange as the gift economy or sacred economics? As the age of cybernetic enclosures and programmable finance tightens its grip on refugees, the poor, and those thrown out of work by economic upheaval, propagandists are working overtime to convince us that disruption is merely the opening act for an age of digital abundance – no mention of the ubiquitous surveillance that’s being baked into the transition.</p>

<p>A current example is this duplicity is Yale alumnus, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Eisenstein">Charles Eisentein</a>, author and speaker on Eastern spiritual teachings, indigenous culture, ecology, and the new economy, who recently made common cause with <a href="https://celo.org/about">Celo</a>, a social impact “regenerative finance” company that’s doing the full court press to convince the world that “beautiful money” is the wave of the future.</p>
<p>During the global lockdowns Celo took the opportunity, in partnership with Impact Market, “<a href="https://www.impactmarket.com/">A Decentralized Poverty Alleviation Protocol</a>,” to seed a future customer base for Universal Basic Income. Impact Market is already active in the <a href="https://kotanipay.medium.com/kotani-pay-partners-with-rio-impact-market-to-enable-ubi-payments-to-refugees-in-africa-c9bb85beab36">refugee space</a> in Africa. Celo’s project involved a 30-year old traditional weaving cooperative (yes, cooperative) in the Philippines that became destabilized when the tourist economy was taken out. The program offered members, mostly women with children at home, a small monthly stipend to offset their losses. First, however, they had to obtain smartphones (mostly from their children) and learn the ropes of digital money and Valora wallets.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/valora-fc01">Valora</a> is a peer-to-peer payment system based in San Francisco that completed a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/celo-powered-valora-closes-series-a-funding-becomes-a-standalone-company-as-crypto-mobile-app-gains-traction-301341674.html">$20 million funding round</a> led by blockchain/crypto VC Marc Andreessen.

<p>Celo’s founder and spokesperson is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepandar_Kamvar">Sep Kamva</a>r, the guy who invented Google’s page rank algorithm and, while working as the head of MIT’s Social Computing Group, started a Montessori-inspired pre-k franchise (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbB5na0g_6M">Wildflower</a>) where children had to wear slippers with sensors in them so adults could track their social behaviors and what toys they played with in school. Oh, and there were also artificial vision cameras mounted on the ceiling that fed data to dashboards on each child.</p>
<p>Eisenstein has not responded to repeated Tweets asking him to clarify his relationship with Kamvar and Celo and to explain how the company’s use of his “Sacred Economics” branding is compatible with the heartfelt blog posts he writes about protesting digital futures.</p>
<p>These characters are working all the angles to sell the masses on tokenized cooperatives as a wholesome remedy to the current brutal economic landscape. It’s not. For me it’s a gut-punch to see that so many supporters refuse to look at the facts and hold individuals and institutions whether Catholic, or New Age, or something else accountable for the deceptions they’re so deftly spinning.</p>

 In a Basque Village – Education for Liberation or Impact? 
<p><a href="https://www.mondragon-assembly.com/about-us/">Mondragon gained </a><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25594260">attention in the 1970s</a> as a singular example of the unification of social justice with theology, worker empowerment through education. The firm has grown to include two hundred and eighty companies employing eighty one thousand people in forty one different countries. Its products have moved far beyond sheet metal, paraffin heaters, and office furniture of seventy years ago. Now it specializes in automated production lines for automotive and energy system fabrication. It also advocates <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgWl1NVAKmI&amp;t=7s">circular economy</a> practices.</p>
<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Cooperative-Economies-in-a-Global-Age.pdf">https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Cooperative-Economies-in-a-Global-Age.pdf</a>

<p>Jose Maria Arizmendiarrieta, the Jesuit founder of Mondragon cooperative, was a seminarian during the Spanish Civil War and part of the <a href="http://www.canonizacionarizmendiarrieta.com/en/biografia/">Vitoria Priests’ Movement</a>, guided by the teaching of Spanish Renaissance theologian and jurist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_de_Vitoria">Francisco de Vitoria.</a>&nbsp;His training focused on Catholic social teaching grounded in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rerum_novarum">Rerum Novarum</a>, rights and duties of capital and labor. Dominican Thomist scholar Tommaso Maria Zigliara prepared the encyclical that was issued by Pope Leo XIII in 1891 to address suffering of workers caused by industrialization, a response to rising socialist sentiment that threatened to undermine the influence of church and uplift state power. The document reasserted the importance of private property while laying out responsibilities of employers to provide dignified work suited to each person’s capacity and for labor to refrain from violence and complete their tasks diligently. The Basque priest internalized the ideal of hard work for the collective good being a tool of economic and spiritual liberation. He was taught by his mentor Rufino Aldabalde that the exclusion of God from society through industrialization and secularization had led to the Second World War.</p>
<p>Another influence on Arizmendiarrieta was <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/history/past-prime-ministers/clement-attlee">Clement Atlee</a>, UK Prime Minister and leader of the Labour Party from 1935 to 1955. Atlee was Deputy Prime Minister under Churchill in 1942 and later presided over the partition of India. This was the era in which <a href="https://littlesis.org/person/389080-Michael_Dunlop_Young">Michael Dunlop Young</a>, father of social entrepreneurship in England, shaped the agenda of Labour, including the creation of the National Health Service. This influence led Arizmendiarrieta to endorse the public-private partnership model, which he used in the development of a TB treatment facility and early housing cooperative.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://archive.ph/6OGa6">Source</a>: Atlee and Churchill in 1946 from “Labour Battles Over Its Own History Hoping for 1945 And All That,” Financial Times Op-Ed November 2021</p>
<p>In their 2008 profile, “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Origins-of-Mondragon.pdf">The Origins of Mondragon: Catholic Co-Operativism and Social Movement in a Basque Valley (1941-59)</a>” sociologists Fernando Molina and Antonio Miguez state that Arizmendiarrieta had a desire to create a “new Christian order” where through proper education and training, Basque peasants could be morally transformed while building a “communitarian Christian practice of worker solidarity” that would “give them equal footing with their bosses and break the ruling-class structure.” When he arrived, the town was dealing with the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War, which divided the community. The town’s economy revolved around Union Cerrajera, a sheet metal company. Children of the elite had access to education and apprenticeship programs that enabled those in the network to control managerial jobs, while the rest had few opportunities for advancement.</p>
<p>The priest sought to mobilize the youth through sports and Catholic volunteer programs. He was very successful at shaping public opinion, having refined his skills in narrative crafting while working at a Basque Nationalist newspaper, Eguna, during his seminary years. Arizmendiarrieta targeted young men he felt could be molded to become “redeemers of their class,” and hosted weekly discussions on “private property, capital and labour, social justice, or novel Catholic social theories such as the ‘dual salary’, which sought to divide salaries into a portion for consumption and another for investment.” The priest centered the idea of emancipatory education and dignified work promoted by French Catholic philosophers Jean Leclerq, French Benedictine monk known for writing “T<a href="https://holywisdommonastery.org/the-love-of-learning-and-the-desire-for-god/">he Love of Learning and the Desire for God: A Study of Monastic Culture</a>“ and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Maritain">Jacques Maritain</a> a Thomist who help develop the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. Emphasis was placed on learning in the service of others, which supported the eventual expansion of the Mondragon cooperative model.</p>

<p>With support from local businesses, Arizmendiarrieta launched the Professional School of Mondragon with the goal of “socializing knowledge to democratize power.” Technical education and training has always been a central feature of the Mondragon program, which is important to remember as we consider the place of this model in human capital re-skilling tied to data-driven investments by social entrepreneurs today, not to mention the meta-data captured from online learning that is being leveraged to train our AI replacements.</p>
<p>While the priest had hoped to be able to change the corporate culture of Union Cerrajera from within by training up through subsidization of the education of a cohort of young managers, he was not successful. In 1956, a group broke off and petitioned to create a new Christian company, Ulgor. Their first product line was <a href="http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/dward/classes/powpart/benellomondragon.html">kerosene stoves</a>. The business thrived under <a href="https://www.bbva.com/en/brief-history-bbva-xix-economic-opening-stabilization-plan/">Spain’s Stabilization Plan</a> enacted by Franco in 1959 that backed-off the dictator’s previous efforts at <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Indecent-Proposal_-Exposing-the-1959-Stabilization-Plan-of-Spain.pdf">autarchy</a>, industrial self-sufficiency, and began to liberalize the country’s economy allowing for growth in exports. Over time Mondragon expanded production to include a range of home appliances.</p>
<p>The education component remained central with three interrelated programs that operated in affiliation with the University of the Basque Country for its first four decades. Mondragon University was incorporated as an independent university in 1997. Today it hosts 4,000 students studying engineering, business, entrepreneurship, communication, gastronomy, education, cooperativism, and social innovation. The school partners with ESADE, Spain’s influential Jesuit-affiliated MBA program second only to IESE, the Opus Dei-affiliate. Together ESADE and IESE hold substantial sway over business operations in Spain, maintaining extensive alumni networks that include over a quarter of the board members of the Ibex 35, the index of Spain’s principal stock exchange, with particular representation in the telecommunications sector. ESADE created a <a href="https://www.esade.edu/en/faculty-and-research/research/knowledge-units/center-social-impact">Center for Social Impact</a> in 2017. In 2020 ESADE joined with Comillas Universidad Pontificia and Universidad de Deusto, two other Jesuit institutions, to create <a href="https://www.esade.edu/en/news/comillas-deusto-and-esade-establish-jesuit-advanced-management-school-foundation/24884">a special post-graduate program of study</a> for international management with a focus on helping others through the development of social impact enterprises.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/dward/classes/powpart/benellomondragon.html">credit union</a> was added in 1959, Caja Laboral Popular. Its descendant, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboral_Kutxa">Laboral Kutxa</a>, has 400 offices and is the third largest credit union in Spain. The credit union was vital to business expansion, because each member business would put forty-percent of their after-tax profits into funds for research through the university or solidarity. The remainder, after a ten-percent distribution to charity, was deposited to cover worker pensions. All of the funds held could then be used to offer low-rate loans to support business expansion (<a href="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ap-st01.ext.exlibrisgroup.com/61RMIT_INST/storage/alma/9B/9C/05/D8/D6/36/67/EA/9C/2E/F2/03/EA/2D/4E/6B/Siebel.pdf?response-content-type=application%2Fpdf&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Date=20220703T123632Z&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Expires=119&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAJN6NPMNGJALPPWAQ%2F20220703%2Fap-southeast-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Signature=8206fb733378e743e6bfe0649f1b963ff3e787a991275206d9ea61e3468aeb61">page 122</a>) among members.</p>
<p>Given the amount of funding that is anticipated to run through human capital-related projects Mondragon Corporation could be in a position to channel a lot of money through worker re-skilling at their technical university. The financial infrastructure is already in place, integrated into the program from the beginning, and complements their history of faith-based philanthropy. I think a similar dynamic linking wellbeing metrics and human capital investments could be in play in the United States with plans for public banking.</p>

<p>Ignatius of Loyola (1491-1556), founder of the religious order of the Society of Jesus or Jesuits, was born in Azpeitia. He was the most famous Catholic priest from the Basque region. Pope Francis, of course, <a href="https://www.ncronline.org/news/vatican/understand-pope-francis-look-jesuits">is the first Jesuit pope,</a>&nbsp;one with some skeletons in his closet from <a href="https://archive.ph/hIPT7#selection-753.123-753.144">Argentina’s Dirty Wars</a>.&nbsp;Pope Francis has thus far issued three encyclicals: 1) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelii_gaudium">Evangelii Gaudium</a>, in 2007 that announced a new era of evangelism in which Chapter 4 speaks specifically about care for the weak and poor; 2) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laudato_si%27">Laudato Si</a> in 2015 critiquing consumerism and advancing environmental and climate concerns; and 3) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaudete_et_exsultate">Gaudete et exultate</a>, a universal call to holiness in 2018. The following paragraph is taken from a website promoting the canonization of Arizmendiarrieta, which is consistent with stakeholder capitalism:</p>
<p>“The basis of the Christian endeavour he founded was “a group of young people, who are very good Christians, and I would even go so far as to say they are good apostles”. He wished to fulfill the dictate made by Pope Pious XI in his encyclical “Quadragesimo Anno”. The result, following on from the Professional School, was the creation of ULGOR, the San José cooperative society (which would later become Eroski), the Caja Laboral savings bank and other cooperative enterprises. He considered that “the workers will not believe in the Church’s social doctrine if they cannot see it put into practice through work for society”. And he added “The cooperative formula requires human activity in order to share and implement higher human values, and work, capital and organisation are therefore not its ends in themselves, but means for better serving human interests“. <a href="http://www.canonizacionarizmendiarrieta.com/en/biografia/">Source</a></p>
<p>In the United States, quite a few of the institutions at the forefront of advancing social impact finance, digital governance, and data analytics are affiliated with the Jesuits: <a href="https://www.millersocent.org/">Santa Clara University</a>, <a href="https://www.gonzaga.edu/catalogs/current/undergraduate/school-of-business/course-detail?code=BENT+493">Gonzaga University</a>, <a href="https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/bcnews/nation-world-society/business-and-management/rating-social-performance-reveals-tough-graders.html">Boston College</a>, <a href="https://www.fordham.edu/gabelli-school-of-business/about/social-innovation-at-the-gabelli-school-of-business/">Fordham University</a>, <a href="https://www.luc.edu/baumhartcenter/">Loyola Universit</a>y, and <a href="https://beeckcenter.georgetown.edu/">Georgetown University</a>. In my opinion the <a href="https://library.brown.edu/create/fivecenturiesofchange/chapters/chapter-2/the-jesuits/">Jesuit’s history</a> of mass conversion of colonized people through control of labor for large-scale agricultural projects, standardized education, and enforced faith practices cannot be discounted moving forward. Look to the history of the original people and enslaved Africans that Jesuits used to subjugate the lands of Brazil and their use of <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Jesuit-Engagement-in-Brazil.pdf">aldeias</a>, small villages designed to instill new social norms.</p>
<p>“For the Indians the aldeias meant a new and inhabit living space. The customs as well as the structural layout of the village must have been very strange for the Indios (given their previous living environment). Besides the living conditions, the aldeias created a new identity for the people. The all-encompassing concept ‘Aldeia-Indian’ was created and applied to Indians from different tribes, with different cultures and languages. For the Jesuits the aldeias represented spaces for realizing a utopia which they already formulated in Europe. (Krumpel 1992) The missionary movement was strengthened in the counter-reform to fight Evangelization, so the Jesuits saw in the peoples, who were discovered during the Portuguese expansionist movement, an opportunity to shape Christianity and form a catholic community free from the problems which suffered the church at home in Europe. Because of this plan to create a purer and better Christianity abroad, the Jesuits in Brazil tried to keep a strategic alliance with the Portuguese Crown. Like the priest Antonio Viera said, they dreamed of creating a worldwide realm of Portuguese Catholicism.” <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Jesuit-Engagement-in-Brazil.pdf">Page 7</a></p>
<p>I imagine these are not so different from Focolare towns or charter cities for refugees. The networked built environment will be constructed with encoded social values and used to attempt to transition us from our original biological state to Nicholas Berggruen’s planned transition to holographic life.

<p>The next four posts started out as a single article for the Synthetic Pretenders series; but as I continued to dig and write, the content got a little out of hand. If I were more self-disciplined, I’d probably be able to organize my findings better and perhaps offer up more compact, digestible posts. There’s a lot of background information provided here, so even though I cast a wide net, rest assured it does ultimately connect back to syn-bio eugenics, Berggruen’s Network, and California social impact NGOs joined at hip with defense-tech, global finance, and faith-based institutions.</p>

 Your Government As A Planetary Computer 
<p>When Nicholas Berggruen reestablished himself in Los Angeles in 2010 with an intention to train in philosophy, he sought out two mentors, both <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/06/magazine/nicolas-berggruen-philosophy.html">UCLA professors</a>. One was <a href="https://www.worth.com/the-new-world-of-nicolas-berggren/">Brian Esparza Walker</a>, a researcher in comparative political theory and civic responsibility who has been working on a new book on cybernetics and Confucianism. The other was Brian Copenhaver an expert in the belief in magic in early Modern Europe and the Hermetica. Copenhaver’s 2015 book, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Western-Culture-Antiquity-Enlightenment/dp/110707052X">Magic in Western Culture: From Antiquity to the Enlightenment</a>,” looks quite interesting, but comes with the hefty price tag of academic presses. If you’re interested in getting a sense of what he’s all about, there are a few online talks with Copenhaver <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CkHsu_xX10">here</a> and <a href="https://shwep.net/podcast/brian-copenhaver-on-the-hermetica/">here</a>.</p>

<p>In lieu of payment, the two professors asked Berggruen to become a donor to UCLA. He ended up underwriting research at the Luskin School of Public Affairs on a <a href="https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/gift-from-berggruen-institute-for-research-partnership">good governance index</a> and partnering with the humanities division on a lecture series aptly titled “<a href="https://humanities.ucla.edu/lecture/possible-worlds/">Possible Worlds</a>.” If you read between the lines of the tweets below, you can see how this governance index is infrastructure for outcomes-based contracts aligned to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
<p>Remaking political systems for electronic government is the imperative; not only to ease the collection of data to prove “progress” towards the seventeen goals, but also to build the global data economy which, in turn, fuels machine learning for artificial intelligence. <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal16">UN SDG 16</a> is “strong institutions.” The Governance Index is overseen by <a href="https://luskin.ucla.edu/person/helmut-k-anheier">Helmut Ankeier</a>, a German sociologist specializing in social innovation who splits his time between UCLA and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertie_School">Hertie School</a> in Berlin, one of Europe’s first graduate schools devoted to public policy. The Hertie School promotes e-government <a href="https://www.hertie-school.org/en/digitalgovernance/news/detail/content/centre-for-digital-governance-launch-event-how-can-digital-governance-strategies-drive-sustainability">digitalisation</a> as a means by which to steer behaviors towards “sustainability” through circular economic practice.</p>

<p>A network emerged from the proceedings of Berggruen’s <a href="https://www.berggruen.org/work/the-future-of-democracy/think-long-california/">Think Long California</a> committee, whose scope of work quickly expanded beyond the Eureka state to include international bridge building. In its first few years the Berggruen Institute <a href="https://www.berggruen.org/history/">established relationships</a> with leaders in the EU and sent delegations to work with Chinese officials and industry leaders. A year after “<a href="https://36z59wriv543qd814533ma8z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Blueprint_to_Renew_ca.pdf">The Blueprint to Renew California</a>” went public, Nicholas headed over to Berlin for a European town hall co-hosted with French economist <a href="https://www.berggruen.org/people/jean-pisani-ferry/">Jean Pisani-Ferry</a> and <a href="https://www.berggruen.org/people/jakob-kellenberger/">Jakob Kellenberger</a>, a Swiss diplomat working in the international humanitarian aid space. Both are members of the <a href="https://www.berggruen.org/people/group/the-berggruen-network/">Berggruen Network</a>.</p>
 Disruption, Displacement, and the Solidarity Economy 
<p>At that event, speeches were given by Minnesota native and former Prime Minister of Greece <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Papandreou">George Papandreou;</a> and former UK Prime Minister and <a href="https://research.gold.ac.uk/id/eprint/8051/1/POL_thesis_Somers_2013.pdf">big-data social entrepreneur</a>, Tony Blair. Then George Soros took the opportunity to chastise the greedy creditors that precipitated the Eurozone crisis, decry the refugee situation in Greece, and propose a new era in which <a href="http://www.solidaritynow.org/kentro-allileggiis-athinas/">“solidarity” community centers</a> would be established to manage the masses of people flowing into the debt-crushed country. In 2013 his foundation launched the <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/who-we-are/programs/open-society-initiative-for-europe">Open Society Initiative for Europe</a> to promote “democracy” and “human rights,” with a special focus on refugees. Three years later he pledged $500 million for social impact initiatives targeting displaced people.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to harness the private sector for public good,” Mr. Soros said. “We will invest in startups, established companies, social impact initiatives, and businesses started by migrants and refugees themselves. These investments are intended to be successful. But our primary focus is to create products and services that truly benefit migrants and host communities. I hope my commitment will inspire other investors to pursue the same mission.” <a href="https://www.solidaritynow.org/en/george-soros-why-i-invest-500-million-dollars-for-the-refugees/">Source</a></p>
<p>In the image below, taken from the Berggruen Institute’s website, Nicholas is seated next to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_von_der_Leyen">Ursula von der Leyen.</a> At the time von der Leyen was a CDU (Christian Democratic Union, Center-Right) member of the Bundestag representing Hanover and Minister of Labor and Social Affairs. The year after the Town Hall, Merkel appointed her Minister of Defence. She became President of the European Commission in 2019. Her husband Heiko founded the Hannover Clinical Trial Center GmbH. He specializes in cardiovascular gene therapy and has held leadership positions at several bio-tech firms.</p>

<p>The issue of solidarity seems to be one of growing scholarly interest, which gives me the feeling that social integration of migrants may be being set up as a social impact investing opportunity – not unlike <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/business/columnists/carol-cain/2019/10/26/social-impact-bonds-help-nonprofits-help-others-heres-how/4090113002/">anti-racism</a> and <a href="https://nff.org/report/california-pay-success-final-reflections">racial equity metrics</a> in the US. If you want to read my concerns about equity dashboards, I wrote an open letter to Ibram Kendi about it in the summer of 2019, <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2019/08/31/digital-curriculum-an-answer-to-equity-an-open-letter-to-dr-ibram-x-kendi/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Academics are parsing the differences between offering needy people “charity” and “solidarity,” examining how that distinction plays into the dynamic of EU politics. Seeing that, my first thought is that this is a narrative being spun to position “<a href="https://cps.ceu.edu/sites/cps.ceu.edu/files/attachment/publication/2986/cps-working-paper-migsol-d3.1-2018.pdf">solidarity</a>” as the preferred method of immigrant support, where asylum seekers can be “empowered” to work off their re-skilling and social care costs with impact investments tracked against future economic output. That’s the set up for the <a href="https://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/562020/20201015a.shtml">Career Impact Bonds</a> former Goldman Sachs executive Phil Murphy has been pitching with Social Finance in New Jersey.</p>
<p>The OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) with funding provided from the EU launched the “<a href="https://www.oecd.org/cfe/leed/social-economy/OECD-global-action/">Global Action: Promoting Social and Solidarity Economy Ecosystems</a>” initiative in 2020 to begin to address income inequality exacerbated by Covid lockdowns. Or, to put it another way, the time had come to create the data architecture needed to channel global ESG capital flows through human misery.</p>
<p>The effort is being chaired by Secretary General <a href="https://www.oecd.org/about/oecd-secretary-general-mathias-cormann-biography.htm">Mathias Cormann</a>, a Belgian born and educated politician who was previously affiliated with the German and French-Speaking Christian Social Parties in Europe before he relocated to Western Australia and rose to become Finance Minister with the Liberal Party of Australia. Prior to that he’d been working in the health insurance industry. Cormann, a conservative with a free-market outlook, <a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-oecd-secretary-general-mathias-cormann-before-their-meeting/">met with</a> Secretary of State Antony Blinken last June to discuss the post-Covid recovery; climate change; international tax reform; and management of the risks associated with the digital transformation of the economies of market-based democracies.</p>
<p>The intent is to transform all the so-called solidarity economies, but substantial “education” will be needed. Those <a href="https://www.oecd.org/cfe/leed/Flyer_SSE_Ecosystems.pdf">targeted</a> for the first round hard sell are: Canada, Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, India, the United States and the EU. Canada, Mexico, and Korea comprise three of the ten <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-nations.html">Digital Nations</a>. Peer learning programs and conferences are meant to instill a desire in local leaders to develop the legal frameworks and impact metrics required to scale these planned “social economies.”</p>
<p>In 2021, the OECD developed a working paper, “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Social-Impact-measurement-for-the-Social-and-Solidarity-Economy.pdf">Social Impact Measurement for the Social and Solidarity Economy</a>,” with input from <a href="https://littlesis.org/person/344884-Catherine_Clark_(Cathy_Clark)">Catherine Clark</a> of the CASE Center for Social Entrepreneurship at Duke University; Lisa Hehenberger, management professor at <a href="https://www.esade.edu/faculty/lisa.hehenberger">ESADE</a>; and <a href="https://socialvalueuk.org/staff/j-nicholls/">Jeremy Nicholls</a> a leader in the establishment of social impact metric values in the UK.</p>
<p>The document emphasized the need to shift to outcomes-based reporting tied to procurement and enforcement regulations; addressing the lack of common measurement standards and issues of credibility; opportunities for government and foundations to finance rigorous data collection; and getting buy-in from employees. All of this data will be used to keep capital flowing even as its collection normalizes ubiquitous digital surveillance for surreal simulations run through Taylorist optimization protocols to stave off climate catastrophe and mass social unrest. That’s the story they’ll tell us anyway to justify our dehumanization and the imprisonment of nature through blockchain financialization.</p>

<p>Who knows, they may even fancy it up by positioning contingent laborers as “cooperative” members. Envision pop-up refugee communities, enclosures of dispossession, reframed as a collective businesses where residents are made “token” stakeholders, living under rule of smart contract law with enforced participation metrics for a governance scheme they never wanted to be a part of in the first place.</p>
 Charter Cities as Containment Zones for Remote Refugee Labor? 
<p>My suspicion is part of the plan to manage the transition to the Fourth Industrial Revolution era of automation will be to disrupt social structures across the globe through economic and military interventions; remove people to different locations where they have no support network; and then set up ad-hoc <a href="https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/intervention-report-charter-cities">charter cities</a> where they will be leveraged as human capital commodities and trained to build and defend mixed-reality Internet-of-Everything infrastructure.</p>
<p>Displaced people aren’t to be blamed; no one wants to be forced out of their home and culture. The average length of stay in a UNHCR camp is currently five years under terrible conditions with very limited rights and economic opportunities. Yet issues of asylum tend to center the challenges of meeting the needs of individuals and families balanced against economic and social impacts on host communities, who are often suffering under conditions of austerity themselves, rather than interrogating the systems that led to mass displacement in the first place.</p>
<p>I believe millions of people are being pressured to be on the move, because it serves the interests of power to normalize biometrically-managed social instability as the disruptive potential of Web 3.0 materializes. Last year the Charter Cities Institute prepared a white paper proposing their solution as an improvement over the current horror of refugee camps where families may languish for years. In the introduction, the author Sarah Doyel states that data from the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees indicates the number of displaced people has almost doubled over the past decade from 43 million to 80 million. Each of those people is a potential impact opportunity for global investment portfolios.</p>
<p>Markets in human capital “improvement” are created by trauma resulting from war and the breakdown of civil society. That’s the simple, brutal truth.</p>
<p></p>

<p>CCI pitches their planned communities as a better option to UN-managed camp life, because they would open up settlements to economic activity and thus pools of millions of desperate potential workers (<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/How-Charter-Cities-Can-Create-Better-Refugee-Responses.pdf">page 19</a>). This approach also creates investment opportunities for public private partnerships (P3), which are touted as a way to off-set costs for host countries desiring to stay in compliance with the 1951 Refugee Convention.</p>
<p>Though they speak of P3 investment in terms of local entrepreneurs, the reality is that residents of charter cities will most likely be working on the Web 3.0 build out. It’s not about supporting the creation of one-off mom-and-pop businesses. The excerpt from the CCI paper below brings in language of “the collective” and “cooperatives” with the additional element of female empowerment, since gender equity is UN Sustainable Development Goal 5. What this looks like is tokenized plural voting, NOT what most people understand as participatory democracy.</p>
<p>“Collective ownership and cooperative groups constitute the social and economic parallels to participatory governance in refugee charter cities. Land trusts, housing cooperatives, and what the International Labour Organization calls “Social and Solidarity Economy Enterprises and Organizations” (SSEEOs) create opportunities for refugee ownership and inter- and intra-community social and economic relationships. In partnership with the IKEA Foundation, UNHCR has already implemented livelihood cooperatives across the five Dollo Ado refugee camps in Ethiopia that seem to be popular among both refugees and host populations. Charter cities can also build on existing collective structures in local communities, which can be especially helpful for women refugees who face higher barriers to economic activity. For example, Dr. Holly Ritchie, founder of the refugee women’s empowerment social enterprise THRIVE for Change, pointed out that mutual aid networks have been particularly important for refugee women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, there is a strong need from both a normative and an empirical perspective to center refugee voices in the design of governance, business practices, programs, and institutions.” <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/How-Charter-Cities-Can-Create-Better-Refugee-Responses.pdf">Pages 22-23</a></p>
<p>The policy paper closes out with a call for accurate measurement and evaluation – for the impact markets.</p>
 Blockchain Collectivism and the Mormon Transhumanist Association Conference 
<p>Below is a clip from the blockchain-themed March 2022 <a href="https://www.mtaconf.org/">Mormon Transhumanist Conference</a> in which I ask <a href="https://chartercitiesinstitute.org/people/kurtis-lockhart-2/">Kurtis Lockhart</a>, head of research for the Charter Cities Institute (CCI), how he reconciles the use of digital identity and sensor networks to track behaviors within smart urban environments with his advocacy for high-tech communities managed through public-private partnerships. How will the concept he’s promoting avoid the creation of DAO “company” towns run on behavioral scrip? I mention that Foshan in China has been using blockchain to track the behaviors of individuals across the city, a topic I wrote about <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2020/01/06/prison-reform-to-incarcerate-the-world-smart-justice-global-finance/">here</a>. The model Mr. Lockhart envisioned for scaling charter city development was China’s complex network of Special Economic Zones.</p>

<p>The charter city idea was expanded upon later that day by Tom W. Bell, faculty of Chapman University’s Fowler School of Law advising on special jurisdictions, who logged in from <a href="https://prospera.hn/#:~:text=A%20Platform%20for,Sustainable%20Growth.&amp;text=Pr%C3%B3spera%20is%20partnered%20with%20Honduras,About%20the%20Pr%C3%B3spera%20Platform">Prospera</a>, the West’s first charter city billed as a “platform for sustainable development” on the Honduran island of Roatan. Bell’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyS9TKikW0M">talk</a> was on <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3605807">U-Lex standardized blockchain legal systems</a> – perfect for “sustainable,” automated cities of well-managed human capital.</p>
<p>Vinay Gupta of Mattereum (<a href="http://internetofagreements.com/">Internet of Agreements</a>) who describes himself as a “<a href="https://cryptoanarchy.wiki/people/vinay-gupta">humanitarian turned technocra</a>t” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yJi2uRf29A">presented</a> remotely on fair trade as spiritual liberation. At the end of the day, a young Lisbon-based scholar <a href="https://bernardovicente.substack.com/p/a-case-for-harbergeorgist-economics">Bernardo Vicente</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd1_rUaUtjk">presented</a> on the application of Harbergeorgist principles, novel forms of property ownership, to governance in “sustainable” crypto cities. Various interest groups are working diligently to get all the parts up and running, but I sense it will take more manufactured disruption before things start to scale. I’d definitely keep my eyes on Ukraine being used as a case study for a decentralized, digital systems-engineered society.</p>
 Paul Romer’s Vision Opens the Door to “Sustainable” ESG Finance 
<p>NYU and former World Bank economist Paul Romer’s vision for geo-fenced, state-of-exception towns fell out of favor after an <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GHOST-TOWNS-CHALLENGES-FACING-THE-CHARTER-CITIES-PROJECT-IN-HONDURAS.pdf">unsuccessful campaign in Honduras</a>, but seems to be making a slow comeback. A former Russian energy lawyer doing consulting for the state of Vermont, <a href="https://www.mtu.edu/social-sciences/department/faculty/sidortsov/">Roman Sidortsov</a>, prepared a paper, “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sustainable-CharterCities-the-Development-Solution-to-Environmental-Problems.pdf">Sustainable Charter Cities: The Development Solution to Environmental Problems</a>,” as a Global Fellow at the University of Vermont Law School back in 2011.</p>
<p>Sidortsov began his paper describing how he and his wife were inspired to create a humanitarian NGO after listening to a National Public Radio program about women and children brutalized at the Chad-Sudan border. He then pitched charter cities as an effective “solution” to human misery that would also meet the needs of ESG impact finance portfolios. To Sidortsov’s way of thinking, charter city investments would generate profit, unlike traditional humanitarian assistance. According to his Michigan Tech bio, Sidortsov teaches courses in alternative energy and climate policy. It defies logic that he would embrace Romer’s proposal, which entails building enormous cities the size and density of Hong Kong from scratch in developing nations on uninhabited tracts of coastline. Strange indeed.</p>
<p>The Charter Cities Institute has been collaborating with the United Nations on “sustainable” global development per a <a href="https://chartercitiesinstitute.org/interviews/q-a-charter-cities-institute-united-nations-conference-on-trade-and-development-unctad/">2019 webinar</a> with Richard Bolwijn, head investment researcher with UNCTAD. The image below is taken from the <a href="https://www.iom.int/migration-sustainable-development-and-2030-agenda">website</a> of the UN-affiliated International Organization for Migration and links migration to the achievement of Agenda 2030.</p>
<p>It is important that we recognize displaced people as victims of the planned transition to an automated, surveillance data economy, one that will center remote work. No amount of border control can mitigate erosion of wages once blockchain skill lockers and haptic-robotic / telepresence labor become acceptable. Each of the squares below represents an opportunity for billionaires to use technological systems to process other humans, including children, as digital commodities. Every heading is an intentionally unattainable goal meant to keep the masses on treadmills (pathways) of prescribed self-improvement optimized for machine-learning data harvest. Immigrants are not the threat; BlackRock’s ESG portfolios are.</p>

<p>An example of immigrants being targeted for “pay for success” finance is the <a href="https://missioninvestors.org/resources/pay-success-action-massachusetts-pathways-economic-advancement">Massachusetts Pathways to Economic Advancement</a> piloted by JEVS (Jewish Vocational Service) in 2018 in partnership with <a href="https://www.maycombcapital.com/the-community-outcomes-fund/">Maycomb Capital’s</a> Community Outcomes Fund, <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/332796-Community_Outcomes_Fund">Prudential Financial</a>, and the <a href="https://kresge.org/news-views/kresge-invests-in-massachusetts-pathways-to-economic-advancement-project/">Kresge Foundation</a>. Digital identity is a way to profile and cream compliant immigrant labor. It is easy to see how such programs could be incorporated into charter cities where people may have to earn release into the general population through demonstrations of social impact compliance over time.</p>
<p>The idea is that purpose-built communities would be open to anyone who agrees to opt-in. They would be run by private managers and embrace Romer’s New Economic Theory of technological innovation guided by Meta-Rules. Of course the presumption that all people actually have a free choice in the matter is disingenuous. In a 2010 <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/article/charter-cities-qa-paul-romer">interview</a> with the Center for Global Development, Romer laid out a variety of scenarios, including the use of Charter Cities as immigrant containment zones:</p>
<p>“Brazil could be the guarantor and the host, but Haiti could be the source. Brazil has already made a major commitment to providing security for Haitians in Haiti. They are the main supplier of troops and police officers in the force that entered Haiti under a UN mandate in 2004. To have a credible exit option, Brazil might consider chartering a new city on empty land in its territory that could accept Haitians as residents of the new zone, while maintaining standard immigration procedures for the rest of Brazil.</p>
<p>This could give Brazilian forces in Haiti a way to leave even if there is little progress toward stable governance. Brazilian leaders might say to the Haitian elites “we’ll spend several years trying to help you return your government to the point where it can provide essential state services like public safety. But if by then it still can’t serve this function, and things go back to where they were before we came, back to a situation where crimes like kidnapping were common and the police couldn’t enter zones controlled by gangs, we will leave. But if we leave we will also give Haitians the option to move to a special zone in Brazil where we will provide the basics of good governance.”</p>
<p>The charter cities model involves up to three parties – the host nation that provides the land; the source nation that provides the people; and the guarantor nation that enforces the charter. From the passage above one can imagine where <a href="https://peacekeeping.un.org/en">United Nations’ Peacekeeping</a> fits in. Once installed in new settlements, displaced people would become impact commodities, suitable for training as gig-economy remote workers. That makes sense given the push by <a href="https://www.unicef.org/innovation/XR">UNICEF Innovation</a> to “educate” children of the global south through VR headsets and condition them for a future of tele-robotic labor. There are already many coding boot camps that target refugees and immigrants for training into low-skill, task rabbit work in the tech sector including: <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/refugees-get-free-training-tech-careers-pilot-program-launched-coding-dojo-partners/">Coding Dojo</a>, <a href="https://devmountain.com/blog/iraqi-refugee-finds-new-life-coding-bootcamp/">DevMountain</a>, <a href="https://refcode.org/pages/index.html">RefCode</a>, and <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/jordan/unhcr-partners-chams-and-na-amal-launch-two-new-coding-bootcamps-support-dignified">Na’Amal</a>.</p>
 Something Rotten In The State of Denmark 
<p>In a June 2021 Charter Cities Initiative <a href="https://chartercitiesinstitute.org/podcast/charter-cities-podcast-episode-30-how-displaced-people-can-build-economies-with-alexander-betts/">podcast,</a> the Jordan Compact and the economic upside of locating refugees in special economic zones is explored. While Denmark has taken an i<a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2021/06/denmarks-immigrants-forced-out-government-policies">ncreasingly hostile position</a> towards asylum seekers in recent years; we see developments like <a href="https://archive.ph/ghPYD">the tunnel project in Lolland</a> that rely on immigrant labor. With advances in <a href="https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/Words%20and%20Concepts%20Front%20Page/Shared/Biometric">biometric identity</a>, satellite surveillance, and geo-fencing, could charter cities become twenty-first century “pop-up” labor camps where people enter a country conditionally – borders within borders? Remote compounds like <a href="https://archive.ph/CbWpO">Lindholm Island</a> would no longer be needed.</p>
<p></p>

<p>The hard line taken with refugees in Denmark contrasts starkly with a <a href="https://www.icvanetwork.org/uploads/2021/07/JDC-Background-Note-September-2019.pdf">2018 Memorandum of Agreement</a> to establish a Joint Data Center on Forced Displacement in Copenhagen’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_City">UN City</a>. The United Nations and the World Bank have teamed up to gather “evidence” on “what works” in the management of global misery, styling the effort as a “<a href="https://www.jointdatacenter.org/who-we-are/#structure">global public good</a>.” The University of Copenhagen hosts the <a href="https://amis.ku.dk/about/">Centre for Advanced Migration Studies</a>, established in 2013, and the <a href="https://drc.ngo/about-us/who-we-are/drc-s-history/">Danish Refugee Council</a>, Denmark’s largest NGO established in 1956, holds the world’s largest migrant dataset. That data is being used to explore <a href="https://admigov.eu/home">Alternative Migration Governance Models</a> (ADMIGOV) aligned to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This is about managing humans for impact markets.</p>
<p>Martin Lemberg-Pedersen and Eman Haioty’s 2020 article “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Re-assembling-the-surveillable-refugee-body-in-the-era-of-data-craving.pdf">Re-assembling the Surveillable Refugee Body in the Era of Data-Craving</a>” does a solid job of laying out how the process of digitally-managing millions of dislocated people have supported the development of global data economies and the emergence of disruptive financial “solutions” like programmable money. The latter seeks to supplant informal economies and reframe “othered” people as dynamic “risk” scores, though the narrative spun in a 2018 article in <a href="https://archive.ph/prz3L">MIT Technology Review</a> is that intense blockchain data aggregation should be seen as empowering for those looking to make a new start. Every displaced person is a credit score waiting to be compiled and rated.</p>
<p>“The act of biometric enrollment can be seen as requiring refugees to perform certain acts and roles to obtain the associated entitlements. Performing docility is key to the assembling and re-assembling of webs of rights, duties and consumption opportunities. This can be perceived as a form of quasi-coerced alliance, defined as when one or more actors involved in a transaction are either forced to abide by the rules of a transaction or are otherwise placed in a position in which rejecting a transaction can incur a loss beyond the scope of the rejected proposition.” Page 4</p>
<p>“Refugee acts of quasi-citizenship are increasingly determined by intersecting and blurred markets involving actors like the UNHCR, the EU, the World Bank Group, IrisGuard, Accenture and the Cairo Amman Bank. These markets are characterized by a pervasive craving for data about displaced populations as risky others. The identities of the displaced and dataveilled are thus re-assembled according to their aid needs, but also according to donor dictates concerned with risk management, and technological and financial market opportunities.” Page 15</p>
<p>This quasi-citizenship is evocative of the plot of a science-fiction novel. Cory Doctorow’s novella “Unauthorized Bread” in “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbdgdH8ksaM">Radicalized”</a> comes to mind. Unfortunately, <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/pais/people/lemberg-pedersen/">Lemberg-Pederson</a> (Amnesty International) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emanhaioty/">Haioty</a> (IT University of Copenhagen) stop short of linking manufactured dispossession to the cultivation of social impact investment opportunities. The networks are vast, and hiding in plain sight as illustrated in a map I made a few years back of the Massachusetts Pathways to Economic Advancement Project. It links <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/77316-Jobs_for_the_Future">Jobs for the Future</a> re-skilling; financialized income sharing agreements through <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/350838-edly_Income_Sharing_Agreement_Marketplace">Edly</a>; <a href="https://littlesis.org/person/155465-Jonathan_Greenblatt">Jonathan Greenblatt</a>, Obama’s impact finance guy now head of ADL; and Bloomberg Philanthropies with its <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/363995-Hazira">Hazira</a> “what works” smart city government pilots in Israel where the start-up nation is pivoting to be a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LQ1xY2G2GQ">Tikkun Olam</a> <a href="https://socialimpactil.com/hows-the-impact-nation-transition-going-part-1/">impact nation</a>. Where impact data is the new gold, migrants will deliver as soon as blockchain ID has been fully implemented for supply train traceability.</p>

<p>We see glimmers of Doctorow’s dystopian future in Jeffrey Berns’s plans for <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/nevada-asks-can-blockchain-build-a-smarter-city-2446146">Painted Rock Smart City and Innovation Park</a>, a privately-managed blockchain community in Nevada, and Bill Gates’s acquisition of <a href="https://www.globest.com/2020/03/05/an-update-on-bill-gates-new-smart-city-in-arizona/?slreturn=20220603163851">24,000 acres</a> west of Phoenix for a smart city near Buckeye. The Charter Cities Institute weighed in over the Fourth of July Weekend in 2020 <a href="https://chartercitiesinstitute.org/blog-posts/charter-cities-and-america/">making a case</a> for privately managed communities being compatible with the United States’s legacy of “good governance,” likening the model to the Mayflower Compact and the First Charter of Virginia.</p>
<p>The poor reception of Alphabet’s Sidewalk Labs’s <a href="https://www.triplepundit.com/story/2020/sidewalk-labs-failure-smart-cities/120616">Toronto Quayside project</a> gives me hope that there may still be some clear-thinking people in the world. While most of the criticism leveled at that smart neighborhood revolved around data privacy rights, I continue to hope that one day soon people will start to understand that human capital finance is what’s actually driving the demand for big-data ubiquitous computing.</p>

 The Learning Economy As A Digital Public Good 
<p>Deployment of educational technologies is being pushed to gather data for human capital finance deals and machine learning. One of the systems being prototyped is <a href="https://www.unicef.org/innovation/stories/imisi-3d-providing-locally-tailored-interactive-content-using-vr-transform-education">IMISI</a>, an interface where pre-literate children learn to code by <a href="https://www.unicef.org/innovation/stories/imisi-3d-providing-locally-tailored-interactive-content-using-vr-transform-education">hand gesture</a>. UNICEF believes children in Africa are never going to merit human teachers. Besides the continent’s substantial youth population is too important to leave as an unrealized dataset.</p>
<p>Much of the software being promoted by UNICEF is open-source and pitched as helping create “digital public goods.” UNICEF is a member of the <a href="https://www.unicef.org/innovation/hiring-digital-public-goods">Digital Public Goods Alliance</a>. This framing is important, because the new economic model is driven by data. Tokenized data will be used as the primary governance mechanism of smart contract mixed reality as society acquiesces to cybernetic control.</p>
<p>The “commons” should be understood as an encoded cyber-physical system, not some shared pasture, cultural tradition, or civic space. The narrative frame that is being crafted is that the Metaverse is “open,” that it is being created with “open source” software for “sovereign” digital citizens, so it must be good, right? In fact, in this Alice-in-Wonderland world, everything is inverted. When you see “open,” read “restricted.” When you see “commons,” read “enclosures.” When you see “decentralized,” read “centralized.” Once you understand the game is enmeshing everything natural in a synthetic sensing web, the intent is easier to assess.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/who-we-are/">Source</a>: Digital Public Goods Alliance</p>
<p>Investments in these so-called public goods will become quite important in the future. We already see the infrastructure being put in place to track “public benefit” contributions over space and time in David Dalrymple’s presentation for Protocol Labs on Hypercerts below.</p>
<p>Dalrymple worked on the creation of virtual organisms with Ed Boyden’s <a href="https://syntheticneurobiology.org/people/display/144/Alumni%20-%20Visiting%20Scientists%20and%20Affiliates">Synthetic Neurobiology Group</a> at MIT and secured private funding for his research from Peter Thiel and Larry Page. My sense is that what they are doing is attempting to organize information, including biophysical and biogeochemical data, to catalyze “life/automata” using artificial neural nets, gamified IoT environments, and “moralized” market logic. The Hypercerts presented here would be part of the latter. Perhaps they imagine bio-digital convergence as a form of <a href="https://voegelinview.com/evolution-2-0-by-perry-marshall/">symbiogenesis</a>? It’s difficult to imagine what might be going on in their minds beyond the goal of a seamless human-computer interface.&nbsp; Ed-tech is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MnbY8g_Iq4">testbed</a>.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><a href="https://research.protocol.ai/authors/david-dalrymple/">Source</a>: David Dalrymple Biography at Protocol Labs</p>
<p>They need ways to tag programs to track progress and claim “credit” for future well being. Hypercerts are one way to assess which of the various contributors have responsibility for a communal benefit and to what degree. Coming from a space as an activist parent who opposed the data-mining of children through educational technologies, I see that screenshot as representing many programs and interventions foisted on a child as digital society tracks their performance and future economic productivity. Sort of a cross between Los Angeles’s Daily Pass Digital ID, <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/164710-Clever">Clever’s QR codes</a>, and Soulbound Token meta-data tags.</p>
<p>Children are quantified as “public goods” and subject to optimization by technological systems. The application of “evidence-based” scientific management of children toward pre-determined outcomes on pathways will be justified through the language of “equity.” The data analysts, program managers, and investors may attempt to convince themselves that this is benevolent, but it isn’t. You can see in the image below the treacherous fiction being peddled by UNICEF, Disney, and the Finance Ministries of Denmark and Finland.</p>
<p></p>

<p>This training will not only be imposed on children. The new economy is a so-called “<a href="https://littlesis.org/org/409805-Learning_Economy_Foundation">learning economy</a>” on blockchain. Refugees are targeted for perpetual data-mining through the United Nations High Council on Refugees and allied promoters of competency-based education.</p>
<p>Paul LeBlanc at Southern New Hampshire University, home of one of the largest distance learning programs in the US, piloted <a href="https://www.snhu.edu/about-us/newsroom/stem/blockchain-securing-school-records">early blockchain transcripts</a> with MIT’s spin off Learning Machine and partnered with <a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/snhu-receives-dollar1m-grant-from-google-to-design-soft-skill-assessment-platform/20055568">Google</a> on development of systems to track and log soft skills among enrolled students. I discuss these initiatives in <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/08/13/edu-blocks-arrive-in-new-hampshire/">this post</a>.</p>
<p>SNHU’s <a href="https://gem.snhu.edu/about-gem/">GEM</a> (Global Education Movement) mastery-based degree program was initiated in 2017 in refugee camps in Lebanon and Africa. The UNHCR’s also manages a “Connected Learning In Crisis” program of badge-based education for refugees, which is affiliated with several Catholic and Jesuit institutions. All of this needs to be viewed as a mining operation where children and adults from dislocated communities are literally plugged in to generate data flows that accrue to their biometric ID, establishing their digital reputation with the understanding that one day they may be released back into the real world.</p>

 The New Economic Model Is Shared Surveillance Branded as a “Data Commons” 
<p>The intent of manufactured communities like charter cities is ostensibly to improve economic productivity and well-being while reducing poverty. In the clip below from 2013, George Soros talks about his <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/06/13/the-chicago-school-of-economics-and-george-soros-new-theories-for-an-impoverished-world/">Institute for New Economic Thinking</a>, which spent the past decade funding experts in the academy, paying them to conceptualize a new game of global economics to be built on cybernetic social impact finance and closing wealth gaps. The project lead is <a href="https://archive.ph/xL2Mf">Lord Adair Turner</a>, former head of the UK Financial Services Authority, who managed the aftermath of the 2008 global banking crisis in England.</p>

<p>Paul Romer won the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2018/romer/facts/">2018 Nobel Prize</a> in economics when he was teaching at the NYU Stern Business School. NYU is a major player in data-driven “what works” government through the <a href="https://thegovlab.com/about.html">GovLab</a> based out of the Tandon School of Engineering. It is this government policy infrastructure that will pave the way for the “new economic thinking” described above. The prize was for Romer’s work in <a href="https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/97956/#:~:text=Romer's%20theory%20of%20endogenous%20technological,goods%20and%20services%20more%20productive.">endogenous growth theory</a> that states growth is best achieved through investment in people that will generate innovative ideas and new technologies. Human capital management is a core element of this proposal. Romer noted that he sought input from James Heckman.</p>
<p>Although I don’t fully understand it yet, the concept of “non-rival goods” that Romer proposes feels important. This is a paper he wrote on “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131228135644/https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~promer/Endogenous.pdf">Endogenous Technological Change</a>” in 1990 for the Journal of Political Economy. Feel free to look it over and drop your thoughts in the comments. My sense is that this conceptual framework would be applicable to open source software (Linux in a major player in digital ID), the so-called “open” Metaverse (<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/?ncid=pa-srch-goog-721691&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw_ISWBhBkEiwAdqxb9nrZqOYHc6lSnkF-TENFu5xJafmySjuT_vREOYw5mse8c_1mpDecxBoCixsQAvD_BwE#cid=ov01_pa-srch-goog_en-us">NVIDIA</a> and <a href="https://cesium.com/platform/cesiumjs/">Cesium</a>), and digital public goods (<a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/governance/">Norway</a>) meant to open low and middle countries up to the global data economy – economic liberalization for the Web 3.0 era.</p>
<p>As I’ve mentioned often, the growth imperative of capitalism demands creation of a digital empire before the Ponzi scheme falls apart. That empire will be made up of ideas and information. Those who aspire to be the next imperial rulers need for us to submit and build it for them. Unlike the colonial era in which lands lay on the horizon for the taking by force and trickery, this new world, the mixed-reality smart contract world, must first be made manifest through the organization of innumerable bits and bytes.</p>
<p>The pillow talk being deployed to get us to walk over to the edge of the Metaverse pit trap is that we’ll be creators, peers, members of a collective working in unity to enhance the Metaverse commons. When the harsh reality is that their plan is to use our naivete and need for belonging to turn us into piles of Soulbound Tokenized meta-data for a poker game run by techno-fascist billionaires and AI supercomputers. You see the way the story is being spun in this excerpt from P2P Foundation founder and former Belgian telecom executive Michel Bauwens 2007 “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150701092856/http://p2pfoundation.net/P2P_Theory">Key Theses on P2P Politics</a>, which just happens to be eerily similar to <a href="https://www.radicalxchange.org/">RadicalXChange’s</a> plans for plural property, plural money, plural voting, and plural funding.</p>
<p>“Our current world system is marked by a profoundly counterproductive logic of social organization:</p>
<p>a) It is based on a false concept of abundance in the limited material world; it has created a system based on infinite growth, within the confines of finite resources.</p>
<p>b) It is based on a false concept of scarcity in the infinite immaterial world (that’s mixed-reality / the Metaverse); instead of allowing continuous experimental social innovation, it purposely erects legal and technical barriers to disallow free cooperation through copyright, patents, etc.</p>
<p>Therefore, the number one priority for a sustainable civilization is overturning these principles into their opposite.</p>
<p>a) We need to base our physical economy on a recognition of the finitude of natural resources (circular economy), and achieve a sustainable steady-state economy (cybernetic homeostasis).</p>
<p>b) We need to facilitate free and creative cooperation and lower the barriers to such exchange by reforming the copyright and other restrictive regimes (free markets in data).</p>
<p>Hierarchy, markets, and even democracy are means to allocate scarce resources through authority, pricing, and negotiation; they are not necessary in the realm of the creation and free exchange of immaterial value, which will be marked by bottom-up forms of peer governance.</p>
<p>Markets, as means to manage scarce physical resources, are but one of the means to achieve such allocation (tokenization as alternative), and need to be divorced from the idea of capitalism, which is a system of infinite growth.</p>
<p>The creation of immaterial value (data economy / information economy / knowledge economy), which again needs to become dominant in a post-material world which recognized the finiteness of the material world, will be characterized by the further emergence of non-reciprocal peer production.</p>
<p>Peer production is a more productive system for producing immaterial value than the for-profit mode (peer to peer makes social relations visible to AI through tokenized transactions), and in cases of the asymmetric competition between for-profit companies and for-benefit institutions and communities, the latter will tend to emerge.</p>
<p>Peer production produces more social happiness (well-being metrics for pay for success finance and to train cyber-physical systems how to be more “human”), because 1) it is based on the highest form of individual motivation, nl. intrinsic positive motivation; 2) it is based on the highest form of collective cooperation, nl. synergistic cooperation characterized by four wins (the participants x2, the community, the universal system).”</p>

<p>I haven’t had a chance to do more than skim it, but Nicholas Negroponte’s 1995 “<a href="http://governance40.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Nicholas-Negroponte-Being-Digital-Vintage-1996.pdf">Being Digital</a>” appears to be a very accessible entry point into the physics of the information economy. Thanks Sebs for bringing it to my attention in <a href="https://gnomes4truth.medium.com/goldman-sachs-brics-alternative-world-scenarios-b203957d3580">your recent post</a> about BRICs.</p>
<p>The planned future revolves around a knowledge economy, which is swiftly morphing into a data economy, which in turn rests on social impact finance, perpetual re-skilling to compete against AI, and health surveillance that legitimizes coerced bodily intake of the torrent of synthetic-biological “knowledge” churned out by thousands of biotech ventures. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/endogenousgrowththeory.asp">Romer’s theory of growth</a> promotes investment in education, healthcare, and telecommunications, which on the surface sounds good. What they don’t say is that measuring returns on these investments will require the invasive use of Internet of Bodies wearables and biometric identity linked to your education and health records.</p>
<p>While teaching at Stanford, Romer developed an online homework assignment platform, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplia">Aplia</a>, bought out by Cengage in 2007. So, he practices what he preaches. Ed-tech is an enormous area for investment as evidenced by BlackRock’s recent launch of a new entertainment/education-themed ETF (exchange traded fund) called <a href="https://www.etfstream.com/news/blackrock-launches-digital-entertainment-and-education-etf/">PLAY</a> that tracks stocks in the ed-tech, gaming, and digital device sectors. This new global economy of “ideas,” seems to be apps and games, while the future of “work” is navigating games under digital surveillance. I’m sure it sounded better to Romer back in the early 1980s when he was writing his <a href="http://dxie.people.ust.hk/OnlineMacro/romerjpe1986.pdf">dissertation</a>. I imagine his outlook is closely aligned with the tenets of the United Nations and <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/edutech/brief/blockchain-for-education-community">World Bank-affiliated</a> <a href="https://id2020.medium.com/id2020-welcomes-learning-economy-foundation-as-newest-alliance-partner-a7e92054e8bb">Learning Economy Foundation</a>. Learning Economy joined the UN’s ID2020 program six months after Romer stepped down from his position of chief economist at the World Bank.</p>

<p>Charter cities, built from the ground up with smart infrastructure, will become glorified Skinner boxes. Sidortsov also thought it would be useful for UN Peacekeeping Forces to get involved setting up these new settlements, because if international energy firms can own large tracts of land in developing nations, why not the United Nations? It’s such an honorable project, who could possibly refuse?</p>
<p>“As I noted above, Romer is currently trying to persuade leaders of developing countries to invest into charter cities. However, his idea should be appealing to a much broader audience. Charter cities present a rare “triple dividend” solution of environmental, sociopolitical, and economic problems. This makes charter cities a primary goal for international aid funds of various flags and colors. For example, refugee camps provide a temporary yet critical solution of humanitarian crisis. However, they depend on international aid and do not provide a permanent solution, whereas charter cities do. On the climate change front, a charter city can be a perfect candidate for a carbon offset project and can be funded through the newly established Green Climate Fund. Finally, because a charter city creates a mechanism for sustainable economic growth, it should be a primary target for economic aid. Overall, investments in charter cities are a much more effective and productive way to distribute $120 billion that developed countries spend on international aid.</p>
<p>Charter cities present a unique opportunity as a test bed for the “new economy” ideas reflected in the works of several authors. Free of public pressure, the governing body can internalize environmental costs by shifting tax burden from payrolls to carbon and other pollutants. As the German energy tax experience shows, such a shift spurs “green” economic growth and innovation. Because a charter city or village will be planned completely or almost completely from scratch, “smart” urban design and permaculture principles will be utilized. Finally, sustainable charter cities can serve as hubs for new business organization forms such as for-benefit-corporations.” <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sustainable-CharterCities-the-Development-Solution-to-Environmental-Problems.pdf">Source</a></p>
<p>Sidortsov then goes on to say that while some worry cities run on public-private partnerships risk subsuming the public sector entirely, we shouldn’t be concerned, because there are models like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation">Mondragon</a> in the Basque region of Spain that generate strong economic growth.

<p>A challenge all web3 developers need to address when building applications is where the data is&nbsp;stored.</p><p>Historically, most web3 developers have chosen to use either blockchain storage or <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> and sometimes resort to traditional centralized database (eg MongoDB, Postgres) for some types of data. Verida provides a decentralized replacement for those traditional databases, and a better option for some of the things developers are currently using blockchain storage or IPFS&nbsp;for.</p> Choosing data&nbsp;storage <p>In the flowchart below we show some of the key decisions a developer must make when choosing&nbsp;storage.</p><p>Firstly, look at your data and decide if it is structured or unstructured. Examples of structured data include data that you would keep in a spreadsheet, a JSON or XML file or a Notion database. Unstructured data includes images, movies or other multimedia.</p><p>Secondly, is your data public or private? By public we mean it can be accessed without access control mechanisms. Note that encryption on its own is not an access control mechanism because access cannot be revoked if a key&nbsp;leaks.</p><p>Finally, do you need to update or delete data? Be careful here — some storage systems implement deletion as the removal of a reference to data that is stored elsewhere. In these cases the data is still there and anyone who recorded that reference can easily access it. Both deletion and updates should be implemented in such a way that all copies of the data are irrevocably modified.</p>Data choice flowchart Limitations of Current Web3 Data Storage Solutions <p>Blockchain storage is the first type of storage most web3 developers use. However, it doesn’t take long to realize this is best suited for very specific types of data such as links to external data like NFTs. The nature of a blockchain makes it expensive and inefficient to store more than small amounts of data and the immutable, public nature of the data means it is unsuitable for many applications.</p><p>Many developers discover these limitations and switch to using IPFS. IPFS is a globally accessible content addressable file storage network, where files are referenced by the hash of their content. This makes it very well suited to “flat file” type storage, and it has had great success as storage for NFT images. In broad terms IPFS is used in a similar way to how AWS S3 is used in Web2 development — to make files available to people and applications.</p><p>The next limitation Web3 developers find is around private data and managing access permissions to that data. Users want self-sovereignty over personal data so they can control their own information. How do you store things like a user’s interests or even things like health information in a way that doesn’t make it publicly available to anyone for data mining or identity&nbsp;theft?</p><p>Many developers resort to trying to encrypt data and store it either on-chain or in encrypted files on IPFS. There are a number of serious problems with&nbsp;this:</p>  Most developers are not cryptographers and often make mistakes in how they implement their encryption, putting user data at&nbsp;risk.  Both blockchains and IPFS are immutable storage systems, meaning that any mistake either in implementation or by a user accidently leaking an encryption key means their data is globally public forever with no way to fix&nbsp;it.  The lack of a proper query mechanism leads to badly performing apps. Either applications load large files into memory and developers find data inside them or there are many small files each of which must be requested each time it is&nbsp;needed.  Updates and deletes are implemented by copying all data to a new version of the file and resaving it. This is both expensive and&nbsp;slow.  No control over the physical storage location of data which is often important for legal or policy&nbsp;reasons.  <p>Verida exists to solve these problems. The <a href="https://developers.verida.io/docs/network/storage-node">Verida DbStore</a> is a decentralized, end-to-end (E2E) encrypted document database.</p><p>Because it is a database, developers get strong query capabilities. Data updates are trivial and fast which means correcting any errors in the data is simple. Databases are both encrypted (so storage node operators can never see the data) and protected by an authentication system (so they are inaccessible to non-authorized users).</p><p>Verida <a href="https://developers.verida.io/docs/network/storage-node">storage nodes</a> are open source and can be self-hosted. Users can choose what node to store their data on, meaning that the legal and policy issues around data sovereignty are easily addressed. Data can be replicated to multiple non-related nodes for better availability and performance.</p><p>The table below is an easy to use reference to look at when comparing the three&nbsp;methods:</p>Table comparing Web3 storage solutions Conclusion <p>Verida DbStore is a new type of Web3 storage that provides capabilities that are important to many applications.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Although it is intimately connected to our everyday lives, advertising technology (adtech) goes unnoticed by most of us. </p>

<p>One of the most pervasive techniques used by browsers and advertisers to get relevant ads in front of increasingly receptive eyes is that of the ‘third-party cookie’. </p>

 What is a third-party cookie?  

<p>These are tiny pieces of data that are stored in your browser on behalf of a website whenever you visit. Websites that you visit later can access these cookies and use them to tailor the ads they show or the deals they offer. </p>

<p>An example: suppose that you are planning a trip to Lisbon and doing online research about where to visit and what to eat. Some of these websites leave cookies on your browser that can be witnessed by other websites when you browse to them. The next time you visit Amazon you may find that - miraculously - there is a sale on guide books to Portugal. </p>

<p>As simple and benign as third-party cookies sound, this mechanism is powerful. As internet users, we are spreading information about our browsing history far and wide. While more tailored advertisements is in theory a benefit, the privacy implications are manifest.</p>

 How do we tackle the issues related with adtech? 

<p>An obvious approach to cookies and adtech is to make the trade-offs between privacy and relevance of advertisements clearer. One trivial way to do this is to alert a web user each time they visit a website that uses cookies. Those of us in jurisdictions subject to the GDPR encounter these warnings with aggravating frequency. Inevitably, we click through the warnings with no thought at all, meaning that the well-intentioned notifications are completely meaningless. </p>

<p>This status quo is transparency theatre. Even though these cookie warnings are meant to abide by the GDPR principle of consent, those of us in the majority of users who ignore the warnings do not have the time to give informed consent and we gain little assurance that our data is being used in appropriate ways. Even if GDPR risk is mitigated in a technical sense, practically there is no benefit.</p>

 Adtech needs a major facelift! 

<p>One such direction, until it was killed in January 2022, was Google’s FLoC; the Federated Learning of Cohorts. The idea behind FLoC was to map people into a group of like-minded users called a cohort. A website can then request the cohort identity of a given user to generate targeted ads, without getting more specific or identifying data from the browser. Topics, which is Google’s proposed replacement for FLoC, instead tracks user interests based on browser history and makes these interests available to advertisers in real time. </p>

<p>The Google proposals have received mixed reviews. They may not be as private in practice as suggested. Then again, it might actually be a more pragmatic approach than simply blocking third-party cookies, which at first glance is more privacy-friendly, but has the effect of strongly incentivising much more privacy destructive technologies such as device fingerprinting. </p>

 We see no solution on the table as getting adtech quite right.  

<p>The ingredients that are missing are meaningful transparency and minimality. A key aspect of adtech transparency should be to provide information about when a person’s browsing data is actually used. This avoids some of the problems of the never-ending cookie warnings, but also introduces ‘actionability’. </p>

<p>An example of actionable adtech transparency: you find that a particular company’s website is making heavy and seemingly unjustifiable use of your browser data. You then consider switching to an alternative business to get the same service. </p>

<p>This methodology, in which statistics about your adtech privacy are consumed after-the-fact, and then made actionable, eliminates the need for a constant stream of up-front warnings, without foregoing ultimate transparency or accountability. </p>

<p>As members of the PAD team, we cannot help but notice that this methodology is closely related to the trust-but-verify nature of decryptions under the PAD system. Once a user grants in-principle decryption approval to another party, that party does not need to request permission to decrypt. Instead, that party is subjected to unavoidable transparency about whether and when decryptions were made. </p>

<p>This counter-intuitive property allows many of the PAD use cases to fit together well. In the case of PAD Places, if you are in an emergency and a friend needs to identify your location, requiring that the friend seek permission may be unsuitable if you are unable to grant it.</p>

 Applying PAD-style transparency to adtech.. 

<p>Applying PAD-style transparency to adtech might be a modest part of solving the problems inherent to this domain. Technology that enables the average person to get a sense for which websites apply adtech proportionally - rather than provide a useless stream of blanket warnings - also could be used to empower the individual to be compensated for use of their browser data. Users who are highly motivated by this compensation could even optionally attach additional attributes about their identity or browsing history, and secure this information in encrypted form under PAD. If advertisers wish to use this data, they must transparently decrypt it and subject themselves to a micropayment to the user.</p>

<p>This self-sovereign ownership of browser data may be a moonshot for now, but regardless, the notion of meaningful transparency already incentivises our second goal of minimality. Privacy-centric consumers will track and recommend businesses that make the most out of the least data and provide more relevant ads without making unjustifiable intrusions. Reputation-sensitive companies will respond and learn to live with less. Incentive compatibility is a hallmark of great technology. </p>

<p>We see meaningful transparency and incentivised minimality as the principles currently missing from the adtech debate surrounding third-party cookies and alternative solutions like topics. Any technology that provides individuals with an easily interpretable layer to see how their data is actually used will play an outsize role in the adtech of Web3.0.</p>

It publishes the Stanford Social Innovation Review and awards digital impact grants that foster a metrics-oriented approach to service delivery via its Digital Civil Society Lab. <a href="https://littlesis.org/person/68602-Laura_K_Arrillaga">Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen</a>, daughter of prominent Silicon Valley commercial real estate developer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Arrillaga">John Arrillaga</a> and wife of Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen, founded the center in 2006 and built up the social impact program within the Stanford Graduate School of Business. She also created the Silicon Valley Social Venture Fund, which was incubated within the Silicon Valley Community Foundation for ten years before spinning out in 2008.</p>

 Why release a transparency report? 



<p>Electric Coin Co. (ECC)* is committed to openness and transparency — as we help evolve and support the Zcash digital currency, and in support of our mission to empower people with economic freedom. This transparency report details company income, expenses, and use of funds during Q4 2021.</p>



<p>Key takeaways:</p>



  Bootstrap received coins at a value above the ECC operating-expense level for Q4 2021. During this time, Bootstrap received coins at an average of $1,185,000 a month (at the Q4 average ZEC price for each of the three months’ distribution dates at $154.81), and ECC incurred average monthly expenses of approximately $717,000.  At the end of Q4 2021, Bootstrap and ECC collectively held approximately $6.5M in USD and approximately 85.3K ZEC. As of June 22, 2022, the companies held approximately $4.9M in USD and approximately 113.3K in ZEC.

  MEV (Miner Extractable Value) is deemed both a problem and a feature of blockchains. Here’s our guide to understanding and dealing with it.

<p></p><p>The term MEV stands for Miner Extractable Value, lately referred to as maximum extractable value. It is a measure of the profit a miner (or validator, sequencer, etc.) can make through their ability to arbitrarily include, exclude, or re-order transactions within the blocks they produce on a smart-contract enabled blockchain network.</p> What is MEV (Miner Extractable Value)? <p>Simply put, MEV is a dynamic that allows miners to maximize their profit by determining the order of transactions on a blockchain network to their advantage. This includes arbitrarily reordering, including, or excluding transactions within a block at the expense of users.<br></p><p>The term Miner Extractable Value was first coined in 2019 by a team of researchers highlighting the issue by publishing a paper called <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05234.pdf">Flash Boys 2.0</a>. Interestingly, the problem of MEV was first identified even earlier by a Reddit user in 2014 who raised the issue of ‘<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/2d84yv/miners_frontrunning/">miner front-running</a>’ given that all transactions are public on the Ethereum network.<br></p><p>Subsequently, the concept of Miner Extractable Value and the problems surrounding it gained notoriety after the research team of a Web3 investment firm, Paradigm, dove into them. Head of Research at Paradigm, Dan Robinson, published the article <a href="https://www.paradigm.xyz/2020/08/ethereum-is-a-dark-forest/">Ethereum is a Dark Forest</a>, in 2020. In it, Robinson states that MEV issues such as front-running bots potentially incentivize miners to reorder and submit transactions in their mempools for their benefit.<br></p>Total MEV on the Ethereum network since 2020. (<a href="https://explore.flashbots.net/">Source</a>)<p>Today, MEV is one of Ethereum’s biggest issues, with more than <a href="https://explore.flashbots.net/">$663 million</a> worth of value extracted from users since 2020. This shows that MEV is not merely a minor issue, but a significant problem occurring at a massive scale and a matter of concern for Ethereum users.<br></p><p>Let’s look at the different types of extractions, examples, and effects of MEV, as well as the measures users can take to mitigate its effects.</p> Types of Miner Extractable Value <p>Today, users suffer the economic effects of MEV in more than one form. Terms like gas golfing and generalized front-runners often occupy crypto headlines. However, before we venture into discussing the various types of MEV, let’s first examine the theory behind MEV and how it impacts miners and validators.<br></p><p>As we have stated, MEV allows miners and validators to profit from re-ordering transactions, as they have access to confirming blocks. Despite this, a good portion of MEV is performed by autonomous network partakers called searchers.<br></p><p>Searchers are users (not necessarily miners) that handle intricate algorithms in the blockchain ecosystem. These algorithms are then used to detect available profitable MEV opportunities. Searchers make use of bots to automate the submission of profitable transactions to the network. Since searchers have a “secure” profit opportunity, they are able to pay high gas fees, incentivizing miners and validators to accept their proposed order of transactions.<br></p><p>Below are the different types of extractions that take place as forms of MEV.</p> Gas golfing <p>Gas golfing is the process of optimizing the existing functionalities of smart contracts in a way that minimizes the amount of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gas-ethereum.asp">gas</a> involved. This involves programming transactions in a way that takes advantage of contracts’ design to use the least possible gas. <br></p><p>Gas golfing gives a competitive advantage to searchers, as it allows them to set higher gas prices while keeping their total gas fees constant (since gas fees = gas price*gas used).<br></p><p>To understand the concept of gas golfing, one must understand the cost of storage in a <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-road-to-decentralization-part-1-setting-our-foundations-2e7e3874c09e/">decentralized</a> network. Unlike data centralized in servers, blockchain data is not stored in just one place but on tens of thousands of disks distributed across the globe. Furthermore, data has to be readily available to every node in the network if a future transaction comes along to access or change it. Because of this, the cost of data access is charged by the network in the form of gas fees. <br></p><p>Gas golfers use techniques such as: <br></p>  Saving data space within transaction code whenever they can.  Only storing data when it is really required.  Keeping a check on how many times a function is accessing or changing storage.<br>  <p>Other gas golfing techniques involve using addresses that start with a long string of zeroes, as they take less storage space. Another involves leaving small <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/">ERC-20</a> token balances in contracts to re-use them, since it costs more gas to initialize a storage slot than to update one (SSTORE vs SLOAD).<br></p><p>It’s worth noting that SSTORE (to store data in a storage slot) and SLOAD (to load data from the slot into memory) are some of the most expensive opcodes on <a href="https://cypherpunks-core.github.io/ethereumbook/13evm.html">EVM</a> in terms of gas fees.</p> Generalized front-running: What is front-running and why it’s so common <p>Unlike gas golfing, front-running doesn’t deal with optimizing smart contracts to detect profitable MEV opportunities. Instead, it involves keeping an eye on unconfirmed transactions, looking for profitable trades, and then front-running the original transactions by submitting them but with higher gas fees. <br></p><p>By effectively executing a winning trade first, front-runners secure a profit at the expense of the original honest trader. Front-running bots that use specific algorithms and parameters to identify transactions before they happen are called generalized front-runners.<br></p><p>Let’s illustrate this with an example.<br></p><p>Imagine a trader finds an arbitrage opportunity. As it turns out, there’s a price difference for a certain coin between Uniswap and Sushiswap. Let’s say wBTC/USDC is $20,904 in one and $20,916 in the other. To profit from this opportunity, the trader has to initiate a transaction to buy the asset for a lower price on Uniswap and then sell it at a higher price on Sushiswap. Once the trader initiates the transaction, it will have to wait in the mempool (the pool of unconfirmed transactions) to be picked by a miner and get executed.<br></p><p>However, what our trader doesn’t know is that this opens up a window for a front-runner bot to sweep in. The bot would detect the transaction while it’s waiting to be executed, copy it, add in higher gas fees, and have its transaction executed beforehand. This will effectively rob the trader of her arbitrage opportunity, profiting at her intellectual, monetary, and creative expense.</p> Back-running <p>Similar to front-running, back-running involves the monitoring of a mempool to execute a transaction immediately after a pending target transaction. To achieve this, MEV searchers employ back-running bots eavesdropping on big transactions that often results in an imbalance in an <a href="https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/what-is-an-automated-market-maker-amm-588954fc5ff7">AMM</a> pool and in heavy price slippage.<br></p><p>The back-running bot then executes an opposite trade on the same pool to maximize its owner’s profit. In other words, back-running works by leveraging the price difference caused by an original transaction.<br></p><p>Back-running bots also monitor mempools for new token pair listings and place transactions to immediately scoop the initial liquidity by buying a large quantity of one token from the pair. This subsequently increases the price of a token, creating FOMO among other traders and pushing the price even higher. The bot then sells the token at a higher price maximizing the searcher’s profit, wrecking small buyers on its way out.</p> Sandwich attack <p>Sandwich attacks deal combine both front-running and back-running strategies. They are particularly useful in decentralized exchanges (such as Uniswap) that utilize an AMM concept. As you saw in the back-running example, the price of an asset can substantially increase or decrease with a single big trade under this model. <br></p>Illustration of a sandwich attack for a given token. (<a href="https://www.publish0x.com/ilvfi/illuvium-silv2-don-t-get-sandwiched-xqmrdwj">Source</a>)<p>MEV extractors leverage AMMs for a profit by monitoring the mempool for large transactions and sandwiching them. To do so, they simultaneously front-run and back-run them.<br></p><p>For example, let’s say a victim wants to swap a large amount of ETH for an obscure altcoin on Uniswap. Once the MEV searcher sees this transaction in mempool, it can front-run the victim’s transaction by executing the same transaction prior to the victim's transaction. <br></p><p>As the searcher’s transaction hits, it will invariably result in price slippage, which will subsequently increase the price of the altcoin within the pool. This, in turn, will make the victim pay substantially more per coin than they originally expected. To complete the job, once the victim’s transaction is executed, the searcher can then swap its altcoins back to ETH at the original trader’s expense, back-running to make a profit.</p> Time bandit attacks <p>Another form of MEV attack is the so-called time bandit attack. As you will see, these are perhaps the most worrying types of attacks, as they could destabilize the consensus and trust in a network.<br></p><p>Time bandit attacks involve the re-mining of blocks in order to maximize profits. An opportunity for a time bandit attack might occur when block rewards are small enough compared to MEV. This incentivizes miners to destabilize the consensus to reap the maximum profits.<br></p><p>For example, let’s say the highest block of a blockchain network is numbered #B10 and its block reward is $100. Incidentally, a miner notices an MEV opportunity worth $1000 on block number #B7. This opportunity might incentivize the said miner to remine the #B7 block and all subsequent blocks to reap the MEV rewards while adhering to the longest-chain rule.<br></p><p>As you can imagine, this is unlikely to happen in big chains without a certain degree of collusion between several miners. However, block re-mining is still a problem in novel chains and could become more prominent as <a href="https://argoblockchain.com/articles/read-more-china-dominates-bitcoin-mining-heres-why-that-needs-to-change">mining power progressively centralizes.</a></p> Uncle attacks <p>Another peculiar kind of attack is uncle attacks. Uncle attacks can bypass and perform MEV even from bundled transactions, a common defense tactic that consists of sending transactions in batches. To understand how <a href="https://twitter.com/bertcmiller/status/1382673587715342339">uncle attacks</a> work, we need to first understand bundled transactions.<br></p><p><a href="https://docs.flashbots.net/">Flashbots</a> is a research organization that democratizes access to MEV (a controversial take that we’ll address below) by creating an off-chain MEV auction marketplace. This is called front-running as a service (FaaS). Once Flashbots’ auctions conclude, a batch of front-running transactions is bundled together to avoid getting front-run by other searchers (in other words, out-speeding front-runners). Bundled transactions must be included in the order submitted, and either the whole bundle is included, or nothing is. They are also not allowed to split.<br></p><p>However, there are cases in which a bundle of such transactions is mined on an uncle block. In Ethereum, occasionally two blocks can be mined at roughly the same time, with only one of them being allowed into the chain. The block that gets discarded is then called an "uncle" or “orphan”. Transactions that get written into uncle blocks then create a small window of opportunity for an attack.<br></p><p>When bundled transactions are mined into an uncle block, they’re open for everyone to see. In this case, an attacker can select transactions from the bundle to front-run or back-run them. This also shows that attacks extend beyond the mempool and into uncled blocks as well.</p> Effects of Miner Extractable Value – the good, the bad, and the ugly <p>Surprisingly, there are numerous arguments for MEV and its role in the blockchain ecosystem. <br></p><p>Let’s start out with the side that believes MEV is unsolvable and inevitable before we look into the negatives.</p> The good side of MEV <p>This side argues that the crypto community should be building the tools to democratize access to MEV instead of trying to solve it.<br></p><p>The proponents of MEV believe that MEV ensures the usefulness of DeFi projects such as lending protocols, enabling them to speedy and smooth liquidation processes. The proponents argue that MEV extractors are rational actors seeking and fixing economic inefficiencies of <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/the-worlds-first-private-decentralized-protocol-launch-panther-dao-votes-to-launch-private-defi-e721df1364/">DeFi protocols</a> making them robust.<br></p><p>A group of researchers belonging to the proponents camps have built an organization called Flashbots working on mitigating the negative externalities of current MEV extraction techniques. <a href="https://docs.flashbots.net/#:~:text=Flashbots%20is%20a%20research%20and,state%2Drich%20blockchains%20like%20Ethereum.">Flashbots</a> has built a product called MEV-Geth, which offers front-running as a service with a primary focus on enabling a permissionless, transparent, and fair ecosystem for MEV extraction.<br></p><p>The proponents argue that offering <a href="https://medium.com/offchainlabs/front-running-as-a-service-334c929c945a">front-running as a service</a> (FaaS) makes up for the miners’ lost revenue caused by Ethereum’s <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/quorum/what-is-eip-1559-how-will-it-change-ethereum/">EIP-1559</a> fee-burning update. Hence, it indirectly increases Ethereum’s security by incentivizing miners to compete for MEV with higher hash power.</p> The bad <p>On other hand, there are obvious reasons for MEV causing a worse experience for users. Particularly, it causes more expensive transactions and revenue loss.<br></p><p>For example, at the application layer, front-running and sandwich attacks are causing users millions of dollars worth of losses in terms of increased price slippage and lost arbitrage opportunities. In the 30 days before publishing this article, MEV searchers and miners have extracted over $28 million from Ethereum users.<br></p><p>The existence of front-running bots makes arbitrage trading an unwinnable game for amateur traders. This especially hurts the proposed functionality of DeFi protocols that rely on third-party arbitrage to function properly. The presence of MEV bots creates an unfavorable environment for real arbitrageurs to participate in such protocols, which in turn is detrimental to the protocol’s security.<br></p><p>Additionally, at a network level, generalized front-runners compete against each other by increasing gas fees. This often results in network congestion and high transaction fees. Network users (and the network itself, which turns inefficient and costly) suffer as a consequence.</p> The ugly <p>There are also arguments put forth claiming that MEV worsens the network itself at a protocol level. For example, for any given block, if MEV rewards are larger than block rewards, this might incentivize miners to remine blocks and destabilize the network’s <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065245820300668">consensus</a>.<br></p><p>Depending on who you ask, allowing miners to reorganize and reorder the transactions in blocks for profit might be seen as breaking the entire premise of blockchains being a secure, immutable, and permissionless technology. It also makes miners’ take an active role in influencing transactions and balances, as opposed to being neutral parties competing for a different set of benefits. In fact, we encourage you to think about what may happen when miners decide it’s worth their time to utilize their mining privileges to conduct MEV themselves.</p> Mitigating Miner Extractable Value <p>We have looked into the bad and ugly sides of MEV and considered the millions of dollars lost due to MEV extractions. It is now crucial to close this article by discussing how to mitigate or minimize the effects of MEV.<br></p><p>The crypto ecosystem as a whole is actively discussing and working on solutions to mitigate or at least minimize MEV’s effects. Numerous solutions have been proposed from both camps – those who believe MEV is inevitable and access to it should be democratized, and those who are trying to prevent it.<br></p><p>Let’s have a look at the solutions both camps propose.</p> MEV democratization, Flashbots, and more <p>In the “proponent” camp, several organizations such as Flashbots (see above) aim to democratize MEV extraction through a sealed-bid block space auction mechanism. This auction mechanism creates a parallel private relay to reduce mempool bidding wars, failed transactions bloating the blockchain, and overall gas costs for users.<br></p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.optimism.io/">Optimism</a> has led a movement that proposes <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-auction-auctioning-transaction-ordering-rights-as-a-solution-to-miner-extractable-value/6788">MEV Auction</a> (MEVA) to minimize the effects of MEV on network traffic. With MEVA, an auction is created in which the winner has the right to reorder submitted transactions and insert their own, as long as they do not delay any specific transaction by more than N blocks.</p> Against MEV <p>On the other side, those who believe that MEV is bad and should be minimized have built a couple of solutions as well.<br></p><p><a href="https://bridge.arbitrum.io/">Arbitrum</a>, a Layer-2 solution for Ethereum, has openly positioned itself against MEV and FaaS. To mitigate MEV, Arbitrum has proposed a solution to avoid reordering of transactions by having <a href="https://www.mev.wiki/solutions/mev-minimization/arbitrum-offchain-labs">no sequencer</a> on Layer-2 chains. <br></p><p>As per Arbitrum, a chain can be created in which no permissioned entities have sequencing rights. Ordering then is to be determined entirely by inbox contracts. A Layer-2 chain without sequencers might lose the ability to get lower latency than its Layer-1 chain but, without any party involved in the Layer-2 (including Arbitrum validators) having a say in transaction ordering, MEV cannot enter the picture.<br></p><p>Well-known oracle network Chainlink has also built a solution to avoid the reordering of transactions called <a href="https://blog.chain.link/chainlink-fair-sequencing-services-enabling-a-provably-fair-defi-ecosystem/">Fair Sequencing Service.</a> The idea behind FSS is to have an oracle network order the transactions sent to a particular contract, including both user transactions and oracle reports. Through FSS, oracle nodes ingest transactions and then reach consensus on their ordering, rather than allowing a single leader to dictate it.<br></p><p>Another approach is that of <a href="https://github.com/Taichi-Network/docs">Taichi Network</a> (now defunct) or <a href="https://bloxroute.com/">bloXroute</a>, which allows users to send private transactions directly to a mining pool, bypassing the public mempool. This eliminates the attack surface within the mempools (where, as we have established, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bitcoin-tumblers-privacy-coins-and-prifi-private-crypto/">transactions are public</a> and can be monitored by MEV bots).<br><br></p>A diagram showing how Taichi Network enables users to avoid getting front-runned. (<a href="https://www.mev.wiki/solutions/faas-or-meva/private-transactions">Source</a>) Conclusion: Miner Extraction Value is not going away soon. <p>It is a well-established fact that MEV problems, as they stand, are quite serious in nature, and need to be addressed or minimized at least. Even though there are conflicts about the good and bad sides of MEV, both sides are actively working on various solutions. The ones we covered are just the tip of the iceberg –<a href="https://www.mev.wiki/solutions/">the MEV wiki</a> and other sources offer a comprehensive list for those interested in knowing more about the MEV ecosystem.</p><p>At Panther, we're building privacy-centric solutions with an emphasis on users' privacy and autonomy.

<p>We’re proud to announce that Aztec Connect is live on mainnet, enabling private DeFi on Ethereum for the first time&nbsp;ever.</p><p>By fusing full privacy and L1 DeFi liquidity right on Ethereum mainnet, users no longer need to trade convenience for privacy via alternative privacy chains. With Aztec Connect, Ethereum is now capable of private DeFi all on its&nbsp;own.</p><p>To help reveal the power of Aztec Connect, we’ve completely revamped <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a>, our first-party DeFi aggregator. Users can try the comprehensive update today, which allows anyone to use DeFi apps like Lido, Curve, and Element with complete privacy and up to 100x cost&nbsp;savings.</p><blockquote><a href="http://zk.money">Try zk.money&nbsp;here</a></blockquote><p>Blockchain transactions are fully public. They leak privacy, exposing user behavior and creating security vulnerabilities. At Aztec we solved the challenge of implementing blockchain privacy by inventing <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/09/22/plonk.html">Plonk</a>, the industry-standard zk-SNARK that enables fast privacy for Aztec while securing billions of dollars of on-chain value for the broader zk community.</p><p>Aztec Connect is the next major leap toward our long-term vision: a fast, decentralized zero-knowledge network with native smart contract&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Aztec Connect enables anyone to add privacy to Ethereum applications with two easy-to-use developer tools:</p>  Bridge Contracts: 100–200 line interfaces connecting Ethereum smart contracts to Aztec’s&nbsp;rollup  SDK: a front-end toolkit enabling beautiful, seamless web interfaces to access Aztec Connect integrations  <p>In simples terms, Aztec Connect works like a VPN: by using Aztec’s rollup contract as a proxy, users interact with Ethereum services from within the Aztec&nbsp;network.</p><p>Encrypted instructions are passed to Aztec’s rollup contract on Layer 1, which executes those commands. Aztec batches transactions, reducing user fees and enabling up to 100x cost savings over mainnet Ethereum.</p> A Private zk-Rollup — Today <p>The launch of Aztec Connect represents exciting new paradigms for DeFi and&nbsp;beyond:</p>  Fully confidential Defi actions: staking, vault entry, lending and&nbsp;swaps  Significant cost reduction for&nbsp;users  Private treasury management, on-chain DAO governance, and NFT purchasing and&nbsp;trading  <p>And because Aztec Connect relies on Ethereum as its execution environment, protocols keep liquidity and contracts on mainnet while maintaining Ethereum ecosystem composability.</p><p>That means partners can access the benefits of a private rollup&nbsp;with:</p>  No liquidity fragmentation  No contract redeployment  No re-audits of code and contracts  <p>Scale and privacy without compromise.</p> zk.money <p>We originally built zk.money as a showcase for private payments. Since launch, 75,000 users have entrusted our cryptography with over $100 million in payment&nbsp;volume.</p><p>We’ve now expanded <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> functionality to support beautiful, intuitive access to DeFi interactions that are private by default, starting with acquiring Lido liquid staked Ether (stETH) with Curve and entering fixed rate vaults with Element&nbsp;Finance.</p><p>As of today, users can visit zk.money and interact with our Curve-Lido and Element bridges, enjoying mainnet liquidity, full privacy and up to 100x cost savings over Layer 1 Ethereum, with upcoming support for your favorite DeFi&nbsp;apps.</p><p><a href="http://zk.money">Zk.money</a> demonstrates the simple and elegant user experiences that are possible with the Aztec Connect SDK–a Typescript-based front-end development tool that allows anyone to integrate privacy and cost savings into Ethereum applications.</p><p>We’re just getting started and will be bringing more DeFi integrations to zk.money over the coming&nbsp;months.</p><p>We’re supporting developers creating fully private DeFi experiences using these tools, and we want to hear from you! The public repo for Aztec Connect can be found <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect-bridges">here</a>, with documentation found&nbsp;<a href="https://transcendent-marshmallow-2f922f.netlify.app/">here</a>.</p> State of Aztec’s Private&nbsp;Rollup <p>In order to achieve seamless privacy, we’ve made significant improvements to Aztec’s rollup in the last&nbsp;year:</p>  Performance: throughput increase of over 11x; rollup gas efficiency improvement of&nbsp;30%+  UX on L2: chained transactions allows for instant settlement on internal transfers  UX on L1: support for multi-asset DeFi deposits and withdrawals  <p>Further releases will include gas cost reduction via off-chain viewing keys, lower latency, improved UX and security via native Ethereum signatures, and multi-signature wallet&nbsp;support.</p> Towards a Community-Driven Rollup <p>This achievement wouldn’t be possible without the Aztec, Ethereum, and zk communities. More than ever, we are committed to supporting a community-first approach to Ethereum&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>That’s what prompted us to launch Aztec Grants, funding the independent development of DeFi protocol integrations with Aztec Connect. We’re excited to be working in collaboration with the grants programs at Aave, Compound, Element, Lido, and more to expand the privacy ecosystem.</p><p>If you’re a developer interested in building privacy-first applications, please <a href="https://airtable.com/shrvglCZ24jaH73oe">apply for a grant&nbsp;here</a>.</p><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect-bridges/tree/master/src/bridges">See here for a repository of Aztec Connect integrations.</a></blockquote><p>We also owe a debt of gratitude to the scientists, researchers, and engineers who are building on Plonk and keeping cryptography secure. With their support and collaboration, the dream of blockchain privacy will soon be a&nbsp;reality.</p> About Aztec&nbsp;Network <p>Aztec Network is the first private zk-rollup on Ethereum, enabling decentralized applications to access privacy and scale. Aztec’s rollup is secured by its industry-standard Plonk proving mechanism used by the leading zero-knowledge scaling projects.</p><p>Aztec’s first-party payments and DeFi aggregation product <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> has supported over 75,000 unique users, 250,000 transactions, and $100 million in transaction volume since its launch in&nbsp;2021.</p> Build with Aztec Connect&nbsp;SDK <p>Are you a developer who wants to bring privacy to your favorite DeFi protocol?

<p>Dear community,<br></p><p>We’re happy to announce that our Zafari incentivized Testnet is resuming its activities with the third wave of <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testing-for-zkp-advanced-staking-is-now-live-19b51bc6b42b?source=collection_home---4------1-----------------------">Advanced Staking testing</a>!<br></p><p>Please read all the details below carefully to learn more about what is being tested and how to participate.</p> How does Wave 3 of testing work?<br> <p>In this testing round, users will stake test <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/the-bull-case-for-zkp-and-private-crypto-as-a-whole/">$ZKP tokens</a> (i.e., tokens with no value) to earn:</p>  Test $zZKP rewards, which are computed in a Multi-Asset Shielded Pool (MASP).  10,000 test Panther Reward Points (PRPs) per stake, which can be redeemed for test $zZKP once the protocol’s v1 launches.  <p>By holding onto their test $zZKP in the MASP, users can also continue to accrue additional test PRPs.</p><p>This new test environment will feature an Early Redemption functionality which allows users to withdraw their test $zZKP rewards early by forfeiting test PRP rewards. Withdrawing ahead of time means that users give up any possible additional test PRPs accrued through holding test $zZKP in the MASP.</p><p>$zZKP in the MASP will start accruing rewards in PRP as soon as the stake is created. They will continue to do so even in the period before upgrading to v1, which implements full shielded pool functionalities. This wave of testing also features updated contracts and reward management mechanics (implementing smart contracts), as expected.</p><p>Note that PRPs will only be created as the protocol’s v1 launches. Rewards issued to users will be computed taking into consideration their staking date.</p><p>Wave 3 of testing will proceed as follows:</p>  Staking will become available on July 7th, 14:00 UTC.  The staking period will end on July 9th, 14:00 UTC.  Unstaking of test $ZKP principal will become available on July 10th, 14:00 UTC.  test zZKP rewards will also become available for redemption on July 10th, 14:00 UTC.   Reporting a bug <p>Make sure you read the instructions below, as well as our section on Unaccepted submissions before participating.<br></p><p>To report and be eligible for rewards, do the following once you think you’ve stumbled into a bug:</p>  <a href="https://appuals.com/open-browser-console/">Open your browser console</a>.  Ensure that the Console tab is selected.  Type -/zkp-staking/ into the Filter box to filter out all the failed to load source map warnings.Make sure all logging levels are enabled, including Verbose:<br>    Scroll to the bottom to locate the more detailed errors.  Make sure the window is a decent size, so that it captures a good amount of detail from the errors.  Take one or more screenshots of the window to capture any log messages which might be relevant to the problem in question.  Make sure to include this information in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSftCbVmbosspDfFDLMwL5qfDyq4O7bRcijicZKPXLBhISUTGA/viewform">bug report form found here.</a><br>   Unaccepted submissions <p>Avoid grouping multiple bugs into a single report. Please generate multiple reports for any number of issues you find.</p><p>Note that the previous rounds of testing have helped identify several unresolved bugs. Submissions reporting them will therefore not be accepted. All submissions also now need to provide proof of the bugs they’re reporting via an image or video.</p><p>These include:</p>  White screen upon opening the zAssets page.  Pending transactions in MetaMask.  Faucet: transaction failed - None 200, status code ‘404’ (mobile version).  Transaction error: code 32603 + code 404.  Transaction error: Cannot find event in receipt. No StakeCreated event found for this transaction.  Available balance incorrect comma in total balance (balance card).  Double tapping Stake/Unstake buttons produces 2 transactions per one stake.  zAssets page not viewable if connected to networks other than the Polygon Mumbai Testnet.  zAsset link not showing on the navigation bar when &nbsp;connected to networks other than the Polygon Mumbai Testnet.  Incorrect rounding of staked amounts.  Footer line showing at incorrect locations.  White screens when using Safari (browser).  MATIC balance not auto-refreshing.  Progress bar on top of staking tab needs real data.  Auto translator enabled.  Unstaking tab and balance card data showing differences in total rewards.   Moving forward<br> <p>From the Panther team, we'd like to thank you again for your enthusiasm in previous testing rounds. Your feedback has been incredibly helpful in building towards v1 of our protocol and the launch of MASPs.<br></p><p>Advanced <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/crypto-staking-misconceptions-benefits-risks-and-taxation/">Staking</a> is a critical intermediate step between Panther's current state and the release of MASPs. Thanks to it, we can test the dynamics behind creating zAssets and computing rewards in a real-world setting.<br></p><p>We're looking forward to receiving your input!<br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

 Scallet — Scala’s Web Wallet &amp; Payment&nbsp;Gateway  Introduction <p>The most ancient among our community surely remember <a href="https://medium.com/scala/the-story-behind-stellitepay-12faddc8204">StellitePay</a>, the web wallet of the pre-Scala era… yes, that nostalgic time when Scala was still called “Stellite”.</p><p>At the time, StellitePay was a simple and fast payment system that has been integrated into some applications: tip bots, a gambling site, and some other experimental apps.</p><p>Unfortunately, user adoption of StellitePay was limited at the time due to some technical challenges and other priorities… until&nbsp;now!</p> The rebirth <p>Releasing a web wallet made it to the top of our backlog in 2022, and we took the time to rewrite the entire frontend/backend and make it better, thanks to the feedback we got from StellitePay.</p><p>After our <a href="https://shop.scalaproject.io/product/re-re-re-branded/">re-re-rebranding</a> (please, meme us!), we had to find a new name for StellitePay.</p><p>We decided to go with Scallet, which is the combination of “Scala” and “wallet”.</p> What is&nbsp;it? <p>You may be wondering why we need a new wallet? It is true that we already have a few wallets — they all have their respective uses… but they also have their drawbacks.</p><blockquote>Scallet intends to be a simple browser-based wallet with everything you need in your daily&nbsp;life.</blockquote> Everything I&nbsp;need? <p>Yes, indeed! But what does that mean&nbsp;exactly?</p><p>Well, if&nbsp;you…</p>  need a wallet which is always&nbsp;synced  need to access your wallet from any device connected to the&nbsp;internet  want to accept/use Scala’s currency (XLA) in your shop or application  want a simple and fast&nbsp;wallet  <p>Then… Scallet is the right&nbsp;choice!</p> How can I get&nbsp;mine? <p>It all starts here: <a href="https://scallet.io">https://scallet.io</a></p><p>Just register your email, username and password and you’re good to&nbsp;go!</p><p>Send some of your XLA to Scallet and have fun while sending it from your phone or even from your refrigerator web interface (did you know we are one of the only real CPU and mobile-friendly projects out there? Check out our <a href="https://github.com/scala-network/MobileMiner">mobile&nbsp;miner</a>!)</p> Shortlink <p>We have implemented a cool feature called “shortlink”, which allows you to define your own personal URL that you can share with your friends, family or users and makes it easy to receive&nbsp;XLA.</p>Shortlink example How much does it&nbsp;cost? <p>It’s totally free! There are no hidden&nbsp;fees.</p><p>You simply send and receive XLA like any other transaction on any other wallet, just like you are used&nbsp;to.</p> Can I make Scallet my main&nbsp;wallet? <p>We don’t recommend it. Even though we’re doing our very best to make Scallet as safe as possible, there isn’t a safer place than a cold wallet to which only you got access and no one else in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Our <a href="https://scalaproject.io/">CLI/GUI/Mobile wallets</a> are better options to store your coins safely if you intend to&nbsp;hodl.</p><p>Scallet is meant to be used as your “hot wallet” to send/receive transactions whenever you purchase something or when you need a simple and fast&nbsp;wallet.</p> Conclusion <p>In the future, there will be additions to the app, such as Discord webhooks, but first and foremost we want to make sure that the core features work as intended and that people can use the app&nbsp;easily.</p><p>So please give us your feedback on <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/djAFVvy">Discord</a> so we can improve the&nbsp;service!</p> Community 👋 <p>If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact&nbsp;us:</p>  Website: <a href="https://scalaproject.io/">https://scalaproject.io/</a>  Discord: <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/djAFVvy">https://discordapp.com/invite/djAFVvy</a>  Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/scalaofficial">https://t.me/scalaofficial</a>  Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scalahq">https://twitter.com/scalahq</a>  Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScalaNetwork/">https://www.reddit.com/r/ScalaNetwork/</a>  Scala Mining Stats: <a href="https://scalastats.com/">https://scalastats.com/</a>  Email: hello@scalaproject.io   <p><a href="https://medium.com/scala-network/scallet-scalas-web-wallet-payment-gateway-db6a7e29d808">Scallet — Scala’s Web Wallet &amp; Payment Gateway</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/scala-network">Scala</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/human-betterment-foundation-1928-1942">Ezra Seymour Gosney</a>, a lawyer born in Kentucky, became involved in the cattle and sheep industry in Arizona and later in citrus production when he relocated his family to Pasadena in the 1920s. He owned one of the largest lemon groves in the state and was involved in numerous finance civic activities, including the California Boy Scouts, when he approached Harry Laughlin of the Eugenics Records Office at Cold Spring Harbor on Long Island about establishing an office on the west coast to promote sterilization practices.</p>

<p>Before the Human Betterment Foundation (HBF) officially launched, Paul Popenhoe was hired to conduct extensive field work in California and summarize the impact of the 6,000+ sterilizations that had taken place in the state following the enabling legislation that passed in 1909. Popenhoe was a horticulturalist researching avocado and date production who later became interested in human breeding. He wrote “<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/19560/19560-h/19560-h.htm">Applied Eugenics</a>” in 1918, a textbook that promoted the idea of segregated societies where “waste” humanity would do manual labor to create value on unimproved forestland as a means by which to offset the cost of their upkeep.</p>
<p></p>

<p>This focus on sterilization coincided with intense anti-immigrant settlement during the 1920s and 30s. The Johnson Reed Act that was passed in 1924 implemented strict quotas, imposed a literacy test and tax, and excluded Asian immigrants other than Japanese and Filipinos, because the Philippines was an American colony at the time.</p>
<p>After Gosney’s death, the remaining assets of Human Betterment Foundation and his <a href="https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf2h4n98gb/admin/#did-1.7.1">papers</a>, were transferred to Caltech. The income from the <a href="http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/629/2/Personals.pdf">Gosney Research Fund</a> was to be used for “the promotion of the research of the biological basis of human qualities.” Of course today, Caltech offers <a href="https://catalog.caltech.edu/documents/19916/caltech_catalog-2122-section_2.pdf">graduate degrees</a> in molecular biophysics, bioengineering, biochemistry, neural engineering, medical engineering, social and decision neuroscience (including economic theory and game theory and behavioral economics). I imagine there are many avenues for pursuing the engineering of certain qualities, though they are increasingly likely to be post-human.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://collections.archives.caltech.edu/repositories/2/resources/91">Source</a>: Caltech Archives Human Betterment Foundation Collection</p>
<p>Below are selections taken from the Human Betterment Foundation’s materials on the social benefits of sterilization. Remember, this was during a period of economic upheaval that caused grave distress for many families.</p>
<blockquote><p>Chapter XII Sterilization for Eugenic Reasons</p>
<p>There remains, then, the principal field for sterilization; namely, the eugenic. Persons should be sterilized if it is to the interests of the commonwealth (or more broadly of the human race) that they bear no children, or no further children; and if it appears that sterilization is the most effective and satisfactory means of preventing such reproduction, more specifically, sterilization is justified 1) if mental disease and defect are a menace to the state 2) if they are perpetuated by heredity and 3 if sterilization seems to be the most effective means available for dealing with them, or with certain aspects of them.</p>
<p><a href="http://chwe.net/michael/gosney_popenoe_1929.pdf">Source</a>: Sterilization for Human Betterment, 1929, page 116</p>
<p>The Problem Before American Citizens</p>
<p>The situation which has led all these commonwealths to adopt sterilization laws grows out of such facts as the following. Births among families habitually living on public charity are often 50% or higher than births among self-supporting families. The families that contribute children to the state homes for the feebleminded in California are multiplying about twice as rapidly as the rest of the population. The burden of taxation due to the mentally diseased and mentally defective is, at the same time, steadily mounting.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/rbpe.0020380g/?sp=2&amp;st=image">Source</a>: Human Sterilization Today, Human Betterment Foundation, 1938, page 2</p>
<p>Eugenic Sterilization Is Not a Panacea</p>
<p>Sterilization is no panacea for these ills of mankind, but it is one of the many measures indispensable to any far-sighted and humanitarian program dealing with society’s tremendous burden of mental disease, deficiency, and dependency.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/rbpe.0020380g/?sp=3&amp;st=image">Source</a>: Human Sterilization Today, Human Betterment Foundation, 1938, page 6</p></blockquote>
<p>These quotes show that the foundation’s membership justified sterilization in part by saying families of feeble-minded people had too many children and were a drain on government assistance. These were among the wealthiest citizens of Pasadena, many of whom had made fortunes made in law, academia, and speculative real estate.</p>

<p><a href="https://calisphere.org/item/9ded8f51877b0ac10f122ad5bd345c5f/">Source</a>: Robert Millikan with Cosmic X-Ray Equipment 1935</p>
<p>While Robert Millikan was not a founder of HBF, he <a href="https://archive.ph/B7VFr">joined the board in 1937</a> and played a key role in securing Gosney’s papers and HBF’s funds for Caltech. Before coming to Pasadena in 1921, Millikan helped establish the physics department at the University of Chicago, where he pursued <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1923/millikan/facts/">Nobel Prize-winning research</a> into the charge of electrons. During WWI he served as vice-chair of the National Research Council and coordinated applied research for defense purposes. At Caltech he investigated cosmic radiation and served as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-Millikan">board chair</a> from 1921-46, turning the school into one of the foremost applied research institutions in the nation.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2020 <a href="https://archive.ph/B7VFr">concerns were once again raised</a> about Millikan’s legacy with calls to remove his name from campus facilities. The Black Scientists and Engineers of Caltech issued a statement at the time, noting that of the 1,299 graduate students at the university, only 11 (.8%) were Black. This was not because there weren’t qualified PhD candidates, but rather that the school had chosen not to direct endowment support to the <a href="https://sfp.caltech.edu/undergraduate-research/programs/wavefellows">WAVE Fellows</a> program for underrepresented communities.</p>

He taught European History there from 1919 to 1924. Born in France and a WWI veteran, he taught ethics at the University of Wisconsin and later French Literature at UCLA. Active in international diplomacy, he participated in League of Nations activities in the early 1920s, touring the country at the request of President Wilson. He was also president of the International Labor Office and served as a delegate to the United Nations after WWII. In retirement he relocated to Haiti where he established an English newspaper, the Port-Au-Prince Times.</p>

<p><a href="http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/2820/1/albert.pdf">Albert Ruddock</a> came from a lumber family, served in the diplomatic corps in Berlin, Brussels, and Peking. In the 1920s he moved to California and got into the petroleum and banking sectors. He was a lifelong benefactor of Caltech and served on many community boards, including two Los Angeles hospitals. Ruddock was a member of many California social clubs, including the Bohemian Club in San Francisco where he <a href="http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/2820/1/albert.pdf">died of a heart attack</a> in 1970. He, too, was a member of HBF.</p>
<p>The Ruddock family acquired what they initially viewed as “worthless” copper mines in southeastern Utah in foreclosing proceedings. In the early 1950s the Atomic Energy Commission determined that lands held <a href="http://www.canyoncountryzephyr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/OCT-NOV16-20-21.pdf">uranium deposits</a>. They incorporated as the Cal Uranium Company and began removing ore in 1954. Albert’s son Merritt Ruddock helped manage the family’s mining investments and purchased <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/?clipping_id=67047562&amp;fcfToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVlLXZpZXctaWQiOjU5OTI0MTAzOSwiaWF0IjoxNjU2NzY4ODQxLCJleHAiOjE2NTY4NTUyNDF9.Bjwnrds7-NEDYo9xocAhbR0eVp4_-OH0HWCFUAbP3B0">Charlford Castle</a> and extensive ranch holdings, now known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee_Ranch">Cherokee Ranch</a>, in Sedalia, CO in 1954.

<p><a href="https://about.usc.edu/presidents/rufus-b-von-kleinsmid/">Rufus Von KleinSmid</a> co-founded the Human Betterment Society with Gosney. He was an education and psychology professor who led Arizona State University before moving on to the University of Southern California. As the fifth president of USC, he developed international relationships in the 1930s, including with Japan, and undertook a massive building campaign in the years after WWII.</p>
<p>Von KleinSmid advocated for sterilization of “defective” people and deprived Japanese American students who had attended USC before being placed in internment camps during the war of their transcripts. His name was <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-11/usc-removes-name-of-former-president-rufus-von-kleinsmid-a-supporter-of-eugenics-from-prominent-building">removed</a> from the school’s Center for International and Policy Affairs in 2020 after over a decade of intense advocacy by staff and students. In 1913 as the director of research at the Indiana Reformatory KleinSmid prepared a speech, “<a href="https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/bitstream/handle/1805/1150/von%20KleinSmit_%20Eugenics%20and%20the%20State.pdf?sequence=1">Eugenics and the State</a>,” delivered before the Cincinnati Academy of Medicine.</p>

<p>The following quotes are taken from that speech:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The average worth of the individual to the society is constantly lowered because of both the lack of productiveness among the worthy, and the fecundity of the defective.”</p>
<p>“It is fair to say that too much of the effort which these organizations (social workers) have put forth has done little more than to save to the state the defective classes, making it less and less likely that the rigors of climate and the prevalence of disease and other devastating conditions among which these people live may tend toward the survival of the fittest. We who are strong have borne the burdens of the weak, and the weak have repaid us by furnishing still greater burdens for us to bear.”</p>
<p>“Whatever steps may be taken to prevent the augmenting of the part of society’s membership which can never be other than a hindrance and a drag, must be taken with the consciousness that what is best for society must be acceptable to the individual.”</p>
<p>“It may not be practical nor wise to adopt the Greek plan of welcoming every babe in the world in the presence of an agent of the state, nor yet to expose on the mountainside those babes who furnish immediate evidence of their unfitness for life. On the other hand, there is little question that the physician here in reporting to the proper authorities the physical condition of newborn babes and in so far as continued observation is possible, the mental condition, can render and incalculable service to society.”</p>
<p>“Psychology is, as yet, a comparatively new science, but when the most searching observation and test will have been augmented and explained by anthropometric records, statistics in the field of heredity, experiments in paidology and pedagogy, and investigations in the fields of neurology, pathology and biochemistry, we shall have every reason to believe that the commonwealth will make no mistake in organizing its affairs and legislating its will upon the basis of the most scientific research that it can employ. Nay, more, it is wholly the privilege as well as the duty of the state to deny itself no opportunity or obligation that will assure its people life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness in ever increasing abundance.” <a href="https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/bitstream/handle/1805/1150/von%20KleinSmit_%20Eugenics%20and%20the%20State.pdf?sequence=1">Rufus Bernhard Von KleinSmid</a> 1913</p></blockquote>
<p>The quotes above candidly reveal the disdain held by those who controlled the resources for those deemed less-than, degenerate, not pulling their own weight. Those condemning included newspapermen, real estate speculators, conservationists, medical doctors, a media broadcaster, agriculturalists, ministers, and a rabbi.</p>

<p>It is this mental construct that was adopted by the Nazis who murdered hundreds of thousands of children and adults under the <a href="https://www.hmd.org.uk/learn-about-the-holocaust-and-genocides/nazi-persecution/disabled-people/">T4Programme</a> starting as early as 1939. Germany passed a law in 1933 that legalized sterilization of hundreds of thousands of people labeled physically or mentally impaired. This law was based on American precedent – the <a href="https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/buck-v-bell-1927">Buck vs Bell</a> Supreme Court case of 1927 that legitimized forced government sterilization. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Sterilization_Act_of_1924">Virginia Eugenical Sterilization Act</a> of was based on model&nbsp; legislation developed at the Cold Springs Harbor Eugenics Records Office by Harry Laughlin, a close associate of Ezra Gosney and Paul Popenhoe.</p>
<p>The systems of industrialized mass murder first used by the Nazis on the disabled were then scaled for deployment in forced labor prisons like Auschwitz-Birkenau. For a detailed look into the inter-generational impact of one woman’s murder after being institutionalized for a mental breakdown, see Andreas Heckler’s 2017 long-form essay for Disability Studies Quarterly, “<a href="https://dsq-sds.org/article/view/5573/4651">Diagnoses That Matter: My Great Grandmother’s Murder as One Deemed ‘Unworthy of Living’ and Its Impact on Our Family</a>.” The screenshot below is taken from that article. Emilie Rau fell into a depression after her husband, who had a harsh temper, was injured and became unable to support their family of four children. The institution into which her husband placed her severely limited visitation and would not release her to return home, stating that her condition was incurable. Her unwillingness to work led to her being of over 10,000 people identified for euthanasia in the gas chambers of <a href="https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/american-soldiers-uncover-medical-mass-murder-hadamar">Hadamar,</a> “house of shutters,” in the first years of the war.</p>

<p>The following selection is from the 2020 East Tennessee University graduate thesis of Cameron Williams, “<a href="https://dsq-sds.org/article/view/5573/4651">A Study of the United States’ Influence on German Eugenics</a>:”</p>
<blockquote><p>American eugenicists enjoyed a strong position in the international community and were admired by their European counterparts for their success in influencing legislation and gaining extensive financial support for the American eugenics’ movement. The German racial hygiene movement, in fact, followed developments in the United States closely. During the First World War the Society for Racial hygiene began to distribute a public flyer extolling the “dedication with which Americans sponsor research in the field of racial hygiene and with which they translate theoretical knowledge into practical.” The previously mentioned flyer was in reference to a donation of several million dollars by a widow of a railway magnate in support of Cold Spring Harbor. Also mentioned was the foundation established in 1915 following a eugenics conference held in Battle Creek, Michigan, which provided over three-hundred thousand dollars for conferences and exhibitions in the field of eugenics. The flyer also claimed that even American farmers believed that racial hygiene was the most important question of the century. It praised the funding of state commissions that attempted to awaken the nation to a eugenic centered consciousness. It applauded the control of immigration through legislation as well as laws in twelve states that regarded the prevention of procreation of “inferior families”.56 The Society for Racial Hygiene concluded that Americans recognized the “critical importance” of race improvement and were eager to adopt measures to further this goal.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you try on the lens that the latter half of the twentieth century, and now the twenty-first, has largely been about using manufactured scarcity, military R&amp;D, radiological exposure, re-engineered food, and poisoned ecosystems to advance the Oliver Reiser-Julius Stulman-Ervin Laszlo-Fritz Kunz World Brain agenda, you can see how the pre-WWII ethos of eugenics in the United States and abroad, wrapped in social progressivism, effectively set the stage for much of what has followed.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Winslow_Taylor">Frederick Winslow Taylor</a> could only dream of a future where flesh-bound, fallible humans were replaced by programmed avatars functioning with supreme efficiency, never getting tired, never asserting their own ideas, never asking for a raise. The video below is a site visit I made last summer to the SEPTA bus depot, which was the site of Midvale Steel where Taylor refined his principles in scientific management while working on Naval contracts for the Spanish American War. I read from John Trudell’s 1980 incredibly moving and prescient speech “<a href="https://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/trudellwearepower.html">We Are Power</a>.”</p>

<p>The eugenicist Von KleinSmid, USC administrator and Human Betterment Foundation member, oversaw the creation of the first film studies program in the nation. Cecille B. DeMille funded the photography classes and teaching partnerships with many early actors and directors in 1929. Fast forward seventy-five years, and we get the Institute for Creative Technologies at the University of Southern California, a testing laboratory for the creation of synthetic people.</p>
<p>USC ICT was birthed from a <a href="https://archive.ph/AxNim">1996 collaboration</a> of the Hollywood special effects industry and defense interests hosted by the National Research Council and chaired by Mike Zyda. In 1986, Zyda, a computer science professor at the Naval Post Graduate School in Monterrey, founded a special research group, NPSNET, to develop gaming simulation technology for the military including virtual world building and America’s Army Game. Other participants included <a href="https://archive.ph/I6xMN">Gilman Louie</a> who would go on to found Niantic and <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/349407-Alexander_Singer">Alexander Singer</a>, Star Trek producer who created a short film to demonstrate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO7gN1lvjU">augmented cognition</a>.</p>

<p>Reflecting on my “Digital Babies” piece, what more perverse “solution” could engineers’ minds come up with than extinguishing the materiality of living tissue and re-rendering it in efficient computational formats? Nanotechnology is central to such an effort, and it was launched at Caltech. Richard Feynman introduced the concept of nanotechnology to the world with he “<a href="https://web.pa.msu.edu/people/yang/RFeynman_plentySpace.pdf">Plenty of Room at the Bottom</a>,” lecture given in December 1959 in Pasadena to the American Physical Society.</p>
<p>Feynman taught at Caltech from 1950 to 1988, winning the Nobel Prize in 1965 for discoveries in quantum electrodynamics relating to how subatomic particles interact with light. In 2018 there was a <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/remembering-richard-feynman-81875">celebration of his life</a> on what would have been his 100th birthday coordinated by the following divisions of the university involved in carrying forward his research: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1733907&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">Caltech Institute for Quantum Information and Matter;</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://burkeinstitute.caltech.edu/AboutTheInstitute">Walter Burke Institute for Theoretical Physics</a> (Burke was a financial advisor to Sherman Fairchild a major shareholder in IBM who increased his fortune from inventions in avionic photography and semiconductors); <a href="http://kni.caltech.edu/about">Kavli Nanoscience Institute</a> (operating since 2003 and developed origami DNA in 2006); and the <a href="https://www.moore.org/grant-detail?grantId=GBMF412">Nanoscale Systems Initiative</a> established in 2004 with a $25 million gift from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. Gordon created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore’s Law</a>, was co-founder of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Fairchild Semiconductor</a> and Intel, and <a href="https://www.medalofphilanthropy.org/betty-gordon-moore-moores-law-giving/">Betty</a> was an employee of the Ford Foundation.</p>
<p>Perhaps in the age of Huxley’s high-tech eugenics, water-based beings will be deemed too bulky for “interplanetary” (“inter-dimensional”) travel. Some days it feels like natural humans (and all other watery beings) are Pasadena’s plump, juicy citrus of the 1960s facing off against <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/lifestyle/how-nasa-made-tang-cool">TANG</a>. Suck out the water, crystallize vitality, toss in a few chemical additives, and store on a shelf for future use. Seriously, let’s not do this. I don’t want to go to “Mars” that badly.</p>

The people who work in these arenas are tasked with delivering ruthless anti-life efficiencies. Make it a game; spackle Star Wars “hero’s journey” branding over the rough edges; and wrap it in an aura of novelty and exclusivity. Then people will beat a path to your door to boost their children into a Flat Stanley world run by military psychologists dialing up custom realities with internet of everything quantum supercomputers.</p>
<p>Given that many of the eugenics programs centered mental and physical deficiencies that impacted the abilities of adults to participate in economically productive work, it’s not much of a stretch to envision a future where AI synthetic therapists pull panopticon data on individuals deemed at-risk of falling out of compliance with the consensus reality, assign them mental health diagnoses, and issue treatment orders for ICT reprogramming or containment. We can only hope there are no Hadamars this time around.</p>
<p>Our nation’s eugenics history has not disappeared. Some of the most sinister tendencies had gone underground. Some of them have been rebranded in socially acceptable terms. The fact that we rarely teach youth contextualized history means velvet glove brutality can hide in plain sight in the land of movie stars and militarized digital “magic.”</p>
<p>It is my contention before society acquiesces to incorporating biology and thought forms into cyber-physical systems, we must have a better understanding of the ways in which scientific management principles have been used over the past century to dehumanize and degrade labor. Against a backdrop of eugenics, are we willing to disrespect the bodies birthed by our mothers and trade them for cyborg puppet avatars with holographic capabilities?</p>
<p>Is that really the world we are leaving for the children, so California’s modern day eugenicists can bring Julian Huxley’s plans to fruition?</p>

<p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>Believe it or not, it’s July already, and we’re more than happy to share that we continue to meet milestones in our development. Our first proof-of-concept for a DeFi integration is complete, we’re moving forward with research that will empower the zero-knowledge community, and partnership opportunities keep arising everywhere.</p><p>Let’s jump right into our monthly update.</p> Tech and Product  Advanced Staking testing <p>We’ve constantly reiterated the importance of Advanced Staking as a predecessor to Panther’s v1. This is because the primitives used in Advanced Staking will be key to designing and building Panther’s Multi-Asset Shielded Pools.</p><p>Zafari, our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testing-for-zkp-advanced-staking-is-now-live-19b51bc6b42b/">incentivized testing program</a>, continues to provide invaluable feedback for our upcoming Advanced Staking program.</p><p>In addition to last month’s findings, testers managed to catch a few urgent and high-priority bugs, as well as other lower-priority items throughout. While feedback has now slowed down as the system has already been thoroughly explored, we haven’t. Our team is hard at work fixing the last batch of bugs, and we will soon be able to swiftly roll out Advanced Staking on Polygon.</p> DeFi integration <p>While Advanced Staking progresses, we have successfully finished the first proof-of-concept of a DeFi integration. Through it, users can utilize Panther to access DeFi privately, interacting with protocols in a way very similar to what they’re used to.</p><p>The importance of a DeFi-compatible privacy solution cannot be overstated! Enabling the Multi-Asset Shielded Pools to augment DeFi as a whole with privacy lays the foundation for bringing trust to DeFi via Panther’s flexible disclosure capabilities.</p><p>More news on this, pronto.</p> Community and business development  Released our one-pager <p>As builders of a pioneering blockchain privacy protocol, we are tasked with introducing people not only to the need for privacy, but to its solution as well. Since this happens almost on a daily basis, we decided to create the most digestible (but still thorough!) explanation of Panther to this day.</p><p>We’ve redesigned the <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.pdf">Panther One-Pager</a>. It contains all the central points to grasp why PriFi is deeply necessary and how Panther is the perfect solution for enabling it, within a single standard sheet of paper!</p> New Panther Blog &amp; Panther Academy <p>The <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/">Panther Blog</a> went through a complete UX redesign. We’ve organized content by categories, removed cluttering elements from its interface, and added a dark mode, in addition to many other noticeable improvements. The Panther Blog is now easier to navigate and friendlier than ever! Our re-vamp also touched on technical aspects that make our blog easier to find through search engines and news feeds. All our precious existing content is still available with the same URLs for you to share.</p><p>Part of the reason to put in the effort and redesign our blog came from our plans to launch a valuable initiative from Panther for the crypto community: The <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/tag/academy/">Panther Academy</a>. Our goal with the Academy is to improve accessibility to high-quality crypto education, even for subjects that could be considered basic by our audience of mainly hardcore privacy enthusiasts. Those interested in diving deeper into crypto, DeFi, and privacy can now come and learn about these subjects from us.</p><p>Our first Panther Academy article is already out and tackles <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bitcoin-tumblers-privacy-coins-and-prifi-private-crypto/">private crypto transactions</a>. Don’t forget to give it a read and share it with your privacy-curious friends!</p> Unofficial local language Twitter accounts <p>Panther Ambassadors have been doing a more than impressive job at spreading the Panther Gospel to non-English-speaking countries. We now have three unofficial Twitter accounts; in <a href="http://twitter.com/zkpantherES">Español</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/zkpantherTR">Türkçe</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/zkpantherFR">Français</a>! </p><p>Here’s to all of our amazing ambassadors.</p> 12k followers in CMC Gravity <p>In order to kickstart our <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/gravity/profile/PantherProtocol">CoinMarketCap Gravity</a> following, we hosted a <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther/status/1533888810991370240">giveaway</a> offering a $2500 $ZKP prize pool. Three weeks later, we can say with no doubt that it was a success.</p><p>Panther has attained the number one spot in engagement growth in CoinMarketCap’s blogging platform! That’s a pretty good reason to celebrate, don’t you think?</p><p>Panther’s CMC Gravity account now has over 12,000 followers, growing by almost a thousand daily. If you’re not among them, you know what to do: <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/gravity/profile/PantherProtocol">follow us now</a>!</p> zTalks #2 <p>The second episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mXHeo2FvUQ">Panther zTalks</a> touched on multiple intriguing subjects: </p>  The role of cryptography experts in Panther  Why we <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-joins-zprize-and-industry-leaders-to-further-the-zero-knowledge-industry-391a494a58d6/">foster the zero-knowledge field</a>  How significant is Advanced Staking in Panther’s roadmap  <p>… and so much more.</p><p>Our Senior Architect, Adam Spiers, was a new addition to our team members’ panel for this episode. Show it some love, and remember to subscribe to our Youtube account!</p> Events  Oliver and Mike in Consensus 2022 <p>Our Co-Founder and CEO Oliver Gale and Mike Chan, Head of Marketing, were present at <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus2022/">Consensus 2022</a>, the largest crypto and blockchain event worldwide. The conference hosting 500+ speakers from within and outside the cryptosphere took place in Austin, Texas, from June 9th to 12th.</p><p>Lots of partnerships talks, great panels about privacy, and walking around in Panther swag ensued.</p>Oliver and Mike in full Panther style. Anish and Saif at NFT NYC <p>On <a href="http://www.nft.nyc/">NFT NYC</a>’s 4th edition, Panther was well-represented by two heavy hitters of our tech team: Anish Mohammed, our Co-Founder, CTO, and Chief Scientist, and Saif Akhtar, our Head of Product. The conference featured 1500 speakers and over 14k attendees. </p><p>Why are we attending NFT conferences, you might be asking? Well, because privacy for NFTs is definitely necessary, creating a fertile land for Panther to explore.</p><p>To learn why, check out this great <a href="https://twitter.com/OriginalOlii/status/1540106469013610503">thread</a> by CEO Oliver Gale.</p> Features &amp; Media  Anish AMA with Bittrex &amp; interview on XT Cast <p>Bittrex was one of our first exchange partners to list $ZKP.

Finance <p>As of late, crypto has become <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/the-ultimate-irony-thoughts-on-the-state-of-our-markets-1de4a5c8bec3/">increasingly correlated</a> with the stock market’s movements. These, in turn, are undeniably linked to interest rates set by the Federal Reserve. Yahoo! Finance’s article on <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/impact-did-fed-interest-rate-152256883.html">the impact of the interest rate hikes on crypto</a> counted on the expert opinion of none other than Oliver Gale, our Co-Founder and CEO. In his thought-provoking words:</p><blockquote>“Cryptoassets are experiencing the fastest growth of any technology industry in history – almost twice the pace at which the internet was adopted in the 1990s. Despite a bump in the road here, this trend is still intact and will resume in the next year or two. For now, we have to bide our time until inflation is brought down.”</blockquote><p>Worth a read!</p> Hirings <p>This month, we hired new Panthers for the following positions:</p>  Head of Compliance  Content Writer &amp; Social Media Manager  Head of Community  <p>Several roles remain open on our <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol">Angel.co page</a>:</p>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2172598-graphic-designer">Graphic Designer</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2204245-applied-mathematician">Applied Mathematician</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2221049-blockchain-architect">Blockchain Architect</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2204246-cryptographic-engineer">Cryptographic Engineer</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2142601-cryptography-internship">Cryptography Internship</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2221050-cryptography-researcher-zero-knowledge-proofs">Cryptography Researcher (Zero-Knowledge Proofs)</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2227585-full-stack-developer">Full-Stack Developer</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2227586-lead-front-end-developer">Lead Front-end Developer</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2109231-machine-learning-internship">Machine Learning Internship</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2227587-senior-solidity-developer">Senior Solidity Developer</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2198464-defi-research-analyst">DeFi Research Analyst</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2009427-product-marketing-intern">Product Marketing Intern</a>  <p>If you wish to work with us or know someone who might be a good fit, please apply right away!</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

BlockWallet is here to ensure that on-chain privacy does not lag behind. The wallet provides a set of advanced privacy tools wrapped in a familiar and user-friendly wallet experience, eliminating friction and making privacy accessible for everyone.</p><p>BlockWallet protects you and ensures privacy by default. When you make transactions or interact with blockchain apps, BlockWallet routes all node requests through Privacy Proxies, which mask the IP address and other metadata, that can be used to identify and track you on a blockchain. You can also use the Privacy Pools feature, powered by <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/zk-snarks">zk-SNARKs</a> technology, to deposit and mix funds in a smart contract. This allows transferring funds without links to your main wallet. BlockWallet offers integrated Flash-Bot Protection, shielding you from sandwich attacks when you trade on DEXes. Meanwhile, the Phishing Protection feature helps you combat phishing scams by generating unique artwork on all sensitive pages.</p><p>BlockWallet is not a compromise. It’s privacy-first, but it still packs all features you would expect from a wallet. With full Web 3.0 support, the wallet allows you to connect to any&nbsp;DApp.</p><p>Become a part of the BlockWallet community today:</p><p><a href="https://blockwallet.io/">Homepage</a> | <a href="https://blockwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/GetBlockWallet">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/blockwallet">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://discord.gg/69gvNKatdb">Discord</a> | <a href="https://discord.com/invite/EKVZ2xWXEH">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="http://hello@blockwallet.io/">E-mail</a></p>

<p></p><p>Web 5 is a decentralized platform that provides a new identity layer for the web to enable decentralized apps and protocols.</p><p>In the current web model, users do not own their data or identity. They are given accounts by companies and their data is held captive in app silos. To create a new class of decentralized apps and protocols that put individuals at the center, we must empower them with self-owned identity and restore control over their data.</p><p>This platform embraces the convenience of Web 2 but it also returns control back to the users, an ethos of Web 3. The harmony of these two views is what we're calling Web 5.</p><p></p> Components of Web 5<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>There are three main pillars of the decentralized web platform, all of which are based on open standards.</p><p></p> Decentralized Identifiers<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>The identifiers we know and use today are owned by the government, a company, an organization, or some other intermediary. For example, our email addresses and social media handles are identifiers associated with us but are owned and controlled by the service providers. These companies have the right to ban, disable, or delete these identifiers and we have little to no control over this.</p><p>So before we can realize truly decentralized applications, we need decentralized identifiers that users own and control. This removes the dependency on centralized entities to authenticate and represent us.</p><p>​​<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs) are a W3C proposed recommendation with a standardized structure that essentially links to you and your information.</p><p></p><p>They are a long string of text that consists of three parts:</p>  the URI scheme identifier, which is did  the identifier for a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-methods">DID method</a>  the DID method-specific identifier  <p>Storing DIDs on <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">ION</a> (a Layer 2 DID network that runs on top of Bitcoin) is a preferred design decision for the implementation of Web 5. ION is a decentralized replacement for DNS for identity identifiers, so there are no authorities, coordinators, tokens, or other centralized bottleneck.</p><p>DIDs are the only component of Web5 that touch a blockchain, which is generally limited to anchoring the keys/endpoints linked to the ID.</p><p>That being said, anchoring DIDs on Bitcoin (or any blockchain) is not a requirement. In fact, what's great about having the standardized formatting for DIDs is that they can be anchored anywhere or not anchored at all and this still works, although with varying levels of decentralization.</p><p>Here are examples of DIDs on the Bitcoin blockchain, the Ethereum blockchain, and the web. Notice they all use the same format: scheme, DID method, and DID method-specific identifier.</p>   <code>did:btcr:xyv2-xzpq-q9wa-p7t<br>did:ens:some.eth<br>did:web:example.com<br></code>   <p>Because personal data is not stored on the blockchain, the DID essentially acts as a URI that associates the subject of the DID (the person, company, or object being identified) with a DID document that lives off-chain.</p><p>DID Documents are JSON files stored in decentralized storage systems such as IPFS, and describe how to interact with the DID subject. The DID Document contains things like the DID subject's public keys, authentication and verification methods, and service endpoints that reference the locations of the subject’s data.</p>   <code>{<br>  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",<br>  "id": "did:ion:EiClkZMDxPKqC9c-umQfTkR8",<br>  "verificationMethod": [<br>    {<br>      "id": "did:ion:EiClkZMDxPKqC9c-umQfTkR8",<br>      "type": "Secp256k1VerificationKey2018",<br>      "controller": "did:ion:EiClkZMDxPKqC9c-umQfTkR8"<br>    }<br>  ],<br>  "authentication": ["did:ion:EiClkZMDxPKqC9c-umQfTkR8"]<br>}<br></code>    Verifiable Credentials<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> are a fully ratified W3C standard that work hand in hand with Decentralized Identifiers to enable trustless interactions - meaning two parties do not need to trust one another to engage, but claims made about a DID subject can be verified.</p><p>For example, Alice needs to prove she has a bank account at Acme Bank. Acme Bank issues a cryptographically signed Verifiable Credential which would be stored in Alice's identity wallet.</p><p></p><p>The credential contains the issuer as Acme and the subject as Alice, as well as the claims, which are Alice's account number and full name.</p><p>Upon request for proof of banking, Alice presents the Verifiable Credential that's cryptographically signed by both Alice as well as her bank.</p><p>This is an easy, machine-readable way to share credentials across the web. The Verifier does not know or trust Alice, but they do consider Acme trustworthy, and they have essentially vouched for Alice therefore distributing trust.</p> Decentralized Web Nodes<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Today, centralized entities act as our data stores. Applications hold all of our content and preferences on their servers.</p><p><a href="https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/">Decentralized Web Nodes</a> (DWNs) change this by allowing us to decouple our data from the applications that we use, and instead host our data ourselves in our own personal data stores.</p><p><a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/">BlueSky</a> is a good example; it's a decentralized version of Twitter that's in the works. With BlueSky, your tweets and your connections aren't stored with the application. They are stored with you. So you can present your content on any decentralized social media app you want, not just BlueSky.</p><p>Your DWNs can hold both public and encrypted data. For example, in the case of a decentralized version of Twitter, you'd want data like your tweets and your connections to be public but things like your DMs to be private.</p><p>Your decentralized web nodes do not live on the blockchain. You can host your web nodes anywhere (your phone, computer, etc) and can replicate them across your devices and clouds and all data will be synced.</p><p></p><p>While self-hosting your DWNs provides a means for decentralizing your data, we recognize some users will be more comfortable with others hosting their web nodes for convenience sake. We envision there will be vendors offering to host your web nodes for you. The good part about that is you can encrypt any private data so unlike today where cloud hosts can scan everything that you host there, you can still maintain some privacy even if you have your web nodes hosted by intermediaries.</p><p>Your DWNs are associated with your Decentralized Identifiers and are listed in a DID document.</p><p>Notice the <code>serviceEndpoint</code> section of the DID doc specifies service endpoints and provides URIs to the decentralized web nodes.</p>   <code>{<br>  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",<br>  "id": "did:web:example.com:u:alice",<br>  "service": [<br>    {<br>      "id": "#dwn",<br>      "type": "DecentralizedWebNode",<br>      "serviceEndpoint": {<br>        "nodes": ["https://dwn.example.com", "00:11:22:33:FF:EE"]<br>      }<br>    }<br>  ],<br>  "verificationMethod": [<br>    {<br>      "id": "did:web:example.com:u:alice",<br>      "type": "Secp256k1VerificationKey2018",<br>      "controller": "did:web:example.com:u:alice"<br>    }<br>  ],<br>  "authentication": ["did:web:example.com:u:alice"]<br>}<br></code>   <p>Given an application has the address to your DWN, they can send you a request for data.</p><p>This represents a request from an application to obtain all objects within a DWN that follow the <code>SocialMediaPosting</code> schema:</p>   <code>    POST https://dwn.example.com/<br>    BODY {<br>      "requestId": "c5784162-84af-4aab-aff5-f1f8438dfc3d",<br>      "target": "did:example:123",<br>      "messages": [<br>        {<br>          "descriptor": {<br>            "method": "CollectionsQuery",<br>            "schema": "https://schema.org/SocialMediaPosting"<br>          }<br>        },<br>        {...}<br>      ]<br>    }<br></code>   <p>The data within DWNs are JSON objects that follow a universal standard, thus making it possible for any application to discover and process the data given its semantic type.</p><p>If this data is public, those objects will be automatically returned to the application, and if the data is private, the node owner would need to grant the application access to that data.</p> Identity Wallets<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Obviously all of this is pretty complicated, especially for non-technical users. So we need a simplistic, easy to use interface that will allow people to access and manage their identity.</p><p>A well designed identity wallet would provide ways to manage the data stored in decentralized web nodes, the decentralized IDs and the context in which they should be used, verifiable credentials, and authorizations.</p><p></p> Decentralized Web Apps<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Web 5 enables developers to build decentralized web applications (DWAs) on top of it and it’s all open source! You're free to use it as your foundation and focus your attention on what you really care about, your app. Web5 brings to DWAs what cloud and application servers bring to enterprise apps. It does the hard part. It brings decentralization. By building your apps on top of Web 5, you get decentralization and identity and data management as part of the platform.</p><p>This is definitely a fundamental change in how we exchange data, but it's not a total overhaul of the web we already know. This works like Progressive Web Apps, but you'd add the decentralized web node SDK and then applications are free to really go serverless because the data isn't stored with them.</p><p></p><p>The sky's the limit to what you can build on top of this platform, but here are some cool basic examples.</p> Music Applications<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>No one likes recreating their music playlists over and over again for different apps. With Web 5, you wouldn't have to do that.</p><p>In this example, Groove has access to write to Alice's decentralized web node and adds a new entry.</p><p>Tidal has access to read from Alice's DWN, so can read the new entry that was added by Groove, and now Alice has her playlist readily available on both apps.</p><p></p><p>With the continuous utilization of the data across apps, not only do Groove and Tidal get access to Alice's data, but they use it to improve her user experience, thus creating a stronger experience than Alice could have ever gotten had she not used this tech.</p> Travel Applications<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Your travel preferences, tickets, and reservations are scattered across so many different hotels, airlines, rental car agencies and travel apps, making it really difficult to coordinate. Heaven forbid there's any hiccup in the system such as a delayed flight.

<p>Privacy in crypto is an ongoing major theme, shaping innovations and driving discussions in the ecosystem. <br></p><p>The idea that all cryptocurrencies are private is fairly attractive and a narrative that has been sold to newcomers countlessly. After all, who would not want full control over their information and guaranteed coin security?<br></p><p>As enticing as the concept of default privacy in crypto sounds, it has (with exceptions) always been nothing but a common misconception, particularly on public blockchain networks, which represent the majority in the crypto space. Therefore, it is imperative to find a solution to interact on the blockchain without giving away sensitive, personal information. It’s also worth noting that a sustainable privacy solution can only be achieved by taking back control over our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/philosophy-legality-and-economics-of-privacy-how-privacy-spans-through-most-areas-of-our-lives-1b0d48945291/">privacy</a> while remaining within the boundaries of legislation and compliance.<br></p><p>In this article, we will explore the concept of on-chain privacy, why most cryptocurrencies are not private, and how this takes a toll on coin security. We will look into privacy coins and the validity of their claims towards creating private blockchains. Finally, we’ll explore the viability of achieving privacy in a <a href="https://www.leewayhertz.com/cross-chain-defi-technology/">cross-chain</a> interoperable DeFi ecosystem while achieving regulatory compliance.<br></p> Why blockchain anonymity is (for the most part) a myth <p>When Bitcoin emerged a decade ago, it promised an idea of pseudonymity and privacy. Naturally, people were excited about the ability to transact without giving up their personal information, unlike in traditional financial services. <br></p><p>At the time, few people noticed an inherent contradiction: On one side, the supposed pseudo-anonymity stood, and on the other, never-seen-before transparency was the major selling point of Bitcoin.<br></p>Bitcoin traceability diagram (<a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/protect-your-privacy">Source</a>)<p>Every transaction and activity related to interacting with the Bitcoin blockchain is recorded on an immutable ledger. No one can change the records afterward, nor could anyone conspire to alter the ledger. Yet, the Bitcoin blockchain has more than an unalterable bookkeeping function— it is <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/btc/blocks">completely public</a>. Whereas banks can only reveal a statement to its account owner and maybe law enforcement, on the Bitcoin network, everyone can access all the information stored on the blockchain. <br></p><p>Taking this into consideration, “are Bitcoin transactions traceable?” is an incomplete question at best.<br></p> How do cryptocurrency transactions get traced?<br> <p>Given a Bitcoin address, you can check every transaction that ever involved it. You can also easily see how much Bitcoin it holds. Although the faces behind the addresses are hidden, every transaction is public. And, while Bitcoin is often lauded as a completely private and anonymous way to transact, there are ways that users' identities can be revealed. For example, if someone's identity is linked to their Bitcoin address, any transactions they make can be <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/protect-your-privacy">traced</a> back to them.<br></p><p>While chain analysis is something anti-crime organizations perform to take down criminals, there are also cases of users’ identities being tracked in the most mundane settings. A typical case occurs because virtual asset service providers (<a href="https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/what-are-virtual-asset-service-providers-vasp/">VASPs</a>) like crypto exchanges are required to comply with know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. Any transaction in or out of a crypto exchange wallet leaves a clear trail connecting all self-custody wallets to their user’s identity. This opens a door for law enforcement to subpoena the exchange for their KYC records and the user's transactions can be made transparent.<br></p><p>While Bitcoin promised anonymity, it could only deliver pseudonymity. Individuals who wanted to keep their transactions fully private searched for and developed methods to stay private, leading to the rise of <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bitcoin-tumblers-privacy-coins-and-prifi-private-crypto/">Bitcoin mixers and coin tumblers</a>. In essence, the transparent nature of Bitcoin made it impossible for anyone to use the network privately.<br></p> Why are blockchain networks open and transparent? Why this is good for coin security? <p>Most cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks are open and transparent, for reasons that may surprise you. The founding idea behind Bitcoin, the mother of all cryptocurrencies and blockchains, is decentralization. And the concept of decentralization has been thrown around in crypto-centric circles enough for many to not know what it means anymore.<br></p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/02/17/bitcoins-value-depends-on-its-decentralization/">Decentralization</a>, in simple terms, means dissolving central authority and giving the right of governance to the stakeholders involved in the system, giving full control back to the ordinary user. <br></p><p>The idea of decentralization is quite familiar to how democracies work where instead of a single ruler making all the decisions, a government is mainly composed of an executive, legislative, and judiciary power keeping a check on each other. Similarly, decentralization takes the power from a single centralized authority and distributes it among all network participants keeping a check on each other. <br></p><p>Bitcoin is decentralized, as no company or group can lay claim to being decision-makers on the network. Unlike banks and governments, no one can freeze a person's access to the blockchain. However, this lack of a central authority poses a need for accountability of transactions since there are no governing bodies to verify them.<br></p><p>The Bitcoin network maintains its miners honest by issuing rewards to those that agree on an immutable network state. However, by design, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin-mining.asp">miners</a> alone shouldn't be trusted to verify transactions, as they’re likely to act in a way that maximizes their profit. Therefore, the network was made transparent and public so that anyone with access to the Internet could run a <a href="https://www.bitpanda.com/academy/en/lessons/what-is-a-bitcoin-node/">Bitcoin node</a> and personally confirm if the miners' verification claims were true. <br></p><p>In this way, it wouldn’t be wrong to say that the radical transparency of public blockchains is both a feature and a bug. But doesn’t change the fact that It is secured with the same level of security employed by banks, the military, and virtual private networks (VPNs) to encrypt their systems: the 256-bit SHA hash algorithms. However, SHA hash functions provide each transaction a distinct fingerprint that cannot be reversed, unlike encryption, which can be decoded. Meaning that it grants your coin security.<br><br></p>Bitcoin – a shared public ledger. (<a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/how-it-works">Source</a>) Need for privacy coins <p>Privacy coins were born as a next step in the evolution of cryptocurrency. <br></p><p>Bitcoin’s creator(s) never had access to the technology necessary to make transactions that were fully private possible. And, in their defense, “are Bitcoin transactions traceable” could’ve been taken as a silly question before the development of chain analysis tools and in an early stage of the network. <br></p><p>As soon as these standards were reached, new initiatives to restore true control over information to the average user and counterbalance the excess of transparency in the crypto space emerged. The earliest private blockchains such as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2021/08/03/satoshi-nakamoto-collaborator-says-his-bitcoin-fork-zcash-should-go-proof-of-stake-and-wind-down-its-carbon-footprint/?sh=610aa2d47449">Zcash</a> were forked from the Bitcoin network. They adhered to the fundamental aspects of blockchain technology and the solutions that cryptocurrencies offered, but every similarity ended there. <br></p><p>Private blockchain networks didn’t take the path of open-ledger technology with all transactions open to the public along with receivers' and senders' addresses, amount of coins transferred, history of all transactions associated with addresses, etc. They, on the other hand, enabled users to conceal all these details.<br></p><p>Privacy-focused blockchains utilize privacy settings and advanced technologies like <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ring-signatures-vs-zksnarks-comparing-privacy-technologies/">ring signatures</a>, zero-knowledge proofs, and stealth addresses. Some of them have been largely successful at maintaining their users’ privacy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">Zero-knowledge proofs</a>, one of the most exciting technologies used in them, ensure that you can see that a transaction was successful but know nothing else about it –which, as you will learn, can have many applications.</p> Examples and comparison of privacy coins <p>The most popular privacy coins include Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC), and Secret (SCRT). Other popular options are Beam, Grin, Verge, and Horizon (ZEN). These cryptocurrencies use different technologies and cryptographic protocols to keep their users anonymous.<br></p><p>Out of all privacy coins, Monero and Zcash are the most well-known and have the highest market cap. Let’s have a look at these top two privacy coins and how they differ in terms of technology to enable privacy. <br></p>Comparison between Monero, Zcash, and Dash. (<a href="https://medium.com/@tabul8tor/privacy-coins-monero-dash-and-zcash-compared-686fdae6c0ba">Source</a>) Monero <p>Monero (XMR) has made a name for itself in the crypto space as a leader in the private cryptocurrency space. The network uses ring signatures and stealth addresses to hide the identities of both parties in a transaction, as well as Ring Confidential Transactions (<a href="https://unblock.net/ringct-vs-zk-snark/">RingCT</a>) to hide the amount involved in any transaction.<br></p><p>Unlike some of its competitors, Monero is a private-by-default blockchain. Although some groups have proclaimed to have cracked Monero's technology, most of those claims are largely disputed by the blockchain community.<br></p> Zcash <p>Forked from Bitcoin, Zcash famously <a href="https://nakamoto.com/zcash-the-https-of-blockchains/">claims</a> to be “HTTPS if Bitcoin stands for HTTP”. Using advanced cryptography, Zcash allows its users to shield their transactions. Its zero-knowledge proof setup also facilitates shielded transactions, allowing users to send and receive coins without revealing their addresses to third parties.<br></p><p>Zcash’s ZK proofs also hide transaction amounts, adding an extra layer of privacy. Its technology is widely used in the crypto space today, adopted by many as a transparent way to access privacy. Like Monero, the network has been successful at keeping its users’ privacy.</p> Private but flawed: The drawbacks of private blockchains and privacy coins <p>Most privacy coins are true to their promise of anonymity, but it comes at a huge opportunity cost. In the past couple of years, the rise of decentralized financial services (DeFi) and Web3 has clouded the crypto space at large. Built on the ethos of cypherpunks and leveraging blockchain technology, the DeFi ecosystem offers almost all of the financial services seen in traditional finance, but without trusted third parties or middlemen.<br></p><p>But there's a caveat: the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/institutional-defi-the-next-big-thing-a5b07193232b/">DeFi ecosystem</a> at large is built on top of public blockchain networks. The same blockchain networks that antagonize private transactions or privacy in general. Privacy coins, on the other hand, offer top-notch privacy but lag behind in terms of DeFi innovations. <br></p><p>Furthermore, building a DeFi ecosystem on privacy coin networks would be like reinventing the wheel. Building a new DeFi ecosystem in silos rather than fixing privacy on existing DeFi carries along a range of complexities such as attracting new capital, training developers, fixing the same old <a href="https://analyticsindiamag.com/understanding-ethereums-scalability-problems-and-the-solution-on-the-horizon/">scalability issues</a>, etc.<br></p><p>The combination of complexities involved in building a new DeFi ecosystem, along with the composability issues in the existing DeFi ecosystem severely limits the prospects of private blockchains. This limits users’ privacy to mere simple wallet-A-to-wallet-B transactions, while missing out on financial services such as lending, borrowing, yield farming, stablecoins, decentralized exchanges, and <a href="https://defillama.com/top-protocols">many more</a>. <br></p> Regulatory compliance<br> <p>Another major drawback of privacy coins is regulatory compliance. Even though privacy coins allow users to hide their sensitive information from public view, it then becomes tricky for them to prove they’re compliant, or to do so without disclosing all their information..<br></p><p>Solution offering privacy without achieving regulatory compliance will always end up in a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/regulators-dial-up-the-heat-dash-zec-and-monero-reach-boiling-point">tussle with regulators</a>. This creates the need for a privacy solution that achieves regulatory compliance through voluntary, selective disclosures.<br></p> Panther Protocol: driving interchain privacy with compliance<br> <p>The Panther Protocol prides itself as an end-to-end solution to privacy in Web3 and DeFi. The protocol also seeks to aid financial institutions as they aim for regulatory-compliant participation in decentralized finance. Panther combines the power of blockchain privacy with transparency, restoring trust in the system without sacrificing privacy.<br></p><p>Panther adopts <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zksnarks-through-the-lens-of-a-cypherpunk-f9f72a0f5bcd/">zk-SNARKs</a> cryptography, allowing users to perform shielded transactions across DeFi platforms with zero-knowledge proofs. Through a powerful multi-asset vault, the average cryptocurrency user can deposit their coins into Panther's vaults and mint a corresponding amount in zAssets (zero-knowledge, fully collateralized versions of the deposit). These zAssets support interoperability, allowing the user to move them across different blockchains and transact privately on public networks.<br></p> Panther protocol vs privacy coins <p>Panther's moat is in providing privacy in DeFi while allowing users to achieve compliance without sharing underlying data. Panther allows users to generate zero-knowledge reports to voluntarily disclose parts or their full transaction history with select counterparties.<br></p><p>Furthermore, Panther <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/privacy-finance-why-panther-is-different-and-necessary-e423b2993df9/">stands out</a> from the crowd because it provides privacy across several blockchain networks. When users deposits assets into Panther, they break the on-chain link but continue to perform on-chain activities privately using Panther's <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/minting-and-burning-zassets-a-semi-technical-deep-dive-18dea602a859/">zAssets</a>.<br></p><p>Panther’s vision is to provide privacy features and power of choice to the entire DeFi ecosystem, in which users have complete control of their data and an ability to reveal as much or as little as they want, to whomever they want, at all times.</p> So, are Bitcoin transactions traceable? Yes, very much. <p>Privacy on public blockchain networks is a myth, with the most popular cryptocurrencies only able to offer pseudonymity due to their transparency. Privacy coins have sprung up to fill the void, but their solutions do not make room for compliance or offer advanced financial services.<br></p><p>For a true solution to this dilemma, the crypto ecosystem needs to combine privacy, access to DeFi, selective transparency, and <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/interoperable-privacy-building-privacy-bridges-to-all-of-defi-2eaa89c9c7ac/">interoperability</a>. Every attempt that fails to meet any of these requirements will either result in a siloed ecosystem, lack of public interest, or in further violations to users’ privacy. Private chains, even if they support smart contracts, are therefore not a solution to the need for privacy across the blockchain scene.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

<p>Staking your DOT just got a whole lot easier with Polkadot’s new staking dashboard. This new interface offers an intuitive, user-friendly alternative to the Polkadot-JS Apps developer tool for DOT holders who want to stake natively on Polkadot.</p><p>The Polkadot ecosystem is getting a long overdue upgrade to its staking experience for less-technical DOT holders. The new <a href="https://staking.polkadot.network/dashboard">staking dashboard</a>, demonstrated today for the first time at <a href="https://decoded.polkadot.network/">Polkadot Decoded</a>, provides a simplified and streamlined interface to give users a more intuitive staking experience. Coupled with the expected launch of <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-nomination-pools">nomination pools</a> (currently live on Kusama only), the new dashboard eliminates the need for newer and less-technical DOT holders to stake via third-party staking service providers.</p><p>The dashboard is now available for the community to try out in beta, with several features to continue improving the staking experience planned for future updates.</p><p>Polkadot uses a variant of proof of stake called Nominated Proof-of-Stake, or NPoS, which enables DOT holders to help secure the network by selecting validators and staking their tokens to receive rewards. In addition to improving the user experience, the new staking dashboard is also designed to encourage more participation with native staking directly on the Relay Chain rather than using third-party applications and custodial services, helping ensure the network remains secure and decentralized.</p> Polkadot Staking Dashboard Beta <p>It’s now possible to manage all Polkadot staking functions through the staking dashboard. The interface works by connecting to your existing Polkadot wallet, with support for the Polkadot-JS Extension and Talisman for now, and support for Subwallet coming soon. Additionally, read-only accounts are supported, allowing you to connect any account on a read-only basis to track your staking activity. The dashboard currently has support for Polkadot, Kusama, and Westend networks.</p><p>The staking dashboard currently offers the following features and functionality:</p>  Research, favorite, and nominate your choice of validators  See your payouts history thanks to an opt-in Subscan API integration  Support for nomination pools (currently live on Kusama only)  Handy definitions for staking terminology  Support for read-only accounts on mobile devices  Extrinsic-related data fetched directly from RPC node for better decentralization  Network-wide staking metrics   App walkthrough  Overview <p>The Overview tab provides information about the state of the network, including the cumulative supply of DOT being staked globally and the number of nominators on the network earning rewards. There’s also information on your staking statistics, such as the amount you have staked vs your free unstaked balance and an overview of your recent staking payouts. The announcements section features recent news on the network’s staking parameters that may affect your staking positions.</p> Staking <p>You can view all the relevant information about your staking activities at a glance under the Staking section. The ‘Stake’ tab provides an overview of your current staking setup and lets you start or stop nominating, adjust the DOT amount bonded, choose and adjust your selected validators, and select your payout destination. The ‘Payouts’ tab shows insights on your recent history of staking payouts.</p> Validators <p>The ‘Validators’ tab allows you to see an overview of network validators and relevant statistics that could affect your nomination choices. You can sort validators by commission rate and exclude inactive validators, oversubscribed and blocked validators, validators charging 100% commission, and validators without an on-chain identity. Once you’ve identified your favorite validators, you can pin them to save them in the ‘Favorites’ tab for easier reference and selection.</p> Get started with the Staking Dashboard <p>Go to the <a href="https://staking.polkadot.network/dashboard">Staking Dashboard</a> to get started. Then, select ‘Connect’ to link an account from the compatible wallet extensions including Talisman and Polkadot-JS. Select ‘Read Only Accounts’ to import any account address directly into the dashboard.</p><p>Make sure your controller account and reward destination are set, then you’re ready to set up or modify your staking preferences. If you’re not familiar with any terms along the way, click the (i) to access the Staking Assistant.</p> Coming soon to the Staking Dashboard <p>The staking dashboard is a work in progress. There are two milestones active on Github [<a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard/milestone/5">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard/milestone/4">here</a>] at the time of writing aimed at getting the codebase production-ready and feature complete — so users can expect changes and improvements across the board.</p><p>In addition to improving the existing code, a range of other validator discovery improvements including a search bar, a validator metrics card, fairer nomination generation, and integration of the validator selection algorithm are on the agenda before the initial release. High-priority items like proxy account support and SubWallet extension support are also on the near-term roadmap.</p><p>With this first-class staking portal, the community now has an easy, modern, and advanced interface to stake directly on the Polkadot Relay Chain. This should encourage more network participation as users are given an easier way to stake directly (versus through trusted third-party services), and ultimately a more secure network.</p><p>User experience will continue to improve beyond the beta, and the dashboard should help to inspire other components that will contribute to a larger library of reusable, generic UX components for the ecosystem and complement the other application-side initiatives that include style guides, validator discovery, metrics, and future Polkadot APIs.</p><p>Have any feedback on the beta or suggestions for future functionality? Check out the <a href="https://staking.polkadot.network/dashboard#/feedback">feedback page</a> and leave your thoughts!</p><p>Interested in building on Polkadot or Kusama?<a href="https://info.polkadot.network/contact"> Get in touch</a>!</p>

         From Poker to Protocols                <p>By Sam Eifling</p><p>Published June 28, 2022</p>            <p>A lifelong competitor, Bryan Pellegrino is turning what might be crypto’s biggest challenge into his own game: connecting all blockchains securely, cheaply and efficiently.
</p>       



 
 
   
<p>In 2014 Bryan Pellegrino was one of the world’s best poker players, winning more money than ever—and having the most boring year of his life. The change felt sudden. After tens of thousands of hours of grinding online, and a big finish at the 2012 World Series of Poker, only fools or those new to the game would now play him online. What had once been his life’s great pursuit, working to outwit and outplay other poker stars, was reduced to a chore. Pellegrino sat in his apartment in Vancouver, British Columbia, staring at his laptop, playing rote perfection, pouncing on the rookies’ mistakes. “It was mind-numbing,” he says. “I felt like a monkey clicking buttons.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pellegrino had begun playing online poker at 15, well below legal gambling age, using an account his dad set up for him. Over a dozen years, poker helped Pellegrino travel the world for tournaments and for fun. He accumulated more than $500,000 in World Series of Poker purses alone. He spent 10 hours a day, for years, clicking through a half-dozen hands at a time. He’d won a fortune in return. But by 2014, his reputation had caught up with him, and there was no joy, challenge or purpose in playing the newbies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It felt incredible, he says, to be so good at something so hard. But poker had become a cul-de-sac. He knew, after he’d played this hand, there was going to be another, and another. There was no bigger point, no end goal. Once there was no one worth playing, the game wasn’t enough for Pellegrino. “I was just trying to be the best,” he says now. “Once I got there, I realized, hey—there’s no leverage. There’s no anything. I hadn’t realized until then, you need to focus on the utility payoff of what you’re doing.” So he closed his laptop and went looking for a payoff he could measure in more than money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Today Pellegrino is the co-founder and CEO of LayerZero Labs, a company that set out to solve one of the most fundamental, yet most difficult problems in the world of blockchains and cryptocurrencies. Pellegrino and his LayerZero co-founders Ryan Zarick and Caleb Banister—best friends since they worked together in computer network research labs at the University of New Hampshire—built a protocol that enables blockchains to communicate with each other frictionlessly, so people and programs can move assets or information across chains cheaply, swiftly and securely. They’ve named their new venture LayerZero because it offers a foundation with which any application on any blockchain (layer 1 or layer 2) can integrate. The ability for users to send information between blockchains is central to the promise of Web3, which some think will be the future of the internet. In this vision, the internet is organized on decentralized global ledgers called blockchains, allowing people to connect without central servers to store permanent digital records.</p>



<p>The problem Pellegrino, Zarick and Banister are solving with LayerZero is that, today, moving data between two chains is expensive, tedious and insecure. Blockchains have been in operation since the late 2000s, each uniquely coded to excel at a different task. But no single blockchain has emerged as the standard. Even as the larger chains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana grow, dozens of others keep popping up. For <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFnF1dgbF00">data to move between blockchains</a> today, a message has to wind through a blockchain bridge, a series of centralized servers. Navigating a bridge can require clicking dozens of times through multiple programs for anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour. And it requires that a user have a coin or token on the destination blockchain to pay for the transaction fee, called gas, which can add up quickly. Another issue LayerZero is solving for is security. Pellegrino found the state of bridge security technology “horrifying” when he looked into it in 2020. To move, for example, $1,000 worth of cryptocurrency from blockchain A to blockchain B, a person has to send a message from A through a middle chain, which validates the transaction, and then that middle chain tells B that A has moved the funds. But those middle chains make enticing targets for hackers to attack. Cryptocurrency hacks cost more than $14 billion in 2021. The weakness of existing bridge solutions make the entire crypto ecosystem vulnerable, and could hobble its wider adoption.</p>



<p>Inspired by the thrill of a great challenge, Pellegrino, Zarick and Banister began writing the code in early 2021 that would become LayerZero. Not a bridge, but rather a new kind of messaging layer, they believed the tool they were working to create would make all of Web3—apps, money, security, games—better. For average users, their protocol would run as seamlessly in the background as standardized tracks beneath a railcar. Pellegrino had finally found something with meaning, with a global payoff, in his words, a “Holy Grail” problem to solve. It was something worth his time in a way poker could never be.</p>



<p>Along the way, they caught the attention of others in the space. Sequoia Capital partner Shaun Maguire, who earned a physics PhD from CalTech, and had been tracking blockchain technology’s progression since the late ’90s, was following them. And after <a href="https://twitter.com/PrimordialAA/status/1451632573310857216">a notable tweet</a>&nbsp;from Pellegrino in October of 2021, he and Sequoia partner Michelle Bailhe prompted the firm in 2022 to co-lead a $135 million Series A+ fundraising round. “LayerZero’s technology is the glue of crypto,” Maguire says. “It is the thing that stitches the rest of crypto together. The collective value is much, much greater than the sum of its parts. Bryan wants all of crypto to win, wants to make every pocket of crypto more valuable.”</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Danbury, New Hampshire, had fewer than 1,000 residents when Pellegrino was born, and to him, it felt like a significant portion were his cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandparents. By age 4, he’d already sized up his hometown, says his mother, Audrey, and declared that one day he wanted to live in a place where people were more different from one another. By age 6, he was such an evident math prodigy that his parents bought him a guitar, thinking that if he was going to be an outlier, he’d at least have music to share with others. Their worry was misplaced. Pellegrino was also unusually empathetic. Audrey recalls a youth soccer game when a larger kid crashed into Pellegrino hard enough to send him sprawling. “Don’t worry,” she told her son, “The bigger they are, the harder they fall.” He stopped playing to correct her, saying, “Mom, that is not nice.”</p>



<p>Pellegrino’s dad, Steven, was a UPS driver who got up early and came home late, so Friday and Saturday nights at the Pellegrinos’ were special, and all about games. The four siblings, Deanna, Manie, Bryan and Angela, bonded over long hours playing Risk, Monopoly, Stratego and bid whist. Pellegrino was a game savant, always willing to play, and winning almost all the time, at almost all costs, even if he had to stay up all night to do it. His family didn’t know it then, but these ordinary game nights would come to shape Pellegrino’s life and livelihood.</p>



<p>In high school he was a good kid—he took after his parents, abstaining from smoking or drinking—though he was not above reproach. When he was 15, Pellegrino spent a week at Georgetown University as part of the Presidential Classroom program, wherein bright high schoolers toured the nation’s capital and met political leaders. The idea was to inspire kids to go into public service. Instead, Pellegrino got into poker. A fellow participant invited him to play and Pellegrino bought in with $20 his mom had given him as spending money. His childhood obsession with games honed his sense of risk and strategy, which paid off almost immediately. Before the night was over, he’d turned $20 into $60, which he spent on a Georgetown sweatshirt that he’s pretty sure he still has. When he got home, he handed his dad another $50 to get his first online account started.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Throughout high school, Pellegrino ran track, wrestled—and played online poker. Senior year, he barely studied and still graduated third in his class. He chose the University of New Hampshire out of frugality as much as anything. But the decision worked out. It was through working at a networking lab that he got close to Zarick and Banister, who would become his lifelong friends and LayerZero co-founders. And the college broadened his horizons. When he was 19, he applied to a study abroad trip to Budapest, Hungary, at the insistence of his brother-in-law, who had done the same trip years before and loved it. Pellegrino submitted his application at the deadline, got accepted, and truly left home for the first time. “I cried like a baby when I dropped him off,” Audrey says. “He cried like a baby. We never thought that he would never return home.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>During his first week in Budapest, Pellegrino lived in a hostel with fellow students while they were expected to find their own apartments for the semester. Pellegrino was in an elevator one day when the doors opened for Melanie, a French architecture student. She saw him and thought, “Oh, no. This is trouble,” she remembers with a laugh. With a mini French-to-English dictionary in her pocket, Melanie got into a cab with Pellegrino, and they spent the day together. “Our first conversation, she had to look up every word, one at a time, with this little book,” Pellegrino remembers. “I don’t know what it was, but it was definitely there for sure.” Melanie asked him to split an apartment with her, strictly as roommates. That arrangement, she says, lasted about a week. They were married two years later.</p>



<p>In Budapest, Pellegrino earned enough money playing online poker to justify dropping out of school. He gave himself six months to make it as a pro or resume computer science studies. When Pellegrino told his family he wasn’t going back to school, his mother remembers telling him that she’d support him no matter what, so long as he kept his nose clean, paid his taxes, and stayed safe. “He could do anything he wanted,” Audrey says. “If he goes busto—that’s his word—he knows he can come home. There’s always home. He has a very tight-knit family.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>From this moment, until 2011, when America outlawed playing online poker for money, Pellegrino played poker 70 hours a week, most of the time at a computer. He was obsessed with the game, optimizing his performance and learning to make decisions about risk and reward in .3 seconds, over and over and over. He and Melanie traveled the world, hitting 80 countries, often while lugging a full-size computer tower across borders. Melanie remembers customs agents stopping them at airports, insisting that the computer proved Pellegrino must be traveling for work. But he explained he was a dedicated online poker player—and that’s just for fun, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>When America outlawed playing poker online for money, the Pellegrinos were living in Austin, Texas. Because online poker is where players could make the most money and have the most frequent opportunities to play, Pellegrino was ostensibly out of work. He agreed to join the fantasy sports betting site BuzzDraft and had become CEO by the time the company was acquired by another fantasy sports betting company shortly thereafter. Then, he went to Las Vegas to play in the World Series of Poker in 2012, where he finished second in one of the events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By 2013, Pellegrino had some money in the bank and was curious about the Bitcoin buzz between his brother and his brother-in-law. Cryptocurrency caught Pellegrino’s attention for a number of reasons, one of which was that it was a new kind of way to place a bet. He understood the cryptography and distributed systems that undergirded the blockchain, and he felt like he was good at crunching the odds of a payoff. And like poker, some cryptocurrencies paid out, and some went bust. The three men bought computers to mine Bitcoin, but then the cryptocurrency’s value plummeted in 2014. Its exchange collapsed, a Bitcoin Foundation board member was arrested for money laundering, and hackers repeatedly stole hundreds of millions of dollars. It had been a bad bet at the time. Pellegrino, now living in Canada, where online poker was legal, went back to playing. This is when he found himself listless, absent challenging competition, when he should have been having the year of his life professionally. “The game had changed,” Pellegrino remembers. Unlike so many other pros, he wasn’t driven by the money. He wanted a competitive challenge. And one with a meaningful payoff.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>For about three months circa 2015, Pellegrino actually contemplated retirement. He and Melanie took their infant son around the world to look for their ideal home, hitting 12 countries in 12 months. He was restless but not anxious. Then one day, as he watched YouTube, the algorithm served up a video of a DeepMind artificial intelligence called Agent57 playing Atari. Agent57 had, in fact, “learned” to play all 57 Atari games starting from zero, just pixels on the screen. As the AI failed and failed, it learned, and quickly taught itself to surpass any human. “This was one of the first steps toward artificial general intelligence, something that could take information with no context and learn to be incredible at it,” Pellegrino says. “That was super exciting. That got me thinking about reinforcement learning generally—machine learning, AI. Just excited about the field.” Pellegrino, awed, thought back on how the fantasy sports players he’d seen at BuzzDraft racked up millions in wins without the aid of machine learning. “I said, ‘That’s crazy. There has to be a better way.’ So I looked at all the sports and said, ‘OK, I hate baseball, but it has the best data set. Let’s go with that.’”</p>



<p>After their year of travel, the Pellegrinos settled back in Vancouver—it had a school the family loved—and Pellegrino found himself drawn to work on the baseball-AI idea. It was another puzzle to solve, a game to design. Pellegrino hypothesized that he could build an AI to crunch the data points to predict a pitcher’s pitch-by-pitch performance against a batter. It had been years since he’d routinely written code, but one thing led to another and, as can happen to a guy like Pellegrino, he wound up creating a machine learning tool he sold to several Major League Baseball clubs in early 2016. He still relishes the day when the phone rang and on the other end, ready to talk business, was Billy Beane, the Oakland A’s executive immortalized in “Moneyball” for his dedication to statistical analysis. Pellegrino had addressed a big problem for a few pro sports teams. But he wanted to work at something, and be the best at something, that would matter more.</p>



<p>He was becoming increasingly curious about cryptocurrency as a place to do that work. In late 2016, Pellegrino bought into Bitcoin with “a renewed conviction.” What started as an investment turned into Pellegrino building on the Ethereum blockchain, reading white papers and connecting with the community. He immediately saw how hard it was for people to start new cryptocurrencies. “It was a miserable process,” he says, one inaccessible for anyone without coding sophistication. At this time, a friend introduced him to Daniel Chen, then an engineer at Andreessen Horowitz. In 2017, the two friends decided to pursue something big—writing code that could democratize cryptocurrency launches. They launched OpenToken in 2018 as a platform that offered regular people the chance to launch their own cryptocurrencies. But both Pellegrino and Chen moved on to other projects as the work they did with OpenToken led to product pivots and an acquisition. Pellegrino turned back to experimenting with AI and gaming.</p>



<p>In the summer of 2020, he had a breakthrough, further solidifying his credibility as a master of games and machine learning. Pellegrino, his longtime best friends and co-founders Zarick and Banister, along with Facebook AI’s Noam Brown, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10442">published a research paper</a> that described their poker-playing AI, named Supremus. The AI clobbered the world’s previous best poker AI, and some of the world’s top pros. A key insight: players do not always optimize their odds, but are likely to play in such a way that gives them the fewest regrets about the outcome. Their paper has since been cited in game theory research published by DeepMind, the Alphabet AI lab. “All my life, I’ve just liked to work on hard problems,” Pellegrino says. “More than anything else, that’s what attracts me.”</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>In the fall of 2020, the Binance Smart Chain launched. As a rare non-Bitcoin, non-Ethereum blockchain product, it fascinated Pellegrino. The cryptocurrency exchange built a new blockchain designed to make it relatively easy, cheap, and fast for users to conduct transactions among more than 300 cryptocurrency tokens. Pellegrino decided he wanted to test this new tool. He lassoed Zarick and Banister and began, as so many technologists have over the years, by trying to create a game. The goal was to leverage the quick throughput and cheap transaction cost of Binance Smart Chain to play this game they’d invented—generating a bunch of gladiators to fight to the death—and in so doing create an NFT of the winning gladiator. The NFT would be stored on the Ethereum chain, a popular chain for NFTs but relatively inefficient and expensive for the work of gameplay. They soon realized that they had to move the NFT more or less manually, using a bridge they built themselves. The other bridges they could’ve used were too susceptible to hacking. They’d hit upon an aha moment: If existing bridges were a liability for moving an NFT, the risk in moving actual money was enormous.</p>



<p>They realized they needed more than a bridge. They needed a foundational code layer the bridge could be built upon to make it secure. But, more than a decade into the blockchain revolution, such a thing didn’t exist. And other multi-chain bridges were only moving “wrapped” cryptocurrencies, not NFTs or other kinds of data. Pellegrino says the most fundamental need was to get a generic message—the simplest, barest information packets—to operate across blockchains. What solution could facilitate that kind of interoperability among every sort of chain moving any kind of data? Pellegrino had found his big project, a challenge that could pay off in a way that no poker hand ever could.&nbsp;</p>



LAYERZERO



<p></p>



<p>The LayerZero team spent months hardening their messaging protocol, and in late May 2021 <a href="https://layerzero.network/pdf/LayerZero_Whitepaper_Release.pdf">released a white paper</a>, “LayerZero: Trustless Omnichain Interoperability Protocol.” The paper laid out how their free, open-source protocol would be the first to enable direct transactions across all blockchains while remaining decentralized, transparent and permanent. They never shopped their project as a company; Pellegrino smiles when he says LayerZero never created a sales deck. But stealthily, Pellegrino, Zarick and Banister were leveling up. When the renowned co-founder of SushiSwap, who goes by 0xMaki, left that decentralized exchange, he could’ve taken a job anywhere, Pellegrino says. But Pellegrino dropped him a Twitter DM and soon coaxed him aboard to integrate new clients and find new business for LayerZero.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October 2021, feeling exuberant at the 0xMaki hire, Pellegrino tweeted a fateful claim: “We’re legitimately assembling the greatest team in crypto and nobody even knows about it yet.” Sequoia partner Michelle Bailhe saw it and sent a DM. “I didn’t know him,” Bailhe says, “but his contributions to crypto Twitter were optimistic and interesting. Plus, he had a Pudgy Penguin as his profile picture. When Shaun and I met him, Bryan’s intellectual horsepower and clarity of thought on one of the hardest problems in crypto was immediately compelling to us.” As it happened, Maguire had been an angel investor in OpenToken, and Chen, Pellegrino’s former co-founder at OpenToken, would soon become a visiting fellow at Sequoia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bailhe and Maguire recognized that LayerZero was, in one sense, tackling a massive, future-internet-shaping problem. It was, in another sense, inventing plumbing. The internet today is built on similarly boring breakthroughs. Before the creation of Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (known as TCP/IP), the varied intranets that linked universities and government offices in different countries had no way to transmit data to each other. Further back, people standardized electrical currents, fire hoses and hydrants and myriad other things in which interchangeability determines the usefulness of two things together. They saw that Pellegrino wanted to build this kind of basic infrastructure, something worth his time and expertise because it had such a huge potential payoff for so many. And when he came to Sequoia to negotiate the terms of business, Maguire says Pellegrino showed that same spirit of wanting everyone to come out ahead.</p>



<p>“Heads-up poker is basically the same skill as negotiating,” Maguire says. “It’s reading people, knowing when they’re bluffing, all that. So despite the fact that Bryan has that skill, when he negotiated with us, he didn’t play poker, which was very interesting. He was just 100 percent upfront and direct. He said all of his constraints and basically implied, ‘Look, if I wanted to go negotiate and be a jerk and all that, I could do it. But I want to build a partnership with you guys.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In March of this year, Pellegrino, Zarick and Banister launched their own proof-of-concept in Stargate, an application built on LayerZero that helps to move funds between blockchains smoothly. In its first 10 days, people moved more than $250 million worth of crypto assets using Stargate, which helped to get other applications to adopt LayerZero. Pellegrino and others in the crypto community saw it as an unmitigated success. His inbox is full, he says, of potential partners. But outreaches aren’t the same as customers or collaborators.</p>



<p>What lies ahead is anyone’s guess. Hundreds of developers are now working on applications that incorporate the free, open-source code of LayerZero, promising to flatten the silos that individual blockchains have built. Take a platform like OpenSea, the largest marketplace for NFTs. It had built three parallel versions of itself, effectively, one each for users of Ether, Solana, or Polygon. But none of the versions could transfer cryptocurrencies, information or digital art between them easily or affordably because they were all on different blockchains. By adopting LayerZero, OpenSea could allow a user holding any of those coins to spend freely on anything on the platform.</p>



<p>Pellegrino’s time these days is spent on business development, strategy and honing the product. And he now has three kids ranging in age from 8 years to 11 months, so he also spends time getting them up for breakfast, fed and out the door, playing little word games along the way. “In those short moments with my kids… when we’re in the car, we’re not just sitting, we’re doing something. (My oldest) loves this game where we throw out a letter, and on the entire commute, we’ll just throw words back and forth on that letter.” Of course, Pellegrino has also been playing cards with his oldest son since the boy was four. He says he’s a family man like his dad, working to spark in his kids the same excitement for games that his dad instilled in him. “I try to celebrate even a small moment,” he says of the car rides. “Then I go off and I do my thing.”</p>



<p>At work, he has no direct reports and no limit to the number of ways his platform could plug into the next version of the internet. “We’ve built something awesome,” he says. “But there’s a lot of awesome technologies out there that don’t get used. For us now, it’s purely expansion and adoption. It’s getting all of the largest projects in the world to build on top of us. To get every developer who’s thinking cross-chain, to think of us.</p>



<p>“The prior stage was launch, which was great. But as soon as you launch? People forget about the past. And now you’re in a totally new game.”</p>

<p>The birth of Bitcoin led to a Cambrian explosion of blockchains with different design decisions and use cases. While these distributed ledgers serve different purposes, they existed (and still exist to a certain degree) as silos with limited meaningful interaction.</p><p>Similar to the Internet which facilitates different types of computers in different parts of the world to communicate with one another, a similar technology that acts as the connective tissue between blockchains is necessary for true value accrual. The Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol aims to serve this&nbsp;purpose.</p><p>IBC is a universal interoperability protocol that allows two different blockchains to communicate with one another. IBC guarantees reliable, ordered, and authenticated communication.</p><p>Perhaps one of the most important properties of IBC is trust-minimization. In blockchains, the property of trust-minimization is inherently linked to security. No distributed system is entirely ‘trustless’. Therefore, the question of security boils down to who or what is trusted, and how can that trust be violated i.e., what does it take for the trusted entity to be corrupted?</p><p>In this sense, and unlike most bridging solutions, IBC uses no trusted third parties. This means that if you trust two particular chains to use the functions they provide (and by default their consensus mechanisms), then there is no additional trust assumption required while using IBC to interact between said&nbsp;chains.</p><p>IBC is also more than just a bridge that facilitates token transfers. It is a general-purpose message passing protocol. This means that any form of data can be communicated over&nbsp;IBC.</p> How does IBC&nbsp;work? <p>In order to understand how IBC works, it is important to separate the two different layers of IBC — 1) the transport layer and 2) the application layer.</p>High-level depiction of IBC packet flow between two blockchains Transport Layer <p>Messages communicated over IBC are transported within <a href="https://computersciencewiki.org/index.php/Data_packet">data packets</a>. And the transport layer is responsible for transporting, authenticating, and ordering these data&nbsp;packets.</p><p>The transport layer does not specify anything about what the data in the packets should be or how they should be interpreted by a receiving chain. From the transport layer’s point of view, information within data packets are just random&nbsp;bytes.</p><p>The key components of the transport layer are light clients, relayers, connections, and channels.</p><p>A light client is a lightweight representation of a blockchain. Unlike a <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos/blob/master/VALIDATORS_FAQ.md#what-is-a-full-node">full node</a>, light clients do not store the entire history of all the messages contained in a blockchain. Neither do they execute transactions. Rather, light clients are designed to connect to a full node, and verify block headers (a summary of the data contained within a block). This allows light clients to be efficient in terms of storage and computation.</p><p>Two independent blockchains A and B interacting over IBC have <a href="https://medium.com/tendermint/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-tendermint-light-client-f80d03856f98">light clients</a> of the counterparty chain. This means that A has a light client on its blockchain which acts as a lightweight representation of B’s blockchain. When A wants to communicate a certain message ‘X’ with B, it sends the header of the block in which that message exists, along with a commitment proof of that message to B. The commitment proof is used to verify the presence or absence of a particular message on A. Using the block header and proof, B cryptographically verifies that A did indeed perform X. It is this use of light clients in IBC that allow blockchains to exchange messages with one another without the need for a trusted third&nbsp;party.</p><p>But A and B do not directly send these messages/data packets between each other. Instead, when A wishes to send a message to B, it commits or stores a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hash.asp">hash</a> of a data packet containing the message in its <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/16447/state-machine">state machine</a>. Relayers, which are off-chain processes, constantly observe for such messages. When they see that A has committed a message intended for B in its state machine, they simply pick up this message and pass it onto B. Note that relayers are permissionless and therefore can be run by&nbsp;anyone.</p><p>Connections are responsible for connecting light clients on two different chains. And channels are conduits for transferring packets between modules on these different chains. Therefore, while connections are chain-specific, channels are module-specific. Each channel end has a unique channel ID (and a port ID) that is used to accurately route packets between two&nbsp;modules.</p> Application Layer <p>The application layer is what end-users interact with. It consists of various applications that use the transport layer to build on top. The transport layer does not specify how data packets need to be interpreted. This role is performed by the application layer.</p><p>IBC supports a variety of applications such as fungible/non-fungible token transfers, cross-chain oracle feeds, <a href="https://interchain-io.medium.com/welcome-to-the-ibc-gang-lets-talk-f469883e0ffe">Interchain Accounts</a>, Interchain Queries, <a href="https://interchain-io.medium.com/ibc-relaying-as-a-service-the-in-protocol-incentivization-story-9922c7b953f0">Fee middleware</a> (to incentivise relayers), etc.</p><p>For example, the IBC-level application for token transfers — termed <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/blob/master/spec/app/ics-020-fungible-token-transfer/README.md">Interchain Standard 20</a> (ICS 20) — specifies how data packets should be structured and how they are to be interpreted by receiving chains. In the case of fungible token transfers, data packets contain information regarding the sender, receiver, amount, and denomination (IBC denom). The denom field traces the path that a particular token has gone through to reach a certain chain. Logic regarding how the packets are to be acted upon are also specified by ICS&nbsp;20.</p><p>A simple analogy that can be helpful in understanding IBC is that of the mail delivery system. When you send a letter to someone, you send it through a postal service that collects the envelope containing the letter from you and deposits it into the recipient’s mailbox. The recipient then opens said envelope and reads your letter. The transport layer of IBC can be thought of as the postal service. The postal service does not tell you what the contents of the letter should be, or how the recipient should interpret your&nbsp;message.</p><p>Neither do they know what the contents of the envelope are. It only performs the action of collecting the envelope from point A and sending it to point B. The envelope itself can be thought of as IBC packets that are sent from one chain to another. And on this envelope, you would specify the address of the recipient. This is similar to how IBC packets contain information regarding who sent the packet (specified by the channel ID) and to whom it is intended for (specified by the counterparty channel ID). In the end, it is the receiver (application) that is responsible for opening the envelope (data packet) and interpreting the contents of the&nbsp;letter.</p> What can IBC be used&nbsp;for? <p>Apart from fungible token transfers, two other IBC-level applications include Interchain Accounts, and <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/interchain-security-is-coming-to-the-cosmos-hub-f144c45fb035">Interchain Security</a>.</p><p>Interchain Accounts facilitate chain to chain interaction while remaining on a single interface. This effectively means that any action such as transfers, staking, or voting on governance proposals which can be performed on B (called the ‘host chain’), can be performed from A (called the ‘controller chain’). Interchain Accounts significantly increases composability within the Interchain by improving user-experience.</p><p>Interchain Security is the Cosmos Ecosystem’s version of shared security. It enables a blockchain to lease security from another chain in a completely opt-in manner. This is especially useful for new chains that can choose to tap into the security offered by an already established network such as the Cosmos Hub. Interchain Security removes the need for chains to bootstrap their own validator set.</p><p>The scope of applications that can be performed using IBC as a core primitive is consistently growing. Cross-chain NFT transfers and Interchain Queries (where one chain can read state from another chain) are currently being developed and will soon be production ready.</p> What problem does IBC&nbsp;solve? <p>In a sentence, IBC solves the problem of blockchains existing as silos with limited interaction. Interoperability between blockchains is necessary for maximal value&nbsp;accrual.</p><p>Each blockchain caters to one or more specialized use cases. If these use cases cannot be leveraged across multiple blockchains, it severely handicaps their utility. The breakthrough that the internet provided is that information can easily flow across different parts of the world with ease. Similarly, the utility of different blockchains need to be freely accessible across multiple platforms.</p><p>For example, users might want to use stablecoins from one blockchain, to generate yield through a liquidity pool (LP) on a decentralized exchange (DEX) that exists on another blockchain. Or they might want to leverage the privacy preserving properties that a different blockchain provides. Interoperability between chains are required to realize these use cases and&nbsp;more.</p><p>IBC not only solves the problem of interoperability, but it does so in a trust-minimized, secure, extensible, and general purpose&nbsp;manner.</p> How can I as an application developer use&nbsp;IBC? <p>The modular nature of the Cosmos SDK prevents developers from having to concern themselves with some of the layers of abstractions such as light clients, connections, proof verification, etc. For developers, the most relevant requirements and functions to familiarize with are <a href="https://ibc.cosmos.network/main/ibc/overview.html#channels">channels</a> and <a href="https://ibc.cosmos.network/main/ibc/overview.html#ports">ports</a>. For more detailed information on IBC, <a href="https://tutorials.cosmos.network/">you can refer to our developer porta</a>l.</p><p>If you are building your blockchain using the Cosmos SDK, the necessary steps to enable IBC for an SDK module are <a href="https://ibc.cosmos.network/main/ibc/apps.html">detailed here</a>.

 Announcing the Verida Credentials Incubator &amp; the inspiring first projects coming to&nbsp;market Announcing the Verida Credentials Incubator<p>Self-sovereignty is a key objective of Web3. “Not your keys, not your crypto” is a common mantra. Verifiable credentials are a way to bring self-sovereignty to your identity and build digital attestations in order to access products and services, both on and off the blockchain.</p><p>Enabling privacy preserving credentials on public blockchain is critical to enable regulatory compliance and unlock trillions of dollars of capital from traditional finance to flow into Decentralized Finance&nbsp;(DeFi).</p><p>Verida offers the world’s first mobile wallet that incorporates a blockchain wallet, verifiable credential support and a decentralized database storage network that is capable of storing verifiable credentials in a regulatory compliant manner.</p><p>As such, we have seen an explosion of interest in recent months to utilise our wallet and storage network to build credential related products and services.</p><p>The Verida Credential Incubator is bringing together a collection of these organizations and emerging technologies to enable the rapid development of end-to-end credential products and proof of concepts.</p><p>These projects are supporting use cases such&nbsp;as:</p>  Blockchain enabled KYC for Decentralized Exchanges, DAO’s and DeFi lending and insurance protocols to become regulatory compliant  Blockchain enabled credit scores for DeFi protocols to enable under collateralized loans  Healthcare worker credentials for nation state healthcare systems to increase trust and efficiency  <p>Verida, along with the technology partners in the incubator program, provide a composable credential technology stack that allows projects to innovate at speed, demonstrate real world use cases and increase interoperability with complementary projects.</p><p>Many of the technical partners are actively participating and helping shape the standards that support verifiable credentials, including the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID-Core</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>.</p><p>Verida is committed to the Verida Vault and the Verida private data storage network continually being upgraded to support these emerging standards as they are ratified and accepted by their respective communities. This will provide a reliable, end-to-end, interoperable technology platform for projects requiring credentials.</p> Current Challenges With Credentials <p>We have been approached by many organizations to help them build out products using verifiable credentials and the Verida technology stack. Through our discussions with these partners, it’s become clear that credential technology is rapidly evolving and projects need help in several&nbsp;ways:</p>  End-to-end infrastructure for testing credential products and new technologies  Accelerating collaboration and adoption between complementary projects  Support to create PoC’s that demonstrate new technology enhancements  <p>Additionally, the technical standards and implementations of verifiable credentials are rapidly evolving. Here are some of the problems being tackled by participants in the incubator, often through involvement with standards working&nbsp;groups.</p>  Private credential storage: Credential holders need the ability to store their credentials in a private database, owned and controlled by the&nbsp;holder.  Business model: Verifiable credentials construct an ecosystem where a user owns data about themselves. This creates challenges around who should pay for the work involved with issuing a credential. The holder or the verifier? How should that payment be privacy preserving? Can the payment be made with fiat and / or&nbsp;crypto?  Interoperability: There’s an emerging Verifiable Credential standard, however there are many varied implementations and lack of definitions in some key areas required for mass adoption. How do we create an architecture that supports both on-chain and off-chain use cases? How can wallets easily support many different credential implementations? Is an NFT a credential?  Revocation: One area lacking clarity is the revocation of credentials. Can or should that occur on the blockchain? Should that remain private with a standardized set of REST API calls? When should revocation occur? When should revocation be&nbsp;checked?  Trust anchors: A credential is signed using the private key of an issuer, which is linked to a public key. This public key is simply letters and numbers. How can an individual be confident their public key is actually controlled by the government, a bank or a healthcare organisation?  On-chain bridging: How can an off-chain Verifiable Credential be used on the blockchain? What are the privacy implications? How can zero-knowledge technology help? What is the role of Oracles? How does an on-chain credential work with revocation and trust anchors? How do we create an architecture that’s multi-chain?  Data connectivity: How can a user’s personal data be consensually obtained and shared (by its rightful owner) in a way that meets the principles of self-sovereignty?  Adoption: Gaining widespread adoption of credentials in the off chain world (Web2) and the on chain world (Web3) requires both technical and business consensus, with an understanding that flexibility of approaches is required for different use&nbsp;cases.   The Verida Credential Incubator: A composable tech stack for&nbsp;Web3 <p>It’s been clear from conversations over the past three months that many projects are coming up against the challenges listed above. Builders and developers need support in different ways.</p>  Projects addressing a technical challenge (ie: revocation) require a full end-to-end credential technology stack where their contribution to a broader solution can be integrated, easy to demo, and rapidly iterated on for end to end proof of concepts.  Projects have customers wanting to issue credentials or build new tokenized business models with credentials, but lack the end user products, expertise and tools to quickly deliver a solution.  Web2 companies see the huge opportunity emerging with Web3 credentials and want to rapidly build PoC’s and partner with others to launch new products and services.  <p>The Verida Credential Incubator provides a composable credential technology stack. This enables projects to easily collaborate with each other on proof of concepts via a highly flexible technology stack that offers technology consensus.</p>A composable credential technology stack.<p>When combined with some of Verida’s solutions to the challenges above (ie: private data storage, self-custody credential wallet) and open source reference implementations, it provides an ideal environment for projects driving credential innovation across&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>This incubator will assist all participants to better collaborate, innovate and launch new products that drive forward adoption of both credential solutions and broader adoption of Web3 solutions.</p><p><a href="https://www.verida.io/credentials">Learn more about Verida Credentials</a></p> Discover what’s being&nbsp;built <p>Discover the projects Verida is collaborating with to accelerate the development of credential based solutions for&nbsp;Web3.</p>  cheqd — payment — cheqd is a decentralised network for data ownership and value creation.

 HackAtom Seoul, Organized by Interchain in collaboration with the talented KryptoSeoul team, will be our first in-person Hackathon since 2019 and the first Cosmos-branded event in the Asian continent since the pandemic began. This HackATOM will not only be the perfect chance for developers to start their journey in our ecosystem with a bang, but it will also be a real moment of sharing and growing for our entire community. <p>Cosmonauts, it’s been over a year since the <a href="https://stargate.cosmos.network/">Stargate upgrade</a>, the Cosmos Big-Bang that announced the start of the <a href="https://hub.mintscan.io/ibc-network">Interchain Era</a>, and since then our ecosystem has faced many challenges but, despite our differing views and opinions, we have always been united in a common front when the moment called for it, acknowledging that our diversities are what make our Interchain Ecosystem thriving.</p><p>It is the desire to grow together that inspired <a href="https://www.buidl.asia/hackatom-seoul-2022">HackATOM 2022</a>, which will take place at <a href="https://www.dreamplus.asia/center/gangnam/intro">Dreamplus Startup Building</a> in Seoul, South Korea, on July 29 to&nbsp;31.</p><p>This Cosmos Hackathon will be a temple for devs approaching Cosmos for the first time and their ideas, the launching pad for new and exciting projects, and a valuable moment of sharing for Core Contributors, Validators, Teams, and Community to meet each other. There will be many educational workshops (which will be captured and reposted via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CosmosProject">our YouTube channel</a> so that they can be easily accessible to all), working sessions with mentors, and an awesome afterparty for all Cosmos &amp; friends attendees.</p><p>👉🏻 <a href="https://www.buidl.asia/hackatom-seoul-2022">Register Now&nbsp;</a>👈🏾</p><p>Let’s dive into what makes this event so exciting!</p>[<a href="https://www.buidl.asia/hackatom-seoul-2022">Details about each challenge are available here</a>] Main Challenges: <p>🏆 Interchain Price: Interoperability</p><p>🏆 Hub Prize: Interchain Security</p><p>🏆 Application Price: Cosmos&nbsp;SDK</p><p>each of these challenges has these&nbsp;prizes:</p>  1st Place USD $50k in&nbsp;ATOM  2nd Place USD $30k in&nbsp;ATOM  3rd Place USD $10k in ATOM (two&nbsp;winners)  <p>For a total prize pool of USD $300k in&nbsp;ATOM</p> Sponsor Challenges: <p>🏆 Osmosis Prize: CosmWasm (Permissioned)</p>  1st Place USD $50k in&nbsp;OSMO  2nd Place USD $30k in&nbsp;OSMO  3rd Place USD $10k in OSMO (two&nbsp;winners)  <p>for a total prize pool of USD $100k in&nbsp;OSMO</p><p>🏆 Juno Prize: CosmWasm (Permissionless)</p>  1st Place USD $50k in&nbsp;JUNO  2nd Place USD $30k in&nbsp;JUNO  3rd Place USD $10k in JUNO (two&nbsp;winners)  <p>for a total prize pool of USD $100k in&nbsp;JUNO</p><p>🏆 Evmos Prize: Solidity-related challenge</p>  1st Place USD $50k in&nbsp;EVMOS  2nd Place USD $30k in&nbsp;EVMOS  3rd Place USD $10k in EVMOS (two&nbsp;winners)  <p>for a total prize pool of USD $100k in&nbsp;EVMOS</p> 🎖 Critics&nbsp;Prize:  Dreamplus Award: 5 MacBook&nbsp;Pro <p>5 MacBook Pro will be given by the Dreamplus Team to the 5 individuals who will distinguish themselves the most as per talent and capabilities. <br>Guidelines and judging criteria about this specific prize will be explained during HackATOM Opening Ceremony.</p> Persistence Award: USD $5k in&nbsp;USDC <p>The best CosmWasm project of the whole competition [tracks Juno ~ Osmosis].

And not only that, a great many participants from past hackathons have brought undeniable value to our ecosystem, and I believe that one of the strongest points of a community is to be able to recognize and value true talent. And support&nbsp;it.</p><p><a href="https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-signaling-proposal-hackatom-seoul-2022/6799?u=catdotfish">That’s why we thought we’d request the total prizes of the main challenges from the Cosmos Hub community pool. </a>Juno and Osmosis readily offered in turn to be sponsors for the CosmWasm tracks. Many other foundations from across the ecosystem contribute to creating the first true Community HackATOM in Cosmos history. HackATOM is no longer an event organized by one team, instead, it is an event that truly sprang from the coming together of all of us, fully representing the evolution of Cosmos from individual isolated chains to Interchain.</p><p>HackATOM is reborn like a phoenix and brings us to once again savor the adrenaline-fueled atmosphere that pervades these in-person competitions.

  Arc Americas: Build for the Next Decade  <p>Applications are now open for the first Americas cohort of Arc, our seed-stage catalyst for outlier founders.</p>  <p>By Jess Lee</p><p>Published June 27, 2022</p>  



 
<p>Earlier this year we <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/sequoia-arc-outliers-wanted/">unveiled</a> Arc, Sequoia’s seed-stage catalyst that helps outlier founders build category-defining companies that will endure. Our first Arc Europe cohort kicked off in May, and today we are thrilled to launch the <a href="https://arc.sequoiacap.com/">application</a> for Arc Americas—for companies headquartered in North America and Latin America.</p>



<p>In addition to receiving initial funding of $1M, each Arc founder participates in a seven-week program introducing them to Company Design, the Sequoia way to start, build and scale enduring companies.&nbsp;</p>


 A legendary field trip to Klarna HQ in Stockholm, Sweden. 


<p>Company Design draws on Sequoia’s five decades of experience to teach core concepts in product strategy, go-to-market, culture and more. The curriculum is taught by Sequoia partners along with visiting instructors and builders from our network, including founders and operators of our portfolio companies. To connect the dots between theory and practice, Arc blends foundational lectures, case studies, hands-on practice and a group field trip; the inaugural <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/outlier-founders-of-arc-europe/">Europe cohort</a> visited Stockholm to learn with the Klarna team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Arc also connects participants with a powerful network for mentorship and support, through regular 1:1s with our partners and fellow founders, office hours, peer boards and Sequoia community dinners. In addition, participants get access to our Ampersand app, where Sequoia founders can share advice and explore a library of Company Design resources.</p>



<p>Six weeks into hosting Arc Europe, it’s been incredible to watch how these founders are already bending the arc of their companies, and we are excited for the first Americas cohort to embark on the same transformative journey.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“I love how each week takes a deep dive into a specific topic. Arc has provided me the knowledge, tools and network to bring Xelda to the global stage. I feel there’s no limit to what Xelda can achieve with the support of this group.”</p>India Healy O’Connor, Xelda</blockquote>



<p>Each week of the Arc curriculum is focused on a different question—such as “Who are you building for?” “How do you find traction?” and “How do you win talent?” As we work together to find the answers to those questions, the company’s story takes shape.</p>


 Founders explore Company Design cards at Sequoia’s London office. 


<p>Participants learn to articulate their unique founder story, as well as the stories of their customer, their product, their culture and their business. Each module builds on the next, starting with what makes an outlier and ending with understanding and sharing the scale of your company’s ambition—with critical lessons about how to get there learned along the way.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“I thought I understood customer obsession and all it entailed. Being shown what true customer obsession looks like immediately changed how we see our customers and how we interact with them at every level.”</p>Ciaran O’Keefe, Akeero</blockquote>



<p>In the final week, founders synthesize the company story they’ll use in recruiting critical early hires, and present those stories to a group of Sequoia partners, visiting instructors and potential customers, getting feedback to help them grow.</p>



<blockquote><p>“Learning about the early days of legendary companies directly from the operators and founders who built them has massively raised both my personal ambition and my ambition for what we can achieve with Telescope.”</p>Camin McClusky, Telescope</blockquote>



<p>The first Arc Americas will take place September 12 through October 28, with Weeks 1 and 7 on-site at Sequoia’s offices in Menlo Park, a field trip during week 4 and the rest of the program held remotely. Applications are open through July 22. <a href="https://arc.sequoiacap.com/">Learn more and apply here.</a></p>

  Before the PriFi boom, Bitcoin tumblers and privacy coins were the only way to transact privately on-chain. Are they still valid, safe options?

<p>Before the PriFi (private finance) scene emerged, people looked into <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/privacy-crypto-projects-bitcoin-competitors-or-not/">Bitcoin tumblers and privacy coins</a> as the only means to exert their on-chain privacy.<br></p><p>Privacy is not only a fundamental right but a foundation upon which many other human rights are built. When we speak of privacy, we speak about privacy of body, correspondence, data, finance, identity, location, and territory. <br></p><p>However, when it comes to financial privacy, there isn’t much we can do to exert our rights, considering the limitations of our traditional financial institutions. When Bitcoin emerged as an alternative to the current global monetary system, there was hope — a hope to uphold our right to financial privacy with a completely new system that doesn’t rely on third-party or trust-based models.<br></p><p>With the rapid rise of blockchain forensics, analysis tools, and the inherent open nature of public blockchain networks, all transactions are open for everyone to see. This makes it impossible to transact privately on an open ledger.<br></p><p>Because of this, many users constantly wonder how to send crypto privately and if this is doable at all. In this article, we’ll explore the popular methods through which one can send crypto privately. These methods can be broadly categorized into three distinct categories, as mentioned before:<br></p>  Crypto mixers (or Bitcoin tumblers)  Privacy coins  Privacy solutions <br>  <p>We will also address common questions on how to use the blockchain privately and how privacy coins and cryptocurrency mixers work. <br></p><p>Let’s get started.</p> How do Bitcoin tumblers work? <p>Crypto mixers, also known as Bitcoin tumblers (even tho they can support a wide variety of crypto assets, including ERC-20 tokens), allow users to transact with their cryptocurrencies privately. They work by pooling together funds from different sources and then allowing users to withdraw from the pool to a destination address of their choice. Since the funds are lumped together and then distributed at random times, examining the trails behind exact coins and their new destinations becomes particularly hard, helping users gain privacy.<br></p><p>The dynamics of crypto mixers can be explained through an analogy: If you take ten $100 notes from ten people and put them all together in a bag, it is unlikely that each person will have the same note they put in if you ask them to retrieve their notes. If you then play around with factors such as the order of retrieval, where notes are delivered, in what order and at what times, it becomes even more difficult to track the transaction trail of an exact note.<br></p><p>Bitcoin tumblers follow a similar model. If more people contribute, it gets progressively harder to trace which note originally belonged to whom. Crypto or Bitcoin mixers create private pools and muddle them before sending coins out to pre-set recipient wallets.</p>Diagram showcasing how crypto mixers work (<a href="https://www.coincenter.org/education/advanced-topics/what-are-mixers-and-privacy-coins/">Source</a>).<p></p><p>There are two main types of cryptocurrency mixers. They are sufficiently different, although they stay true to the founding idea of how Bitcoin mixers work. <br></p>  Centralized mixers (tumblers) will receive your Bitcoin or tokens and send it to a designated address for a fee.<br>  Decentralized mixers are built on the blockchain and use a protocol to receive and send identical amounts of Bitcoins or tokens. They usually use a peer-to-peer or coordinated approach and involve many people, usually in the hundreds.   Benefits of crypto mixers (Bitcoin tumblers) <p>Regular cryptocurrency transactions are traceable and can be sufficiently proven by exchanges. If the coins you bought were involved in illegal activities (such as black market transactions), a crypto exchange could freeze your funds even if you weren’t complicit in that behavior. The traceability of blockchain transactions and KYC verification exercise make it possible for crypto exchanges to figure out and reveal the identity of persons involved in a certain blockchain transaction.<br></p><p>With mixers, the idea of untraceable cryptocurrency transactions is possible.<br></p><p>Cryptocurrency mixers help you stay private as you transact on the blockchain, keeping your dealings away from the public eye, preserving your identity, and obscuring sensitive information on the transactions you have made.</p> Flaws of Bitcoin tumblers <p>If you remove the benefit of keeping transactions and identities private from the picture, little is left regarding the benefits of using cryptocurrency mixers. Firstly, one major flaw of crypto mixers is supporting only one asset type at a time and only in a determinate amount (e.g. only in batches of 1 BTC at a time per mixer), thus severely limiting their privacy prospect.<br></p><p>Most crypto mixing services also operate in legal obscurity and might get you in trouble if your jurisdiction introduces a law against them and applies it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_post_facto_law">retrospectively</a>. On top of that, the unchartered territory of crypto mixers is riddled with scams, seizures, outright fraud, and shutdowns.<br></p><p>Fraudulent services aside, some cryptocurrency mixers provide somewhat flawed privacy. With the help of blockchain forensics and analytics firms, law enforcement agencies can <a href="https://protos.com/bitcoin-mixing-coinjoin-wasabi-chainalysis-samourai-privacy-wallet/">bypass</a> some of the mixing models these services use. This is particularly true when it comes to KYC’d accounts in centralized exchanges, for example.<br></p><p>Major crypto exchanges like Binance have begun blocking crypto transactions originating from mixers or freezing the accounts of users receiving or sending funds connected to mixing services. These companies cite money laundering and compliance with existing <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/as-fatf-regulations-galvanize-crypto-mixing-applications-are-targeted/">regulations</a> as the reasons behind the clampdown, and they are not far from the truth.<br></p><p>Another problem with mixers is – how to make them profitable or even self-sustaining? It is the reason several current schemes are broken. Furthermore, these mixers often request users to withdraw the exact number of coins they put in, and only accept one type of asset. This makes mixers inconvenient and limits the scope of the privacy they're able to provide.<br></p><p>In essence, crypto and Bitcoin tumblers aren’t ideal for financial privacy because their flaws pose some unique challenges, particularly on the compliance side. Even though mixers aren’t inherently bad, they might be better positioned to succeed if they tackled regulatory concerns first and foremost.</p> All about privacy coins <p>A second popular way through which one can send crypto privately is through privacy coins. Unlike open ledger networks such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, privacy coins can offer greater obscurity.<br></p><p>By creating Layer-1 blockchains that are inherently more private than their pseudonymous counterparts, privacy coins go beyond what is possible with crypto mixers. This has attracted attention from privacy enthusiasts, financial regulators, and exchanges alike.<br></p> How do private cryptocurrencies work? <p>Privacy coins keep the flow of money on their networks from the public eye, usually by restricting vital information involved in a transaction (e.g.,wallet addresses, transaction amounts, senders’ and receivers’ wallet addresses, etc.) from public view. If you send a private coin to another address, other users cannot access the details of the transaction, as is the practice with Bitcoin and other open blockchain networks.<br></p><p>Popular examples of privacy coins are Zcash and Monero, which employ different methods to achieve privacy. <br></p><p>Monero uses three different mechanisms to hide transaction data. First, users send or receive coins with stealth addresses, which resemble one-time passwords that cannot be used twice. Then, Monero uses ring signatures to mix up actual transactions with old and fake transactions and ringCT, a privacy technology, to hide the transaction amount.<br></p>Diagram showing how Monero’s untraceable payments work (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/introduction-monero-xmr/">Source</a>).<p></p><p>Zcash employs a different mechanism, incorporating an optional switch between transacting publicly and privately. The network receives a message validating each private transaction via zero-knowledge proofs, and this message withholds any additional information on the transaction. <br></p><p>Other examples of privacy coins include Beam, Grin, and PIVX.<br></p> How can you use privacy coins? <p>On a fundamental level, privacy coins operate in a similar fashion as those within open ledger blockchains. Like their counterparts, they hold qualities such as immutability, verifiability, distribution, and decentralization. As such, you can send or receive privacy coins with a cold or hot wallet, and some are available for trading on centralized exchanges. However, many exchanges like Coinbase UK and <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bittrex-to-delist-privacy-coins-monero-dash-and-zcash-2021-01-01">Bittrex Global</a> have recently delisted privacy coins.<br></p><p>To use Monero ($XMR), for instance, you would need a Monero GUI wallet. After setting up the wallet, you can buy $XMR on a centralized exchange or through a peer-to-peer network and transfer your coins to a Monero wallet. <br></p><p>Other private currencies like Zcash are also available on centralized exchanges, offering optional privacy functions like PrivateSend for Dash and shielded transactions for Zcash (ZEC).</p> Pros and cons of privacy coins <p>Like every innovation in the crypto space, privacy coins have their good side and also come with certain flaws. <br></p><p>For starters, you can keep your financial information away from the public with privacy coins, regaining control over how much information you want to disclose online.<br></p><p>A privacy coin keeps the details of transactions hidden, protecting the identities of both parties against third-party privacy violations. The record of such transactions exists, but the sending and receiving addresses, and the amounts involved, are unavailable to the public.<br></p><p>On the flip side, privacy coins occupy a precarious position on the books of centralized exchanges. Remember that we mentioned how you could access privacy coins through centralized exchanges? Under the Financial Action Task Force Travel Rule, exchanges are required to share information on transactions with law enforcement agencies on request. The absence of clarity on this subject has made certain exchanges <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/state-of-the-privacy-coin-fatf-pushes-delisting-and-exclusion/">delist</a> privacy coins.<br></p><p>Also, the question of legality hangs in the air. In some jurisdictions, privacy coins are as good as illegal, with their trading fully banned in South Korea. The United States is towing a different path, focusing on developing technology to crack privacy on the blockchain. They even offered a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2020/09/14/irs-will-pay-up-to-625000-if-you-can-crack-monero-other-privacy-coins/?sh=3db27e1b85cc">$625,000</a> bounty to anyone who could crack the Monero network.<br><br></p><p>Besides issues around legality, privacy coins seriously lag behind in terms of DeFi innovation. Open ledger networks such as Ethereum, with its Layer-2 solutions, are massively ahead in terms of offering a range of decentralized financial services such as lending, borrowing, stablecoins, etc. This limits the use of privacy coins to simple transactions, making them less attractive in comparison.<br></p><p>The lack of privacy in the existing DeFi ecosystem then raises an important question: what can we do to incorporate privacy into what already exists? This is where Panther comes into the picture to solve a previously unsolvable problem.<br></p> What is Panther Protocol? <p>In the world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), the public nature of most L1 blockchains, while offering transparency, has the side effect of robbing traders of their advantages. Alphas and strategies become non-existent or less effective when surveillance and observation of a DeFi user's strategy and transaction records are possible. <br></p><p>With Panther, DeFi users can keep their transactions private while ensuring compliance with regulations as they trade on the blockchain. Panther integrates with the existing DeFi ecosystems on multiple chains rather than trying to reinvent the parts of them (e.g., protocols, underlying structures, etc.) that are currently most popular and in use. Through this, Panther aims to create a cross-chain interoperable privacy-preserving DeFi ecosystem for all players to thrive.</p> The technology behind Panther <p>Panther restores privacy through zAssets, versions of regular digital assets that enhance privacy with zero-knowledge proofs. <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/26/snarks.html">zk-SNARK</a> cryptography (short for zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge) allows users to provide proof of transactions without giving up sensitive information, ensuring compliance without violating privacy rights.<br></p>Panther’s unique architecture, from <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/panther-protocol-v-1-0-1.pdf">our whitepaper.</a><p></p><p>Panther's zAssets operate across several blockchains and allow users to protect their privacy as they interact with DeFi applications. Presently, Panther is building on several networks, including Elrond, Ethereum, NEAR, Polygon, Flare, and more. Panther’s native token $ZKP governs the Panther ecosystem and is used to reward users for enabling the protocol’s privacy.</p> Using Panther Protocol <p>DeFi traders can mint zAssets by depositing their corresponding digital assets into Multi-Asset Shielded Pools (MASPs). They can then use their zAssets across different blockchains through a system of private bridges. Rewards are available for users that deposit and interact with the shielded pools.<br></p><p>For instance, when you deposit USDC into the pool, you can mint the corresponding privacy-enabled zAsset, zUSDC, which breaks the on-chain link and allows you to transact privately. After transacting, you can redeem your deposited USDC to a new stealth address, and the zUSDC is removed from circulation.<br></p><p>Panther also supports a feature called Panther Reveals, which allows you to disclose parts or the totality of your DeFi history if required by KYC verification, regulators, and financial institutions.</p> Final thoughts <p>The discussion around the subject of privacy on the blockchain may never cease. Users continue to clamor for increased privacy while regulators grow wary of the solutions currently in the market. Cryptocurrency mixers and privacy coins have enhanced users' privacy on the blockchain, but this has come at the cost of coming under scrutiny due to their lack of compliance concerns.<br></p><p>Panther solves this dilemma with a comprehensive solution, ensuring users can send and receive cryptocurrencies privately and compliantly. Panther offers an end-to-end DeFi solution that enhances trust on the blockchain and gives users control over the information they share. <br></p><p>The future of privacy will thrive in an ecosystem where there’s no additional cost or barrier for a law-abiding citizen to exercise their right to privacy. We’re at an important juncture of building a decentralized financial world – a global monetary system built on the ethos of transparent, private, and censorship-resistant. <br></p><p>It’s time to realize that our right to financial privacy cannot be ignored while building an open financial system.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

 Chainsafe – Lerna Jabourian, Project Manager 
<p>Chainsafe is working on reimplementing the Mina protocol in Rust. As of late we are working on an MVP, which is a smaller scope of the original project. It consists of a non-consensus node which will be able to:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Run a web browser 
 Check the state of the chain 
 Download blocks 
 Validate proofs similar to a full node 
 
<p>We have made significant progress on the web node extension. We’re now able to completely serialize/deserialize an entire block in-browser. At the moment, the state &amp; the chain data are being fetched from the canonical graphQL API (via <a href="https://graphql.minaexplorer.com">https://graphql.minaexplorer.com</a>), which will retrieve the latest blocks from the network. Once downloaded, the blocks are sent to the rust module in WASM to deserialize the data in json serialization format. The blocks then get validated and chain selection is run to then proceed with what is considered the best chain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>See demo below:</p>
<p>Step 1: Click on “Query” to fetch basic info on the latest blocks</p>
<p></p>
<p>Step 2: Click on “Poll latest blocks” to download blocks and run chain selection</p>
<p></p>
<p>Step 3: Receive info for the last 10 blocks</p>
<p></p>
<p>Effort is also being put towards refactoring our consensus tests to make them more maintainable.&nbsp;</p>
 Up Next 
<p>We will be working on integrating the web node with the <a href="https://www.aurowallet.com/">Auro wallet</a>. Additionally, we’ll be delving into supporting retrieval of account information by implementing sparse merkle ledger as well as merkle proofs by way of the new graphQL endpoint.</p>
<p>We are looking into adding issues for outside contributors to work on via Github: <a href="https://github.com/ChainSafe/mina-rs/issues">https://github.com/ChainSafe/mina-rs/issues</a>&nbsp;</p>

 =nil; Foundation – Mikhail Komarov, Founder 
<p>Nil Foundation is working on In-EVM Mina Verification for the zkBridge. Last month was dedicated to several things:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Audit-related circuits adjustments – The <a href="https://www.abdk.consulting/">ABDK team</a> is doing an extraordinary job regarding getting into all the details and this obviously requires us to introduce a lot of adjustments, explanations, etc.&nbsp; 
 Proof generation performance – It is critical to have the auxiliary proof generated within reasonable timings, so we’ve dedicated time to that. 
 Paving the road to the zkBridge’s future – Specifications and papers. We will release a separate blog post about all that  
 
<p>For those interested in checking out some recent PRs related to proof generation performance adjustments:</p>
 
 <a href="https://github.com/NilFoundation/crypto3-zk/pull/48">https://github.com/NilFoundation/crypto3-zk/pull/48</a> – using point-value polynomial form within the proof generator 
 The following are about proof generation parallelization:

 <a href="https://github.com/NilFoundation/actor-zk">https://github.com/NilFoundation/actor-zk</a> 
 
 
 
<p>Now that we’re preparing a verification part for the audit, we wouldn’t mind if the Mina community takes a look and leaves a review of the implementation of the in-EVM verification part. We would love to adjust it to match the highest community expectations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 O(1) Labs – Emre Tekisalp, CEO 
 SnarkyJS Week 
<p>The O(1) Labs team has been working hard to prepare to host the <a href="https://blog.o1labs.org/join-us-for-the-first-ever-snarkyjs-week-6c718ed2b090">first-ever SnarkyJS Week</a>. Join to learn how to write zkApps (with Intro &amp; Advanced dev workshops) &amp; to meet other zkApps developers from the Mina community!</p>
 Improving Node Stability 
<p>The latest alpha release 1.3.2 is being tested on devnet and the last stable release 1.3.1 has been running smoothly on Mainnet for well over a month. We’ve been focused on shipping performance improvements and addressing outstanding issues. We hope to promote 1.3.2 to beta and then a stable release in the coming weeks.</p>
 Berkeley QA Network 
<p>The Berkeley QA Network is ongoing and the QA task force is diligently participating and helping to address issues that occur. If you would like to participate in the QA network, please chime in on the #devnet channel on <a href="http://bit.ly/MinaDiscord">Mina’s Discord</a>. A few more redeployments to the QA network are planned in the coming weeks, so look out for more enhancements and fixes.</p>
 zkApps &amp; SnarkyJS 
<p>Deployment of zkApps to Berkeley QANet is now fully possible using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/zkapp-cli">Mina zkApp CLI</a>. Elegant <a href="https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/207">support for “preconditions” in SnarkyJS</a> has also been implemented. These allow a zkApp developer to set specific network or account-related conditions that must be true in order for their transaction to be accepted by the network; docs coming soon. SnarkyJS proving on NodeJS now supports multi-cores for faster performance. Mina zkApp CLI size has been reduced to only 706 KB–now even your tools are lighter weight.</p>
 Proof Systems 
<p>​​An update to Proof Systems was recently completed, which improves compile times of SnarkyJS circuits by ~5x and similarly improves proving times by around ~3x. Additionally, a first working version of a circuit-writing API was completed for Kimchi. Some optimizations are planned, but we hope to make this new API available for public consumption in the not too distant future. Additionally, the team is reviewing a third iteration of a proposed keccak circuit design which will be a significant step toward enabling compatibility of zkApps and Proof Systems compatibility with Ethereum and other EVM-based chains.</p>
 zkOracles 
<p>Engineering progress is at a standstill as we continue to recruit for a qualified Rust engineer to work on this project in a dedicated capacity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Mina Alert Bot – Makalfo#7996 
<p>Community member and zkApp Builders Program participant Makalfo has built a Mina Alert Bot for blockchain events. This utilizes Telegram to dispatch alerts such as block production, transactions, and delegation transactions. Examples include:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Mina Explorer produces a canonical or orphaned block: A Telegram message would be dispatched of the production of the block, chain status, and the associated coinbase reward 
 DexHeim sends 10 Mina to ZKValidator: A Telegram message would be dispatched of the transaction amount and the decoded memo, if applicable 
 Figment receives a delegation transaction: A Telegram message would be dispatched of the delegation&nbsp; 
 
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@makalfo/development-of-a-mina-telegram-bot-for-mina-protocol-11cb2cceeefc">Check out this Medium post for how to utilize the bot</a>. If anybody is interested in the Github repo, feel free to reach out to me. I would also appreciate if community members use the service and let me know if there are any functions that are desired! I added some filtering of spam transactions (e.g. balance must be greater than 1 and no links in the memos) but it has met my original goal so I do not need to watch my addresses on the explorers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 b62.io – talha | b62.io#0779 
<p>Community member Talha was involved in creating <a href="http://b62.io">b62.io</a>, a resource for the Turkish Mina community.</p>
<p>B62.io is the world’s lightest blog! (The b62’s name comes from the first 3 digits of all Mina wallet addresses.) We create content to help the community, share articles on topics that the community is interested in, provide Turkish translations of news from Mina’s ecosystem, as well as helpful infographics. We are working to create a resource where the Mina Turkey community will find answers to their questions and where they can be informed of developments related to the Mina ecosystem. In addition, the <a href="https://twitter.com/minawhale_alert">Mina Whale Alert Twitter</a> &amp; <a href="https://t.me/minawhalealert">Telegram bot</a> which reports large Mina transactions and <a href="https://t.me/mina_fiyat">Mina Turkish trade chat</a> are members of the b62 family. And we are working on introducing other new tools and content to the community on the site soon.</p>
<p>We are happy that the content we produce is read and shared by thousands of people. For example, zkApe, the only Turkish news bulletin that publishes about zero knowledge projects, shared b62 and its contents many times in its bullet and recommended it to its readers. See <a href="https://zkape.substack.com/p/zkape-16">here</a>, <a href="https://zkape.substack.com/p/zkape-18">here</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/0xzkape/status/1531758178748211201">here</a>. Articles published on b62 were also shared on Turkish crypto communities, such as those of Blockland DAO, Coin Fedaileri and of course the Mina Turkiye Telegram.&nbsp;</p>
 What’s Next 
 
 We are working on a Mina Turkish dictionary. 
 We are creating some infographic templates for Mina ecosystem projects. 
 We will create some new social media channels for b62 (like Telegram Mina news feed and b62 Telegram chat). 
 We will start publishing a&nbsp; b62 bulletin soon. 
 
<p>We encourage everyone to follow, like and share the b62.io Mina content!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Mina Blacklist – carbonara | WeStake.Club#5880 
<p>Community and Genesis Founding Member Carbonara has created a new tool called the Mina Blacklist.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://blacklist.mina.tools">Mina Blacklist</a> is an open/crowd-sourced list of Mina addresses being used for malicious purposes. The list is accessible from the <a href="https://blacklist.mina.tools/">Web UI</a> or from the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nerdvibe/mina-addresses-blacklist/main/addresses.json">API</a>. The idea is to have a transparent and up-to-date list, so developers can query addresses in their software and take preventive measures to help end users. For example, <a href="https://clor.io/">Clorio Wallet</a> and <a href="https://minaexplorer.com/">MinaExplorer</a> use the Mina Blacklist to verify if an address is in the list and then visually mark the addresses as a threat. The list is automated by the <a href="https://github.com/minascamwatcher">MinaScamWatcher</a>, a bot that is constantly scanning the network for newer threats and when it finds one, it submits them to the repository.</p>
<p>The bot creates the PRs and then one of the maintainers of the repository verifies the legitimacy of the report (sometimes there are false positives, so it’s important to be manually checked) and merges the PR to the list. You can see the <a href="https://github.com/nerdvibe/mina-addresses-blacklist/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed">github repo here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

 Introducing Privy’s new&nbsp;look <p>I wish this title were a computer science joke. It’s not. We’re just very excited to introduce our new look. Thank you to the great team at <a href="https://unfold.co/">Unfold</a> for working with us on this redesign.</p>We’ve taken to calling it&nbsp;blobby What’s in a&nbsp;brand? <p>The French say “<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/l%27habit_ne_fait_pas_le_moine">the clothes do not make the monk</a>” and we recognize this: Privy is only as good as its APIs are useful. We are here to build simple, powerful developer tools to help you manage user data safely and put users back in control of their data on the web. That is our core&nbsp;mission.</p><p>And yet, we also recognize the power of brands to create movements and foster community. Here are a few we look up&nbsp;to:</p><p><a href="http://uniswap.org">Uniswap</a></p><p>We’d know that hot pink anywhere. Yes, they may be building an AMM, but from the horse 🦄 to the socks 🧦, you can tell they care about their art. (June 22 edit — <a href="https://uniswap.org/blog/genie">indeed they&nbsp;do</a>).</p><p><a href="http://flashbots.net">Flashbots</a></p><p>You recognize a Flashbots team member from the ⚡🤖 and the <a href="https://twitter.com/Yamer">Yamer</a> pfp. Along with their comically understated site, these are hackers first and foremost. They ship code, with a&nbsp;purpose.</p><p><a href="http://dune.xyz">Dune</a></p><p>The website, the palette. This is about information architecture and surfacing data, plain and simple&nbsp;📈.</p> Enter Blobby <p>We built Privy to help developers delight their users without putting them at risk. It’d be a shame for us not to find delight in our own&nbsp;work.</p><p>As a developer, dealing with user data must become simple again. You should be able to build wonderful products without stripping your users of control, or putting your product and org at risk. Privacy is table-stakes. More than that, our data future will unlock new, interesting experiences on the Web. It must be secure, engaging and&nbsp;playful.</p>What do you leave behind as you surf the&nbsp;web?<p>We’ve done our best to convey a sense of this across our work. We hope you’ll like&nbsp;it.</p> Privacy as a&nbsp;prism Before /&nbsp;After<p>The new carries with it some of the old. Simple as it was, part of our old logo tried to convey change; that user identity is not uniform or fixed in time, but depends on time, place, counterparty, etc. So too, the data you&nbsp;present.</p><p>So why does the same unshakable data trail follow you throughout the web?You would not wear the same outfit to church, the office, or a club. And so while the clothes do not make the monk, you should get to pick what you wear&nbsp;online.</p><p>We see our new mascot as a version of what you can be online: your astral projection on the web, changing as you surf to continually protect and delight you. That’s the future we are building&nbsp;toward.</p><p>This brand will evolve along with our APIs, our org and the web and we can’t wait to help it&nbsp;morph.</p><p>In case you were wondering: <a href="https://hot-alphabet-53c.notion.site/Privy-Careers-b4a51920dc5548e9b0f53bd0c7c186b0">yes, we are still hiring.</a> We’d love for you to come shape Privy with&nbsp;us.</p>We can’t wait to see what we build&nbsp;together<p>Exciting times&nbsp;ahead!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.privy.io/new-threads-who-dis-cc6b2e054c2e">New threads, who dis?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.privy.io">Privy Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 On-Site Token Launch Station 



  
<p>We had a booth on the exhibitor hall where we hosted an on-site token launch station! The pre-booked 2-day launch schedule was fully booked before the event, and we had many “walk-ins” that lined up by our booth to create their own token on <a href="https://tokenmint.global/">TokenMint</a>.</p>
<p>Our swag was a huge hit too!</p>

Following this expansion, the panel now consists of 140 people (listed below), including 34 new members.&nbsp;</p><p>There were several nominations that missed the deadline (three), or where vetting is not yet complete (two).

<p>Private, independent search engine exits beta phase on its first anniversary, with innovative features that help users de-Google their search</p>
<p>One year ago, <a>we launched Brave Search</a> to give everyone online a real choice over Big Tech: a privacy-protecting, unbiased alternative to Google and Bing, and a truly independent alternative to providers—such as DuckDuckGo or Startpage—that rely on Big Tech to run.</p>
<p>Today, Brave Search is exiting its beta phase. It’s the default search engine for most new Brave browser users, and any user can search privately using Brave Search in their favorite browser by going to search.brave.com. It’s had rapid user growth, released a slew of innovative features, and challenged the Big Tech monopolies head on. All while staying true to core principles:</p>
 
 Independence: We serve results from our own built-from-scratch index of the Web 
 Privacy: We don’t track you, your searches, or your clicks 
 User-first: We put you first, not the advertising or data industries 
 Transparency: We don’t censor, bias, filter, or downrank results (unless legally required to) 
 Seamlessness: Brave can offer a best-in-class integration between the browser and search—from personalization to instant results as you type—without compromising privacy 
 
<p>To celebrate this one-year anniversary, we’d like to take a moment to highlight growth, give a sneak peek of Goggles, and review other innovative features of Brave Search.</p>

 Unparalleled growth 
<p>Brave Search has grown faster than any search provider since Bing. Some numbers:</p>
 
 2.5 billion queries in the past 365 days 
 A high of 14.1 million queries per day 
 5 billion queries annualized (projection based on current monthly totals) 
 
<p>For comparison, it took Google <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Search.html?id=FAJ9DAAAQBAJ">more than a year</a> to reach 2.5 billion queries, and DuckDuckGo <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/traffic">more than 4 years</a>.</p>
<p>While we’ll never stop improving, in many regions Brave Search already has a level of quality that competes with other established search engines such as Google and Bing. Thanks to this quality, growth, new features, and continued rise in global independence scores, we’re pleased to announce that we’re removing the “beta” label from Brave Search.</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>“Since launching one year ago, Brave Search has prioritized independence and innovation in order to give users the privacy they deserve. The Web is changing, and our incredible growth shows that there is demand for a new player that puts users first,” said Josep M. Pujol, Chief of Search at Brave. “Today we’re releasing Goggles to alter the way search has traditionally been done and to put users in charge at last. The world is too diverse for a single ranking, so Goggles opens search ranking and filtering transparently for everyone to use, share, and improve.”</p>

 Search without limits: Goggles beta release 
<p>We’re excited to announce the long-awaited beta release of an innovative new Brave Search feature: Goggles. Goggles will enable anyone, or any community of people, to create sets of rules and filters to constrain the searchable space and / or alter the ordering of search results. Anyone could then choose to apply a Goggle—or extend it—to their view of Brave Search results. Essentially, Goggles will act as a re-ranking option on top of the Brave Search index.</p>
<p>This means that, instead of a single ranking, Brave Search can offer an almost limitless number of ranking options, enabling search use-cases that could be too specific for a general purpose search engine. While Brave Search doesn’t have editorial biases, all search engines have some level of intrinsic bias. Goggles allows for users to counter any intrinsic biases in the algorithm.</p>
<p>Brave Search is committed to openness in search. It does not manipulate its algorithm to bias, filter, or down-rank results (unless it’s compelled by law to do so). Contrast this with the world’s two largest search providers—Google and Bing—who <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-google-interferes-with-its-search-algorithms-and-changes-your-results-11573823753?mod=hp_lead_pos10">openly manipulate their rankings based on political leanings or other factors</a>.</p>
<p>Goggles takes this commitment to openness a step further by allowing users to choose, alter, or extend the ranking of Brave Search results. In the sample query “search engine” below, you’ll see the power of Goggles in action. You can see that a simple query that would normally favor more common news outlets instead here shows results from individual bloggers.</p>



    



    


    


    
    




    



    


    


    
    

<p>Goggles can work much the same way for any topic, any media, any website. With Goggles, users can search without Big Tech’s bias—they can search without limits.</p>
 
 
<p>To get started with the Goggles beta, simply conduct a search at search.brave.com and click the Goggles tab on the results page.</p>
 
 
<p>Anybody can make Goggles, use ones created by others, and see the source code for already existing Goggles—and extend it—by <a href="https://github.com/brave/goggles-quickstart">visiting the Github repository</a>.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Read the full <a>Goggles white paper</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>The Goggles available at launch (listed below) are demos, created by Brave for educational purposes only, and to showcase the Goggles’ syntax and their simplicity. They’re meant as examples so users can understand the impact and potential for new Goggles, and developers can extend or fork them. Brave will not actively maintain or extend those Goggles, and will delete these specific Goggles once the community has begun building their own.</p>
 
 
<p>Tech blogs—Rerank results to boost content found on technical blogs.</p>
 
 
<p>Hacker News—Prioritizes domains popular with the Hacker News community, minus those that would rank among the top 1000 most-viewed websites.</p>
 
 
<p>No Pinterest—Rerank results to remove pages / threads hosted on Pinterest.</p>
 
 
<p>Rust programming—Rerank results to boost content related to the Rust programming language.</p>
 
 
<p>Copycats removal—Rerank results to remove “copycat” content (e.g. StackOverflow threads or GitHub translations).</p>
 
 
<p>1k short—Rerank results to remove pages found on the top 1,000 most-viewed websites.</p>
 
 The lists of tech blogs are drawn from multiple sources, including blogsurf.io and refined.blog, and not vetted by Brave. The list of top sites in the “1k short” Goggle are drawn from tranco-list.eu. Newly up-ranked sites are not vetted by Brave. 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Community engagement with Goggles has already started. The team at <a href="https://allsides.com/">Allsides</a> has built Goggles based on their knowledge of political biases in the media. Note that Brave is not affiliated with any of the Goggles’ independent creators.</p>
 
 Left-leaning sources—Rerank results to boost content from left-leaning sources. 
 Right-leaning sources—Rerank results to boost content from right-leaning sources. 
 
 
 

 Discussions 
<p>Brave Search isn’t just about offering a newer, more private alternative to the same old search. We’re also adding brand new features to improve search results.</p>
<p>In addition to Goggles, <a>in April, 2022 we announced</a> Discussions. With Discussions, search results on Brave Search are augmented with actual conversations related to the query, pulled from popular forum sites including Reddit. This allows users to easily see what various communities are saying about a topic, rather than just reading content curated by websites.</p>
<p>Discussions bring multiple points of view to search, and a readymade method—upvotes and likes—to measure an answer’s quality. They also allow Brave Search to combat the so-called “SEO spam” that’s <a href="https://dkb.io/post/google-search-is-dying">become so prominent on Google</a>. Brave Search is already better than other search engines at handling SEO content—with Discussions, we’re enhancing results even more to bring real human conversations (and answers) right to the search results page.</p>

 How we’ve grown 
<p>Of course privacy, independence, and innovation are nice. But search lives and dies on accuracy. From the beginning, we set out to build a search engine that delivers the quality, nuance, and depth that people expect from Google or Bing. And we set ourselves that mission all while committing to stay true to our principles.</p>
<p>So Brave Search then became an enormous engineering challenge: How to build the index—and the ranking algorithm—without collecting user data? We came up with a handful of ways:</p>
 
 <a>The Web Discovery Project</a>: A privacy-preserving way for users to anonymously contribute browsing data, and thus improve the coverage and quality of Brave Search. 
 <a href="https://search.brave.com/help/google-fallback">Fallback mixing</a>: An anonymous way for Brave to check Google in cases where our index isn’t complete or refined enough (especially for “long-tail” queries), and “mix” the results for you. 
 <a href="https://search.brave.com/help/anonymous-local-results">Anonymous local results</a>: A way for Brave Search to serve localized search results (e.g. for the query “restaurants near me”) without knowing your physical location or broadcasting your IP address. 
 <a href="https://search.brave.com/help/feedback">Listening to your feedback</a>: We have a strong community of Brave Search users who provide feedback, requests, and suggestions on everything from results, features, infoboxes and widgets, and more. And we act on as much of this feedback as we can. 
 

 Independence scores 
<p>Together, the above show it is possible to thread the needle: to both improve the index for all users, and preserve their privacy and anonymity online. In addition to the rapid growth Brave has seen, we’re also checking another metric to measure the success of this mission: the independence score.</p>
<p>In isolation, this score—shown for both individuals and users globally—is a measure of the percentage of our results served directly from the Brave Search index. But it also does something much more important: It ensures free access to information, without Big Tech’s manipulation. Search engines that depend too much, or exclusively, on Big Tech are subject to their censorship, biases, and editorial decisions. The Web needs multiple search providers—without choice there’s no freedom.</p>
<p>Brave is building an alternative to what already exists, not window dressing the same old thing.</p>
 
 The global independence score for all Brave Search users is 92% 
 This is up from 87% when Brave Search first launched one year ago 
 



    



    


    


    
    


 Let me de-Google that for you (LMDGTFY) 
<p>When Brave first acquired the Tailcat team and began to lay the foundation for Brave Search, we knew what we were up against: The monolith of Google. It was audacious enough to take on a global brand that dominates 85% of search volume and over 60% of desktop browser usage worldwide. Doing so in a way that preserved user privacy and relied on an independently built index of the Web was a huge challenge. But it was consistent with Brave’s mission of putting users first and fixing the Web.</p>
<p>Coupled with our privacy browser, Brave now provides the first truly viable, private browser+search alternative to the Big Tech platforms. We’re making it seamless for users to browse and search with guaranteed privacy, all while fighting the censorship and overreach of Big Tech companies. And, rather than just offer a privacy-first copy of Google, we’re continuing to innovate with features such as Discussions and Goggles.</p>
<p>Ever hear the phrase “Let me Google that for you?” How about letting Brave de-Google that for you instead?</p>

<p>By Jason Borseth, PM for zkApps at <a href="https://o1labs.org/">O(1) Labs</a>, a Mina ecosystem partner</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.minaprotocol.com/zkapps">zkApps on Mina Protocol</a> are poised for an exciting summer, with the <a href="https://blog.o1labs.org/join-us-for-the-first-ever-snarkyjs-week-6c718ed2b090">first-ever SnarkyJS Week kicking off today</a> and the incentivized Berkeley Testnet planned for later this summer!&nbsp;</p>
<p>As SnarkyJS Week gets underway, we want to begin by sharing more about <a href="https://docs.minaprotocol.com/zkapps">zkApps</a> to give insight into why we made some of the design decisions we did, the unique advantages they provide for Mina, and the vision for their future.</p>
 Zero-knowledge proof powered smart contracts 
<p>As fans of Mina know well, Mina Protocol is built on zero-knowledge proofs, and is the only layer-1 blockchain built on recursive zero-knowledge proofs (“ZKPs”), which are even more powerful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These enable Mina Protocol to have the world’s-lightest blockchain and are the foundation upon which we can entirely rethink how to design a modern, smart contract platform, such as Mina’s zkApps.</p>
<p>For anyone new to zero-knowledge proofs, let’s give a brief summary, so the rest of this post will make more sense:&nbsp;</p>
<p>ZKPs enable you to perform a computation (of any kind, size, &amp; duration) that generates a zero-knowledge proof as its output. This proof contains none of the private data used in the computation and can be presented to a 3rd party (such as a blockchain) who can run an associated verifier function that returns a true/false to indicate “yes this proof was generated using the expected computation/program” or “no it wasn’t”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, a developer could write a ZK program that takes seconds, minutes, hours, or even days to run–doing anything that a developer desires–but the proof generated will always be fast to verify (on the order of tens or hundreds of milliseconds) irrespective of how complex the original computation was.</p>
<p>This characteristic is the key upon which we built zkApps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How this works 
<p>zkApps on Mina execute off-chain, privately in a user’s web browser, and generate a zero-knowledge proof.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a user sends a zkApp transaction containing this proof to the Mina network, the zkApp account on Mina will only accept the transaction if the proof is valid, indicating the user ran the computation expected for this smart contract. If it is valid, then the transaction is accepted and any state that the developer has chosen to store on-chain is updated. All other private inputs from the user are never sent to or seen by the network. A developer must explicitly indicate which data they want to be public state in order for it to be stored on-chain. On-chain state is most often useful to allow coordination between different users or a given user over time; there are additional uses but we’ll get to that later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this way, the user’s privacy can be maintained, the network remains highly scalable due to off-chain computation, and developers have powerful smart contracts with unlimited off-chain computation that support both private data inputs and optional public state!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Early blockchain architectures 
<p>Early blockchains supporting smart contracts, such as Ethereum, were built on the concept that every node in the network must both: 1.) store all data on-chain, and 2.) run every computation that the network has ever seen, in order to verify the current consensus state of the network. This is incredibly inefficient and has major downsides:</p>
 
 First, requiring every node to run every computation is highly inefficient and bad for network scalability. 
 Second, it imposes a gas-based fee model on users, where transactions running more complex computations require higher transaction fees. 
 Third, storing all data on-chain data is harmful for user privacy.&nbsp; 
 Lastly, storing all data on chain harms decentralization by accumulating over time and creating a very large blockchain (in GB to TB) such that fewer and fewer network participants will be willing to pay the costs to operate a full consensus node (Ethereum is <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_chain_full_sync_data_size">755 GB</a> and growing). 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Building a more ideal blockchain architecture 
<p>Now, let’s envision a more ideal architecture using zero-knowledge proofs:</p>
 
 First, we want a lightweight (in KB size) way to represent and verify the blockchain’s current consensus state, from the present back to the genesis block. Keeping this consensus “source of truth” small ensures we maintain a high degree of decentralization. Mina’s constant size, 22 KB consensus proof, serves this perfectly!&nbsp; 
 Next, we want to offer unlimited computation for users at no additional transaction cost. We can do this by running computations off-chain and sending a ZK proof that cryptographically proves the expected computation was run. If the computation exceeds the maximum constraints allowed by the ZK proof, Mina’s proof system will use its infinite recursion to accommodate as much computation as desired in exchange for extra recursive steps. So now we have unlimited off-chain computation! 
 We also want privacy for users. By executing smart contracts off-chain, we’re able to process private data in a user’s web browser such that it can always remain on the user’s computer and never sent to the blockchain. Users end up attesting to facts about their data, rather than sharing their private data itself. So now we have powerful privacy for users!&nbsp; 
 We also want optional public data (a.k.a. “state”), so that a developer can store the current state of their application. This is useful to enable coordination between different users or a single user over time, among other reasons. Mina has 8 fields of on-chain storage per zkApp account. 
 Lastly, let’s dream big and allow developers to store larger data off chain. We can store larger data structures, like a Merkle tree, off chain and we only need to store the root hash of the tree on chain. Because of how Merkle trees work (hashes of hashes), this provides data authenticity even though the bulk of the data is stored off chain. What this achieves is a good separation of concerns–the bulk of our data can be stored off-chain using ideal infrastructure for this need and is flexible to adapt to newer, better, more efficient data storage mechanisms over time. Most importantly, the ability to verify the consensus state of the network is not impaired by data accumulation over time like occurs on Ethereum! 
 
<p>This is zkApps!</p>
<p>Off-chain storage is planned, but the rest is available today on Mina’s Berkeley QANet and soon on Berkeley Testnet!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Advantages of zkApps 
<p>To summarize the advantages, we now have:</p>
 
 Unlimited off-chain computation 
 Predictable, flat transaction fees for users (not gas-based) 
 Privacy for user data 
 Optional, public on-chain state 
 Off-chain storage for large data (planned) 
 Infinitely recursive ZKPs (enabling easy rollups &amp; more) 
 
<p>This flexibility creates a powerful toolset for developers to build a new generation of blockchain apps powered by zero-knowledge proofs, which we call zkApps!</p>
<p>We haven’t even touched on the advantages of zkApps’ developer tooling yet–the Mina zkApp CLI and SnarkyJS, a TypeScript library for writing zkApp smart contracts. But we’ll save that for another blog post!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Vision for the future 
<p>In addition to the zkApp features mentioned above, both Mina Foundation, and Mina ecosystem contributors such as O(1) Labs, Nil Foundation, &amp; more are building other fundamental building blocks for the Mina ecosystem. These include a <a href="https://minaprotocol.com/blog/ethereum-foundation-and-mina-foundation-award-a-1-2m-contract-to-nilfoundation-to-implement-minas-privacy-preserving-zk-snarks-on-ethereum">zkBridge</a> to bridge Mina zkApps and other blockchains such as Ethereum, and zkOracles to consume data from external sources inside zkApps (such as price feeds &amp; more Web2 APIs and websites).</p>
<p>With zkApps, zkBridge, and zkOracles, a powerful zero-knowledge ecosystem lies ahead for Mina Protocol. zkApps are only the first step!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

         Partnering with Deno: Application Development for the Modern Web            <p>Ryan, Bert and the Deno team are breathing new life into the server-side JavaScript ecosystem.</p>  <p>By Lauren Reeder and Mike Vernal</p><p>Published </p>       



            



 
 
   
<p>Today, we are incredibly excited to announce that we are partnering with Ryan Dahl, Bert Belder and the team at <a href="https://deno.com/">Deno</a>.</p>



<p>Over the last couple of years, application development has moved to the cloud. If you want an auto-scaling database, a warehouse or a message bus, you have MongoDB, Snowflake or Confluent available at the click of a button. Yet for core application logic, developers still need to worry about pods, instances, versions, ports, regions and everything between. Whether it’s deciding to run your application in US-east1 or US-east2, or choosing the right instance type out of the dozens of options—it all feels archaic and far too complex.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t need to be that way. We deeply believe in a serverless future—one where developers can write their core logic in a simple, accessible way, and the cloud will be responsible for auto-scaling and globally distributing that code to all of the machines needed to serve their users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also believe that in that future, Deno will be the easiest, fastest way to build applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ryan has been making full-stack application development dramatically more accessible for well over a decade. He is the creator of Node.js, which brought the power of JavaScript—and later TypeScript—outside of the browser and into the cloud. But as Ryan detailed in his 2018 presentation “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3BM9TB-8yA">10 Things I Regret about Node.js</a>,” it was built in and for a different era. That’s why he and co-founder Bert created Deno: to bring the world a modern JavaScript and TypeScript runtime.</p>



<p>Deno has become <a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno">tremendously popular</a> in the last four years; with more than 83k stars, it’s already nearly caught up to Node. The recent launch of <a href="https://deno.com/deploy">Deno Deploy</a> made it trivial to build serverless apps in a globally distributed way—and since then, Deno has seen strong adoption by both individual developers and as the new default environment for products such as <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/announcing-serverless-compute-with-edge-functions/">Netlify’s serverless Edge Functions</a> and <a href="https://deno.com/blog/supabase-functions-on-deno-deploy#:~:text=With%20Deno%2C%20Supabase%20Functions%20get,websites%2C%20services%2C%20and%20apps.">Supabase’s Functions</a>. For those customers and countless others, Deno is a much-needed breath of fresh air. No more puzzling over or tweaking instances or pods—just write your app with JS/TS with Deno and then deploy and auto-scale around the world.</p>



<p>But Ryan, Bert and their team are just getting started on their mission to make it dramatically easier to write global-scale web applications, and we are thrilled to partner with them on that journey by leading this Series A. If you’re interested in Deno, you can check it out <a href="https://deno.com/deploy">here</a>. And if you’d like to join the team, please reach out—they’re <a href="https://deno.com/jobs">hiring</a> now!</p>
