<p>The very nature of Ethereum addresses, expressed as random hexadecimal character strings, represents a big hurdle for mass adoption, as they are not human-readable. ENS domains were envisioned to not only solve this and provide a seamless UX, but to also be the cornerstone of on-chain identities. However, in the current multichain landscape, a plethora of decentralised naming services arose, which led to a heterogeneous domain name pool. As a result, ENS aims to expand to L2s and non-EVM chains, attempting to provide consistency, in order to further reduce user friction and limit conflicting domain names.</p><p>We were joined by Nick Johnson, founder of ENS, to discuss the current state of decentralised naming services from a multichain and L2 perspective, and how these ultimately tie into decentralised identities.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Nick’s background and ENS history  The plethora of decentralised naming services  ENS use cases  Interacting with Web2 DNS  L2 compatibility for ENS via CCIP Read  ENS wrapper and subdomains  CCIP Read  Bridging ENS to non-EVM L2s  Coinbase’s cb.id  ENS and on-chain privacy OPSEC  Account abstraction  The future of ENS  Governance   <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/nicksdjohnson">Nick Johnson on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ensdomains">ENS on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Sebastien Couture.

You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8_ueRFRLcY">watch the first ever town hall here</a> or read on for a TL;DW summary of each talk, and you can find a transcript of the Q&amp;A session at the very bottom of this&nbsp;post.</p> Key highlights <p>It’s been a busy time for the Nym core team, readying the mixnet for its first consumer application in the form of the NymVPN, preparing integrations, partnerships, optimisations, and plenty of R&amp;D developments. Everyone is truly firing on all cylinders.</p><p>Here are just some of the key highlights from the last&nbsp;quarter:</p>  Optimising the Nym network for scale ahead of NymVPN&nbsp;launch  NymVPN <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nymvpn-litepaper-and-preview-video-released-3cd00d821de0">litepaper</a> released  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/zk-nyms-are-here-a-major-milestone-towards-a-market-ready-mixnet-a3470c9ab10a">Zk-nym</a> anonymous credentials systems deployed in testnet, live&nbsp;soon  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/faster-better-stronger-smooshier-improving-mixnet-coverage-with-project-smoosh-eaf4b215507f">Project ‘Smoosh’</a> to reward gateways and simplify operating infrastructure  <a href="https://sdk.nymtech.net/">SDKs</a> for easier integrations with the Nym&nbsp;mixnet  Initial <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-censorship-resistance-update-d2f5e08e66d1">censorship resistance</a> work, new Outfox packet&nbsp;format  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/press-release-nym-partners-with-near-foundation-bringing-web3-privacy-to-users-and-validators-844966df7f0b">Partnership with Near’s</a> L1 blockchain announced — more partnerships to come&nbsp;soon!  <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/">Nym Shipyard MOOC</a> with 2k+ participants to scale the Nym community  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-300m-innovation-fund-opens-for-applications-this-november-ad82f06a060b">$300m Innovation Fund</a> to support privacy projects leveraging Nym&nbsp;stack   Nym Community Town Hall — Q3&nbsp;recap <p>Hosted by Sudo and Diane from the Nym core team, this well-attended livestream featured updates from Nym CEO and cofounder Harry Halpin; Head of Research and Nym cofounder Ania Piotrowska; Head of Engineering, Mark Sinclair; Lead Product Manager, Marc Debizet; Head of Business Development, Ade Molajo; and community contributor Huxian.</p>Presentation slide on the Nym roadmap, from Harry Halpin, CEO and cofounder, Nym<p>CEO and cofounder Harry Halpin provided a roadmap update about the NymVPN and ongoing work to improve the mixnet — including<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/faster-better-stronger-smooshier-improving-mixnet-coverage-with-project-smoosh-eaf4b215507f"> project Smoosh</a>, where gateways binaries are merged into mix node binaries, simplifying the infrastructure while also incentivising more people to run gateways.</p><p>Harry also ran through the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/zk-nyms-are-here-a-major-milestone-towards-a-market-ready-mixnet-a3470c9ab10a">zk-nyms</a> anonymous credentials system, a core technology that will allow users to pay for the NymVPN with no financial paper trail, unlike other existing VPNs. He previewed upcoming censorship resistance technologies on the Nym network so that in time, anyone will be able to access NymVPN, anywhere.</p><p>Finally, Harry dropped some tantalising teasers about upcoming partnerships in addition to the recent <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/press-release-nym-partners-with-near-foundation-bringing-web3-privacy-to-users-and-validators-844966df7f0b">Nym-Near collaboration</a>, plus hinted at potential institutional support for 2024 and&nbsp;beyond.</p>Presentation slide on building, integrating and using Nym from Mark Sinclair, Head of Engineering, Nym<p>Mark Sinclair, Head of Engineering at Nym gave an update on technical progress around development and integrations, including <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/mixfetch-like-the-fetch-api-but-via-the-mixnet-82acfd435c62">mixFetch</a>, the drop-in replacement for the Fetch API — so builders can use the mixnet in their applications with just three lines of code. The development team is currently working on a node.js version of both the Wasm client and mixFetch, he said. Mark provided more details on the SDK, and previewed a white-label zk-nyms solution so builders will be able to, in future, integrate the zero-knowledge credentials system in their own projects.</p>Presentation slide on the NymVPN value proposition, from Marc Debizet, Lead Product Manager,&nbsp;Nym<p>Marc Debizet, Lead Product Manager, Nym said that <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nymvpn-litepaper-and-preview-video-released-3cd00d821de0">NymVPN</a> will give users the best possible combination for enjoying privacy at all times — the decentralised VPN mode for everyday browsing, plus the mixnet mode for even more advanced privacy protections.</p><p>Marc also delved into the features of the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nymvpn-litepaper-and-preview-video-released-3cd00d821de0">upcoming NymVPN</a> including private payments and showed viewers a preview demo, before explaining ongoing work for further hardware and software optimisation to improve the mixnet. And look out for the NymVPN website coming extremely soon, he said, where you can sign up to the access wait&nbsp;list.</p>Presentation slide about achievements and ongoing R&amp;D from Ania Piotrowska, Head of Research, Nym<p>Ania Piotrowska, Nym cofounder and Head of Research offered a deeper dive on the R&amp;D side behind zk-nym credentials, as well as upcoming work on censorship resistance for the Nym network and by extension, the NymVPN. Also included were details on forward security and replay attack detection to further safeguard both users and the network. Ania teased the new Outfox packet format, a simplified but faster format derived from Sphinx, which is currently used by the mixnet. Keep your eyes peeled for an Outfox explainer on this blog&nbsp;soon.</p>Presentation slide about the Nym $300m Innovation Fund from Ade Molajo, Head of Business Development, Nym<p>Ade Molajo, Head of Business Development detailed the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-300m-innovation-fund-opens-for-applications-this-november-ad82f06a060b">$300m Innovation Fund programme</a>, which will foster growth in the privacy ecosystem specifically for projects that leverage the Nym tech stack. He discussed <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/press-release-nym-partners-with-near-foundation-bringing-web3-privacy-to-users-and-validators-844966df7f0b">the recent partnership with the NEAR Foundation</a> to bring the privacy protections of the Nym mixnet to Near’s L1 blockchain, and encouraged builders to apply for open grants&nbsp;now.</p>Presentation slide on the three Shipyard tracks from Huxian, Nym community contributor (featuring visuals from&nbsp;<a href="https://linktr.ee/Poppel">Poppel</a>)<p>Huxian, Nym community contributor updated viewers on <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-shipyard-level-1-unlocked-87e79da32f67">Nym Shipyard</a> and detailed his vision for Nym community squads — what he describes as a ‘social mesh’ system of ‘autonomous collective intelligence agents, weaving trust into the fabric of the mixnet’. He urged viewers to form their own squads, or join existing ones, whether ‘Builders’, ‘Operators’ or ‘Visionaries’, to contribute to the health of the mixnet and build the future private internet.</p> Community Q&amp;A <p>The following Q&amp;A session was compiled from the questions received after each individual core team member’s presentation, as well as the open Q&amp;A at the end of the Town Hall. The questions and answers have been lightly edited only for grammar, clarity, and readability.</p><p>Are there any specific types of applications you think are more or less appropriate for integrating and using the mixnet at this point, and in the&nbsp;future?</p><p>Mark Sinclair, Head of Engineering, Nym: I think for any applications that are written in JavaScript, and that use the Fetch API, mixFetch is a really easy&nbsp;drop-in.</p><p>Currently, because of the allow list [for the network requesters], there are only a few hosts on the internet that you’ll be able to&nbsp;use.</p><p>But as we go live with the ‘smooshed’ gateways and network requesters from project Smoosh, this obviously opens it up to a much wider piece of the internet. Definitely React applications — say React Native, anything written in TypeScript, or JavaScript, Node.Js. All of those are really good candidates for mixFetch and should be pretty easy to integrate with.</p><p>Are there any limitations with the mixnet to be wary of, such as&nbsp;latency?</p><p>Mark Sinclair: Obviously, the main purpose of the mixnet is to hide people’s traffic from a global adversary.</p><p>Because of the cover traffic — some of the traffic will be cover traffic and some will be real traffic —there will be delays. I think it’s not really appropriate for doing things that are really timing specific. That’s just the sacrifice that you have to pay for things that are private, so please don’t use it to do things that are really time sensitive. The performance will never be as good there because it specifically adds delays to add&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Can Nym work on&nbsp;Solana?</p><p>Mark Sinclair: Well, that’s quite a question! I think the thing is that it depends on which bits you’re trying to do. If you’re trying to make sure that any kind of transactions that you’re sending are hidden from a global adversary, and you’ve got a way — like in those diagrams that I showed — to hide portions of the infrastructure from a global adversary, then&nbsp;yes.</p><p>Otherwise, there really are two kinds of use cases here: user traffic, and things that have to do with say, consensus or validators. And then the validators themselves would need to have Nym built into them. Because if any part is sticking out, then you’re maybe not getting the benefits&nbsp;there.</p><p>So the answer would be yes, but it depends what exactly you’re trying to protect. And I suggest looking at the integration guide on <a href="https://sdk.nymtech.net/">sdk.nymtech.net</a>.</p><p>Do you suspect any issues paying for NymVPN on iOS devices, since Apple doesn’t like payments that bypass the app&nbsp;store?</p><p>Marc Debizet, Lead Product Manager, Nym: I think we’ll have to comply with Apple’s policy. Unfortunately. When you buy the subscriptions for Nym directly on iOS, you’ll have to follow the rules set by Apple. So if you want to bypass that you will have to subscribe to Nym directly on our&nbsp;website.</p><p>After NymVPN is launched and efficiently working, is there anything stopping the team from giving us a Nym antivirus?</p><p>Marc Debizet: The Nym mission is to enable privacy for everyone. So we’re not into cyber security, we are into&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Are there any plans to make the e-cash system interoperable with other blockchain or payment ecosystems? How would this impact user privacy and cross-platform transactions?</p><p>Ania Piotrowska, Nym cofounder and Head of Research: In general, the whole scheme which we designed, which was published at PETS, is quite generic. We use them in Nym for paying for using the Nym network. But they can be used in many other scenarios. They could be used by other blockchains. They could be used by CBDCs, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>So it’s a very generic protocol, which could be deployed in many, many situations. That’s really a little bit up to imagination and the needs of people from other projects.</p><p>Right now, we’re not planning to do any big-scale integrations, we’d rather focus on using them within our network. But once we’re gonna polish this, and we’re happy with how this works with Nym, who knows where we are going to&nbsp;look?</p><p>What are the benefits that the Nym community can see in the long from the Nym-Near partnership?</p><p>Ade Molajo: That’s a really good question. So for the Nym community, obviously, once the Near partnership is live, once the integration has been done, that it means that we’re going to be having more traffic going through the mix nodes, which invariably means there will be more awards for our node operators, as well as validators. So that’s the immediate benefit that we’ll&nbsp;see.</p><p>It’s evidently an incredibly exciting time for Nym and the Nym community. We in the core team hope you found the Community Town Hall as enjoyable as we did. See you in&nbsp;Q4!</p><p>As always: for more updates as they happen, keep your eyes on this blog, follow Nym on socials, and join the Nym community.</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-community-town-hall-q3-recap-c2f78c981493">Nym Community Town Hall Q3 — recap</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>A busy month just went by! Here’s everything we did and what’s on the horizon for Panther.</p><p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>October has been a productive month for us, and we’re excited to share our progress in many areas as we work towards Panther v1. <br>Without further ado, let’s dive in.</p> Tech Updates  Stage 2 <p>The latest development sprints were focused on solving a bug related to an external library used for Stage 2, an external factor that has caused a delay. <br><br>Our Incentivized <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testnet-stage-2-is-now-live-and-its-all-about-rewards/">Testnet Stage 2 </a>is now officially underway, bringing a wave of features and rewards to the Panther community. <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testnet-stage-2-is-now-live-and-its-all-about-rewards/">Stage 2</a> is critical as it puts our user interaction and reward mechanisms to the test, laying the groundwork for Panther Protocol’s privacy-preserving features. Our protocol’s privacy is intricately tied to unique game-theoretical features that encourage active user participation, making this stage a pivotal moment for the upcoming Panther Protocol v1.</p><p>Stage 2 includes creating and activating your Panther Account, finding your onboarding bonuses, and claiming your vouchers. <br>Your participation and feedback are crucial as we move closer to our v1 release. Thank you for being a part of Testnet Stage 2, and don't hesitate to share your thoughts through our community channels!</p> V1 redesign <p>Over the past weeks, we have done some UX refinements too. The focus was reviewing what we have learned from the previous design iterations and expanding on it further while also elevating the user experience. Another objective was to revamp and update the onboarding process for more seamless account setup.</p><p>You can take a look at a quick preview below:</p> Ecosystem  Panel with PureFi Protocol <p>Just in case you missed our last update, on October 2nd we hosted <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1zqKVqmnqaaxB?s=20&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">a great conversation via Twitter Spaces</a> with our partners at PureFi.

<p>Now and through the end of January 2024, Electric Coin Co. (ECC) objectives center on delivering an improved ZEC user experience, primarily through the Zashi wallet. Across teams — Product; Engineering; PeopleOps; and Communications and Advocacy — ECC employees are focused on work that either directly contributes to the wallet or in some way makes ZEC and Zashi adoption more viable.</p>



<p>Background: ECC uses an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectives_and_key_results">OKR process</a> for prioritizing and delivering measurable work on four-month cycles. In October, teams met and finalized planning for T3 2023-24 (October-January).</p>



<p>Priorities were developed to accomplish or make meaningful progress on the following:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Release the next version of the Zashi app including a new UX and UI 



 Transition more responsibilities to the wider Zcash community so ECC can focus on building Zashi, starting with the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/decentralizing-zcash-digital/45349">Decentralizing Zcash Digital</a> effort.&nbsp; 



 Take meaningful steps in the effort to transition Zcash from proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS), Zashi’s eventual consensus mechanism, by publishing a design with security arguments, and a protocol simulator. 



 Maintain policy efforts to ensure Zashi and Zcash are (1) accessible and usable by people in the United States and (2) considered socially beneficial. Continue hosting notable policy events and publishing episodes of the PGP for Crypto Podcast. 



 Support select ecosystem teams and projects that directly benefit Zashi users
 
 Support Brave’s integration of Zcash and encrypted media/files. 



 Support Edge, Unstoppable, and Nighthawk’s use of the ECC mobile wallet SDKs. 



 Build and/or improve Zashi features (e.g., implementing ZIP-317 and Orchard). 
 
 
 



<p>Each ECC team has built their OKRs to support these company objectives.</p>

 Intro <p>Panther community,</p><p>As we conclude Testnet Stage 1 with a number of learnings and upgrades, we are thrilled to announce the commencement of Stage 2 of our Testnet.</p><p>This second phase is designed to test the user interaction and reward mechanisms that set the foundation for the protocol’s privacy-preserving features. As Panther’s privacy is built upon unique game-theoretical features fostering user activity, Stage 2 is key for the upcoming Panther Protocol v1.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look at Stage 2. It comprises three main categories of reward mechanisms: Rewards, Recharge pool, and Vouchers.</p> 1. Rewards <p>Rewards or protocol reward points (PRPs) are created as an incentive for users to join and continuously use Panther Protocol. This implies converting the ‘Available PRP’ to ZKP which is accomplished via a <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/fees-and-rewards-structure/prps/single-side-automated-market-maker?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">single-sided AMM</a> (automated market maker) pool. It is one-sided because users can only convert their PRP to ZKP and not vice versa. The exchange rate of this conversion is dynamic in nature and depends on several factors, including the amount of ZKP in the pool and the total available PRP held by users at any given point in time, among other factors. For details on how Panther Rewards works, please see <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/fees-and-rewards-structure/prps?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther docs</a>.</p><p>There are two types of PRPs:</p>  Available PRPs which can be exchanged to zZKP (ZKP within the MASP) immediately.  Pending PRP is the accrued rewards that are not realized yet because a user has not spent those UTXOs. To make it available, the UTXO's should be included in transactions that a user performs within Panther.<br>   2. Recharge Pool  <p>Note: Recharge Pool functionality is currently not included in Stage 2; it will be announced in the upcoming days, prior to Stage 3 release.</p><p>This is a functionality where ZKP is fed to the AMM pool which will be triggered by the user (which costs some gas fees) and the protocol incentivizes the action in the form of a Voucher as described above.</p><p>Check out the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/fees-and-rewards-structure/prps/single-side-automated-market-maker?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther docs</a> to understand the source of ZKP to the Reward Pool (on Polygon)</p><p>The pool can be recharged which means an additional amount of zZKP tokens (see the Recharge screen, Recharge Size field) will be brought to the pool.&nbsp;</p> 3. Vouchers <p>Vouchers are a reward mechanism that can be used by the Protocol to incentivize certain functions that have to be triggered by Users. We refer to them as Admin functions. Those could include but are not limited to functions such as:</p>  Recharging Reward Pool  Trigger conversion of token&nbsp;  <p>Note: the onboarding reward voucher issued atThe voucher this Stage is only for testing purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When a new account is created and activated successfully, a user gets (a) 100 zZKP onto his zAccount and (b) 1 voucher which is worth 500 PRP. This is valid for all new users and the users who have created accounts during Stage 1.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: it can take up to a minute to get the voucher screen updated to let a user find his onboarding voucher.</p><p>The voucher has a stable predefined value which can be different depending on the type of performed action (onboarding = PRP 500, triggering recharge the reward pool = PRP 100). The voucher is nominated in PRP.&nbsp; To get those PRP, one should claim a voucher - it is about submitting a transaction “burn a voucher - get the corresponding PRP”.&nbsp;</p><p>Vouchers are grouped per type of action performed. Stage 2 will have two such groups - (1) Onboarding bonus voucher and (2) Recharge bonus voucher. Vouchers can be claimed by group only, which means a user gets the total PRP for all vouchers in a given group. When claiming is completed successfully, a user will see an updated balance on his (a) Dashboard → Panther Rewards Points section → Available PRP amount and (b) Rewards page → Redeem PRP screen → Available PRP section. &nbsp;</p> STAGE 2 TESTING <p>As we progress through our Testnet stages, we want to express our gratitude for your continued support, feedback, and enthusiasm. To start testing Stage 2, please visit Panther docs <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a> to get the most updated test link and follow the steps:</p>  New user creates and activates Panther Account (existing users go through the same step but the onboarding process bypasses the KYC verification) - see <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage-1-compliance-integrations-is-now-live-heres-how-to-test/">the Stage 1 functionality and instructions</a>.&nbsp;  <p>Note 1.1: both (a) new accounts and (b) previously created during Stage 1 Panther accounts both are valid.&nbsp;</p><p>When your account is successfully created, you will find a success screen:</p>  Find the first part of your onboarding bonus on your dashboard. This bonus is in the form of Panther Account zZKP which is expected to fuel all types of transactions within Panther such as paying Protocol fees, paying to Relayer for gasless transactions, paying Miner’s fee etc. Users are expected to maintain a sufficient balance of this account in zZKP using transfer functions available in later stages.&nbsp;&nbsp;    Find the second part of your onboarding bonus - an onboarding voucher,, which equals 500 PRPs. The voucher should be claimed to get the PRPs into your account. To find the second part, please follow the Rewards menu item =&gt; Vouchers screen =&gt; Onboarding Reward Vouchers.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Note 3.1: It takes time to detect and reflect the corresponding group of vouchers so there can be a case when the screen is empty before the data is updated:</p><p>Note 3.2: It takes time to make your voucher available for claiming, as the zAccount UTXO must be mined in advance. The UI will reflect your bonus voucher. Please be aware that claiming the voucher may take a few minutes in the test environment (due to lower mining activity which impacts transaction processing in the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/ecosystem-roles/miners?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Bus Queue</a>). The claim button is disabled until claiming is available.&nbsp;</p>  Claim your voucher via the Vouchers screen functionality. After Voucher is claimed successfully (Voucher screen will go back to the state mentioned in Note 3.1 upon a successfully claimed transaction), you can find the corresponding amount of PRP on the Redeem PRP screen, Available PRP field&nbsp;  <p>Note 4.1: Sometimes, it may take a few minutes to display the PRP available for redeeming (due to lower mining activity in the test environment, which impacts transaction processing in the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/ecosystem-roles/miners?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Bus Queue</a>). The button is disabled until Redeem is successful.&nbsp;</p>  Redeem your PRP from the Redeem PRP screen to get your zZKP. This zZKP will now be available in your Private zAssets section and zAssets Summary section balance in the Dashboard screen.  <p>To share your feedback, kindly fill in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczZNB-tvMILSo8paFjIkeeSub3cqxv7L85rCeR47ad5bs2Gw/viewform?usp=sf_link&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">form</a>.</p><p>This phase marks not just an advancement in the protocol's capabilities, but gets us a step closer to our v1 release. As always, make sure to let us know if you have any additional feedback through our social and community channels.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for participating in Testnet Stage 2!&nbsp;</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs.

  Partnering with Factory: Autonomous AI for All  <p>Matan and Eno are building fully-autonomous programming “Droids” to unlock creativity within and beyond engineering teams.</p>   
	By Shaun Maguire	 



Published November 2, 2023
  



 
<p>Like any VC partner, I get a lot of cold emails. But when Matan Grinberg’s note appeared in my inbox in March, it got my attention right away. Just from the subject line—”Chat with a fellow former hep-th physicist”—I knew we shared a background in the same tiny sub-field of high-energy physics theory. And as I read on and Googled a bit, I discovered that what he humbly described as having “worked with Juan” actually referred to co-authoring a paper with Juan Maldacena—a professor at the elite Institute for Advanced Study and arguably the world’s best-known living physicist—when Matan was still an undergrad.</p>



<p>I wrote back in less than an hour.</p>



<p>A few days later, Matan and I went for a walk. He’d been working at the intersection of physics and AI at Berkeley and pursuing a PhD, but was considering a transition from academia to a start-up—and though he hadn’t yet settled on a specific idea, it was clear that he wanted to build a company. It was also clear that he had a high EQ to match his exceptional background. I encouraged him to take the leap.</p>



<p>He started iterating, and within a week was working on the autonomous coding project&nbsp; that would become <a href="https://www.factory.ai/">Factory</a>—and working with a co-founder who, as it turned out, was in Sequoia’s orbit as well.</p>



<p>Eno Reyes, who grew up in Atlanta and first met Matan at Princeton, had recently accepted a job as an ML engineer at Hugging Face and moved to San Francisco’s Mission District—just a block from where his grandparents had settled down and set up a restaurant after immigrating from Puebla, Mexico. Shortly before he and Matan reunited at a hackathon and started building Factory, the Sequoia team met Eno at AI Ascent, a small gathering of the leading minds in AI that we held in March. Just a year out of college and a few months into his new role, he had already impressed enough to join CEO Clem Delangue at the event.</p>



<p>Matan and Eno’s idea was to build on the historic momentum in AI and unlock even more creativity in software development—and not just among engineers. In the face of a persistent tech talent <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/cracking-the-code-on-digital-talent">shortage</a>, with many Fortune 500 companies still running infrastructure built decades ago simply because they don’t have enough people to update it, these two co-founders understood that handing off time-consuming tasks like code review, documentation, testing, project management and debugging to fully autonomous “Droids,” or agents, would indeed be a game-changer for engineering teams. But they also understood that for every software developer, there are another 100 people who don’t have highly technical backgrounds—but do have great ideas that software could bring to life.</p>



<p>It is a next-generation vision for AI, and just a year ago, it would have been too ambitious. But Matan and Eno’s timing is perfect—and they are perfectly suited to the task, not only because of their deep domain expertise in ML, AI and physics, but also because they move at lightning speed. Once they’d landed on an idea, it took them a day to sign a term sheet, incorporate the company and start to build.</p>



<p>Six months later, Factory is delivering value to early customers that include two public companies and two decacorns. Meanwhile, Matan and Eno have more complex functionality on the roadmap, and they are <a href="https://www.factory.ai/careers">growing</a> an amazing team to build it. It has been a joy to welcome them to the Sequoia community, and we look forward to supporting them over the months and years to come as they work toward a world where programming capacity no longer limits our collective creativity.</p>

<p>Find a comprehensive deep dive into all the features of NymVPN ahead of its imminent&nbsp;launch</p><p>Today, Nym core team officially announces <a href="https://nymtech.net/nymvpn_litepaper.pdf">the NymVPN litepaper</a> ahead of launch. The litepaper details the peerless privacy protections on offer, features a comprehensive competitor analysis, and explains exactly why NymVPN will be an essential tool for the future internet. NymVPN will preserve your privacy, resist censorship and keep all your data, including metadata, safe — even from the app itself. Let’s take a closer&nbsp;look.</p> NymVPN: unparalleled privacy protections <p>The NymVPN is the first truly private consumer product that encrypts data and protects traffic analysis of metadata.</p><p>NymVPN is entirely decentralised, powered by the Nym network, with no single central point of control or failure. It will be accessible with completely private payments in the form of zk-nym credentials, based on zero-knowledge technology, shredding any financial paper trail between the user and their access to the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Languages: <a href="https://medium.com/@nymspanish/publicamos-el-litepaper-y-v%C3%ADdeo-de-nymvpn-28f1fae88873">Español</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@NYM_Indonesia/litepaper-nymvpn-dan-video-pratinjau-dirilis-1b108f76643e">Bahasa Indonesia</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymturkish/nymvpn-litepaper-ve-%C3%B6nizleme-videosu-yay%C4%B1nland%C4%B1-421db890b2f4">Türkçe</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@nym_ru/litepaper-%D0%B8-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8C%D1%8E-nymvpn-%D1%83%D0%B6%D0%B5-%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%83%D0%BF%D0%BD%D1%8B-d32a6a4c1054">Русский</a></p><p>What’s more, NymVPN gives control to the users with two main options to choose from for their privacy&nbsp;needs:</p>  VPN mode, a decentralised, secure 2-hop mode using the WireGuard protocol that’s optimised for speed — for medium-privacy/high-performance  Mixnet mode, for complete pattern protection security preventing even metadata analysis — for high-privacy/medium performance.  <p>This is a groundbreaking product — until now, the privacy landscape has been fragmented, with even privacy-conscious users having to pick between or audit multiple technologies to understand what works for them. No longer: pick whatever you need in the NymVPN app and use the internet with confidence.</p><p>Features will include a built-in ‘kill switch’ failsafe so if your VPN or mixnet connection drops, your internet access is blocked too. In time, the VPN will also have split tunnelling features, so users can select exactly which application traffic to route through the mixnet or the VPN, so that they don’t have to switch between the two&nbsp;modes.</p><p>With the shifting sands of censorship and anti-digital rights legislation sweeping across the planet right now, a VPN will be an essential tool for anyone who wants to securely access the internet services that they require. And the Nym R&amp;D team is also <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-censorship-resistance-update-d2f5e08e66d1">exploring proven censorship resistance technologies</a> to further cloak mixnet traffic and make it indistinguishable from anything else — so that any person on the planet can enjoy the privacy protections that are their&nbsp;right.</p><p>With NymVPN, the privacy protections are without parallel.</p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/nymvpn_litepaper.pdf">Read the Litepaper now for an ultra in-depth deep dive of NymVPN, including competitor analysis and the wider privacy landscape. Learn how NymVPN stacks up against traditional VPNs — and even&nbsp;Tor.</a></p><p>With NymVPN, you get real privacy — made&nbsp;simple.</p> Why does the world need NymVPN? Because traditional VPNs aren’t really private. NymVPN&nbsp;is. <p>The VPN market is enormous and growing — in fact, a third of all internet users worldwide use a VPN. That’s billions of people who know they need privacy, integrity, and security.

If you have enough metadata, you don’t really need content.”</p><p>NymVPN uses its powerful mix network to obfuscate metadata, preventing powerful adversaries from conducting traffic analysis attacks and de-anonymising users through observing the network. Cloaking metadata is a complex problem and it is one that every existing privacy-preserving technology, even great projects like Tor and Signal, fail to address — until&nbsp;now.</p> Traditional VPNs are centralised — you have to trust the technology and the business, completely <p>Many centralised VPNs, even privacy-focused VPNs, claim they have a “no log policy” — but when push comes to shove, even supposedly private VPNs have turned over information to third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>What’s more, centralised VPNs have a central point of failure, putting them at grave risk of data breaches — <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/whats-the-truth-about-the-nordvpn-breach-heres-what-we-now-know">possibly allowing observers to view&nbsp;traffic</a>.</p><p>When VPNs are centralised, you have to trust their business structure, too, and sometimes this is complicated <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/meet-nordsec-the-company-behind-nordvpn-wants-to-be-your-one-stop-privacy-suite/">by many stakeholders who are not visible at first glance</a>. In the case of ‘free’ VPNs, the user is the product — your every movement being tracked and then sold on to faceless data brokers for&nbsp;profit.</p><p>The question is: why risk entrusting any of this data to an unknown third party at all? It’s better to eliminate the risk of holding unnecessary data at all. This is what decentralisation via the Nym network&nbsp;offers.</p> Zk-nym credentials — solving the paper trail problem with real&nbsp;privacy <p>It is no secret that peoples’ financial lives are not exactly&nbsp;private.</p><p>When users pay for access to traditional VPNs, they leave a digital, financial paper trail behind, linking their payments to their&nbsp;account.</p><p>To solve this problem, NymVPN uses something called <a href="https://nymtech.net/about/zk-nyms">zk-nyms</a> to shred that paper trail and <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/press-release-nym-unveils-zero-knowledge-anonymous-credentials-zk-nyms-at-sxsw-6d56bd31802a">ensure full privacy from the moment a user&nbsp;pays</a>.</p><p>Zk-nyms are a credentials system based on zero-knowledge technologies. The user can be confident that their payments are private, but to understand exactly why, let’s take a look at what goes on in the background.</p><p>Essentially, zk-nyms are an access token that allow users to access the Nym network. They are issued by Nym-API nodes on the Nym network, after validating a user’s subscription and payment. The current implementation is based on the Coconut scheme, a cryptographic protocol that enables the issuance and verification of anonymous credentials, but optimised for use cases specific to Nym. For a deeper dive head to the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/011">Cryptology ePrint Archive&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>By exchanging fiat to native NYM, not only do zk-nyms preserve the users’ privacy for the whole stack, but this also guarantees the health of the NYM ecosystem, creating a steady stream of fiat to NYM that then circulates in the decentralised network.</p><p>Learn more in Nym Head of Research Ania Piotrowska’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/nLmdsZ1BsQg?feature=shared&amp;t=1714">masterclass</a> on&nbsp;zk-nyms.</p> The global decentralised infrastructure behind the&nbsp;NymVPN <p>Take a look at the <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">Nym Explorer</a> for the current distribution of nodes — at present, there are 637 mix nodes in total along with 240 nodes in the ‘active set’, currently mixing traffic, in more than 60 countries.</p><p>While the NymVPN encrypts traffic, the actual nodes that this traffic is mixed through are run completely independently by node operators in order to guarantee decentralisation. With the VPN mode, users will have their traffic run through two hops of these nodes. With the mixnet mode, users will have their traffic run through five hops of these nodes with ‘mixing’ performed in the inner three nodes of the&nbsp;flow.</p><p>This decentralised system is the result of a great deal of academic work designed to create a self-sustaining privacy system. Contrary to privacy projects like Tor which rely on community goodwill, the Nym network is incentivised and governed democratically by its own community. It is the fastest, most reliable mixnet in existence today, making real the idea first conceptualised by legendary cryptographer David Chaum decades&nbsp;ago.</p><p>Check out the <a href="https://nymtech.net/nym-whitepaper.pdf">original Nym whitepaper</a> and the brand new <a href="https://nymtech.net/nymvpn_litepaper.pdf">NymVPN litepaper</a> for an even deeper dive on the Nym token economics.</p><p>Everyone is invited to participate in the health of this democratic, decentralised system. NymVPN users can, for instance, ‘delegate’ their NYM tokens to mix node operators — a vote of confidence in the quality of service of that node, and an investment, because delegators will receive a share of that node’s&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Node operators and delegators therefore have a symbiotic relationship. Uptime and good quality mixes are rewarded, whereas if nodes perform poorly, the community can remove their NYM tokens from that node at any time, and place them in a competing node.</p><p>The whole system is carefully designed to promote community self-governance, along with an incentivised anti-surveillance business model — one that’s completely at odds with the current pro-surveillance business model of web 2.0. And with the payment conversion from fiat to NYM detailed above, Nym core expects an increase in activity in this ecosystem as more NYM tokens are acquired.</p><p>Below are the two main key entities in the underlying NymVPN network. Note there are more entities in the wider ecosystem specifically relating to our blockchain, smart contracts, economics including vaildators on the Nyx blockchain etc.</p><p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-is-not-a-blockchain-but-it-is-powered-by-one-4bb16ef16587">See also: What is Nyx?

They are responsible for routing users’ internet traffic through multi-hop paths, adding layers of privacy and security to online activities. Relay nodes are operated by independent individuals, each contributing to the network’s powerful decentralisation.  Gateways: These are the entry point and the exit points for&nbsp;traffic.  <p>Again, in VPN mode, the data goes through two hops — via an entry gateway and an exit gateway, both encrypting traffic and located in different geographies.</p><p>In mixnet mode, the data goes through 5 hops. That’s the entry gateway, three intermediary ‘mix nodes’, where traffic is shuffled or ‘mixed’ so it’s indistinguishable, and the exit&nbsp;gateway.</p><p>Together, these entities form a decentralised, private environment where users can enjoy online activities without compromising their personal data or security.</p><p>By the end of 2023, NymVPN Beta will be available for testing to the Nym community.

<p>Brave is also introducing Leo Premium, a paid plan featuring Anthropic’s Claude Instant with faster response times</p>
<p>Three months ago, Brave previewed <a>Leo—the browser-native AI assistant</a>—on its Nightly channel for developers and testers. Since then we’ve seen great adoption, with tens of thousands of users globally. With user feedback, we’ve been able to improve much faster than we’d hoped—on response-times, the quality of responses, even the product UI. Today, we’re excited to announce that Brave Leo is ready for all Brave users, available in desktop release 1.60.</p>
<p>With that testing, we also received requests for new features. The most common one has been to add different AI language models in Leo. To that end, we’re bringing our users advanced conversational AI experiences through <a href="https://account.brave.com/?intent=checkout&amp;product=leo">Brave Leo Premium</a>—our new paid option featuring Claude Instant, Anthropic’s state-of-the-art AI assistant.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    


 What is Brave Leo? 
<p>Leo, Brave’s browser AI assistant, can help with all sorts of tasks. It can create real-time summaries of webpages or videos. It can answer questions about content, or generate new content. It can even translate pages, analyze them, rewrite them, and more. Whether you’re looking for information, trying to solve a problem, or creating content, Leo can help.</p>
<p>Leo combines this easy, free access to AI with the privacy focus of Brave. Chats with Leo are private, anonymous, and secure. Leo doesn’t record chats, or use them for model training, and no account or login is required to use Leo. With cutting-edge technology and privacy, Brave Leo pushes the boundaries of typical AI chatbot services.</p>
<p>“It is increasingly common today to use AI to ask questions and get assistance. AI can be a powerful tool but it can also present growing concerns for data privacy and there’s a need for a privacy-first solution,” said Brian Bondy, CTO and co-founder of Brave. “Brave is committed to pairing AI with user privacy, and will provide our users with secure and personalized AI assistance where they already spend their time online. We’re also thrilled to work with Anthropic to bring Claude’s exceptional conversational abilities to the millions of Brave users worldwide.”</p>

 Introducing Leo Premium 
<p>By default, Brave Leo is free for all users, with easy access to the Llama 2 large language model from Meta. For users who want additional models, Brave is also releasing a premium version of Leo for <a href="https://account.brave.com/?intent=checkout&amp;product=leo">$15/month</a>. Leo Premium subscribers will get access to Claude Instant, Anthropic’s faster and lighter model that excels at logical reasoning and coding. The current version of Claude produces longer, more structured responses, follows instructions better than previous versions of Instant, and shows improvements in math, coding, multilingual abilities, and question answering. Additional models will be available to Leo Premium users, as well as access to higher rate limits, higher-quality conversations, priority queuing during periods of peak usage, and early access to new features and improvements.</p>
<p>This integration represents a milestone in delivering sophisticated natural language conversations powered by AI directly within the browser environment. With Claude’s advanced capabilities and Brave’s focus on user privacy and control, we hope to set a new standard for helpful, responsible, and context sensitive AI interactions. Anthropic used <a>Brave’s Search API</a> to train their latest model, Claude 2, on high-quality data to help optimize Claude’s outputs for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) queries.</p>
<p>“We’re excited that Brave is going to bring our state-of-the-art large language model Claude Instant directly into their browser. Integrating access to Claude seamlessly within Brave gives users assistance whenever they need it, right in the context of the page they are on,” says Matt Bell, Head of Product Research at Anthropic. “Whether Brave users are analyzing text, editing documents, or writing code, they can now benefit from having personalized help from Claude at any time. This integration unlocks the potential for AI to enhance people’s browsing and productivity in an intuitive, contextual way.”</p>

 Brave Leo and unparalleled privacy 
<p>As a privacy-first company, Brave is dedicated to releasing leading alternatives to popular Web tools that also protect user data and anonymity. Leo is no different:</p>
 
 
<p>Reverse proxy: All requests are proxied through an anonymized server so the request and user-address cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address.</p>
 
 
<p>Immediate discarding of responses: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded immediately after they’re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers such as your IP Address that can be linked to you. No personal data is retained by the AI model or any 3rd-party model providers.</p>
 
 
<p>No login or account required for access: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo.</p>
 
 
<p>Unlinkable subscription: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you used to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience.</p>
 
 

 Accessing Brave Leo 
<p>Leo is now available to Brave desktop users with version 1.60. It will be rolled out in phases over the next few days, so users should check back soon if they’re not seeing it today. It will be available on mobile (Android and iOS) in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learn more at <a>brave.com/leo</a>, and see details about Leo’s roadmap <a>here</a>.</p>
<p>It’s easy to get started with Brave Leo because it is built right into the Brave desktop browser, and no extra apps or extensions are required. It provides seamless access to AI experiences via the browser address bar, or also as a sidebar, a chat-like interface positioned beside any webpage.</p>
<p>To access Leo, existing Brave users can simply ask a question in the address bar and click  “Ask Leo”, or click  in Brave Sidebar.</p>

<p>A journey that began in the late summer of 2022, has finally come to a joyful end. Third-party Zcash wallets are working again, and Electric Coin Co. (ECC) is exiting Emergency Mode.</p>



<p>During this time, ECC released multiple updates to zcashd and lightwalletd, plus new mobile SDKs that, together, introduced new innovations (and learning) in the world of cryptography and decentralized money. These releases provide massive upgrades to privacy, scalability, and user experience in Zcash, and they have implications for all privacy-focused crypto projects.</p>



<p>Before going further, we need to give the hugest THANK YOU to our wallet partners Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable who worked with us to test releases and submit bugs, then were quick to implement SDKs 2.0 when they were ready.</p>



<p>The ECC engineers deserve special recognition —&nbsp;and possibly a vacation — after putting in long hours over many months on complicated discovery and development. Working through the <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ecc-restructuring-to-better-serve-zcash/">ECC restructure</a> and battling tough deadlines, while tackling other crucial emergencies like the <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-releases-remediate-memory-exhaustion-vulnerability-in-zcash/">Halborn disclosure</a>, they delivered groundbreaking technology that elevates ZEC user experience.</p>



 Background 



<p>Starting in June 2022, the Zcash network began experiencing a huge increase in shielded transaction volume. This additional network load caused a “data pileup” that prevented Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable wallets from being able to sync in a reasonable amount of time. These three wallets rely on ECC’s mobile SDKs.</p>



<p>Wallet syncing processes required scanning the entire blockchain before funds were available to be spent. And when the wallets wouldn’t sync, users couldn’t access or spend their funds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October 2022, ECC went into Emergency Mode and put aside all other roadmap priorities. From our blog in March 2023:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s a complicated challenge to address, and at minimum, it requires developing and implementing (1) a faster algorithm that does not require a linear sync of all blocks on chain and (2) tooling modifications that will give users the ability to spend funds without having a fully synced chain. As mentioned, the solution comprises changes to every component in the shielded mobile wallet stack: zcashd, lightwalletd, the ECC wallet SDKs, and the ECC prototype wallet.</p>
</blockquote>



 Emergency Mode exit criteria 



<p>Our top priority was ensuring users could access and spend their ZEC (Zcash coins). This is fundamental to our mission of economic freedom and a requirement for real-world private digital cash.</p>



<p>Speed and reliability are also critical to Zcash user experience, and these were our criteria for exiting Emergency Mode:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Users of Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable can spend their current funds (funds that are already synced when they open their wallet). 



 Users of those wallets can receive and become able to spend new incoming funds at a rate of a month’s worth of transactions in 1 hour. 



 Users of those wallets see sync updates which are minimally confusing about progress. 



 None of those wallets are impacted by frequent crashes or inconsistent behavior (such as failing to display some already synced transactions), nor do they require work-around behaviors due to the ECC SDK. 
 



<p>With the release of new mobile wallet SDKs 2.0 in September, ECC delivered the final piece in our efforts to mitigate third-party wallet performance issues. Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable quickly implemented the SDKs, and as of today, we are pleased to report that the criteria above have been met.</p>



 What is Spend Before Sync and why is it important? 



<p>Available now in Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable, Spend Before Sync (SBS) introduces non-linear sync, which allows wallets to scan chunks of the blockchain out of order and/or in parallel. This makes it possible for users to spend their existing funds without requiring the wallet to fully sync the entire blockchain.</p>



<p>Separately, but also important, the data structures that enable SBS substantially improve the performance of note commitment tree updates. As an example, Zingo! didn’t adopt SBS, but just by using the updated data structure that wallet got a better than 10x improvement in linear scanning speed.</p>



<p>Aditya Bharadwaj, better known as Adi, founder of Nighthawk, called SBS “a groundbreaking advancement that promises to revolutionize Zcash’s peer-to-peer usage for payments and shielded app interactions.”</p>



 What we learned during Emergency Mode 



 
 Our mobile SDK code did not meet the needs of a typical Zcash user. The syncing UX was confusing and the API design precluded wallets from spending funds until the wallet had fully synced the chain. 



 Before Emergency Mode, and to some extent before the ECC restructure, our team was spread too thin and trying to focus on too many things, which allowed issues like transaction load impact to surface. 



 We knew long ago that a transaction-load issue was possible, but we prioritized other Zcash features and improvements. This challenge of prioritizing new feature improvements versus making the existing system more resilient or robust is always present. In this case we underestimated the likelihood of this problem and the amount of effort it would take to mitigate it. 



 We chose to address the issue in the most thorough manner by making wallets function during high transaction load, rather than the expedient of short-term interventions to lessen the transaction load. We believed those short-term interventions would lead to more complexity without fully resolving the issue in the long run. We still believe our approach was best for the long-term robustness of the Zcash ecosystem, yet we underestimated the time and effort and the overall disruption to Zcash users in the interim. 



 We also learned about comms. It took us too long to define Emergency Mode and communicate a concise explanation and plan, both internally and externally. 



 Having our own wallet in development (Zashi), which uses our SDKs, was key to speeding up the process because it allowed us to test our solutions before deploying and/or sharing with third-party wallets. 
 



<p>With Emergency Mode complete, ECC is turning its attention to our main focus areas: proof-of-stake Zcash, development of the Zashi wallet, continued improvements to SDKs and Zcash Core Libraries, and US Policy work.</p>

      Battling the Trojan Horse in Open Source         
	By Ananya Menon	 



Published November 1, 2023
        Chainguard’s Dan Lorenc is taking on software supply chain security.      



 
<p>Dan Lorenc was at a restaurant in downtown Austin with friends when he received an unusual text. It was the summer of 2021, and the message was from his former coworker, Matt Moore. Lorenc was a software engineer at Google, and he and Moore had worked together on its cyber-security team. The past year had been especially challenging, as the security industry as a whole had faced a reckoning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December 2020, SolarWinds reported that its network monitoring platform had been hacked by operatives suspected of working for Russian intelligence. The attackers had planted malware in SolarWinds’ code, which allowed them to access the data of thousands of SolarWinds’ clients, from Microsoft to the U.S. government. The hack exposed a critical flaw in the security of software supply chains. Just as in real-world manufacturing, software is assembled from components created by developers all over the world. At some point during SolarWinds’ development process, malicious actors inserted malware into two software updates, which were then installed by customers all around the world. SolarWinds’ data breach was a wake-up call. Without verifying the integrity of software at every stage of its lifespan this type of hack could and would happen again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moore had left Google earlier in the year, and Lorenc had called him every month since, hoping to convince him to return. Moore was one of the finest software engineers Lorenc knew, and if anyone could find a solution to supply chain security, it was him. That night, Moore’s text to Lorenc said he was ready to get back to work—but not at Google. “Let’s start a new company,” Moore texted. Lorenc didn’t need to think twice. He was in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next day, Lorenc put in notice at Google, bought a new laptop and began work on Chainguard, a company focused on software supply chain security. Although technically the company was born that night in Austin, Lorenc had been preparing for this moment for years.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>The late 2000s ushered in a fundamental shift in the way tech companies approached security, as alarm around new types of digital threats grew. In what became known as Operation Aurora in 2009, Chinese hackers attempted to access and change source code in a series of attacks against companies like Google and Adobe. In the Snowden leaks in 2013, a contracted employee for the NSA hacked its database and leaked classified documents.</p>



<p>Lorenc joined Google in 2012, working on the company’s efforts to secure its own code and protect its databases from external or internal attackers. In 2016, after he and his team had implemented Google’s new, refined security system, Lorenc shifted focus to work on Minikube, a tool for open-source Kubernetes container management. This was Lorenc’s first time working predominantly with open-source code—code that’s freely available for anyone to download, modify and exchange. As Lorenc was building and shipping Minikube to users all over the world, he realized he could have easily slipped malware into the software. The container’s label would read “Minikube,” but few would take time to comb through the thousands of lines of code in every directory of the program to determine exactly what was inside. Proper verification was something that would take an engineer days, weeks or even months to complete—bandwidth they almost certainly didn’t have, and therefore a task that would fall by the wayside.</p>



<p>Lorenc was terrified. Wasn’t it just a matter of time before someone packaged up open-source software that secretly contained code that could put an entire company and its community at risk? “I realized how much damage I myself could do, and how easily,” Lorenc says. “And if I could do that, so could anyone.”</p>



<p>The concern over how to protect software from hidden malware isn’t a new one. In 1984, an engineer named Ken Thompson wrote an article called “Reflections on Trusting Trust” that demonstrated how easy it was to hide Trojan horse viruses in a computer program. Thompson’s point was that you could never fully trust any code you hadn’t written yourself. According to Lorenc, 90-98% of code used today is open source. Most companies focus resources on making sure the tiny amount of code they write themselves is secure, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. “The 2% of proprietary code is the only part you see over the water, but beneath that is the 98% of code you’re not responsible for yourself,” Lorenc says. “In some ways, open-source code is amazing. It’s enabled all this innovation and velocity and reuse. But it’s also scary because that means 98% of your code is written by strangers on the internet. Which is great when people are well-intentioned, but not everyone on the internet is nice.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite evidence of the risks open-source code can pose to a company’s security, Lorenc learned that managing these risks wasn’t something widely prioritized. When he spoke with engineers at other software companies, supply chain security wasn’t a top concern. “Being a software engineer is like playing Whac-A-Mole. There are so many issues you have to deal with on a constant basis that you can’t spend time on preventive measures,” Lorenc says. “You only pay attention to a problem when it rears its head. At this point, there hadn’t been large instances of open-source vulnerability being a problem, so no one seemed to think much about it.”</p>



<p>No one but Lorenc. That is, until December 2020.</p>
 



Lorenc with fierce Chainguard mascot, Charlie



 
<p>Lorenc was at home when he received a news alert about the SolarWinds attack. Thousands of companies were reporting their data, networks and systems compromised—exactly what Lorenc had been worried about. He stood and walked to his car. Lorenc’s house in Austin was close to SolarWinds’ headquarters. He drove there and took a picture of himself in front of its sign. It would serve as a reminder of how important it was that he continue to raise a red flag about the software supply chain. But it was also a moment of validation—he had seen this coming, and he felt vindicated that his concern was justified. Maybe now people would take the problem seriously.</p>



<p>Although Google was not affected by the breach, Lorenc and his coworkers were intimately familiar with the type of attack that SolarWinds fell victim to because they had spent years building internal systems at Google to prevent it. Dan and team would end up working closely with engineers from SolarWinds to help them do the same. (The following year, when Chainguard held a conference to announce its launch, a SolarWinds engineer spoke about how instrumental Lorenc’s team had been in designing its new security system.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the question of how to entirely prevent these attacks remained: When programs are built on hundreds of thousands of lines of open-source code, how do you ensure that every line is as advertised and secure? It’s a problem so large in scale that it feels almost impossible to figure out. Luckily, that’s kind of Lorenc’s thing.</p>



 



<p>Lorenc’s love of solving difficult problems began when he was a kid, fixing up damaged stock cars with his grandfather. They’d spend hours after school and on weekends tinkering together in a small garage. Once the cars were up and running, Lorenc’s grandfather (and after he got his license, Lorenc himself) would race them in community events. When the cars would break down, they would take inventory of the problems and fix them up again. This was the part Lorenc loved most—looking at the engine as a system of parts, understanding how each one functioned and then using that knowledge to fix what wasn’t working.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In college, Lorenc pursued mechanical engineering. During his junior year he took a programming class and was hooked. “I was building stuff, but it was a lot faster,” Lorenc says. “You didn’t have to order parts and wait a week for them to ship. You could build those components yourself with a laptop, anywhere.” Software engineering offered the same thrill as fixing up old cars. “It’s that loop of trying to solve a problem, and then either seeing it work or seeing it fail miserably and getting to debug it live. You keep going and get real-time feedback until you solve it. That’s why I liked the computer world. I could do more of that in a lot less time.”</p>



<p>One of the first pieces of code he wrote was a program to solve Rubik’s cubes. The program didn’t work—it kept running without ever arriving at a solution. One of his peers laughed when he saw the code and showed Lorenc how to fix it. It was an important moment. “That’s when I realized, with programming, there’s always a solution,” Lorenc says. “It might not be obvious at first, but it’s there. You just have to find it.”</p>



<p>Lorenc began working at Microsoft soon after he graduated college. He remembers the environment as rewarding, but also stressful. There was a weekend when he and his colleagues were working overtime for an upcoming release, and during a particularly tense moment, his manager pantomimed a Monty Python sketch. Lorenc and his team broke into fits of laughter, and the mood instantly brightened. This left an impression on Lorenc: the need for a work environment that balanced hard work with humor.</p>
 



Chainguard founders Kim Lewandowski, Ville Aikas, Dan Lorenc and Matt Moore.



 
<p>“You’re doing what?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bogomil Balkansky, Chainguard’s partner at Sequoia, sat across the table from Lorenc and Moore, not sure he was hearing them right.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the months since Moore’s initial text to Lorenc at the restaurant in Austin, Chainguard had officially launched, and its founders had begun building its product and seeking out investors. Lorenc says starting a company at the beginning of 2022 wasn’t easy. Inflation was rising and a wave of layoffs at tech companies meant Lorenc would pitch Chainguard to software engineers—potential customers—one day, only to learn the following week that they had been laid off. After months of meetings, they finally gained traction. The need for supply chain security tools was too great, and companies realized they couldn’t handle the job alone.</p>



<p>Lorenc and the Chainguard team first met with Sequoia in the spring of 2022. Balkansky was impressed by Chainguard’s initial product in development, Chainguard Enforce, a program that scans containers and produces an itemized list of the code inside. Engineers can then review the list for malware and loopholes that might make the containers vulnerable to hackers. And so Balkansky was surprised to learn, just days after Sequoia’s partnership with Chainguard was finalized, that, according to Lorenc, Chainguard was in the midst of building out a far more ambitious product: Chainguard Images.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In computing, a “container image” refers to a static collection of executable code. Chainguard Images would be a library of these files, made from open-source code that Chainguard engineers would verify, sign, patch and secure. With Chainguard Images, customers would no longer have to opt for open-source code they’d found on the internet and hope for the best. Instead, they could select an image from Chainguard’s library and feel confident that their code was as advertised and could not be edited by bad actors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This was a massive undertaking, which explained Balkansky’s incredulity when he first learned of it. To execute Chainguard Images, Lorenc and his team would first have to build a Linux distribution, an operating system on which Chainguard Images could run. Balkansky had worked with other companies who had endeavored to do this but hadn’t succeeded; he knew it was an incredibly complex task that could take years to complete, and even then there was no guarantee it would work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Balkansky wasn’t the only one who was skeptical. Other software companies with thousands of engineers struggled to believe that Chainguard, with only 25 engineers, could not only build a Linux distribution, but also comb through and verify numerous libraries of code. “Yes, it seemed impossible,” Lorenc says. “Yes, just based on the sheer numbers, the lines of code we would need to pore over and adjust to make secure, it was daunting. Everyone else looked at it and saw it as too hard of a problem, too massive to actually solve. But it seemed obvious it was something we needed to do.” Lorenc shrugs, “To me, it didn’t seem impossible, it just seemed hard. And I’m okay with hard.”</p>



<p>“Hard” paid off. Lorenc and his team spent a year working tirelessly on Chainguard Images. To motivate and energize his team during long days and even longer nights and weekends, Lorenc pulled from the lesson learned at Microsoft, making sure that hours of focus were interspersed with jokes, lighthearted stories and plenty of room for laughter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Balkansky was sitting in a conference room in early 2023 when Lorenc let him know Chainguard Images was live. Balkansky’s first thought: “Pretty damn impressive.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, Chainguard has rebuilt around 80% of the open-source code most companies use, and because Chainguard is the only company offering access to this type of library, they’re racing to keep up with demand for the remaining 20%. Chainguard also takes custom orders—if a company needs a certain container specific to their product verified, Chainguard will take it on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As time consuming and challenging as building out Chainguard Images continues to be, Lorenc recognizes its payoff for users. It’s akin to building a house—yes, you can use cheap and readily available materials for construction and deal with a rickety staircase or a toilet that won’t flush later, but Chainguard’s philosophy is that it’s worth the extra time, money and labor to start with high-quality products. Lorenc believes in taking every measure possible, no matter how complicated it might be, when it comes to keeping software and its users safe.</p>



 



<p>Working in security necessitates a certain amount of paranoia—the fear of what you’ve missed, of an unseen crack or fatal flaw, is relentless. Lorenc’s use of humor to assuage the high-risk, high-anxiety environment has paid off in more ways than one. He regularly makes his own memes, many of which have gone viral within software development communities. One meme shows Ken from the Barbie movie, with the caption “My job is just CVEs.” (CVEs meaning “Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures.”) Another depicts Ned Stark from “Game of Thrones,” with a caption that reads “Brace yourselves. VEX is coming.” (VEX is an open platform for sharing information about software vulnerabilities.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lorenc’s goal in creating memes was originally to provide levity and form a community with people working in security, so he was surprised when his social media presence ended up being one of Chainguard’s most successful marketing strategies. Lorenc regularly sees his memes making rounds on LinkedIn and X, formerly Twitter. Chainguard’s TikToks are also popular among engineers, many of which feature Lorenc, in his trademark backward baseball cap, speaking to viewers as though he was guiding a friend through a casual tutorial on software security. Lorenc attributes the love for Chainguard’s social media to his users’ desire for authenticity. He’s not some faceless CEO of a corporation; he’s a software engineer, just like his customers, and he speaks their language. It’s not a traditional avenue for a security company to market itself, but Chainguard has always done things its own way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite his numerous duties as CEO, Lorenc’s favorite part of the job is still working with other engineers to solve complex and granular problems. He thinks Chainguard was able to attract some of the best engineers in the industry precisely because the company has such lofty goals. “The people on our team were drawn to the difficulty of our mission,” he says. “Smart people want to work on hard problems.” Often when people encounter what seems like an impossible series of problems, they get overwhelmed, but not Lorenc. He knows every inch of this engine, and working on it part by part, he’s confident he can get it to run.</p>

<p>“Everything is theoretically impossible, until it is done.” —Robert A. Heinlein, American science-fiction writer and aeronautical engineer</p>
<p>Modern medicine is full of awe-inspiring progress, but also many humbling limitations. In the face of these limitations, innovators have consistently propelled entirely new classes of drugs from theoretical concepts that sound like total science fiction (vaccines, antibodies, genetic medicines to reprogram our cells, and more)—into the realm of safe and effective therapies for patients.</p>
 Small molecules: the OGs of the therapeutic arsenal 
<p>Amidst all this rapid progress, small molecules—the original heroes of the therapeutic arsenal, the original enablers of the “pill” form of drugs we all have in our medicine cabinets—continue to represent ~60% of all new FDA approvals. Small molecules are fantastical in their own right: they are typically orally bioavailable, conveniently administered, cheaper to manufacture, and distribute well throughout many tissues in our bodies (including the brain). They are also most widely accessible to patients: drugs like aspirin, penicillin, statins, and tamoxifen have had tremendous impact on billions of patients globally.</p>
<p>Now, ushered forward by a wave of new and enabling technologies, the field of small molecule discovery is undergoing nothing short of a <a href="https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/drug-discovery/small-molecule-drug-discovery-having/101/i36#">renaissance</a>. Important classes of targets, however—including thousands of extracellular and secreted protein targets—remain challenging for small molecules to effectively address. This is where Gate Bio comes in.</p>
 Gate Bio: engineering cell biology to build a novel class of medicines 
<p>Gate Bio is building a new class of small molecules called Molecular Gates. While most small molecule drugs bind and inhibit the disease-causing activity of their (typically intracellular) protein targets, Gate Bio instead attacks harmful extracellular proteins by eliminating them at their very root: right where they are produced and secreted from the cell. The secretion of ‘bad-actor’ proteins can drive conditions like neurodegeneration, autoimmunity, cancer, and more: what if we could design small molecules to stop them (“gate” them) from being secreted in the first place—before they even have a chance to cause disease?</p>
<p>To do this, the founders at Gate Bio had a clever idea: to exploit the biology of the single, shared channel through which all ~4000 secreted human proteins must make their journey out of the cell. To visualize this mechanism, go all the way back to high school biology and recall that squiggly, ribosome-lined organelle called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Remember learning that it functions as the cell’s manufacturing and transportation apparatus? Well, this is because getting important secretory proteins (peptide hormones, receptors, cytokines, etc) across the cell’s membrane (a lipid bilayer) from inside the cell to outside is no easy task—and nature has evolved a tightly choreographed dance to make this happen. Central in this sequence is the ER, and specifically a channel within the ER called the secretory translocon, through which all newly synthesized secretory proteins coming off a ribosome must pass in order to enter the ER, fold properly, and ultimately exit the cell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the scientific community gained greater insight into the structure and function of the secretory translocon, Gate Bio’s founders began creatively designing Molecular Gates to bind this translocon and specifically block disease-causing proteins (but not healthy proteins) from exiting the channel. Once a disease protein is ‘gated’ from exiting the channel, it has nowhere to go, and then—as if in a stroke of elegant science fiction!—it gets degraded by the cell’s already existing, natural cleanup machinery. Behold!</p>
<p>If Molecular Gates could be engineered for many high-value targets, they could represent a massive new drug class for extracellular protein targets, with a fundamentally new mechanism of action in the cell—a rare feat in biotech. This vision got us excited, in part because we’ve seen other novel drug classes in recent years (e.g. molecular glues, PROTACs, splice modulators, and more), and each new class has proven that new mechanisms of action can unlock previously inaccessible targets that are important in human disease. Inventing a new modality is also one of the best ways to endow an otherwise lean biotech startup team with a massive moat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At a16z, we love platform biotech companies, and Gate Bio’s platform has a particularly unique feature that we couldn’t resist. Molecular Gate medicines, no matter the target, share a common mechanism of action: gating that secretory translocon. This means that every technology that gets built at the company, every problem solved, and insight uncovered—actually makes all our future programs smarter. Gate Bio is building the platform to screen, design, systematically characterize, and optimize Molecular Gates. And it’s truly a self-reinforcing, always-learning engine that is getting better every day.</p>
 An inventive ensemble of builders 
<p>I have known Jordi Mata-Fink, cofounder and CEO of Gate Bio, for nearly two decades. We went to college at Stanford together, and were even lucky enough to live in the same hallway of the same dorm community (shout out to “FroSoCo” nerds everywhere)! What I remember most from then was Jordi’s massive smile, his excitement when describing an engineering problem, and the way in which people gravitated towards him. Our paths crossed again when we were both in grad school at MIT, and then Jordi subsequently joined a biotech venture incubator in the Boston ecosystem where he helped build and lead several new companies. He has always loved both science and people, and so when he called to say he was starting a biotech company and raising Seed financing, I knew I wanted to be involved.</p>
<p>Raman Talwar (Gate Bio cofounder) and I first met in the context of another exciting company that he helped start a few years ago—where I learned that he has an infectious “Yes, why not?” personality that always makes people want to try and jump even higher. Raman is endlessly and authentically curious, a quality which, when combined with his personal magnetism, makes him a hub for the creative synthesis of new ideas and (perhaps more importantly for a young company) the creative assembly of new people.</p>
<p>And finally, it’s been a joy to work with Pat Sharp, cofounder and the original chemistry brains behind the Gate Bio operation. Pat co-led <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01326-1">academic work on chemically perturbing the secretory translocon</a> at UCSF and then did a tour of duty in big pharma at Merck before jumping into Gate to lead the development of our chemistry and experimental science platform. He is super smart, wonderfully kind, and explains even the most complex chemistry in a soothing Australian accent.</p>
<p>I suspect the founders would say that they are most proud of the amazing team they have recruited around themselves. The Gate Bio team – still small but mighty – is a special ensemble of talent. They are deeply motivated by patient experience, and willing to tread in new waters. They aren’t afraid to build new tools and new ways of measuring the impact of a Molecular Gate, but are also keen to learn from the experience of previously ‘new’ modalities. I can feel the urgency of ‘patients are waiting’ in every interaction with this team, and it is thus such a privilege to be co-leading Gate Bio’s Series A financing and joining their board. We are also thrilled to be working with great friends at Versant Ventures, GV, and ARCH. Please reach out if you’re interested in <a href="https://www.gatebio.com/">joining this team</a> of pioneers!</p>

<p>One of the most common pricing questions we get from late-stage SaaS companies is: should we switch to a usage-based pricing model (also known as consumption-based pricing)?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Often, these companies have an existing subscription model, and usage-based pricing sounds like it would further align their incentives with their customers’. After all, the more their customers use their product, the more revenue they capture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But just because usage-based pricing has worked for other companies doesn’t necessarily mean it’ll work for yours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our rule of thumb: usage-based pricing generally works best for SaaS products whose end user is other software, while subscription-based models tend to work best for SaaS products with human end users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is usually because software-to-human products make employees more productive (through collaboration, training, etc.), while software-to-software products tend to power their customers’ products or internal systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>With software-to-software products, customers want to get access to the products, start using it, and only pay for what they use. These products typically have great product telemetry data, so it’s easy for these companies to set up processes that track, bill, and even cap that usage—which ultimately leads to smoother adoption processes, strong net dollar retention, and a robust land-and-expand motion.</p>
<p>But what removes friction for software-to-software customers actually creates friction for software-to-human customers. The average enterprise has over 100 SaaS apps, and no human user wants to monitor their usage to make sure their IT spend doesn’t surge past a given limit. Individual users also don’t like to be nickel-and-dimed for what they use: imagine if a CRM charged sales reps every time they created an opportunity! That’s why software with human end users typically benefits from subscription models.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s also a natural limit to how much a human user will consume a certain amount of software: they can only watch so many training videos or create so many collaborative documents. Use of software-to-software products, like code testing or data transfer, can grow exponentially, however, so usage-based pricing can better capture the value of those kinds of workloads.</p>
<p>And from a vendor perspective, software-to-software products also generally have a higher marginal cost of service than software-to-human products, so charging by usage sets up stronger unit economics that can cover those costs. Imagine the converse: you run an infrastructure company that bills by subscription and, all of the sudden, your customers’ usages skyrocket—it becomes much less cost-effective to serve them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, this isn’t a hard-and-fast rule.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we’ve outlined an either/or logic above, in reality, pricing is often a spectrum. We often see companies offer hybrid subscription-and-usage pricing models depending on their cost structures, customer needs, or the nature of their product. Our rule of thumb should help you figure out whether to emphasize subscription or usage in your pricing model. And of course, AI is rapidly changing software, how we use it, and how we monetize and charge for it.</p>
<p>There are a lot of questions you’ll need to answer if you want to implement usage-based pricing in your business: how can you best predict usage for both you and your customers? What’s the role of your salesforce? How will you compensate your reps? How do you need to set up your company in order to operationalize a usage model? We’ll touch on all of these topics in forthcoming posts, but this rule of thumb should be a good first step in figuring out if switching to a usage-based model is something you want to consider.</p>

This partnership will integrate the Nym mixnet into the NEAR ecosystem, providing unparalleled privacy to all traffic transmitted across the blockchain — allowing users to access their favourite NFTs, DeFi protocols, and dApps away from the prying eyes of malicious actors like cyber-criminals.</p><p>NEAR Protocol is a leading layer 1 blockchain that operates with many ‘shards’, each acting like its own independent blockchain. Because transactions take place independently of one another, NEAR Protocol is able to provide ultra-high speed, throughput, and scale to projects in its ecosystem.</p><p>Earlier this year, the NEAR Protocol unveiled the Blockchain Operating System (B.O.S.) to create the ideal entry point of the Open Web, and to seamlessly bridge the gap between web 2.0 and Web3. B.O.S. addresses critical challenges around building frontends for Web3 apps, including access, security, composability, and time to market. With B.O.S., the code for Components is permanently stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency, version control, and easy exploration.</p><p>The NEAR ecosystem supported Nym early in its development path via Nym’s participation in the Open Web Collective in 2021, a Web3 incubator sponsored by the NEAR Foundation.</p><p>However, the open, transparent nature of public permissionless blockchains means that transaction data is visible to anyone who cares to look, and even off-chain information like IP addresses and geolocation data can be vulnerable to being exposed. This opens users and validators up to surveillance, targeted attacks, and cyber&nbsp;crime.</p><p>Nym and the NEAR Foundation share the same vision for the future of privacy in Web3. The future of the internet can only take shape successfully provided that it is private, and does not repeat the same mistakes of the legacy internet — namely, monopoly, surveillance, and putting user privacy at&nbsp;risk.</p><p>“Blockchain technology is a large change in digital communications but it’s an open secret that by their very nature, blockchains are not private,” said Harry Halpin, cofounder and CEO at Nym Technologies. “Only weaving privacy into the fabric of Web3 can ensure its success. Nym is highly modular and the mixnet can be plugged into any blockchain, giving users and builders the confidence that they’re not being tracked and followed across the internet or painting targets on themselves for cyber criminals.”</p><p>To make this vision a reality, the Nym mixnet will integrate into NEAR Protocol to encrypt and cloak traffic across the whole ecosystem. By masking off-chain metadata traffic, not only is transaction data protected in transit, but this makes it much more difficult for adversaries to de-anonymise users via their public IP addresses.</p><p>To protect these traffic patterns from analysis, the Nym mixnet splits data into identical encrypted packets and disperses these in three hops to ‘mix nodes’ worldwide via the mixnet. Cover traffic is then inserted into the mix at randomised times to further obfuscate the nature of the communication. This makes tracking metadata patterns impossible, even for powerful adversaries with a global view of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Chris Donovan, CEO of the NEAR Foundation said: “Privacy is a fundamental human right and a cornerstone of the Web3 vision to create a more secure, user-centric and user-empowered web. We are proud to support Nym and its innovative technology, which will help developers and users across the NEAR ecosystem maintain their privacy.”</p><p>By integrating the Nym mixnet into any ecosystem, partners can have confidence that their developers, operators, and users are able to enjoy real privacy, shielding them from surveillance and cyber criminals.</p><p>The Nym mixnet is layer-0 privacy infrastructure: it is chain-agnostic and can be integrated into any blockchain to obscure traffic, protect privacy, and secure users and validators. By partnering with Nym, Near joins other Web3 projects like <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/new-mixnet-integration-nym-for-monero-f0a3068e803f">Monero</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-partners-with-aztec-to-provide-integral-infrastructure-privacy-in-ethereum-chains-694963c55192">Aztec</a>.</p><p>For more information about Nym please visit <a href="https://nymtech.net/">https://nymtech.net/</a></p><p>About Nym Technologies</p><p>Nym Technologies is a trailblazing leader in privacy and blockchain technology.

<p>911 call centers –&nbsp;also known as public safety answering points (PSAPs) – are one of the most actively used public-safety infrastructure systems in the United States, fielding an estimated <a href="https://www.nena.org/page/911statistics">240 million calls per year</a>. That’s more than 650,000 per day. These centers act as the first point of engagement between a citizen and the public safety system, and PSAPs are often the conduit between the citizen and the eventual field responders (e.g., police, fire, emergency medicine) who go on-site to help. To say they serve a life-or-death function would be an understatement.</p>
<p>Despite its importance, though, our 911 system is ill equipped to handle many modern emergencies. When someone calls 911, they often don’t speak the same language as the operator, are in situations where speaking cogently to the operator is fraught, or don’t know the necessary details needed for help to arrive.</p>
<p>This makes it difficult for operators to get the information they need from callers, while still keeping callers safe and making them feel comfortable. Information loss can dramatically degrade incident response and resolution. In addition, over <a href="https://www.911.gov/newsletters/issue-14/survey-more-than-half-of-911-centers-face-staffing-crisis/">half of PSAPs nationally</a> are experiencing staffing and labor shortages, and the emotional and physical toll of working in these centers has led to <a href="https://www.iaedjournal.org/keeping-them-in-the-profession">meaningful burnout</a> and turnover among the staff.</p>
<p>We’ve already used software to optimize countless tasks across countless industries, and it’s imperative that first-class software also be built to support one of the most important pieces of our public safety infrastructure. In emergency moments seconds matter, and the right data and context can be a critical determinant in the outcome of the call. That’s why we are so proud to invest in <a href="https://www.prepared911.com/">Prepared</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 911 infrastructure was first rolled out in the United States in the 1960s, when most individuals were calling through landlines. With smartphones now virtually ubiquitous, however, <a href="https://transition.fcc.gov/files/documents/bring-wireless-911-rosenworcel.pdf">70% of 911 calls</a> are now made with wireless phones. And smartphones have a wealth of data about a situation that 911 operators should have –&nbsp;GPS location, phone/video access, text capabilities, etc. –&nbsp;but historically these operators have not had an easy way to access that data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prepared is the advanced data layer for 911. They provide operators with real-time data during emergency situations by providing callers with a web-based link to stream live video, share pictures, text, and GPS location to the 911 operators. It also provides real-time translation in more than 140 languages and AI transcription of calls so that operators can seamlessly communicate with the caller while documenting the most important information. Going further, Prepared then allows the 911 operator to share that data as it is coming in with the field responders (e.g., police, fire, emergency medicine) so that they have the full context and can better protect the caller, as well as themselves. Emergency rooms were transformed when ambulances started carrying radios to call ahead and alert an ER about patient status resulting in countless lives saved; the same will be true here where police and emergency responders can get details and live video about a situation in real-time before they arrive at an incident.</p>
<p>We were blown away by the reach Prepared has been able to achieve in a short period of time. Since their founding in 2019, nearly 15% of all 911 centers leverage Prepared, collectively serving more than 75 million Americans.</p>
<p>The customer feedback we received was also glowing. Prepared has spread rapidly, through word-of-mouth, among neighboring law enforcement regions as operators realize the lifesaving benefits of the product and have encouraged neighboring operations centers to adopt it.</p>
<p>It is exceedingly rare to meet a company that achieves that level of reach in public safety — so quickly and with that level of customer love — and it’s a true testament to the Prepared team. Michael Chime, Dylan Gleicher, and Neal Soni are highly mission-driven and passionate about solving this problem.

 Introducing PIVX Perspectives:<br>Engaging conversations with remarkable contributors to the PIVX community. Get ready for insightful dialogues about PIVX’s journey and future. Stay tuned for inspiring stories from various individuals who have played an important role in the PIVX ecosystem. <p>Our first guest is Jeffrey, PIVX Business Development Lead and a key driving force behind the&nbsp;project.</p><p>Can you tell us a little about yourself please?<br>Hey everyone, my name is Jeffrey, I currently live in South Africa but I have also lived in Indonesia and Singapore. I’m an extremely passionate and energetic person when it comes to digital finance and privacy, advocating for secure and efficient financial solutions in a digital age. My academic journey took me to Singapore where I completed my Bachelors in IT with Distinction. During this time is where I became deeply interested in the world of digital finance, as Singapore is a hub for&nbsp;fintech.</p><p>I’ve been a proud member of the PIVX family since early 2017, joining right around the time of the rebrand. It’s been a fortunate journey, allowing me to witness the remarkable growth of the project and actively contribute to its&nbsp;success.</p><p>When and why did you get into cryptocurrency?<br>My cryptocurrency journey goes quite far back and is actually thanks to a stranger, I was part of a social group where people share discounts or deals on servers. Someone wanted to pay on this particular website for a linux VPS but they wanted PayPal. So in return he sent me my first ever Bitcoin and I paid using PayPal. I believe this was back in late 2012 or early 2013. The wallet at the time I used was called MultiBit if I recall correctly. During this time I also experienced so many issues with online payment methods especially since I am from South Africa and many at the time did not provide their services or had lengthy and often privacy invading verification processes. Bitcoin was so fast, I remember being like wow I received this already and didn’t need to register or provide any of my information. My passion grew and I loved superior technology. Sadly I did end up using it as my main payment method for online goods and services lol so could not really enjoy the extreme growth over the&nbsp;years.</p><p>When and why did you choose to get involved with PIVX?<br>Cryptocurrency was starting to go really viral in 2017, It was at this time myself and some online friends were all looking to invest and buy more. The best way to find new cryptocurrencies to invest in at this time was to browse BitcoinTalk. I was lucky enough to find the PIVX post in 2017 on the forum. I read it was a coin dedicated to privacy which piqued my interest. The forum post also provided a Slack invitation link so PIVX ended up being the first cryptocurrency that I joined the official community for. So I guess initially my first finding out about PIVX was for investment purposes however the community was so helpful. I learned so much in just a week there amongst all the “Purple Rain” showers of PIVX tips flying out to everyone. I dedicated so much time that I ended up assisting with the support team by providing technical assistance as well as hosting calls to show people how to trade&nbsp;PIVX.</p><p>What do you think sets PIVX apart from other cryptocurrencies in the market?<br>For me it’s the human touch. PIVX is the only community where anyone can just join in and discuss openly and share ideas with developers, graphics designers, moderators and others from many backgrounds. PIVX may be a privacy coin but it’s extremely human-centric. What I love most is the aim to redefine privacy to its root. That privacy is not for criminals but simply a human right to protect oneself from malicious parties. PIVX makes this privacy option dubbed “SHIELD” completely optional therefore giving the user complete control over how they spend their PIV. PIVX also is a DAO with a treasury guaranteeing constant development and growth therefore PIVX in my opinion has a stable future and is here to secure your digital financial footprint.</p><p>How do you envision PIVX’s role in the broader adoption of cryptocurrencies?<br>PIVX has an ambassador program as well as community members that are introducing PIVX for the first time to many people, many of which will be their first ever crypto and therefore the beginning of their cryptocurrency journey. PIVX sets a benchmark through their meticulous development process that ensures the safety of their blockchain and privacy protocol.</p><p>This unwavering commitment to user safety and the protection of their assets sets a noteworthy example for other cryptocurrencies to follow almost like a benchmark. By establishing such high standards, PIVX contributes to the creation of a safer and more secure environment for newcomers, ultimately fostering increased adoption.</p><p>Can you share any success stories or notable achievements during your time at PIVX?<br>Honestly my biggest achievement in my cryptocurrency career with PIVX is getting feedback from our community on their experiences with PIVX and seeing how positive it is. I work as the lead of business development, I secure new listings and integrations. When I come across fellow Pivians enthusiastically sharing how they’ve started accepting PIVX through platforms like NowPayments, booked flights on Travala using PIVX, or found joy in trading on exchanges such as WhiteBit and LBank, it represents the pinnacle of success for me. More recently, learning how PIVX is enabling our community to make a difference by assisting families in need through the purchase of gift cards on Coinsbee is both humbling and inspiring. It’s not just about me, it’s about the collective impact my decisions make and how they can help others. I hope all my work and achievements combined empowers our community and fellow PIVX holders to explore new possibilities with&nbsp;PIVX.</p><p>How do you approach building strong relationships with exchange platforms and integrating PIVX into their trading systems?<br>I begin this first with market research, identifying areas that we lack. For example an exchange that doesn’t require KYC or perhaps provides GBP withdraws to a bank, Once I establish a decent list of exchanges that provide our needs I proceed to contact&nbsp;them.</p><p>The most important thing is a mutual understanding of the objective. Once we establish that we would like a relationship that is more than just trading PIVX but actually engaging with both communities and building together then I can proceed to discuss listings. Exchanges and cryptocurrencies work hand in hand in securing the future of Crypto. Not everyone supports centralised exchanges however it is thanks to them that cryptocurrency is thriving and vice versa. If an exchange wants to foster a relationship that involves us potentially collaborating on future marketing events or conferences then this is a good sign. If an exchange simply wants a listing fee and nothing more then that is a red flag in my&nbsp;book.</p><p>Obviously I will always advise anyone to do their own research on the exchange before trading however if an exchange is positive and wants to highlight the growth of PIVX and be apart of it, I will do my part by making this known to our communities and giving them the thanks they deserve as well as collaboration on any marketing from our&nbsp;side.</p><p>Thank you for reading our PIVX perspectives, stay tuned for more exciting insights and future&nbsp;updates.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/introducing-pivx-perspectives-engaging-conversations-with-remarkable-contributors-to-the-pivx-bcc9f0698ed8">Introducing PIVX Perspectives:

<p>Crime prevention, detection, and response, as we know it, needs to change. Heck, all emergency response services need to change, including 911 itself. We live in an era where artificial intelligence can conjure up answers, images, audio, and video in seconds, but we still can’t always find a thief fleeing a crime scene in a car with stolen plates or translate a non-English speaker calling 911 in real-time. It’s time for a national upgrade to our first-responder and public safety systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankfully, new and emerging technology solutions — ranging from drones and license-plate scanning technology to data-gathering and intel-collection software — are beginning to make up a veritable tech stack aimed at tackling this issue. Such innovations have already led to significant <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/flock-safety-license-plate-readers-crime/">decreases</a> in crime rates for early-adopter cities, but to maximize their impact we need wider adoption.</p>
 What does technology-enabled public safety look like? 
<p>While still early, technologies like surveillance cameras, sensors, dispatch systems, and drones have already been instrumental in strengthening the capabilities of law enforcement and other agencies, facilitating a more proactive, more objective, and more data-driven approach to crime prevention and response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://a16z.com/announcement/investing-in-flock-safety/">Flock Safety</a> utilizes specialized cameras and sensors to monitor vehicle activities, and has helped police officers catch everyone from <a href="https://www.wpri.com/target-12/new-court-docs-show-what-led-to-arrests-of-providence-bank-heist-suspects/">bank robbers</a> to <a href="https://wwmt.com/news/local/kalamazoo-police-save-child-quickly-arrest-suspected-kidnapper-public-safety-department-south-burdick-street-east-cork">kidnappers</a> (sometimes hundreds of miles from the scene of the crime). On the other hand, <a href="https://www.prepared911.com/">Prepared</a> enhances situational awareness for first responders — whether responding to calls from injured hikers to reports of car accidents, fires, or a home burglary — by letting 911 callers live-stream what’s happening around them. This kind of footage is much more useful in real time to save lives and make arrests than it is after the fact to generate news items or assign blame.</p>
<p>Furthermore, drones have been saving lives and aiding in investigations for years. As far back as 2018, even the Brookings Institution was <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-emergency-responders-are-using-drones-to-save-lives/">highlighting real-world examples</a> ranging from tracking criminals to recreating car accidents and locating senior citizens with dementia who had wandered off. Today, drones, such as those provided by <a href="https://www.skydio.com/">Skydio</a>, are currently used by some <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/philadelphia-police-drone-law-enforcement-city-council/">1,200 U.S. police departments</a> in some capacity. One of their superpowers is that they can be deployed to swiftly assess and relay real-time information from emergency scenes, enabling law enforcement to devise informed responses to a dynamic scene. For example, although the average response time to an emergency in New York City was <a href="https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/public-safety/2022/09/19/emergency-response-times-by-fdny--nypd-increase">9 minutes and 30 seconds</a> in 2022, a startup like <a href="https://www.aerodome.com/">Aerodome</a> that facilitates ‘drones as a first responder’ can have eyes on the scene within 3 minutes. Beyond crime, drones are also tremendously helpful in relaying information from areas hit by natural disasters (such as wildfire or floods) when emergency response may be slow, or impossible to reach (something else the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/18/23799144/nypd-drone-broadcast-safety-warnings-emergencies-surveillance">NYPD is experimenting</a> with).</p>
<p>An integration of these technologies creates a cohesive system that enhances response capabilities. For instance, in a scenario involving a high-speed car chase, cameras could identify the suspect vehicle, while sophisticated software dispatches drones and coordinates law enforcement units, ensuring they are apprised of real-time developments. Concurrently, the drones could provide aerial surveillance, offering additional vantage points and information to ground units. Organizations could even use platforms like <a href="https://www.kodexglobal.com/">Kodex</a> to streamline communications with law enforcement during a post-event criminal investigation. This synchronized operation, facilitated by technology, ensures coordinated, informed, and effective responses to dangerous situations.</p>
 Compounding benefits 
<p>There are also profound second-order effects that stem from the use of these technologies. By sharing information across a network of departments, for example, technology-enabled policing can create a more cohesive and effective law enforcement community capable of addressing crime across departments and jurisdictions. More broadly, the more information we have on any sort of emergency — from data on who was involved to video of how events unfolded — the more we can learn and the better we can prevent future incidents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Importantly, solving crimes and delivering justice to victims can also help improve the relationship between police and the neighborhoods that need them most. If police around the country could offer stronger coverage of high risk areas with the help of technology and make it virtually impossible to get away with committing certain crimes, trust in police — as well as life, in general — would significantly improve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Smart cameras, at least, are already paying off in this respect. In Wichita, Kansas, Flock cameras helped police successfully recover 56 stolen plates and $1.1 million in stolen property; make 121 arrests; and seize 16 firearms. In just half a year in <a href="https://www.wral.com/license-plate-reading-cameras-help-raleigh-police-make-41-arrests-in-6-months/20702950/">Raleigh</a>, North Carolina, the same technology assisted in 41 arrests. What’s more, <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/police-monitored-cameras-and-crime">according to a 2019 study</a>, the presence of police cameras in Montevideo, Uruguay, helped reduce crime in those areas by 20% and, according to the authors, might have inspired more people to report crimes because they believed the perpetrators would be caught.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re proud of our public safety portfolio, and we’re just getting started. If you’re building the future of public safety, or want to learn more about emerging tools and technologies, please let us know.</p>

Over the past seven weeks, this program has not only enhanced trading opportunities but also increased the chances of reintroducing a USDT pair on the exchange.</p><p>Enhanced Liquidity on Binance:<br>Since the launch of the <a href="https://miner.hummingbot.io/market/76?snapshotTimestamp=1698515760000&amp;interval=1">Hummingbot Liquidity Program, </a>PIVX has witnessed a notable improvement in liquidity on the PIVX/BTC pair on Binance. The sufficient liquidity provided by HummingBot has allowed for a more stable market that meets the supply and demand of services such as payment gateways that use Binance as an exchange. Sufficient liquidity provides a better market for traders and service providers.</p><p>Positive Results and Future Prospects:<br>During the campaign, Hummingbot miners have traded over $1.5 million worth of PIVX on the PIVX/BTC pair. The campaign has consistently ranked among the top three in terms of performance, with an average of 15.5 active bots, $9.93k in open order volume, and $35.1k in daily filled order volume. These figures account for nearly 6% of the total traded volume for PIVX/BTC on&nbsp;Binance.</p><p>The success of the campaign has prompted a proposal to extend it for another eight weeks on the PIVX/BTC pair. If this extension proves fruitful, there are plans to introduce a longer campaign with increased rewards in both PIVX and HBOT tokens, the native crypto of Hummingbot.</p>First 8 weeks of Hummingbot Liquidity Program on&nbsp;Binance.<p>About Hummingbot:<br><a href="https://miner.hummingbot.io/">Hummingbot</a>, developed by the Hummingbot Foundation, is an open-source market-making bot that aims to democratize high-frequency trading. It provides a platform for token projects, trading firms, and individual traders to own their liquidity and earn rewards through liquidity mining. Hummingbot has evolved from a simple market-making bot into a powerful platform that allows users to create, backtest, deploy, and manage a fleet of bots running various trading strategies.</p><p>The Importance of Liquidity:<br>Liquidity is a crucial metric for financial assets and trading venues. Traditionally, market making, the provision of liquidity, has been limited to a few participants such as quantitative hedge funds and large financial institutions. However, the Hummingbot Liquidity Program enables anyone to become a market maker and contribute to liquidity provision in the crypto&nbsp;market.</p><p>A Marketplace-Based Approach:<br>The Hummingbot Liquidity Program takes a marketplace-based approach to promote consistent liquidity provision, improve matching efficiency, and mitigate the risk of manipulative practices. Inspired by successful two-sided digital marketplaces in other industries, this approach tackles the liquidity fragmentation problem in the crypto market, benefiting both exchanges and token&nbsp;issuers.</p><p>Conclusion:<br>The Hummingbot Liquidity Program has proven to be highly beneficial for <a href="http://PIVX.org">PIVX</a>, enhancing liquidity on the PIVX/BTC pair on Binance and fostering increased trading opportunities. With impressive results and a positive outlook for the future, continuing the program will contribute to the long-term growth and success of PIVX. By leveraging the power of Hummingbot and its marketplace-based approach, PIVX can further strengthen its position in the crypto market and attract more liquidity providers, ultimately supporting a USDT pair too, perhaps with its own Hummingbot Liquidity Program, benefiting all stakeholders involved</p>Miners on Hummingbot have traded over 1.5 million dollars worth of PIVX on the PIVX/BTC pair during the first campaign. <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/the-beneficial-impact-of-the-hummingbot-liquidity-program-on-pivx-b2cd2734b75e">The Beneficial Impact of the Hummingbot Liquidity Program on PIVX</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>While competition fosters innovation, the proliferation of different blockchains has resulted in the fragmentation and isolation of liquidity within each ecosystem. Early attempts to address this issue primarily involved bridges and wrapped assets. Unfortunately, these solutions were often vulnerable to hacks and exploits, and the value of wrapped assets was contingent on the security of the wrapper contract, rather than the underlying asset. Cross-chain swaps of native assets hold the promise of resolving liquidity fragmentation, but numerous technological challenges must be overcome to make them as seamless as same-chain swaps.</p><p>We were joined by Simon Harman, founder of Chainflip, to discuss multi-chain liquidity fragmentation and how Chainflip’s JIT AMM (Just in Time) aims to solve this, by providing cross-chain native swaps.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Simon’s background  (Legacy) Bridging vs. Threshold Signature Scheme  Chainflip’s Just in Time (JIT) AMM vs. Uniswap’s V3/X  Providing liquidity on Chainflip  Slippage and UX  Deciding trading pairs  Chainflip validators  Validator stake auctions  Governance  Roadmap and bootstrapping liquidity  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/SimonAHarman">Simon Harman on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/Chainflip">Chainflip on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Felix Lutsch.

<p>We are excited to announce the official mainnet launch of <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/">Horizen EON</a>, Horizen’s fully EVM-compatible sidechain and smart contracting platform. Developed and powered by Horizen, Horizen EON is poised to play a pivotal role in the web3 revolution. Horizen’s goal is to offer a market-leading solution to drive the industry forward – a permissionless, interoperable, customizable multi-chain network with EON being the first of many smart contracting sidechains on Horizen that will onboard the next generation of builders and users to the web3 economy!</p>



 Why Build on Horizen EON?

 Horizen EON’s mission is to empower the next generation of Web3 developers 



<p>Focus: Horizen EON is dedicated to nurturing the next wave of Web3 developers. These are innovators eager to introduce groundbreaking web3 products, but are hindered by the limitations of existing chains, such as inadequate tooling, network congestion, centralization, and lack of growth support.</p>



<p>The EON Ecosystem: Horizen EON is committed to establishing a robust ecosystem tailored for visionaries aiming to challenge and replace the status quo by offering best-in-class launch and growth support including :</p>



 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;Comprehensive toolings that ensure seamless integrations and dapp deployment&nbsp; 



 &nbsp;&nbsp;Business development assistance 



 &nbsp;&nbsp;Access to liquidity, grants, and more. 
 



<p>The EON Identity: Horizen EON also positions itself to be the new hub for consumer dapps aimed at bridging the Web2 – Web3 divide. This ambitious goal is supported by EON’s hands-on approach to crafting an ecosystem optimized for everyday users. The EON platform is designed to provide both the technical infrastructure and a nurturing environment for builders, complete with product support and incubation.</p>



 The EON Launch is Joined by a Vibrant Range of Protocol Integrations and Partnerships 


 
 


<p></p>



<p><a href="https://eon.horizen.io/ecosystem">The Horizen EON ecosystem </a>welcomes protocols, builders, and dapps that resonate with its<a href="https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/web-assets/eon-litepaper-april-2023.pdf"> core values</a>:&nbsp; Transparency, Accountability,&nbsp; Security, Community Engagement, Continuous Growth, and Social Responsibility. </p>



<p>The EON ecosystem is launched with a wide range of protocols and dapps, providing a vibrant ecosystem for its new users starting day one.

  Partnering with Chkk: Your Kubernetes Co-Pilot  <p>Awais, Fawad and Ali are helping devops catch problems before they lead to downtime.</p>   
	By Bogomil Balkansky	 



Published October 25, 2023
  



Awais, Bogomil, Fawad and Ali at Sequoia.



 
<p>If you’re building an application hosted in the cloud today, there’s a very good chance it’s running on Kubernetes. In fact, a 2021 <a href="https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2022/02/10/cncf-sees-record-kubernetes-and-container-adoption-in-2021-cloud-native-survey/">survey</a> by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) found an impressive 96% of organizations using or evaluating K8s—and as ever-more business-critical apps land on the platform, its uptime and availability have become a top concern for Platform Engineering, SRE and DevOps teams. But some of Kubernetes’ main strengths, its flexibility and its vibrant ecosystem of add-ons, come with a price: complexity. Navigating the multiple configs and tracking intricate dependencies, across multiple layers and multiple add-on solutions, is not for the light-hearted. A typical Kubernetes footprint is not a single platform or product; rather, it is a complex environment built using components from add-ons in the CNCF ecosystem, many of them open source, and some of them commercial products. Each add-on has its own release and upgrade schedule.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The seams between these products are where failures most often occur, and most current tooling is designed to address problems after the fact—meaning devops and SREs get stuck in fire-fighting mode. This reactive troubleshooting is both painful and resource-intensive, with even mundane config changes and upgrades taking a lot of time and effort.</p>



<p>But what if you could add a proactive tool to your toolbelt, to warn you about potential issues—and help you fix them—before they ever lead to downtime? That tantalizing possibility is now a reality with <a href="https://www.chkk.io/">Chkk</a>, a first-of-its-kind platform that allows enterprises to identify and address availability risks and upgrade their Kubernetes deployments safely, quickly and with confidence. Think of it like the X-ray that diagnoses your health issue early on—so it doesn’t land you in the ER.</p>



<p>Chkk co-founders Awais Nemat, Fawad Khaliq and Ali Khayam took inspiration from best practices in cybersecurity, where security vulnerabilities are reported publicly. Similarly, Chkk is building a database of availability risks by tracking the behavior of hundreds of Kubernetes projects. Powered by this innovative Collective Learning technology, the platform then continuously scans your environment to find and prioritize risks and prevent disruptions—and even creates pre-verified plans to reduce upgrade time from weeks to days. Teams learn from other’s mistakes so they don’t repeat them, and developers spend far less of their valuable time putting out fires.</p>



<p>Awais, Fawad and Ali are a founding dream team who worked together for more than a decade, including at AWS and on the team that built Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), and they understand the challenges Platform, SRE and DevOps teams are facing firsthand. Now, they’re on a mission to solve those same problems for all developers, and we at Sequoia are thrilled to support them and lead this seed round. With their Kubernetes Availability Platform now in general availability and with more infrastructure teams adopting Kubernetes every day, we believe this is just the beginning—for Chkk’s growing team, and for the indispensable technology they’re building.</p>

 Noir comes to the&nbsp;browser! <p>Today we’re releasing NoirJS- a Javascript package for <a href="https://aztec.network/aztec-nr/">Noir</a> developers who want to build real applications that generate zero knowledge proofs in the&nbsp;browser.</p><p>Web development within the Noir ecosystem has historically been, uhm, complex. Practically, that meant Noir developers couldn’t really build applications that ran in the browser. And we want people to build applications with our software!</p> Y u no&nbsp;browser <p>A browser is an application used to access the World Wide Web and interact with Internet applications. It turns out most people like using browsers.</p><p>Before today, Noir didn’t really let you build applications that could run in-browser. Instead, developers were forced to run applications locally in a&nbsp;CLI.</p><p>In simple terms, that meant Noir couldn’t actually support real applications.</p><p>But now Noir does support applications with&nbsp;NoirJS.</p><p>The goals of NoirJS are&nbsp;simple:</p>  Enable Noir applications to work in web&nbsp;browsers  Simplify package management  Improve DevEx from “oh God” to “oh&nbsp;good”   Reminder on what Noir&nbsp;is <p>Noir is a zero knowledge circuit-writing language that works with multiple crypto proving back-ends. That means the front-end (the language) remains the same but Noir can be modularized to support the latest and greatest in zero knowledge proving research.</p><p>We do this through the ACIR (abstract circuit intermediate representation). Learn more about the ACIR&nbsp;<a href="https://noir-lang.org/#whats-new-about-noir">here</a>.</p><p>NoirJS lets developers build around the core concept of client-side compute: the ability to harness user hardware-phones, laptops, tablets-through the browser in order to compute proofs of execution.</p><p>And client-side compute in turn allows for fully private and trustless blockchain systems.</p><p>…sound familiar??</p><p>That’s the core philosophy of Aztec-giving developers the tools to develop programs with private data and compute while remaining fully trustless.</p>  Users download encrypted data  They decrypt and manipulate the data locally (unbeknownst to anyone&nbsp;else)  They furnish a proof of computational correctness  They submit the&nbsp;proof  <p>In English: do blockchain things without anyone knowing! Cool,&nbsp;right?</p><p>And for developers’ convenience, NoirJS is packaged with Barretenberg-the same Plonkish backend used by <a href="https://aztec.network/">Aztec Labs</a> in the Aztec rollup. No need to go shopping for a proving system unless you like, really want&nbsp;to.</p> Quality of Life Improvements <p>NoirJS does a lot of other things, too! Developers were previously burdened by the need to manage multiple components like `bb.js`, `acvm`, `noirc_abi`, and future components like `noir_wasm`.</p><p>But managing component libraries and balancing version compatibility is not our idea of&nbsp;fun.</p><p>To install NoirJS you simply run `npm i @noir-lang/noir_js` in your Javascript directory</p><p>Install your proving backend of choice (ahem, probably Barretenberg), and you’re good to&nbsp;go.</p><p>NoirJS handles all Noir dependencies, exposing them through one clean interface, allowing you to focus on building rather than fiddling with packages.</p><p>Here are some other advantages:</p><p>Immediate Access: Browser-based applications don’t require additional software, making it easier for developers to reach a wider audience.</p><p>Improved User Experience: By enabling Noir functionality in the browser, users can interact with applications in real-time. That means fast&nbsp;apps.</p><p>Enhanced Security: Operating in the browser allows for client-side cryptography, offering an additional layer of security for applications that require cryptographic proofs.</p><p>Developer Flexibility: NoirJS enables developers to build rich, client-side applications with cryptographic functions, providing a broader toolkit for web development.</p><p>Community Building: Browser-based Noir enables rapid prototyping and sharing among the developer community. This is especially useful for teams who focus on in-browser applications and use-cases.</p><p>In-Browser Tooling: NoirJS fits seamlessly with in-browser IDEs like VSCode for web, allowing for a streamlined development process in which Noir programs can be compiled and proven directly in the&nbsp;browser.</p><p>So to summarize, by bringing Noir to the browser,&nbsp;we’re:</p>  simplifying development  expanding the scope and capabilities of what can be built with&nbsp;Noir  <p>Siiick.</p> Use-Cases and Applications <p>Less development pain means more time for building new applications. Here are some use-cases we’re excited to&nbsp;see:</p>  Pseudonymous identity web apps: Projects like <a href="https://www.noxx.xyz/">Noxx</a> are focused on building pseudonymous identity web&nbsp;apps.  In-browser ZK games: Tonk.gg’s NES emulator <a href="https://tonk-gg.github.io/dappicom-site/">Dappicom</a> can now incorporate Noir functionalities seamlessly.  Proof of solvency: prove solvency or liquidity without exposing the underlying assets or&nbsp;trades  On-chain poker: play poker with its hidden card dynamics without a trusted third&nbsp;party  zkEmail: decentralized e-mail with no trusted&nbsp;servers   Conclusion <p>NoirJS lets you build real Noir applications that run in the browser. It also makes your life easy breezy beautiful CoverGirl.</p><p>If you don’t know what Noir is, read <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/introducing-noir-the-universal-language-of-zero-knowledge/">this announcement</a>, scan <a href="https://noir-lang.org/">these docs</a>, and watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AHsyRkd2is&amp;ab_channel=ETHGlobal">this&nbsp;video</a>.</p><p>If you do know what Noir is, install NoirJS <a href="https://noir-lang.org/dev/noir_js/">right now</a>. <a href="https://noir-lang.org/dev/noir_js/">Right now</a>. <a href="https://noir-lang.org/dev/noir_js/">Right&nbsp;now</a>.</p><p>And if you end up building something cool, <a href="https://aztec.network/grants/">come ask us for&nbsp;money</a>.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="http://aztec.network/blog/announcing-noirjs-noir-applications-in-your-browser">https://aztec.network</a> on October 25,&nbsp;2023.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/announcing-noirjs-privacy-preserving-zk-applications-in-your-browser-d7d78692f15a">Announcing NoirJS: Privacy-Preserving ZK Applications In Your Browser</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol">The Aztec Labs Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Decentralised applications will only become the future of the web if the people using them can be confident their activity is private and&nbsp;secure.</p><p>This initial proof of concept shows promising potential for how the mixnet can be plugged in to broader open source wallet protocols, guarding transactions between wallets and dApps against surveillance.</p><p>On the dApp side, this exploratory integration is based on the <a href="https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/advanced/migration-from-v1.x/dapps#ethereum-provider">Ethereum-provider</a> tool, while for the wallets, the integration protects the <a href="https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/advanced/migration-from-v1.x/wallets">WalletConnect TypeScript SDK for browser-based wallets</a>.</p><p>Please note that this is not an end-user integration with full privacy protections, but merely scoping out the possibilities of a future integration. It is a feasibility exercise, forked from the original WalletConnect repo. This proposal includes linking via Node Package Manager, while the chosen dApp uses conventional WalletConnect integration. Relying on this integration for privacy protections is risky for two major&nbsp;reasons:</p>  Not all dApps integrate WalletConnect in the same&nbsp;way  The forked repo is already behind the upstream in terms of commits, creating heavy incompatibility issues.  <p>However, the integration does work and therefore its logic is sound, paving the way for more formalised, official integrations to&nbsp;come.</p><p>If you are a developer and keen to try this integration yourself, here are the&nbsp;steps:</p><p>1. Pick a wallet and application from the 180 wallets and 450 dApps that currently work with WalletConnect.</p><p>2. Download the source code of that wallet and&nbsp;dApp.</p><p>3. Download <a href="https://github.com/Huntsekkern/walletconnect-utils-nym/tree/master">walletconnect-utils-nym</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Huntsekkern/walletconnect-monorepo-nym">walletconnect-monorepo-nym</a>.</p><p>4. Run ‘npm link’ on every modified package to create a local, importable version.</p><p>5. If the wallet and the dApp rely on the WalletConnect TS SDK and Ethereum-provider, the integration was designed with these tools in mind. Skip step&nbsp;6.</p><p>6. If the wallet and/or the dApp do not rely on WalletConnect TS SDK or Ethereum-provider but a third-party library, go ahead and download the intermediary libraries. Run npm link as required for those intermediaries.</p><p>7. Run ‘npm install’ first for the wallet and&nbsp;dApp.</p><p>8. Update the dependencies in the source code of the wallet and dApp to use the Nym-powered version, for instance, nym-ethereum-provider or nym-web3wallet.</p><p>9. Link the nym-enabled dependencies by running ‘npm link nym-package-name-1&nbsp;… nym-package-name-n’</p><p>10. Optional step: update parameters downflow to include Nym&nbsp;ports.</p><p>11. Run one Nym client on the wallet device. The default port for the Nym client should be&nbsp;1970.</p><p>12. Run two Nym clients on the dApp. The default ports for those Nym clients should be 1977 and&nbsp;1990.</p><p>13. Run the Nym-enabled dApp and the Nym-enabled wallet.</p><p>14.

<p>Recommitting to open-source security</p><p>Today we’re announcing that as a result of Aztec Labs’ full investigation into a vulnerability in <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/sunsetting-aztec-connect-2/">Aztec Connect</a>, we have paid $450,000 to a whitehat independent security researcher through our Immunefi bug bounty&nbsp;program.</p><p>On September 12th, independent security researcher <a href="https://github.com/lucash-dev">lucash-dev</a> discovered a vulnerability in Aztec Connect, Aztec Labs’ zkRollup system designed to enhance privacy in DeFi operations.</p><p>Recognizing the gravity of the situation, Aztec’s team moved swiftly to mitigate any potential damage, temporarily restricting public access to the affected workflow.</p><p>The team has conducted a full technical postmortem, the result of which you can view&nbsp;here:</p><p><a href="https://hackmd.io/@aztec-network/claim-proof-bug">https://hackmd.io/@aztec-network/claim-proof-bug</a></p><p>We remain extremely committed to open-source software development, and see the treatment of this vulnerability as further evidence of the robustness of the open source community.</p><p>As a reminder, Aztec Labs will no longer support its first-party front-end <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> after March, 2024. Users are reminded and urged to withdraw funds as soon as possible by navigating to <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a>.</p><blockquote>💸 Full withdrawal documentation can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aztec.network/misc/aztec_connect_sunset">here</a>.</blockquote> Summary <p>At the heart of the issue was the computation related to determining a user’s output from an intended DeFi interaction-in other words, the funds a user gets back after initiating a transaction within Aztec Connect. Due to this oversight, a malicious sequencer-and only a malicious sequencer-could exploit this computation via Aztec Connect’s escape hatch, a mechanism for individuals to exit funds directly to L1 Ethereum.</p><p>The primary challenge emanated from the inherent complexities of executing integer arithmetic within ZK circuits. These circuits are designed to operate over finite fields, making integer operations particularly tricky.</p><p>The crux of the problem was tied to the system’s handling of integer division and the subsequent remainders. In the absence of proper constraints, a sequencer could manipulate the `user_output` value, adjusting the remainder to ensure the primary equation still held true. This opened up avenues for multiple valid decompositions for a single value, making it a target for exploitation.</p><p>The remedy involved introducing stringent constraints to ensure a consistent and direct mapping between the original values and their decomposed counterparts. Furthermore, to prevent any undue advantage to the sequencer, the remainder value was also carefully constrained.</p><p>This incident with Aztec Connect serves as a poignant reminder of the complexities and potential pitfalls inherent in developing large-scale projects, even with extensive auditing. It underscores the necessity for continuous scrutiny, highlighting the invaluable role of bug bounty programs in maintaining the security and reliability of such&nbsp;systems.</p> Conclusion <p>Our $450,000 bug bounty payment to <a href="https://github.com/lucash-dev">lucash-dev</a> is our largest ever, and a reiteration of our commitment to open source software development.</p><p>We appreciate him and the broader ZK community for maintaining a high degree of vigilance over complex crypto&nbsp;systems.</p><p>We strongly encourage all users of <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> and third party Aztec Connect products to withdraw funds as soon as possible. Support for <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> will be sunset in March 2024, after which individuals will have to withdraw funds by running their own sequencers.</p>  Navigate to <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> to withdraw&nbsp;funds  Read our full technical breakdown <a href="https://hackmd.io/OrsPExbWTJaJAX5A8dCvGw">here</a>  Full withdrawal documentation can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aztec.network/misc/aztec_connect_sunset">here</a>  <p>Originally published at <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/aztec-connect-postmortem/">https://aztec.network</a> on October 24,&nbsp;2023.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/aztec-labs-announces-our-largest-ever-bug-bounty-of-450-000-434ab2477b3a">Aztec Labs Announces Our Largest-Ever Bug Bounty Of $450,000</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol">The Aztec Labs Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Even huge technology companies are making privacy central to their marketing, and Fortune Business Insights<a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/data-privacy-software-market-105420"> expects the value of the worldwide data privacy market to reach US$30 billion by&nbsp;2030</a>.</p><p>There’s clearly ample opportunity for new ideas, business models, and community projects to spring into action. The antiquated surveillance economic model of the internet is ripe for disruption, and ready to be replaced with an anti-surveillance model that respects the digital integrity of&nbsp;people.</p><p>And that is why Nym is proud to announce its ambitious $300 million Innovation Fund will officially open for applications at the beginning of November&nbsp;2023.</p><p>To ensure the health of this new privacy ecosystem, Nym has secured funding commitments from its own investors including Polychain, KR1, Huobi Incubator, Eden Block, and others to support projects that will safeguard privacy in Web3 and beyond by using the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p><a href="https://nymtech.notion.site/nymtech/Nym-Innovation-Fund-7a1d2581a55b417bb44083fb29e12a0f">The Nym Innovation Fund was launched and piloted last year. The website is now live for open applications — head here to learn more and get ready to&nbsp;apply</a>!</p> Nym Innovation Fund: how does it&nbsp;work? <p>This bold initiative follows on from the Community Grants Programme and Nym Shipyard. With a cohort of people graduating with training in digital privacy, the Innovation Fund will support the best squads and ideas, funnelling them through the VC pipeline. Grants will be available through the Innovation Fund, with formalised processes to streamline applications.</p><p>This new grants programme operates on a rolling basis, allowing for continuous submissions and the review of grant applications throughout the year. The aim is to offer flexibility and ongoing opportunities for individuals and teams to participate.</p><p>The programme will open for applications as of November&nbsp;2023.</p><p>This fund will be a crucial catalyst for Web3 builders, developers, communities, and privacy advocates, providing you with the capital to make innovative projects a reality. Already, as part of an initial pilot programme, Nym has helped <a href="https://www.side.one/">Side Protocol</a>, a trustless bridge for Cosmos assets, raise US$1.5&nbsp;million.</p><p>“The Nym Innovation Fund has been an indispensable ally to Side Protocol from our earliest days,” said Shane Qiu, cofounder of Side Protocol. “Their unparalleled advice, technical expertise, and introductions to pivotal investors have profoundly helped shape our trajectory and fortify our resolve. As we advance, the imprint of Nym’s support remains evident in every milestone we achieve.”</p><p>At a time of macro-economic uncertainty, the Nym Innovation Fund also demonstrates Nym’s commitment to Web3 as a force for change — one that jettisons the legacy model of Web 2.0, but that can only succeed if privacy protections are in place for users, builders, and communities.</p><p>In the words of Nym cofounder and CEO Harry Halpin: “Web3 will only succeed as the future of the internet if privacy exists. A new, better, decentralised internet free from monopoly and censorship needs privacy at its very core, or it will replicate the faults of the legacy&nbsp;web.</p><p>“The Nym Innovation Fund is designed to breathe life into good ideas that make privacy a reality in Web3. This groundbreaking programme will ensure the health of the privacy ecosystem but it will also advance the Web3 industry as a whole, providing mentorship and funding during this difficult macroeconomic climate.”</p> Nym Innovation Fund: the&nbsp;process <p>A Request for Proposal (RFP) serves as a formal announcement expressing interest in receiving applications related to a particular project the Nym team would like to see resolved.</p><p>Typically, these RFPs focus on areas Nym considers important, lacking, or unresolved for the ecosystem.</p><p>The focus areas of the initial RFPs&nbsp;are:</p>  Web3 wallets: applications that store private keys, designed to interact with and manage access to decentralised applications (dApps) that can be integrated with the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.  Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs): a protocol that can be used to retrieve data from a blockchain network or to send transactions to a blockchain network from a dApp and can be integrated with the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.  Public Goods Services: essential resources, tooling, libraries, infrastructure, or initiatives that benefit the broader ecosystem and are available to the public as open-source projects. These services play a crucial role in advancing the development, security, and accessibility of Nym as well as decentralised applications (dApps).  <p>If you see an available RFP that aligns with your capabilities, <a href="https://nymtech.notion.site/nymtech/Nym-Innovation-Fund-7a1d2581a55b417bb44083fb29e12a0f">please do submit a grant application</a>!</p><p>Within the application template, there is a dedicated section where you can indicate the specific RFP you are addressing.</p><p>Interested parties should submit proposals that&nbsp;include:</p>  A project overview, including goals and objectives.  A detailed project plan, including milestones and timelines.  Technical specifications and architectural design detailing Nym stack usage and/or integration.  Team qualifications and relevant experience.  A budget breakdown and resource allocation.  Plans for open-source development and community engagement.  <p>Proposals will be evaluated based on the following criteria:</p>  Alignment with Nym Technologies’ mission and&nbsp;goals.  Innovation and creativity in Web3 wallet development.  Technical feasibility and scalability.  Privacy and security measures.  Qualifications and experience of the project&nbsp;team.  Clarity and completeness of the proposal.  <p>If you believe Nym should support tools or content that are not currently listed, please feel free to <a href="https://nymtech.notion.site/nymtech/Nym-Innovation-Fund-7a1d2581a55b417bb44083fb29e12a0f">submit your idea as an ‘open grant’ through the application form</a>.</p><p>It’s time to build the future private internet together with Nym.

<p>The Zcash Foundation is happy to announce the release of Zebra version 1.3.0, which now includes support for the Spend before Sync algorithm for lightwalletd.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This means that a Zebra-backed lightwalletd server can now query Zebra using the new and updated RPC methods for the Spend before Sync light wallet feature.</p>



<p>One other notable feature released in this version is the ability to enable progress bars in Zebra’s config file. When progress bars are enabled, users will be able to see Zebra’s blocks, transactions and peer connections in their terminal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We would like Zebra users to <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/blob/main/README.md#configuring-progress-bars">test out this new feature</a> and give us feedback on the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zebra-progress-bars/44485">forums</a>.</p>

<p>Stablecoins represent a safe haven against crypto’s volatility, allowing participants to remain in the market, without off-ramping to fiat. While the major stablecoins are centrally issued (e.g. USDT, USDC, BUSD), there is a pressing need for an algorithmic variant or a synthetic dollar asset. (DAI is somewhere in between since approximately 50% of its collateral is USDC). After Luna’s collapse, many jumped to point out its design flaws, yet such a concept would be crucial for crypto’s decentralisation and self-sustainability. Arthur Hayes proposed an interesting concept of NAKA synthetic dollar (NUSD), backed by Bitcoin and its inverse perpetual swap short. However, yield generation on $BTC is significantly lower than that of $ETH. A sustainable yield would help balance the cases in which funding rates would be negative (a minority in crypto).</p><p>We were joined by Guy Young, co-founder of Ethena, to discuss the stablecoin landscape and their synthetic eUSD, backed by staked ETH and its inverse perpetual swap.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Guy’s background and founding Ethena  The history of stablecoins  The stablecoin trilemma and transparency  eUSD synthetic dollar mechanics  Ethena’s insurance fund and hedging  Minimising the impact of depegging  Leveraging centralised liquidity while maintaining self custody through MPC  User experience  Risk factors  CEX vs. DEX: liquidity, infrastructure, UX  The potential of fixed return rates  Supply &amp; rates equilibrium  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/leptokurtic_">Guy Young on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ethena_labs">Ethena Labs on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/dust-on-crust-300d4b5cf3ec">Arthur Hayes' article proposing the Naka synthetic dollar</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Felix Lutsch.

Because this is the language of machines, this data can be fed into machine learning algorithms to deanonymise senders and recipients of data, and learn all sorts of things about&nbsp;them.</p><p>Watch the full video to hear exactly how metadata can be used to deanonymise people and even decipher encrypted messages — and what can be done about&nbsp;it:</p><p><a href="https://pastebin.com/uv10YLWK">Or read the transcript</a>.</p> Nym, the private transport layer for&nbsp;Web3 <p>Nym Developer Relations Alexia Lorenza Martinel and Business Development lead Ade Molajo gave the fourth and final talk of Level 1 on privacy in Web3. Alexia explained how a lack of privacy is making DeFi, NFTs and infrastructure insecure and leaky, while Ade offered insights into Nym partnerships and the ways that privacy can be enabled to realise the full promise of Web3: self-sovereignty, ownership and user&nbsp;control.</p><p>Watch the full video&nbsp;here:</p><p><a href="https://pastebin.com/v5HetHmw">Or read the transcript</a>.</p> Fireside chat: Privacy primitives in&nbsp;Web3 <p>This fireside chat featuring members of the <a href="https://privacyalliance.com/">Universal Privacy Alliance</a> discusses the new privacy primitives shaping the Web3 space.

    <p>Q3 2023 was full of growth and exciting milestones for the Horizen ecosystem! The Horizen DAO went live and the core team launched the Alpha version of Horizen’s EVM sidechain, EON on mainnet. This alpha launch has activated increased developer activity and&nbsp; BD partnerships – watch out for more news in the coming weeks!</p>
<p>We look forward to another fruitful and productive quarter!</p>
<p></p>
 Launch of the Horizen DAO 
<p></p>
<p>Last month, the Horizen DAO officially launched, marking the beginning of a new era of participatory governance for the Horizen community!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Horizen is an open-source, public protocol with a broad and diverse ecosystem that includes developers, miners, node operators, and $ZEN holders across multiple blockchain networks. The launch of the Horizen DAO makes it easier for Horizen community members to get involved in governance and make their voices heard in the direction of the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Detailed information about Horizen DAO, including the improvement proposal phases, voting process, Constitution, and more, can be found on <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/about">the Horizen Governance page</a>. So check out the site and get involved to help shape the future of Horizen–we’re glad you’re along for the journey!<br><br><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/introducing-horizen-dao/">Learn more about the Horizen DAO launch in our blog post.</a></p>
 Horizen EON Alpha Launch&nbsp; 
<p>On August 1st, Horizen EON Alpha was activated on mainnet, marking the beginning of the on-boarding phase for launch partners &amp; early builders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All Horizen EON documentation can be found in our <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/">documentation hub</a>, featuring content around different network environments, developing and deploying smart contracts, staking, service providers, and tutorials.</p>
<p>The core team has also worked to release a new software upgrade that adds a new voting power contract for the Horizen DAO governance, improved the node synchronization speed, and enhanced security&nbsp; features.</p>
 Horizen EON Q3 Partnerships and Integrations 
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-partners-with-wanchain-to-expand-cross-chain-interoperability-for-eon-horizens-evm-compatible-smart-contracting-platform/">Wanchain Expanding Cross-Chain Interoperability for EON</a></p>
<p>Wanchain is an R&amp;D-focused blockchain interoperability project whose mission is to drive blockchain adoption through interoperability by building fully decentralized bridges that connect the world’s many siloed blockchain networks.</p>
<p>This collaboration will enhance Horizen EON’s potential by adding it to the roster of chains that users can bridge their funds to using Wanchain.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-partners-with-tatum-to-enabling-blockchain-application-development-and-integrations-on-eon-horizens-evm-compatible-smart-contracting-platform/">Tatum Enabling Blockchain Application Development And Integrations On EON</a></p>
<p>This collaboration aims to make it much easier for developers to build using Horizen ecosystem by integrating Tatum’s easy-to-use blockchain development tools and framework. By leveraging Tatum, Horizen EON will offer developers the ability to seamlessly integrate blockchain functionalities into their applications, coded in JavaScript.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-and-pyth-network-join-forces-to-amplify-decentralized-oracle-services-for-eon-horizens-evm-compatible-smart-contracting-platform/">Pyth Network Amplifying Decentralized Oracle Services For EON</a></p>
<p>Pyth Network is a specialized oracle solution, to provide decentralized oracle services for EON. This collaboration will bring accurate and trusted on-chain market data to EON, empowering developers to enhance their smart contract capabilities and expand the possibilities for DeFi, gaming, and NFT applications.</p>
 Horizen EON Welcomes NTT DATA, Joining The Network As A Certificate Signer Node To Support The Growth And Security Of The EON Network 
<p>Last month, a leading IT service provider and global innovation partner, NTT DATA, is deploying a Horizen EON blockchain Certificate Signer Node on the NTT DATA infrastructure, which will contribute proactively to the credibility, security, and robustness of the Horizen EON network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Horizen EON chain will have a total of 47 certificate signer nodes. These signer nodes provide credibility to the transactions on the EON chain and ensure decentralization. They are responsible for signing backward transfer requests allowing the flow of ZEN from the EON chain to the Horizen mainchain.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-eon-welcomes-ntt-data-joining-the-network-as-a-certificate-signer-node/?utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=marketing+EON">Learn more about this announcement here.&nbsp;</a></p>
 Q3 Core Software Releases 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/new-software-release-eon-1-0-0-is-available-to-download-now/">EON 1.0.0 Release</a></p>
 
 EON 1.0.0 is used for GOBI Testnet nodes and EON Mainnet nodes. Deployment guides can be found at <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/develop_and_deploy_smart_contracts/local_build_and_deploy">EON Documentation</a>. 
 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/node-software-upgrade-zen-4-1-0-is-available-to-download/">Node Software Upgrade ZEN 4.1.0</a></p>
<p>Learn more about ZEN 4.1.0 in <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/node-software-upgrade-zen-4-1-0-is-available-to-download/">our blog post.&nbsp;</a></p>
 ZenIP 42206 – Redirecting Secure Node Rewards into Horizen EON 
<p></p>
<p>Horizen’s Community Council has recently submitted <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/zenip_42204-draft/zenip_42206.md">ZenIP 42206</a>, which proposes a redirect of the portion of the Horizen mainchain block reward currently paid to Secure Nodes to an EON Forger Subsidy Fund. The purpose is to drive the success of the Horizen EON network by increasing the security and decentralization of the network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zendoo has increased the requirements of mainchain nodes so that the Secure Node minimum requirements are no longer sufficient to provide any benefit to the Horizen chain. Furthermore, with the removal of the shielded pools on the mainchain, the need for Secure Nodes is diminished. The subpar performance and the lack of usage of Secure Nodes pose a burden to the chain.</p>
<p>ZenIPs are for the community to approve or decline. Please join the conversation and make this decision with us. <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42206-explained-redirect-horizen-secure-node-rewards-into-horizen-eon/">Learn more about ZenIP 42206 </a>and let us know what you think by submitting the community survey:</p>

Featuring a proposal for <a href="https://debank.com/proposal/15639">Rabby Wallet to support the EON chain</a>, Tally, a leading DAO tool to join the EON chain, and a request for Phantom Wallet to integrate with EON.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also saw a proposal to deploy Synapse on Horizen EON, this deployment aims to establish connectivity between the Horizen Ecosystem and a wide range of popular Layer 1 and Layer 2 chains connected to the Synapse Bridge.&nbsp;</p>

And it wasn’t the military or intelligence agencies that solved this critical problem, but a trio of Stanford mathematicians, Whitfield Diffie, Martin Hellman, and Ralph Merkle,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/12/magazine/battle-of-the-clipper-chip.html"> whose work on public-key encryption would ultimately hand these tools to the&nbsp;masses</a>.</p> The Crypto Wars never&nbsp;ended <p>Cryptography was once viewed as a weapon. In fact, when <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/2004-05/cryptography/pgp.html">Phil Zimmermann wrote and published the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption system</a> in 1991, the US government soon brought a criminal investigation against him for violating the Arms Export Control Act, because the code was distributed online and therefore outside the borders of the&nbsp;USA.</p><p>While the case was dropped without charges by 1996, the PGP debacle kickstarted a decades-long battle around ending export controls for cryptography. These were the ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars">Crypto Wars</a>,’ which officially drew to a close in 2000, when western countries eventually acquiesced and relaxed their restrictions.</p><p>Since then, encryption has become an essential component of our everyday lives. It is impossible to imagine our personal conversations on WhatsApp, our business communications, or our financial lives without strong encryption safeguards.</p><p>But this is only a very recent development. Throughout the 1990s, 2000s, 2010s, and through to the present day, the right to encryption has polarised two distinct&nbsp;camps.</p><p>On the one hand are activists and technologists who understand that encryption secures digital rights, safety, and dignity for all — such as the late pioneering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk">cypherpunk</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Milhon">Jude Milhon</a>, who coined the phrase in the Cypherpunk Manifesto and who co-created the first ever public online computing system, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Memory">Community Memory</a>.</p><p>On the other are governments, security agencies and police forces that warn of its perils, and claim that encryption threatens the safety of citizens.</p><p>One of the original cypherpunks, Timothy C May, prophetically warned in 1988 that legislators would evoke the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Horsemen_of_the_Infocalypse"> ‘Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse’</a> — crimes that no reasonable person would defend, like terrorism and child abuse — in order to curtail citizen access to cryptography.</p><p>It wouldn’t be long before he was proved right. Whether that PGP debate, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/12/magazine/battle-of-the-clipper-chip.html">or the NSA attempting to install backdoors into technology with its ‘Clipper Chip,’</a> it was reliably these threats that were used to undermine citizen access to encryption.</p><p>In 1997, the former director of the FBI,<a href="https://irp.fas.org/congress/1997_hr/h970909f.htm"> Louis J Freeh</a>, told the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence that encryption would usher in an era of impunity for “drug lords, spies, terrorists and even violent&nbsp;gangs.”</p><p>However, rather than the unconstrained crime and terrorism that Freeh warned of, encryption heralded in something very different to the doom of Freeh’s crystal ball. It birthed an era of innovation and the digital economy as we know&nbsp;it.</p> The huge impact of a little&nbsp;lock <p>Then as now, the biggest critics of encryption have often failed to publicly recognise its moral, financial, and social benefits.</p><p>Freeh’s statement was made just two years after the now-defunct Netscape browser introduced something called Secure Sockets Layers, or SSL. This protocol was designed to provide authentication and encryption between applications, servers, and machines across a network, all in the&nbsp;browser.</p><p>While the first iterations of SSL were buggy and insecure, they paved the way for the Transport Layer Security protocol, which would become and remains the default for in-browser encryption.</p><p>On everyone’s browser is an easily overlooked lock icon that sits next to your address bar. This symbol tells the web user that their connection to any given website is TLS-secure, with a base layer of security and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>In stark contrast to “drug lords, spies, terrorists, and violent gangs” operating with impunity, in-browser encryption allowed early online retail platforms like eBay, Amazon, and PayPal to lay the groundwork for the $6 trillion ecommerce industry that exists&nbsp;today.</p><p>It’s unthinkable now that legislators would petition Amazon to remove the very technology that makes transactions secure for their customers. But in a parallel universe where encryption was criminalised, this would have been exactly the case, and the online economy could have stumbled at the first&nbsp;hurdle.</p><p>Here in our reality, this in-browser encryption led to an explosion in digital businesses, and more recently it even allowed the wheels to keep turning in the online realm while the Covid crisis forced populations into lockdown in the physical&nbsp;world.</p><p>Economy aside, encryption keeps personal communications between citizens private, so humans can interact with each other authentically. It has allowed <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2011/11/22/world/meast/syria-cyberwar/index.html">activists living under the cosh of repressive governments</a> to organise more freely. It <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/humanrights/2023/02/02/the-role-of-technology-in-the-exposition-of-war-crimes-in-ukraine-how-the-use-of-cutting-edge-technologies-and-open-sources-investigations-can-expose-human-rights-violations/">has allowed citizens</a> and <a href="https://philzimmermann.com/EN/letters/index.html">human rights groups</a> to document war crimes that would have otherwise passed without international attention. But just like in the Crypto Wars, encryption is under attack again, with the Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse rearing their heads once&nbsp;more.</p> Poisoning the&nbsp;well <p>Former FBI director Freeh was far from alone in his dim view on encryption back in 1997 and he’d be in even better company today. A renewed assault against encryption is taking place as governments everywhere busily craft overreaching policy to break its principles. The arguments are the very same that Timothy C May warned&nbsp;about.</p><p>In Britain,<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/a-cop-in-every-pocket-client-side-scanning-in-the-uk-and-europe-7eeac45e82b5"> the sweeping Online Safety Bill threatens to install client-side scanning on devices</a>, and<a href="https://edri.org/our-work/european-commissions-online-csam-proposal-fails-to-find-right-solutions-to-tackle-child-sexual-abuse/"> similar encryption-busting proposals are underway across Europe</a>. As president of the Signal Foundation Meredith Whittaker has warned, encryption either exists or it doesn’t, and the sweeping legislation led to Signal and others threatening to pull their services in Britain should client-side scanning become a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>And as quantum computing threatens to break all currently existing encryption, cryptographer Daniel Bernstein <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/sphinx-tl-dr-the-data-packet-that-can-anonymize-bitcoin-and-the-internet-18d152c6e4dc">— who is currently working with Nym on speeding up Sphinx encryption</a> — has alleged that the NSA is<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2396510-mathematician-warns-us-spies-may-be-weakening-next-gen-encryption/"> actively undermining post-quantum cryptography that could withstand codebreaking in the next computing era</a>.</p><p>To be sure, criminals do use encrypted devices. In the Netherlands, encrypted phones are so commonly used by criminals that they are colloquially known as ‘<a href="https://www.telegraaf.nl/nieuws/1329491/aanslag-op-baas-boeventelefoons">boeventelefoons</a>’ or ‘crook&nbsp;phones’.</p><p>But criminals also drive cars and drink water and ride bicycles, none of which, presumably, should be banned lest a criminal quench their thirst on a long ride. Breaking encryption for everyone is akin to poisoning the village well, to target the one criminal who may or may not be passing&nbsp;through.</p><p>Client-side scanning may not even be technically feasible to enforce, and will open Pandora’s box for undermining safety and security, possibly worldwide.</p><p>This in spite of the fact governments and police departments already have many tools in their arsenal to pursue criminals who are abusing encryption, as<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/04/24/crooks-mistaken-bet-on-encrypted-phones"> a recent sting targeting the EncroChat encrypted chat server leading to thousands of criminal cases against drug dealers across Europe&nbsp;showed</a>.</p><p>It is difficult not to reach the conclusion that, rather than for the purposes of fighting crime, these renewed attacks are actually about normalising bulk surveillance — and not only that, but outsourcing the task to corporations like social media companies, while criminalising the pushback.</p> The next privacy&nbsp;paradigm <p>“Mass surveillance by governments and corporations will become normal and expected this decade and people will increasingly turn to new products and services to protect themselves from surveillance. The biggest consumer technology successes of this decade will be in the area of privacy.”</p><p>This quote is not by an activist or a community organiser or a cypherpunk coder. It was<a href="https://avc.com/2020/01/what-will-happen-in-the-2020s/"> from the prominent venture capitalist Fred Wilson on 1 January&nbsp;2020</a>.</p><p>Figures like Wilson, Nym investors a16z, and multibillion Silicon Valley corporations like Apple all understand that people want their private communications to remain private just as they would in the physical&nbsp;world.</p><p>The goal of Nym is privacy for everyone. Nym addresses the network-layer privacy problem of the internet — that all communications online, even via privacy-enhanced applications, bleed metadata which is all extremely revealing when collected en masse, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded#section/2">just as the NSA&nbsp;did.</a></p><p>Already, the Web 2.0 data privacy market is thriving. <a href="https://www.precedenceresearch.com/virtual-private-network-market">The global VPN market alone is projected to be worth US$358 billion by 2032</a>. Fortune Business Insights<a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/data-privacy-software-market-105420"> expects the value of the worldwide data privacy market to reach US$30 billion by&nbsp;2030</a>.</p><p>But as the internet evolves into a more decentralised model that shakes off monopolies and the surveillance economy of Web 2.0, there is an enormous opportunity to swing the doors open to a new era of innovation — when the legacy problems of the public internet, such as that leaky network layer, are&nbsp;solved.</p><p>Now’s the time. Even with the current regulatory attacks on E2E, encryption is in a golden&nbsp;age.</p><p>This is largely due to Web3 and the spark of interest it has created in complex cryptographic innovation, from <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/sphinx-tl-dr-the-data-packet-that-can-anonymize-bitcoin-and-the-internet-18d152c6e4dc">Sphinx</a> to <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/press-release-nym-unveils-zero-knowledge-anonymous-credentials-zk-nyms-at-sxsw-6d56bd31802a">zero-knowledge proofs, as pioneered by</a> <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Proof%20Systems/The_Knowledge_Complexity_Of_Interactive_Proof_Systems.pdf">Shafi Goldwasser</a>. These are mostly based on cryptographic inventions from 30 to 40 years ago that have only now become operational or usable and are at last in the hands of ordinary&nbsp;people.</p><p>Just as the creators of that little TLS lock icon may not have foreseen the explosion in ecommerce, there is a world of invention waiting to flourish off the back of these cryptographic advances, with uses that none of us could have imagined. Who knows what’s coming next — provided the hard-won right to encryption is not ceded, not now, when it’s more important than&nbsp;ever.</p><p><a href="https://www.globalencryption.org/2023/10/global-encryption-day-2023-statement/">Nym is a proud signatory of this year’s Global Encryption Day open letter</a> to governments and the private sector, to reject efforts to undermine encryption and instead pursue policies that enhance, strengthen, and promote use of strong encryption to protect people everywhere.</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/what-has-encryption-ever-done-for-us-43b033527068">What has encryption ever done for us?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The hype of web3 in marketing has entered the chat. More and more businesses from various industries turn towards leveraging web3 opportunities within their marketing campaigns. To put this into reality, so has the <a href="https://www.glossy.co/beauty/how-loreal-is-gearing-up-for-the-metaverse/">L’Oréal Group</a> utilised the variety of web3 in several of their latest marketing campaigns, especially the metaverse, gamification as well as NFT drops. As more companies seek innovative ways to connect with audiences, the marketing department often takes the lead in experimenting with these modern approaches. Let’s dive in and explore what web3 means for the future of marketing.</p>



 Traditional vs. Web3 Marketing: Effectiveness&nbsp; 



<p>In the dynamic landscape of marketing, two distinct paradigms emerge: web3 marketing and traditional marketing. Web3 marketing harnesses cutting-edge technologies like blockchain to empower users with greater control over their digital presence. In contrast, traditional marketing relies on established channels and centralisation. Web3 marketing is an unchartered field with creative means of disrupting traditional marketing models. The characteristics of web3 marketing are (logically) close to what benefits web3 can offer in general:</p>



 
 Decentralisation  



 Transparency  



 Tokenisation  



 Community  



 Ownership  
 



<p>Especially decentralisation is the pillar that differentiates web3 marketing from traditional marketing practices. Decentralisation is giving individuals control over their data. This shift creates a cooperative and mutually beneficial environment, strengthening the bond between brands and consumers.</p>







<p>When evaluating the effectiveness of web3 marketing in both the short and long term, one key aspect stands out: customer loyalty. Ultimately, it’s the bedrock of long-term success in web3 marketing. Without a loyal customer base, your marketing endeavors lack purpose. While many aspects of web3 may currently seem like mere buzzwords, the cultivation of a strong community sets apart effective web3 marketing from fleeting traditional campaigns (through e.g., print, radio, TV, or social media), as the latter often yield only short-term results. By embracing the user-centric essence of Web3 technologies, businesses can lay the foundation for long-lasting effectiveness. This approach enables them to cultivate trust and engagement with their consumer base, and forge meaningful connections with their target audience, ultimately leading to sustainable marketing success in the long run. One of many ways to achieve this is through, e.g., the introduction of loyalty programs, to keep customers hooked and committed.</p>



 Community-centricity: Reinvented brand-customer power dynamics 



 The community 



<p>“Commonality is a purpose, meets frequency of touch” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3qu5KQJGCs">Swan Sit – web3 developer</a>). Establishing meaningful connections between a brand and its customers is a fundamental objective in marketing. This involves not only targeting customers who align with the brand’s values but also striving for maximum customer engagement. What sets web3 marketing apart is its participatory nature, where customers are not only part of a group but actively engage within that collective. Furthermore, the notion of tangible value comes into play, as the community can receive incentives or rewards from the brand they support, fostering a sense of pride in being part of that specific community. How these incentives could look like, is touched upon later in the article (see NFTs).</p>



<p>Navigating the integration of web3 into your marketing practices may encounter resistance from existing communities that are resistant to change. To overcome potential backlash, open and transparent communication is essential. Engage with your community, address their concerns, and emphasise how the shift to web3 benefits them. Demonstrating a clear understanding of their needs and a commitment to preserving what they value can help ease the transition. Additionally, gradual implementation and education about the advantages of web3 can mitigate resistance and pave the way for a smoother transition, ultimately ensuring the long-term success of your brand’s evolution.</p>



 New power dynamics  



<p>In today’s evolving landscape, we can witness a shift in power dynamics, where the consumer takes a central stage and wields a more significant influence on brand decisions. This represents a stark departure from the traditional paradigm where brands held the upper hand, often due to information imbalances. Web3 technology is a game-changer in this context, offering the potential to rebalance these dynamics. What’s particularly noteworthy is the active involvement of brands in these online communities, signifying a fundamental transformation in how businesses approach marketing.</p>



<p>In this new era, understanding your audience and constructing strategies tailored to their preferences and behaviours becomes paramount. It’s a shift towards a more consumer-centric approach, where the community’s voice plays a crucial role in shaping brand decisions and forging stronger, mutually beneficial relationships.</p>



<p>Web3 technology, thanks to its transparent and authentic nature, helps build trust between brands and consumers. Using blockchain, brands can provide proof of where their products come from, their authenticity, and their sustainability, giving consumers the information they need to make informed decisions. In this context, deceptive marketing practices struggle to gain traction, highlighting how important transparency and authenticity are in web3 marketing. This shift represents a significant departure from traditional marketing, fostering a more genuine and accountable connection between brands and their audiences.</p>



 The web3 marketing trends 



<p>Web3 marketing allows for various new trends, which enrich ways of doing marketing:&nbsp;</p>



 
 NFTs 



 Virtual experiences 



 Decentralised (social media) platforms  
 



 NFTs 



<p>A Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is a one-of-a-kind digital asset, which replicates real-life items in the form of e.g., art or music and can be sold or bought online. NFTs have gained popularity as a means for brands to enter the web3 marketing space, and hold the promise of serving as valuable bridges between brands and their communities.</p>



<p>NFTs serve a dual purpose:</p>



 
 NFTs can expand the current audience of the brand, and reel those in, that show a clear interest in the web3 space.&nbsp; 



 Additionally, they can also be harnessed for branding and communication strategies. Businesses can use NFTs as a means to incentivise their fans and followers. Within the NFT ecosystem, the range of possibilities is vast: this includes providing discounts, delivering rewarding products, or crafting unique digital items exclusively available to members of the NFT community. 
 



<p>To put this into reality, <a href="https://raritysniper.com/news/adidas-tokenproof-partnership-to-reward-loyal-nft-holders/">Adidas</a> has explored web3 marketing through NFTs. They recently collaborated with Tokengate, where an NFT loyalty program grants access to exclusive Adidas sneakers. Furthermore, Adidas has also teamed up with the Doodles collection and had a partnership with Pharrell &amp; Adidas for an exclusive Samba sneaker drop.</p>



 Virtual experiences 



<p>One of the major trends within web3 marketing revolves around creating virtual experiences, primarily through the metaverse or Virtual Reality (VR). The core concept of such, in a marketing sense, is to offer a fluid experience that seamlessly bridges the gap between the physical and virtual worlds. This enables users to engage with both one another and digital elements in real time, soaking up the person into the action. As previously mentioned, consumers are part of a brand experience, giving them a sense of belonging to the particular brand, as well as active participation in the experience. This emotional side of marketing can often be more important than the actual physical product being sold.</p>



<p>In November of 2021, Nike solidified its position in the nascent metaverse with the launch of <a href="https://www.nike.com/kids/nikeland-roblox">Nikeland</a>, a branded virtual interactive space, marking a significant step in blending sales, marketing, and gaming.</p>



 Decentralised (social media) platforms  



<p>Worries regarding privacy and the handling of personal data have surged, and the demand for replacing platforms is growing. Think of web3 as the rebel of the internet world, challenging the status quo. It’s all about giving you, the user, the reins to control your online experience. Unlike those traditional social media giants that hoard your data on their servers, web3 rides on blockchain technology, creating decentralised networks where you are the data owner. Privacy, anonymity, security, and ownership are redefined in web3 (social media) marketing, creating a more trustworthy digital ecosystem.</p>



 Conclusion: Embrace the shift  



<p>As we navigate the evolving landscape of marketing, it’s crucial for brands to adapt and embrace the shift towards integrating web3 into their practices. This means staying true to your brand’s core values while modifying your existing products or services to align with the futuristic space. In this context, experimentation is not an option; it’s a necessity. Embracing web3 in your marketing strategies is the path forward to ensure your brand remains relevant and competitive in an ever-changing digital world.</p>

<p>Nearly all of our electricity is generated from heat powering a steam turbine. Historically, this energy conversion has been achieved through burning wood or fossil fuels. However, while these sorts of reactions release a large amount of chemical energy, they are nothing compared to the energy of a nuclear reaction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here is the specific energy, or the amount of energy (megajoules) per kilogram, in common fuel types. As you can see, nuclear reactions generate an enormous amount of it—nearly 1.8 million times the energy from burning gasoline.</p>
<p>Effectively harnessing nuclear energy does require sophisticated engineering in the form of power plants, but, once online, nothing can beat them in terms of efficiency— a nuclear power plant can <a href="https://liftoff.energy.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/20230320-Liftoff-Advanced-Nuclear-vPUB-0329-Update.pdf">generate over</a> 57,000 MWh/acre compared to solar at 200 MWh/acre, or a natural gas plant at 1,000 MWh/acre. For further perspective, a single reactor can power over 1 million homes with over 90% uptime. In fact, our existing, and largely paid off, nuclear fleet also produces the cheapest baseload electrical power at <a href="https://www.lazard.com/research-insights/2023-levelized-cost-of-energyplus/">around $30/MWh</a>. And because nuclear energy doesn’t involve hydrocarbon combustion, it generates power without producing carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
<p>However, critics often argue that nuclear power is unsafe or unsustainable, citing fears about potential accidents and the accumulation of nuclear waste. These concerns are largely unfounded and reveal a misunderstanding about advancements in nuclear technology. Nonetheless, they have resulted in a state of affairs where new nuclear reactors are exceedingly rare in the United States and, thanks largely to onerous regulations, typically take many years and cost billions of dollars to complete.</p>
<p>For example: The reactor <a href="https://www.georgiapower.com/company/news-center/2023-articles/vogtle-unit-3-goes-into-operation.html">Vogtle 3</a> recently went online in Georgia, becoming the first newly built nuclear power plant to generate power in the United States since 1996. The project also took 7 years longer than expected and is estimated to cost more than $30 billion, once its sister reactor, Vogtle 4, is fully online—more than twice the original projection.</p>
<p>The baggage around nuclear power largely stems from an inaccurate, almost mystical notion of how it works. In reality, contemporary nuclear power plants boast exceptional safety records and produce astonishingly minimal waste relative to their immense energy output. Additionally, their compact footprint allows for versatile placement: They don’t require areas with ample sun or wind, are dispatchable when needed, and realistically could be placed on-site at particularly important facilities as a steady supply of clean power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if we’re going to normalize nuclear power as a reliable and well-understood energy source, it’s essential to understand how we’ve ended up in our current situation. It’s also important to recognize that although much of this post focuses on large-scale nuclear fission reactors—because that’s what have been delivering civilian power for the past several decades—smaller, more modular reactors will likely play a major role going forward, perhaps as a means to address more local, and even hyper-local, energy needs.</p>
  The current state of affairs: Lots of nuclear, (almost) none of it new 
<p>The <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/nuclear/us-nuclear-industry.php">United States</a> actually gets about 20% of its electricity from nuclear fission, and we operate around 20% of the world’s approximately 450 reactors. You might think Japan or France, or even China, are beating us in reactor count; nope, the United States is the largest nuclear power. In fact, we generate nearly double the amount of energy from our fleet than even France, which gets up to 70% of its electricity from fission. We’ve also gotten very good at operating reactors without incident, increasing our capacity factor, or uptime, to more than <a href="https://www.ans.org/news/article-183/us-nuclear-capacity-factors-resiliency-and-new-realities/">90%</a> (France is only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_France#:~:text=Nuclear%20power%20in%20France%20has,the%202020%2D2021%20operating%20years.">around 75%</a>).</p>
<p>The problem: We largely stopped building new reactors in the 1980s. Today, our nuclear fleet is among the oldest in the world, with an average reactor age of approximately 40 years. There are complex reasons for this, but at a high level, the success of nuclear power is much more about project management, financing, and policy than it is cutting-edge engineering or safety. We already know how to build plants and safely operate reactors; we just need to get better at reducing construction hurdles and executing on new reactor deployment.</p>
<p>Our nuclear rollout peaked in the 1970s during the oil crisis—President Nixon championed “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220418181812/https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-nation-about-policies-deal-with-the-energy-shortages">Project Independence</a>,” which aimed to build 1,000 nuclear reactors by 2000. Interest in nuclear energy was at an all-time high; even France was onboard with their similar “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_France#Messmer_Plan">Messmer Plan</a>.” However, while France went through with its plan, the United States did not.</p>
<p>The “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNP-3_and_WNP-5">Whoops</a>” disaster is a good starting point to understand what happened. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Northwest">Washington Public Power Supply System</a> (WPPSS) began construction on five nuclear reactors in 1973. Though these reactors were similar designs, they were not standardized. Different construction crews put together different parts from different suppliers. Naturally, this led to dramatic cost overruns and delays, and only one unit was ever completed. The steelman argument is that WPPSS wanted to figure out which one worked best, but they never even got that far.</p>
 <p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421516300106">Source</a></p> 
<p>And then, in the 1980s, the overnight cost (i.e., the cost to build “over a single night,” or ignoring interest rates) and the time to build new plants increased dramatically. In 1979, we had Three Mile Island, and in 1986, there was Chernobyl—this was a rocky time for public perception of nuclear power. Naturally, <a href="https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2022/05/who-killed-nuclear-energy-and-how-to-revive-it/">environmentalists and regulators stepped in</a>.</p>
<p>Author and engineer Brian Potter has an excellent <a href="https://progress.institute/nuclear-power-plant-construction-costs/#what-does-it-cost-to-build-nuclear-power">essay</a> digging into this issue, but there are a few key points I’ll focus on.</p>
<p>If you were to break down the price of building a new reactor, you’d recognize that indirect costs—that is, for services and financing, not materials—make up the largest proportion. From the 1980s onward, the number of expensive personnel, like engineers, inspectors, managers, and consultants, was overhauled to meet rising regulatory scrutiny. Moreover, regulators would often force design changes mid-construction to meet a newly passed standard, like protecting reactors from potential <a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20100823_RL34331_689c7d5f38295381233c76ec519f6aca0bff1712.pdf">9/11-like aircraft impacts</a>.</p>
 <p><a href="https://liftoff.energy.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/20230320-Liftoff-Advanced-Nuclear-vPUB-0329-Update.pdf">Source</a></p> 
<p>Whatever the case, in the United States today, new-build nuclear power plants cost over $10,000 per kilowatt. The <a href="https://liftoff.energy.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/20230320-Liftoff-Advanced-Nuclear-vPUB-0329-Update.pdf">Department of Energy estimates</a> this rate will need to drop to around $3,600 per kilowatt before nuclear power can really scale, so for a 1 gigawatt plant, we’d want to aim for about $3.6 billion in construction costs compared with the current cost of about $10 billion. Furthermore, potential customers, like utilities, are unlikely to invest in nuclear reactors if they’re continually over budget, delayed, or <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/02/06/south-caroline-green-new-deal-south-carolina-nuclear-energy/">entirely abandoned</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A strict regulatory environment is a core reason why first-of-a-kind reactor construction is very expensive, but there are other areas of improvement that are within a developer’s control. For example, Westinghouse’s<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-toshiba-accounting-westinghouse-nucle/how-two-cutting-edge-u-s-nuclear-projects-bankrupted-westinghouse-idUSKBN17Y0CQ">&nbsp;miscalculation</a> with prefabricated part timelines, inexperienced construction crews, and misjudging known regulatory hurdles led to Vogtle 3’s pyrrhic victory. They weren’t even done with the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/vogtles-troubles-bring-us-nuclear-challenge-into-focus-2023-08-24/">design before they started building</a>, leading to inevitable changes after long lead-time items were already in development.</p>
  The tides are turning in favor of nuclear energy 
<p>But after decades of stagnation, there’s good news.</p>
<p>First, future reactors don’t need to be this expensive. The Department of Energy <a href="https://liftoff.energy.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/20230320-Liftoff-Advanced-Nuclear-vPUB-0329-Update.pdf">identifies experience</a> building the same reactor design as being a core area for cost reductions, largely from declining labor costs associated with better planning. We should certainly encourage EPC firms that worked on Vogtle to share expertise or align themselves with new project proposals. Learning curves do exist in nuclear power, we just need to be smarter about achieving them (and it seems like the <a href="https://web.mit.edu/kshirvan/www/research/ANP193%20TR%20CANES.pdf">next AP1000 under construction</a>, the same model reactor and also built at Vogtle, is on that path).</p>
<p>We know it’s possible at a massive scale, too. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Verde_Nuclear_Generating_Station#History">Palo Verde Nuclear Power Station</a>, our nation’s largest power plant, with generating capacity at nearly 4 GW, was built in the middle of the Arizona desert using treated sewage water for cooling. What’s more, construction occurred during the Three Mile Island incident in 1979, and it still was completed in 12 years for around $12 billion in today’s dollars, putting it at around $3000/kW. We absolutely can build nuclear plants cheaply. A tight partnership between regulators, reactor designers, and EPC firms directly led to the success of Palo Verde.</p>
<p>Depending on the size of the reactor, different use cases make sense (see examples below) —some of which can be constructed much more quickly and cost-effectively than the traditional large reactors we normally think of.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While the table above includes nanoreactors and microreactors, there does not appear to be a unanimous definition here. Some people use the term “SMR” to describe anything under 300 MWe, but it’s arguably more useful to draw some distinctions. Conceptually, you can think of SMRs as small power plants with mass-manufactured parts, whereas microreactors have the additional benefit of being small enough to be carried by a truck. For their part, nanoreactors are mostly for research purposes today. In fact, many top universities, like <a href="https://neup.inl.gov/SitePages/University%20Reactors.aspx">MIT and North Carolina State</a>, have tiny nuclear reactors on campus.</p>
<p>Over the years, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the body overseeing our nation’s civilian nuclear industry, has developed a series of frameworks to address the evolving landscape of the nuclear industry. <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part050/full-text.html">Part 50</a> represents the traditional set of regulations, primarily formulated for the licensing, construction, and operation of the earlier generations of commercial nuclear power plants. As the industry advanced and newer reactor designs emerged, the NRC recognized the need for a more streamlined process.</p>
<p>This led to <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part052/full-text.html">Part 52</a>, which introduced the concept of combined licenses for both construction and operation in 1989. Moreover, it employed “design certifications,” an approach allowing multiple plant applications to reference a single certified design, thus minimizing redundancy and accelerating the approval process. Cynically, this combined licensing presents challenges when changes do need to be made to the underlying design, like when the NRC required Westinghouse to update the AP1000. This directly led to <a href="https://www.ans.org/news/article-1646/root-cause-of-vogtle-and-vc-summer-delays/">project delays</a>. Today, reactors can choose whether to be licensed under Part 50 or Part 52.</p>
<p>You can see a visualization of these processes below:</p>

<p>To make way for advanced reactors, the NRC saw the necessity for an even more adaptable and modernized regulatory approach. Enter <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-reactors/advanced/rulemaking-and-guidance/part-53.html">Part 53</a>, a set of regulations tailored specifically for the licensing of advanced nuclear reactors. Part 53 is still in the drafting period and is expected to be complete in 2025. However, <a href="https://thebreakthrough.org/blog/the-nuclear-regulatory-commissions-break-with-reality#:~:text=As%20we%20have%20written%20elsewhere,useless%20burdens%20on%20new%20reactors.">it remains unclear</a> if this new set of regulations will result in a truly more streamlined approach.</p>
<p>The NRC is also attempting to speed up the review process for new reactors by increasing licensing <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-105997.pdf">review staff</a>. (Although, the company going through the approval process also pays an <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/licensing/general-fee-questions.pdf">hourly rate to review staff</a>, which seems…<a href="https://x.com/Dr_A_Stein/status/1708947405649928192?s=20">misaligned</a>.) Outside of the NRC, the DoE are strong supporters of <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/advanced-reactor-demonstration-program">advanced nuclear power</a> and, as explained further below, can actually accelerate certain reactor designs that aren’t (yet) used to generate energy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, though, public sentiment toward nuclear energy is evolving as more people realize its potential to provide carbon-free, reliable energy—even <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/california-diablo-canyon-nuclear-plant-open-newsom-bill/629727/">Governor Gavin Newsom in progressive California provided a loan</a> to extend the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant. Yes, the NRC adding regulatory hurdles mid-project will always lead to cost overruns and project delays, but many of those hurdles stem from <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/08/30/1119904819/nuclear-power-environmentalists-california-germany-japan">public concern</a> that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/18/growing-share-of-americans-favor-more-nuclear-power/">appears to be waning</a>.</p>
  What about safety? 
<p>While sentiment is shifting in favor of nuclear energy, it’s not out of the woods yet. Many people still have fears around safety and, whatever their veracity, where there are safety concerns, there are regulations. However, nuclear power plants are much safer than many people realize (<a href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/7-things-simpsons-got-wrong-about-nuclear">despite what you might’ve seen on The Simpsons</a>). Below, we dispel two major myths.</p>
 Radiation and nuclear waste 
<p>When it comes to nuclear power plant radiation, the <a href="https://jackdevanney.substack.com/p/alara">ALARA</a> (As Low as “Reasonably” Achievable) framework insists on reducing nearly all possible radiation leakage (there is, however, no clear definition of what reasonable actually means). Underlying this is the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6343444/#:~:text=The%20linear%20no%2Dthreshold%20(LNT,model%20for%20radiation%20risk%20assessment.">Linear No-Threshold model</a>, which assumes there is <a href="https://jackdevanney.substack.com/p/lnt-is-nonsense">no safe dose of radiation</a>. The problem is that limiting any chance of exposure requires excessive amounts of engineering considerations, and there is significant evidence <a href="https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/59/12/1786">against </a>the idea that there is no safe amount of radiation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Safety” reasoning like this <a href="https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2022/05/who-killed-nuclear-energy-and-how-to-revive-it/">does not exist in other sectors</a> where humans also might be exposed to higher levels of radiation, such as simply building your home at a high altitude or flying on a plane. Radiation is everywhere; even our bodies emit low levels of gamma radiation. Reactor designers understand the types of radiation that fission reactions produce, and already go to great lengths to limit meaningful leakage.</p>
 <p>There are several types of ionizing radiation that present different safety challenges when it comes to nuclear reactions.</p> 
<p>Many people are also concerned about what to do with the radioactive waste that’s generated by fission plants. This deserves a little more explanation, because it’s an issue that can kill nuclear projects before they even begin. High-level, or particularly troublesome, nuclear waste contains two categories of fission products.</p>
<p>The first includes the relatively short-lived fission products, including strontium-90, cesium-137, and iodine-131. There is also cobalt-60, the product of a stray neutron colliding with cobalt-59 (via neutron activation) that is found within the special steel used in many reactor walls. Cobalt-60 has a short half-life of approximately 5 years, but emits powerful gamma radiation. Collectively, fission radioisotope products undergo radioactive decay, but the radiation can be easily managed for their relatively short radioactive periods (and can make great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_battery">batteries</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second, more controversial, type of fission products are transuranic (or heavier than uranium) elements that are leftover in spent fuel. A fuel’s “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnup">burnup</a>” determines the amount of fuel consumed, with higher burnup indicating greater fuel efficiency. However, changes in burnup can also lead to changes in waste composition, including the levels of transuranic elements. The formation of transuranic waste occurs when some uranium nuclei absorb a neutron but do not split, yielding a heavier, unstable element. This process is influenced by specific conditions within the reactor, but at a high level, is a matter of probability relating to the fundamentals of nuclear reactions. Resulting products include radioisotopes of elements like plutonium, americium, and curium that have half-lives of thousands of years or more (though most of this radiation is released in the <a href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/introduction/physics-of-nuclear-energy.aspx">first couple of hundred years</a>.)</p>
<p>However sinister this sounds, the reality is that we know how to shield from radiation, and the amount of this waste is not a significant concern, particularly relative to its immense power output. A 1 gigawatt nuclear power plant, capable of powering over 1 million homes annually, uses approximately 25 metric tons of fuel per year (uranium is dense; this is around 600 gallons in volume). Of this, only around 3% is converted into fission products, with the majority of the remaining spent fuel being directly recyclable (further discussed below). In contrast, a coal plant with equivalent output consumes over 3 million metric tons of coal annually, emitting over 13 billion pounds of CO2 in the process.</p>
<p>What to do with long-lived transuranic waste is indeed an important question, but storing it today is largely an over-exaggerated issue. Nearly all waste at American nuclear plants is stored on-site or nearby, first in pools, and then in <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/waste/spent-fuel-storage/dry-cask-storage.html">dry casks</a>—and these are perfectly safe to be around (again: we know how to shield against radiation). There is a small amount of this waste, and nuclear plants already have the space, security, and safety systems to readily <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/ops-experience/tritium/plant-info.html">handle it</a>.</p>
<p>While there have been attempts at a centralized storage facility, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_Mountain_nuclear_waste_repository">Yucca Mountain</a> in Nevada, no such place exists today in the United States. The reason Yucca Mountain hasn’t been utilized stems from a combination of factors, notably political opposition, legal challenges, and the ever-pervasive “Not In My Back Yard” (NIMBY) sentiment. Despite the site being deemed scientifically sound for waste storage, these obstacles have prevented its operation. In a more practical sense, some even view it as unnecessary at this time given how straightforward storing waste on-site actually is. Long term, however, scaling domestic nuclear power will likely require a more centralized solution.</p>
<p>Many European nations are ahead of the U.S. when it comes to nuclear “waste.” France processes spent fuel to extract the remaining uranium-238, uranium-235, and plutonium-239, then vitrifies (i.e., turns it into glass) and stores what’s left over; this type of spent fuel recycling is known as a closed fuel cycle, and it relies upon the use of <a href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/fuel-recycling/mixed-oxide-fuel-mox.aspx">MOX</a> as fissile fuel, which contains a blend of uranium and plutonium extracted from “waste.” And across Europe, there are even efforts to keep spent fuel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_geological_repository">deep underground</a>. Perhaps most excitingly, there are known methods to transmute fission products or transuranics into less troublesome radioisotopes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeder_reactor">breed new fuel</a>, or even burn waste directly using fast fission. There are also fuel cycles in development using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium_fuel_cycle">thorium-232</a> as fertile material to breed fissile uranium-233 within the reactor, instead of starting with uranium-235. All or some of these solutions will be increasingly compelling as the United States builds more nuclear power plants.</p>
 Nuclear meltdowns 
<p>Another popular fear is that of a nuclear meltdown, like what happened at Chernobyl (sort of). A meltdown can occur when a reactor’s cooling system fails to maintain the fuel rods at safe temperatures, leading to the fuel melting. In pressurized water reactors (PWRs), the primary coolant (water) is kept under high pressure to prevent it from boiling. If this pressure is lost or if there’s insufficient cooling, the water can turn to steam, reducing its cooling efficiency. This can cause the confinement materials to melt and explode if pressurized systems burst. It is this combination of events that can lead to radioactive fuel breaching shielding structures and being exposed (not good).&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, modern reactor designs have inherent passive safety mechanisms that do not depend on externally powered coolant systems that could fail in a disaster. For example, modern designs use the natural <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1523/ML15230A043.pdf">circulation of fluids instead of externally-powered pumps</a>. The Westinghouse AP1000, one of the most modern PWR designs in service, is <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML0305/ML030510639.pdf">assessed to be 100 times safer</a> than previous iterations that were already incredibly resilient. And newer reactor types, some of which should be able to achieve NRC approval in the near future, use different fuels, leverage powerful software to eliminate human error, and have even more advanced passive safety mechanisms to prevent meltdowns.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.radiantnuclear.com/">Radiant</a>, for example, is building a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-temperature_gas_reactor">gas-cooled reactor</a> that utilizes TRISO fuel pellets. These pellets encapsulate each particle of fuel, effectively trapping the fission products and making spent fuel movement easier. Moreover, Radiant’s reactor uses helium as its coolant. As a chemically inert gas, helium mitigates many of the risks associated with water-based coolants, like corrosion or boiling. Furthermore, due to its low neutron absorption, helium avoids some of the radiological challenges that must be accounted for in other reactors. It can also get very hot, and thus very energetically <a href="https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Carnot_efficiency">efficient</a>.</p>
  How nuclear progress is unfolding 
<p>Despite the relative safety of modern nuclear reactors and waste-management techniques, we likely won’t see the levels of nuclear energy we need until a couple of major changes happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One is that the NRC approval process, and access to highly-enriched uranium fuel, becomes more efficient, thus, making it more appealing for companies looking to make the significant investment required for meaningful advances. The good news on this front, as noted above, is that the agency actually appears to be trying to streamline and expedite the approval process for advanced reactor designs, and is aware of the industry’s concerns about <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/haleu-availability-program">fuel</a> and mid-construction changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At present, there’s also a catch-22 situation: The NRC requires data to determine a reactor’s safety before granting approval, yet one cannot operate a reactor to gather this data without said approval. While fixing this process is an ongoing effort, startups aren’t just sitting on their heels waiting. <a href="https://www.nuscalepower.com/en/news/press-releases/2023/nuscale-power-signs-agreement-with-doosan-enerbility-and-export-import-bank-of-korea">Some U.S. startups are opting</a> to build their first reactors outside of the United States, in countries with less regulation and a more dire need for energy innovation. Others might begin life inside a university or national lab as small reactors where, especially if they’re not being used to generate energy, different paths to approval present themselves. If initial test reactors are at a government lab, for example, there is the possibility of going through the DoE for initial testing approval rather than the NRC. Naturally, the DoE is more progressive when it comes to new designs, and these early tests under DoE jurisdiction accelerate NRC approval.</p>
<p>Another method is to go through the military. The United States Navy, in particular, operates hundreds of small reactors and has been building them for decades. For things like aircraft carriers and submarines, the Navy values the strategic advantage of having a longer operational window without needing to go to port (in fact, it would probably be cheaper to <a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/weapons/RL33946.pdf">run them on fossil fuels</a>). When it comes to bases, most of the military uses diesel, which, by the time it reaches far away locations, can have an internalized cost of <a href="https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2010/4/1/2010april-how-much-does-the-pentagon-pay-for-a-gallon-of-gas">hundreds of dollars a gallon</a>. Nuclear reactors minimize supply chain issues and offer energy security (and, of course, the military knows how to transport radioactive material). Importantly, the military is also able to tear through regulatory red tape when it comes to national security-related projects, potentially reducing the time it takes to turn the reactor on and generate data, and, thus, receive NRC approval for civil power generation.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, what matters most is the commercial viability of new reactors: Even if they’re approved, will someone buy them? There are strong economies of scale when it comes to large nuclear power plants, so competing directly in the wholesale markets for grid power can be difficult until newer firms can drive down unit costs.</p>
<p>The strategy for many startups is to build smaller plants first, taking advantage of more scalable manufacturing practices to iterate and drive down costs. This is the core principle behind the rise of SMRs and microreactors. These smaller projects might be underwritten without ridiculously high financing costs, making them far more appealing to utilities and other buyers considering investment in new power-generating assets. Typically, these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_IV_reactor">generation IV </a>reactors run at higher temperatures with more advanced fuels to optimize for power output, fuel efficiency, and safety, without increasing size or costs.</p>
<p>Beyond the military, there are commercial use cases that demand similar levels of power reliability. For example, many factories, industrial parks, and data centers seek a stable supply of clean power at a reasonable price. In fact, many <a href="https://pvbuzz.com/top-5-largest-corporate-ppas/">firms are paying a premium</a> for it, entering longer-term power purchase agreements, or PPAs, to reduce volatility. Because reactors have such high upfront costs, however, they must be operating nearly 24/7 to break even. This might be hard to do profitably in a competitive electricity market, but being always-on is a selling point for many PPA customers. As price volatility, clean energy mandates, and rolling blackouts increase—as well as an uptick in power-intensive data center workloads like training AI models—this use case becomes increasingly important.</p>
<p>A new generation of reactors present strong promise, many starting small and refining designs with unit prices that utilities can stomach. They are also, by design, standardized, making learning curves readily achievable—and it seems like <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/microsoft-cloud-hiring-to-implement-global-small-modular-reactor-and-microreactor-strategy-to-power-data-centers/">data centers</a> and <a href="https://www.power-eng.com/nuclear/duke-energy-proposes-site-for-new-nuclear-in-north-carolina/#gref">utilities</a> are interested. Ultimately, the companies that are able to receive approval, convince customers to make orders, and deploy those reactors on time and on budget will be able to secure energy market share, regardless of reactor design.</p>
<p>We need to be mass manufacturing nuclear power plants on the scale of hundreds of gigawatts. The best time to build a vast, civil nuclear fleet was 50 years ago. The second best time is now.</p>

<p>A new suite of modern, accessible tools have made it easier than ever for creators to ideate, produce, and share their work with the world: from using AI-powered platforms to jumpstart an idea to software that manages payroll and insurance for production. New technologies enable creatives to not only produce work and run their businesses, but also break down roadblocks that have historically stifled the ability to remain independent. Artists and creators now have more opportunities to work on their own terms without corporate capital, obligations or oversight. This allows them to retain creative and financial ownership of their brand and IP, an increasingly important part of fostering authentic relationships with communities, fans, and collaborators.</p>
<p>Finding ways to support creatives in every stage of their process is critical to pushing this industry forward. This resonates deeply with the a16z Cultural Leadership Fund (CLF) team as we live at the intersection of culture and technology, connecting the world’s greatest cultural leaders with promising new technology companies. CLF has compiled <a href="https://a16z.com/clf/creator-stack/">The New Creator Stack</a>: a view of companies building at the forefront of creativity and independence. These companies are developing new tools for production, publishing, distribution, community engagement, commerce, and even back office systems: areas we see as the most critical to artist independence.</p>

<p>In 2021, the US Department of Defense spent $142 billion on procurement and $106 billion on developing new technologies (RDT&amp;E) — while global defense spending reached over two trillion dollars. Yet the US and its allies are potentially dangerously wrong-footed by having over-spent on legacy hardware systems (eg aircraft carriers etc) while neglecting what could be the defining battlefield of the future: the control of the radio spectrum, otherwise known as electronic warfare. In a world where societies and markets run on electronics and signals — this is the ultimate defense&nbsp;line.</p><p>Much of electronic warfare is out of sight of the public and media, but since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93U.S._RQ-170_incident">Iran captured and then reverse engineered a sophisticated high-end US UAV</a> using its electronic warfare capabilities — it has become evident just how dangerous these capabilities will become. Since this incident and others like it, the US DoD has made significant investments in electronic warfare capabilities. However these have come from legacy providers, grown through M&amp;A with no cross system or modular capabilities — severely holding back the US’ and NATO’s electronic warfare capabilities. The lack of composability has created a frustration among end users and demands for open standards.</p><p>AnySignal is building open-core radio software for satellite communications, UAVs, and other next generation defense capabilities. The company sits at the core of a more compatible, modular and fast scaling electronic warfare approach.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>In the future, control of radio spectrum will be used to project power instead of aircraft carriers or ICBMs. NATO will continue to make massive investments in this field, but existing defense contractors are not well positioned to deliver what their clients need. A vibrant startup ecosystem, built with open source components that will be maintained long after the company producing the product is gone, will replace slow moving defense prime contractors. The team’s past experience building radio systems at SpaceX &amp; Kepler Communications puts them in a unique position to help define industry standards and open source implementations through their usage of GNU Radio, a widely used, 21 year old, open source project. With this, AnySignal has the potential to provide many of the performance defining components in this emergent ecosystem.</p><p>We are excited to be backing the AnySignal team on their mission to master the radiofrequency (RF) domain through end-to-end solutions that cover communications, radar, navigation, and RF sensing for advanced aircraft, satellites, and national security.

<p>We hear a lot of discussion around the best practices for launching a mobile game, and one particular topic that often comes up is: whether or not to do a soft launch. And if you do soft launch, how can you tell if your game will be successful? Much of the mobile games industry has taken the tactic of soft launching seriously – in September alone, there were more than 100 games soft launched on the Apple App Store and over 600 on the Google Play Store.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>This blog post will explore what a soft launch is and why it can be beneficial for game studios. We’ll also dispel some of the myths that are commonly associated with soft launches and help you figure out if this strategy is right for your game. We’ll also address why there are so many more games soft launched on Google Play (hint: they have more options to support a variety of soft launch strategies).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 What’s a Soft Launch? 
<p>A soft launch (or sometimes “geo test” or “beta”) is when a game is released to a limited number of players before it is released worldwide, usually by releasing only to specific countries. This allows developers to test different aspects of the game, such as the gameplay, graphics, and economy in a real-world environment without the pressure of a full release. Soft launch enables player feedback and metrics which can be used to compare to benchmarks that both <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=5eryjwz3#:~:text=Peer%20group%20benchmarks%20provide%20powerful,volume%20to%20ensure%20relevant%20comparisons">Apple’s iOS App Store</a> and <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/">Google Play</a> offer in their dashboards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are typically two stages of soft launch: alpha and beta.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Alpha is the earlier stage and is often used to test whether the core of the game is working, including the technology and core gameplay loop.&nbsp; 
 Beta is later and is used to test the meta gameplay loop, marketing acquisition, server scalability, and monetization.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Why is soft launch important to consider? Because you only get one shot at a first impression with most of your potential players and you want to make sure the game has the best possible shot at being successful when you launch globally. Mobile gamers are spoiled by choice and have a low propensity to return post-churn. We’ve seen that typically, it is between 5-10x more expensive to acquire a player who already quit than to acquire a new player.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, distribution is one of the biggest challenges in mobile games – if your users don’t retain or monetize, you’ll have trouble scaling your game via organic growth or paid acquisition. By releasing the game in stages, developers can get valuable feedback from players that can help improve the game before it is released to everyone.</p>
 Myths About Soft Launch 
<p>Before we share more perspective on soft launch strategy, we wanted to dispel some common myths:</p>
<p>The country or market chosen for the soft launch will accurately represent how the game will perform worldwide</p>
<p>While it’s important to choose a market that closely aligns with your target demographics, it’s also important to keep in mind that every market is unique and may have different reactions to the game. For example, many developers choose Canada to test how a US launch would perform. In our experience, there are too many variables to accurately simulate a launch in another country, however, retention and monetization metrics compared to other regions can give you some directional understanding of performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soft launch can only be done on mobile platforms like iOS and Android</p>
<p>Though the focus of this post is mobile, a soft launch strategy can also be applied to PC and console games. This can be especially useful for cross platform games to understand the dynamics of players on different platforms, and improve gameplay and performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soft launches are expensive</p>
<p>The investment required for your soft launch is dependent on your goals for soft launch. If you have a strong understanding of your audience, you will be much more likely to target them via organic or paid means in a cost effective way.</p>
<p>You need to soft launch a game for it to succeed</p>
<p>Soft launch is a way to solicit player feedback before a broader global launch, but isn’t necessarily needed to be successful. We believe it is usually better to soft launch, but there are plenty of successful games that went straight to global launch.</p>
<p>Resetting player progress after a soft launch will anger the community</p>
<p>While some players will respond negatively if you reset their progress, many understand that this is the “price of admission” for accessing a game early. As long as you’re upfront with players that the test is limited to a certain number of days, they will understand when the test ends. For example, Supercell recently launched a “Limited Open Beta” to test their game <a href="https://floodrush.supercell.com/en/">Flood Rush</a> <a href="https://floodrush.supercell.com/en/">(</a>ultimately based on soft launch Supercell decided not to release globally). If you’re resetting player progress, it is a best practice to refund players who spend during soft launch (or at a minimum, give them the equivalent value of in-game currency to spend later).</p>
 What Can you Learn from Soft Launch? 
<p>There are a few questions you should seek to answer with a soft launch, though it’s difficult to answer all of these at a high level of fidelity. If you’re resource constrained, you should think about prioritizing your goals based on what’s most important to the team.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Is the game stable/performant?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building a bug-free game is hard, and while your QA team is heroically finding and triaging bugs, there’s nothing like a soft launch to show you where the holes are. Acquiring users at scale from lower-cost geographies is a great way to stress test servers and also get performance data from long-tail devices. There are a TON of lower-spec Android phones that your QA team won’t have and should probably not be purchasing. Some metrics to keep in mind for this sort of testing include: FPS, crash rates/DAU, crashes/crasher, and latency. Google Play recommends monitoring via their <a href="https://play.google.com/console/about/vitals/">Android Vitals Dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>Is the core game fun?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most important part of a game experience is the core loop. It’s the atomic gameplay loop that people will experience over and over and should be HIGHLY repeatable. If a game’s core loop doesn’t work, players will never stick around long enough to hit the meta loops that keep them around long term and can generate revenue. Testing core loops effectively requires getting players in soft launch that simulate your target audience at scale, so targeting that audience is important. On the flip side, you can save some energy/money by remembering you don’t need to target audiences that necessarily monetize or worry about how players are engaging with other parts of the game. Some metrics to keep in mind for core loop testing would be:&nbsp;</p>
 
 First Time User Experience (FTUE) completion rates (Wooga’s game director, Annelie Biernat, recently shared why “<a href="https://www.deconstructoroffun.com/blog/2022/3/27/how-woogas-switchcraft-aced-the-soft-launch#:~:text=Optimizing%20the%20FTUE%20is%20definitely%20worth%20it">Optimizing the FTUE is definitely worth it</a>”)&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 D0 playtime &amp; repeat sessions&nbsp; 
 D1-D7 retention 
 Sessions/day 
 Minutes played/day 
 
<p>Does the game have legs?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your core loop is working, you’ll want to make sure the game is highly retentive. Retention is king, and it’s the most important metric in all of free-to-play. Retention compounds over time and has a large cumulative effect on DAUs. Retention also leads to organic growth – the longer players stick around the more chances they’ll have to tell their friends about the game. Retention also leads to revenue – the more sticky your game is the more likely it is that a player will support the game by monetizing. One key metric to look at is D30 retention, but other metrics are important too including elder system engagement %, DAU/MAU and DAU/WAU. <a href="https://medium.com/googleplaydev/why-focusing-on-tomorrow-brings-back-players-in-the-long-run-e57c51bd3481">Google Play data</a> suggests 50% percentile for top games DAU/WAU = 55% and DAU/MAU = 31%.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ideally you want to make sure your D30 retention is strong enough to stand on its own. Testing D30 retention means that your test will need to run at least 30 days – but to get 30 cohorts of D30 retention your test will have to run at least 60 days! Additionally, since a smaller % of each install cohort will get to D30, you’ll need to work backwards to calculate statistical significance for your install cohorts. Testing D30 retention can be difficult for smaller developers that don’t have the time or resources to get highly statistically significant data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A hack to proxy D30 retention is to look at the ratio of D1:D7:D30 retention – according to Google Play, the Median DAU return is&nbsp; 77%. Looking at the shape of your retention curve can help approximate longer-tail retention.</p>
<p>Will the game generate revenue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately your goal is to create a successful business and to do that you’ll need to generate revenue. Importantly, revenue isn’t just about the money – being able to generate revenue reliably helps you re-invest those dollars back into user acquisition which can help your game grow over time. Many successful mobile games don’t make much of a profit in the first few years of operations. Developers choose to invest in growth for two main reasons: first, network effects from a larger audience can lead to more organic growth. Second, older games have a hard time growing – it’s easier to grow when you have the buzz of a new game (and that new game is featured in the app stores!). After non-linear growth becomes challenging, teams have the option value of taking their foot off the UA pedal and focus instead of revenue optimization/profit maximization.</p>
<p>There isn’t a straightforward playbook on how to test monetization in your game because each game has a different monetization system. The most important signals to understand are:</p>
 
 What % of players convert into becoming payers? 
 Once someone pays, how much do they purchase and how often do they pay? 
 
<p>To get a clean read on those signals, you’ll have to make sure that the players you’re testing against are a representative sample for what you’d expect the target audience in a scaled launch scenario to be. Remember that the % of players that actually pay is typically single digits, which means to get statistically significant data you’ll need to make sure you have enough test players. As a rule, you can expect between 2-5% of your players to be payers (2% for casual games, 5% for midcore), and for 80% of your revenue to come from the top 20% of payers.</p>
<p>Can we grow the game?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, if you know you’ve got a strong core game that retains and monetizes, you’ll still need to ensure the game has a path to sustainable growth. The two primary growth categories are paid and organic and both are important ingredients to any game’s growth story. Stress testing paid growth is a bit easier to do than testing organic growth.</p>
<p>There are several components to testing paid growth. Your ultimate goal is to measure and minimize the cost of acquiring players (your “CPI” or “CAC”). To do this, you can conduct paid user acquisition campaigns and experiment with different targeting strategies, ad creatives, and budgets to determine which ones are most effective at driving player acquisition at the lowest cost. You can also track the long-term engagement and monetization of players acquired through paid campaigns to make sure LTVs are above CPIs. If LTVs don’t exceed CPIs you will be losing money on every paid player you acquire!</p>
<p>If your game is multiplayer, we recommend considering launching on both iOS and Android during soft launch to ensure you have a full understanding of how the network effects across platforms influence retention and organic growth. Brawl Stars, for example, was originally launched on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSVAmf5LCuo">iOS and retention increased once it was launched on Android.</a></p>
<p>Remember, you don’t have to test everything. Choose the testing plan that’s right for your product and timeline. But remember, decide what you want to get out of your soft launch upfront, be clear about the metrics you need to hit to reach the next stage, and be disciplined about holding that bar. The game only gets one shot at a first impression!&nbsp;</p>
 How to Plan a Soft Launch 
<p>There are a few key factors to consider when planning a soft launch. Here’s a checklist to consider:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ultimately, your choices will determine how you balance work and overhead for your team vs. quantity and quality of information from soft launch players.</p>
 Limits of a Soft Launch 
<p>Soft launching can be a valuable tool for game studios, providing insights on the performance and potential success of the game before its worldwide release. But it’s important to keep in mind that there are limitations. By carefully planning and analyzing the results, developers can use soft launches to improve their game and increase its chances for success on a larger scale.</p>
<p>In our experience, there is no way to fully simulate a global launch during soft launch. It is possible to estimate how quickly CPIs in certain regions will saturate and to have an understanding of the shape of your game’s retention curve. However, in soft launch factors like seasonality, network effects across regions &amp; platforms, brand effects of global launch marketing, and platform support are all difficult to fully understand ahead of global launch.</p>
<p>Soft launch should be leveraged to continually improve your game until you are at a point where you can make a go/no go decision. Killing a game in soft launch is difficult, but the option should be on the table if you’re not able to deliver the improvements that you believe are necessary to launch a successful game. Once the game launches the team should be prepared to spend years iterating and improving the game. The passion needs to be there as do the metrics. You will also likely have to scale the team to support ongoing operations including live ops, player support, community, and marketing. Is this a game that you would bet your company on?</p>
<p>Once you are committed to launching, soft launch helps you define your risk tolerance. If based on the metrics, you believe you have a strong product market fit, leaning into launch investment could make sense to maximize the golden cohort. A word of caution, however, if you do not have an understanding of your longer term retention curve (90 days +) you may have later game issues that you have not yet identified. We generally recommend building plans that are flexible and can quickly scale up or down based on performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Conclusion 
<p>We are big believers in getting games into the hands of players as early as possible and iterating based on feedback. To that end, soft launch is an invaluable way to test your game and hypotheses before launching globally. It is incredibly important to have well-defined goals and realistic expectations of the data that soft launch can provide.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Selling into financial institutions (FIs) has long been the end goal for many software-oriented fintech businesses. With massive annual technology budgets and scaled distribution, the largest FIs are the ideal end-buyers. However, a fear of long sales cycles, heavy compliance requirements, and opaque organizational structures preclude many early stage founders from pursuing this go-to-market channel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe, however, these fears are worth tackling, and the current moment is actually an ideal time for fintech businesses to start selling software products into FIs. This is because FIs have long relied on painstaking manual operational processes to accomplish their goals, eschewing technology for human labor. But as investors intensify their scrutiny on companies’ financial performance (including heavily focusing on ROE benchmarks), many FIs are revisiting this approach and looking for more permanent ways to drive operational leverage. In a significant cultural shift, the technology organizations inside these FIs have also started to recognize that not all of their tech products need to be built “in-house.” Meanwhile, FI senior leaders and board members are intrigued by new products like Microsoft 365 Copilot and how generative AI can automate their internal workflows (and improve their bottom lines). Taken as a whole, FIs are at an especially receptive time for greater software adoption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this piece, we aim to demystify the “B2FI” (or “business to financial institution”) GTM motion for fintech companies looking to sell to FIs with lessons and advice from companies like <a href="https://www.sentilink.com/">SentiLink</a>, <a href="https://instabase.com/">Instabase</a>, <a href="https://www.databricks.com/">Databricks</a>, <a href="https://www.novacredit.com/">Nova Credit</a>, and <a href="https://getbuilt.com/">Built Technologies</a>—all of whom have successfully scaled as businesses that sell software into financial institutions. </p>
 The MEDDICC Sales Framework 
<p>To share what we’ve learned from the fintech founders and operators we’ve spoken to about this topic, we have collated their advice under an overarching sales framework known as <a href="https://a16z.com/2016/04/15/sales-forecasting-methodology/#section--8">MEDDICC</a>. This framework, which is frequently leveraged by our GTM team, is a qualification methodology that supports the sales process and can help companies answer internal sales questions such as which customers to go after and how to actually win a deal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By following a consistent approach like MEDDICC, buyers and sellers are more likely to be aligned throughout the entire sales process, and we believe the probability of success thereby increases by an order of magnitude. Keep in mind: this sales framework is not linear, and these steps should be taken in tandem, not sequentially. It should also be employed only after a company has established their <a href="https://a16z.com/2022/09/29/getting-ready-to-move-upmarket/#section--2">ICP</a>.&nbsp; </p>

                 M - Metrics 
         
          <p>When seeking to partner with a financial institution, you will need to provide quantifiable metrics—a clear P&amp;L business case—on how your product can benefit your buyer and what ROI they can expect from purchasing the product. No matter how cutting edge or sophisticated, from a technology perspective, your product might be, you’ll still need to present compelling metrics to get a deal signed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Banks often look for a significant multiple (5-10x) on the value to be delivered vs. the cost of the product, so even before approaching FIs, you need to build an internal case to ensure your product can demonstrate this type of lift.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2029/12/MEDDICC-Naftali-Harris-1200x630-1.png"></a></p>
         
       
           
                 E - Economic Buyer 
         
          <p>To ultimately get a deal signed, it is critical that you&nbsp;simultaneously pursue multiple relationships within different departments at the FI you have targeted. For example, while you certainly need to talk to employees that can help advocate for your product (like the Champion, discussed more in detail below), you must also prioritize getting to know the economic buyer—the person within the FI that actually has access to and can release a company’s dollars to purchase your product; they also make the P&amp;L trade-off decisions. Usually a Chief Information Officer or a Head of Engineering, depending on the organization, the economic buyer is a critical constituent you must win over. (And a surefire way to win over your economic buyer? With compelling metrics, of course!)</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2029/12/MEDDICC-Chase-Gilbert-1200x630-1-1.png"></a></p>
         
       
           
                 D - Decision Criteria 
         
          <p>Decision criteria are the factors by which your product will be judged internally, and the employees who set these criteria are known as user buyers and technical buyers. More specifically, user buyers assess how your product will fit into the FI’s core workflows, while technical buyers ensure that your product will meet the FI’s internal specifications around data privacy, security, and stability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the seller, you will learn the user buyer and technical buyer’s decision criteria during the POV, or Proof Value, demonstration. This is when the buyers ask “does this product really work?” within a given line of business you are selling into. While constituents from a specific line of business typically attend the POV, it can also be used as an opportunity for you to get a headstart in demonstrating the potential value of your product across multiple departments and get other stakeholders across the organization thinking about how your product could solve their own problems (who do you leverage to get other line of business owners to attend the POV? Through your champion!).</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2029/12/MEDDICC-Anant-Bharadwaj-1200x630-2.png"></a></p>
         
       
           
                 D - Decision Process 
         
          <p>If the decision criteria delineates how your product will be judged internally, then the decision process outlines how your customer will evaluate and potentially purchase your solution.This process is typically also uncovered during the POV demonstration and can include the following:</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2029/12/2599-Workstream-Outline-2.png"></a></p>
         
       
           
                 I - Identify Pain 
         
          <p>It is your job as a seller to identify the business pain points your buyer faces—such as reducing fraud, finding new customers to serve, fighting off fintech upstarts, boosting profitability, etc.— so that you can present your product as a solution to that problem. You can use a bottoms-up or top-down approach (or both) to identify these pain points, but eventually you need to converge to a specific line-of-business problem to focus on. For example, if an IT manager within the FI wants to make their data storage and processing capabilities more effective by using your product, it is your job to translate your solution to a bigger business problem that the c-suite is focused on, such as vendor consolidation (to reduce overall costs).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, if you’re able to uncover what’s top of mind for your FI’s executive leadership—such as keeping up with the newest generative AI advancements—you still need to match those concerns to a specific line-of-business owner. For example, a sense of needing to keep up with these technology advancements from leadership can be translated down to a VP of Consumer Finance who needs to grow a consumer banking app while battling fintech upstarts and who may be thinking about using AI products to do so–which your product could help enable.</p>
<p>Leverage your investors/advisors to help uncover that inside baseball for you. At a16z, we have made it a top priority to connect with key decision makers at various financial services institutions; we do this through dinners with our portfolio company CEOs and executives, briefings with line-of-business owners, and demo days. This is a two-way relationship, as we regularly share ideas and innovative companies with FIs in our network, including Goldman Sachs, PNC, Morgan Stanley, American Express, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, another way to identify broad pain points is by working with the innovation groups within FIs—but be wary of those that may want to play gatekeeper with line-of-business owners.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2029/12/MEDDICC-Junta-Nakai-1200x630-1.png"></a></p>
         
       
           
                 C - Champion 
         
          <p>Champions are people with power and influence inside a potential customer’s organization who are actively selling on your behalf. Most champions are line-of-business owners with a problem that’s keeping them up at night—a scrappy or ambitious VP who understands how to enact change and wants to level up professionally. Discovering and cultivating these individuals should be a major priority for your sales team.</p>
<p>To keep things moving along with your champion, you need to ensure that they are aware of who you are meeting with at all times and the results of those meetings. You should also work with them to understand both the decision process and decision criteria to move forward with a deal, as well as where the FI is in its annual budget cycle. Don’t be afraid to work closely with your champion and help them build a business case for your product within the organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, if your champion is in a meeting about you that you’re not privy to, they should be your confidant here. If they’re not, you’re not a priority for the champion and therefore for the broader organization.&nbsp;</p>

                 C - Competition 
         
          <p>As a fledgling startup, you’ll likely be competing with other startups, incumbent companies that have deep relationships with FIs, and perhaps most critically, internal competition from within the FI. This internal competition can take the form of a culture that is risk averse, buyers that don’t know your product and company or if they need it, customers that often don’t know how to evaluate your startup, or existing processes. There are a few things you can do to overcome this competition, such as:</p>
 
 Leverage your investors to position your product as best-in-class to senior leadership, or use board members to push your product to an executive who then can push it to a line-of-business owner 
 Get advice from your champion, who may have insight into any internal dynamics that may derail the deal, any competitors the firm may be considering, and&nbsp; any other employees you may need to get in front of to win the deal&nbsp; 
 Punch above your weight by building visibility with industry experts, publications, companies like Gartner, who can educate your customers on emerging solutions; partnering with channel partners; or gaining credibility with vendors that may refer your product to the FI (e.g., core banking providers like FIS, Fiserv, and Jack Henry) 
 
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2029/12/2599-ILG-2-2.png"></a></p>
         
       
       

 Looking Ahead 
<p>We believe this is the best time for founders to be selling software into financial institutions.&nbsp; Advancements in AI are inspiring senior leaders to drive change across their organizations. As a result, we at a16z have made it a top priority to connect with key decision makers at various financial services institutions—in the form of dinners with our portfolio companies and the CEOs of these firms, briefings with line-of-business owners, and demo days. This relationship is two-way, as we regularly share ideas and innovative companies with FIs in our network including Goldman Sachs, PNC, Morgan Stanley, American Express, and more. If you are working at an incumbent financial institution and interested in the bleeding edge of technology, we’d love to include you in our network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, if you’re an entrepreneur tackling this exciting GTM channel, we’d love to learn your best practices and also open our network to you—both from a top-down and bottoms-up perspective—in effort to continue to demystify this B2FI motion. Thank you to all of the founders, operators, and executives for sharing with us the key lessons they have learned in their B2FI journeys.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the best known memes in crypto is: 'Not your keys, not your coins'. This usually resurfaces whenever a (custodial) centralised exchange is hacked or goes bust altogether. Although Web3 provides the infrastructure for self custody, this often shares the fate of Pandora. Self-custody requires increased security measures, from both end-users, as well as application developers. Web3 wallets are the interface between users and decentralised applications deployed on blockchains. While Metamask still maintains the largest market share, a multitude of wallets have emerged, promising additional features and a better UX.</p><p>We were joined by Evgeny Yurtaev, co-founder &amp; CEO of Zerion, to discuss the challenges of building a Web3 wallet and how Zerion aims to improve user experience, while still maintaining security.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Evgeny’s background  The motivation behind building a Web3 wallet  Zerion UX and security  Seed phrase storing  Zerion user profile  Challenges in building a new wallet app  Protecting users and potential attack vectors  Supported blockchains and (seamless) bridging  Account abstraction and MPC  Business models for Web3 wallets  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/evgeth_">Evgeny Yurtaev on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/zerion">Zerion on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Friederike Ernst.

That way, the core team can determine exactly if the mixnet is already being censored, and if so, exactly how, so that this censorship can be circumvented.</p><p>Why is censorship resistance important? It puts access to information, knowledge and choice back into the hands of people rather than being subject to the overreaching impositions placed on them by governments.</p> The path to censorship resistance <p>To achieve this, the R&amp;D team has created a mixnet censorship test based<a href="https://ooni.org/install/"> on the Open Observatory of Network Interference probe</a>.</p><p>Anyone can run<a href="https://github.com/nymtech/CensorshipMeasurements"> the test</a>. Please do!<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/help-build-censorship-resistance-with-the-nym-censorship-test-4984160996ad"> A tutorial is available here</a>.</p><p>Nym is seeking input from as many geographies as possible. Please share your report.jsonl file with Nym <a href="mailto:merve@nymtech.net">via email</a> or in the General<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> channel of the Nym Matrix server</a>, and be sure to indicate which country the measurement was taken&nbsp;in.</p><p>Right now, the results show no indication of censorship, however this doesn’t mean there won’t be any censorship in&nbsp;future.</p><p>In fact, as mixnet usage picks up and the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/what-does-it-take-to-build-the-worlds-most-powerful-vpn-d351a76ec4e6">Nym VPN launches in Beta by the end of 2023</a> it is highly likely that it will begin to face some censorship...</p><p>The Nym mixnet is unique in that it protects metadata. To do this, content is split up, encrypted, and mixed in with fake cover traffic, all of which is sent at random intervals to make tracking the original message impossible.</p><p>However, because all the packets are the same size, it’s possible that the mixing mechanism is identifiable.</p><p>To be more resistant, the mixnet needs not just cover traffic, but also to disguise mixnet packets so they appear just like regular communications traffic to observers. And it is exactly this work that the R&amp;D team is exploring right&nbsp;now.</p><p>Nym is already exploring technologies such as<a href="https://www.pluggabletransports.info/how-transports/"> pluggable transports</a>, which are currently used as a kind of proxy in the Tor network to disguise connections, and <a href="https://shadowsocks.org/">Shadowsocks</a>, an open source protocol that helps users bypass firewalls by connecting to a third-party SOCKS5&nbsp;proxy.</p><p><a href="https://blog.torproject.org/tor-heart-bridges-and-pluggable-transports/">As the Tor Project explains</a>, internet providers can block connections to known Tor relays and then analyse network traffic to deanonymise use of the protocol. To get around this problem, Tor runs something called Bridges — secret Tor relays that don’t appear in any public list so censors can’t discover them to block in the first place. This is where pluggable transports come in. Pluggable transports disguise connections to the bridges, distorting traffic so that it looks completely normal to any observers.</p><p>The <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/vpns-tor-i2p-how-does-nym-compare-8576824617b8">Nym mixnet works differently to Tor</a> but the purpose of pluggable transports would be the same: to cloak data so that observers wouldn’t even know they were looking at mixnet traffic. All the signifiers would suggest regular HTTP internet traffic but beneath this cover would be Sphinx-encrypted mixnet&nbsp;packets.</p><p><a href="https://shadowsocks.org/doc/what-is-shadowsocks.html">Shadowsocks</a>, meanwhile, is an open source split proxy technology loosely based on SOCKS5. It is widely used in China, where VPN traffic is blocked, to disguise internet traffic and evade censorship. However, it is not a privacy-preserving technology: its main use is to bypass censorship.</p><p>The core team will explore a wide range of technologies with the ultimate goal of providing as many options to resist censorship as possible.</p><p>The R&amp;D team is planning deeper exploratory work on censorship resistance to commence later this year, while development and implementation is<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-roadmap-update-2023-24-2466711e1fad"> penned in on the Nym roadmap for the second half of&nbsp;2024</a>.</p><p>The goal is that the mixnet will not only provide unparalleled privacy, but that adversaries won’t be able to identify mixnet traffic at all — with all communications disguised, a step towards an open access but private and secure, unblockable internet.</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-censorship-resistance-update-d2f5e08e66d1">Nym censorship resistance update</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 This article gives instructions on how to use the Verus-Ethereum Bridge website and Verus Desktop and Verus Mobile to preconvert ETH, DAI and MKR into Bridge.vETH. <p>First I recommend to read: <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/bridging-done-right-verus-ethereum-bridge-launches-now-1b2ca42939b2">Bridging Done Right — Verus-Ethereum Bridge Launches&nbsp;Now!</a></p><p>✅ We will show&nbsp;you:</p>  How-to bridge ETH, DAI &amp; MKR over to&nbsp;Verus  How-to enable vETH, DAI.vETH &amp; MKR.vETH on Verus Desktop &amp; Verus&nbsp;Mobile  How-to preconvert into Bridge.vETH with Verus Desktop &amp; Verus&nbsp;Mobile    Download the latest <a href="https://verus.io/wallet/desktop">Verus Desktop</a> or Verus Mobile (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/en/app/verus-mobile/id6447361908">iOS App Store</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.autonomoussoftwarefoundation.verusmobile.android&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">Android Play&nbsp;Store</a>)  If on Verus Desktop make sure you are on native mode and fully synced. (And remember to always backup your wallet.dat file!)  Visit the Verus-Ethereum Bridge website here: <a href="https://eth.verusbridge.io/">https://eth.verusbridge.io/</a>   Bridging ETH, DAI &amp; MKR over to&nbsp;Verus <p>First thing we need to do, before we can preconvert, is to bridge over. To bridge ETH, DAI or MKR over you need to visit the <a href="https://eth.verusbridge.io/">bridge website&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Then connect your Metamask or WalletConnect wallet. Follow the steps they give&nbsp;you.</p><p>Then fill in the address (R- or i-address) you want the bridged ETH, DAI or MKR to end&nbsp;up.</p><p>Then choose what you want to bridge over (ETH, DAI, MKR or VRSC). And then the destination. After that choose the amount and click&nbsp;send.</p><p>Metamask or WalletConnect will guide you through the next steps. ⚠️ It can take up to 45 minutes before your bridged ETH, DAI or MKR arrives on the Verus blockchain and in your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>⛽ Also, the gas fee calculation is quite high, it could be that you pay a lot less, but this is never a guarantee.</p> Getting Verus Desktop to show vETH, DAI.vETH &amp;&nbsp;MKR.vETH <p>Now that you have sent over ETH, DAI or MKR to your R- or i-address, we need to make sure you can actually see them in Verus&nbsp;Desktop.</p><p>Go to the “Multiverse”-tab, click on Verus on the left. You can see that Bridge.vETH, DAI.vETH, MKR.vETH &amp; vETH or not “added” yet. Click on one of the currencies.</p><p>When clicking on one of the currencies you can see a button “Add Currency”. Click on it, and do it for all if you&nbsp;want.</p><p>You can now go back to the “Wallet”-tab.</p><p>You can now see the added currencies in the dropdown in your Wallet-tab (when Verus is selected).</p> Getting Verus Mobile to show vETH, DAI.vETH &amp;&nbsp;MKR.vETH <p>For this step we assume you already have the wallet installed and are ready to go. Now that you have sent over ETH, DAI or MKR to your R- or i-address, we need to make sure you can actually see them in Verus&nbsp;Mobile.</p><p>Click on the big plus button in the right bottom corner. Then click “Add PBaaS Currency”.</p><p>Then you can type in vETH (or DAI.vETH, MKR.vETH depending on what you want to add). (not capital sensitive). Btw, you can also already add Bridge.vETH.</p><p>Follow the steps and the currency will be added to your main&nbsp;screen.</p> Preconverting to Bridge.vETH  Verus Desktop <p>To actually start preconverting currencies to Bridge.vETH click on “Convert Currencies”.</p><p>Now go to “Advanced”.</p><p>You only need to fill in the highlighted parts of the form. See&nbsp;below:</p>  Amount: how much of vETH, DAI.vETH or MKR.vETH you want to convert to Bridge.vETH  From Currency: Fill in vETH, DAI.vETH or MKR.vETH (not case sensitive)  To Currency: Fill in Bridge.vETH (not case sensitive)  Destination Address: Fill in where you want to receive the Bridge.vETH (on Fri 20 Oct). Can be a R-address, i-address or&nbsp;VerusID.  Send as pre-convert: Check&nbsp;this  Refund Address: Sometimes a currency has a minimum or maximum amount to preconvert before it launches. For example, when the minimum preconversion amount is not met, and thus the currency not launched, you will receive your funds back. In this case there isn’t a minimum or maximum but you still need to fill it in. Can be the same as your Destination Address.  <p>Now click on “Convert Currencies” and confirm the transaction. You have now preconverted funds into Bridge.vETH!</p> Verus Mobile <p>Now we want to preconvert currencies (vETH, DAI.vETH, MKR.vETH) into Bridge.vETH.</p><p>Click on the currency you want to preconvert into Bridge.vETH. Go to the correct tab where you have the currency stored. Click “Send”, then “Convert or Cross-chain”, then click “Pre-convert”.</p>  Recipient address: This is the address where you will receive the Bridge.vETH, you can click on “self”, or choose something else.  Amount: choose the amount of the currency you want to convert into Bridge.vETH.  Currency to convert to: Fill in Bridge.vETH (not case sensitive)  <p>Then click send and follow the steps. You have now preconverted currencies into Bridge.vETH!</p><p>On Friday 20 Oct you will receive an amount of the 100,000 initial supply of Bridge.vETH in your destination address.</p><p>You can always check <a href="http://www.verus.io/eth-bridge">verus.io/eth-bridge</a> for statistics on Bridge.vETH</p> Join the community.

 Bridging Done Right — Verus-Ethereum Bridge Launches&nbsp;Now!  The Verus-Ethereum Bridge is the first non-custodial and trustless bridge in the industry, and where the accounting of funds is proven and verified by consensus. And you can participate in its launch right&nbsp;now!  ⏱️ Verus-Ethereum Bridge launch: block height 2,758,800 (Fri 20 Oct,&nbsp;2023).  ✅ Start preconverting to the bridge currency Bridge.vETH (with an initial supply of 100,000) NOW for a 10 day period. 👉 <a href="https://eth.verusbridge.io">Connect to the&nbsp;bridge</a>  👀 The first ever truly non-custodial, trustless and consensus proven cryptocurrency bridge.  How it&nbsp;Works <p>You can already start to preconvert VRSC, ETH, DAI and MKR into Bridge.vETH.</p>  Bridge ETH, DAI and MKR over to the Verus network. 👉 <a href="http://eth.verusbridge.io">Go to the bridge website</a> <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/how-to-participate-in-the-verus-ethereum-bridge-launch-73aeeae1c76a">How-to guide for bridging &amp; preconversion</a>  Preconvert vETH (ETH), DAI.vETH (DAI), MKR.vETH (MKR) or VRSC into Bridge.vETH.  See Bridge.vETH statistics on <a href="http://www.verus.io/eth-bridge">verus.io/eth-bridge</a>  <p>When the bridge currency launches on 20 Oct the initial supply of 100,000 will be distributed by the protocol among all preconverters.</p><p>If you move ETH, DAI and MKR over to the Verus blockchain before the bridge is launched your cross-chain fees are subsidized. Around 5000 VRSC is used to subsidize the fees on the Verus side. When the bridge currency gets launched, the VRSC that is left will be put into the reserves.</p> Dynamic Supply <p>The Bridge.vETH supply is dynamic (after the preconversion has finished and the bridge currency is launched). The currency gets minted when people convert to it from VRSC, vETH, DAI.vETH and MKR.vETH, or gets burned when people convert out of&nbsp;it.</p>After the bridge currency is launched you can convert into any direction.<blockquote>Worth noting: Verus DeFi is MEV-resistant. There is no front/back-running since all conversions are simultaneously solved within a block. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/sendcurrency/">More details on docs.verus.io</a></blockquote><p>The Bridge.vETH currency function is to make the bridging of assets simple. From wherever you send it converts the fees that you need seamlessly.</p> The Bridge Accrues&nbsp;Fees <p>The bridge currency accrues fees with the cross-chain functions, conversions and&nbsp;.vETH VerusID registrations, making it more valuable the more it’s&nbsp;used.</p><p>Dai holders get 5% interest (at the time of writing, the rate is subject to change by MakerDAO) automatically when holding in the DSR (Dai Savings Rate) contract. DAI in Bridge.vETH and in the complete Verus ecosystem get this savings rate. The DSR is being passed through 100% to the DAI reserves of Bridge.vETH.</p> Use the&nbsp;Bridge <p>After Bridge.vETH is launched and the initial supply is distributed you can now use the bridge as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Convert into any direction after the currency is launched and out of preconversion mode.

Present Issues with Existing Cryptocurrency Bridges <p>Let’s first delve into the challenges associated with the prevailing cryptocurrency bridges in the industry.</p>  The custody of bridged assets is typically maintained by a single or a small number of addresses, effectively creating a central authority for holding the funds, which contradicts the decentralized nature of blockchain.  The smart contracts that secure these bridged assets can be readily modified by a singular or limited number of authorities, thus presenting potential security&nbsp;issues.  Smart contracts might contain bugs or malicious codes, making them susceptible to exploitation and undermining the safety of the bridged assets, especially if those assets are not accounted for by the block producers.  <p>These problems have been demonstrated by numerous bridge hacks that have occurred and are likely to continue in the future. Verus does things, yet again, very different.</p> Why the Verus-Ethereum Bridge is Different <p>The Verus-Ethereum Bridge is different because the assets are never in anyone’s custody. This is done through the seamless cooperation between the block producers, community notary witnesses, the Bridgekeeper software and the Ethereum smart contract. At each step during cross-chain transactions the assets are verified and proven by consensus rules, with safeguards in place to prevent&nbsp;hacks.</p><p>Every 10 blocks validators create a notarization. They create these digital receipts for both Verus and Ethereum. The digital receipts, called “notarizations’’, contain, among other things: the “stateroot” (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp">Merkle Mountain Range</a> for Verus, <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/">Merkle Patricia Trie</a> for Ethereum), the blockheight, blockhash and the gas price for Ethereum. The notarizations have to be agreed to by the block producers (miners and stakers) and are then mined into the Verus blockchain.</p><blockquote>👉 <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-internet-protocol-vip-provable-decentralized-cross-chain-communication-8d9414a429c5">Read more here</a> on how the Verus Protocol handles cross-chain communication (PBaaS-chains and more) in a decentralized and provable&nbsp;way.</blockquote> Safeguards Against Bridge&nbsp;Hacks <p>Threats caused by malicious notary witnesses, or stolen keys to drain funds are not viable against the Verus-Ethereum bridge. To successfully mount an attack on the bridge, if a majority of witnesses were colluding or got their private keys stolen the following would need to&nbsp;happen:</p>  Colluding, malicious witnesses.  Fake block producers with more combined hash and stake power than the publicly validated Verus blockchain.  Developers helping them by creating an alternate protocol for the shadow&nbsp;chain.  <p>These requirements are very close to the requirements of attacking any blockchain. The bridge even provides a way to defend against such an unlikely scenario.</p><p>The notary witnesses are also monitoring notarizations, and if they were to sign for something that they themselves do not agree with, they can auto-revoke their identities, using the VerusID protocol, which cannot be stopped by an attacker unless they have stolen both the keys for the notary ID and those for its revocation ID as well. This serves as a prevention for stolen key attacks, ensuring that notaries are extremely hard targets to compromise.</p> Bridgekeeper <p>The two blockchains, Verus and Ethereum, are fundamentally different from each other, but still need to be able to communicate. A translator is needed. This translator is a program called Bridgekeeper. Notary witnesses have to run the program. Miners and stakers are also encouraged to run it, and for doing so they receive&nbsp;fees.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/Verusbridgekeeper">Bridgekeeper for CLI</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/kyEqBX_erJo?si=UOajk4TnSD0ToRY4">How to become a Bridgekeeper — video</a></p> Verus ➡️&nbsp;Ethereum <p>Let’s consider a scenario where a user wants to move or convert assets from Verus to Ethereum. This transaction gets recorded on the Verus blockchain. When there are enough, or a certain time period has passed, these cross-chain transactions are rolled up into something called a ‘CCE’ (cross-chain export). This CCE is then added to a block by a miner or staker and they are rewarded a fee for doing so. The CCE is now officially part of the blockchain, and is linked to the “stateroot” (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp">Merkle Mountain Range</a>, which is an unchangeable overall summary of the blockchain at that block, and anything preceding it).</p><p>Meanwhile, as the transactions (CCE) are being mined (or staked) in, the notarizations are also being mined or staked in, confirmed by miners and stakers, and only then, signed by the notary witnesses. The notarizations can occur as often as every 10 blocks, depending on how many miners and stakers are running Bridgekeeper. Before a notarization is used as proof, it has to be on the blockchain for 10 blocks, confirmed by another notarization, and also signed by at least 8 of 15 notary witnesses worldwide.</p><p>Then when the notarization is confirmed on Verus, it’s sent over to Ethereum and becomes pending on Ethereum. Once confirmed on Ethereum by receiving another notarization, the transactions (CCE) in that block are sent over to the Ethereum smart contract, along with the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp">Merkle Mountain Range</a> proof. If valid the assets are sent to the users Ethereum&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Anyone can roll up the transactions into a CCE and mine it in to get a reward, but also the notary witnesses paying the ETH fees to send it to Ethereum get a share of the fees to subsidize their transaction costs.</p><p>If there is no traffic from Verus to Ethereum, the notarizations are continued to be mined in on Verus but do not need to be sent to Ethereum, so when the traffic is light, there is minimal&nbsp;cost.</p> Ethereum ➡️&nbsp;Verus <p>The above part explains going from Verus to Ethereum, but the other way around is actually a little bit different. It is not the notary witnesses that send the group of transactions over, but any miner and staker can, and thus also get part of the&nbsp;fees.</p><p>Notarizations made on Verus always contain a stateroot from Ethereum that is a minimum of 30 blocks old (blocks on Ethereum take ~15 seconds) to make sure it is stable. Then after Verus has confirmed the notarization with a new one, Verus can accept transactions (CCE) from Ethereum, along with the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/">Ethereum Merkle Patricia Trie</a> proof that relates to the new confirmed data.</p> A Giant Leap&nbsp;Forward <p>The delayed sending of transactions is an important security mechanism that is not present in any other cross-chain bridge. To recap: before any real transactions happen, the Verus network sends proofs to the Ethereum network and vice versa. These proofs are checked and agreed upon by everyone in the network. Only then the actual moving of assets happens. Because of this delayed system, no single entity ever gets control over the assets. Also there are safeguards in place for the community notaries that protect users from&nbsp;hacks.</p><p>This system is decentralized, which means it’s controlled by everyone participating in the network, rather than a single central authority. It’s a giant leap forward for the entire cryptocurrency industry, and everyone can be a part of&nbsp;it!</p> Join the community. Learn about the protocol.

<p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>It’s the end of the month again! Here’s a round-up of everything that went down this September.</p> Tech Updates  v1 Testnet update <p>Stage 2 of our v1 Testnet is still in the making. This Stage is predominantly about converting Panther Reward Points to $zZKP. The introduction of an additional feature ("vouchers") will enable users to test this conversion while remaining in a testnet environment, an addition that slightly differs from this Stage's original design. The function is still undergoing internal testing.</p><p>Concurrently, Stage 3 work has already started and is in progress. This Stage will be centered around depositing assets into Shielded Pools.</p><p>We're excited to get Panther v1 in your hands. Look out for more updates on the Testnet launch in the coming weeks!</p> Update to the Stage 1 Testnet’s url <p>As we progress on the above, we have updated the link for Stage 1 on our Testnet information repository. The new version contains a few tweaks and upgrades.</p><p>To access it, go to: <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet/testnet-stages?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet/testnet-stages</a></p> Comparing Panther’s approach to ‘Privacy Pools’ <p>The recent <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4563364&amp;download=yes&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Privacy Pools paper</a> struck a chord with the Web3 community. It's clear that preserving users' privacy in a compliant way is crucial for the mass adoption of decentralized technologies.&nbsp;</p><p>After carefully reviewing the paper by <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Vitalik Buterin</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ameensol?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Ameen Soleimani</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mat_nadler?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Mat Nadler</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/chainalysis?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Chainalysis</a>' J. Illum, and <a href="https://twitter.com/fschaer?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Fabien Schär</a>, we wrote an article comparing Panther's solutions to ‘Privacy Pools’.&nbsp;</p><p>Both protocols attempt to exclude bad actors from a privacy-preserving system based on disclosures that can be legally adopted. However, although there are clear similarities, there are also key differences in how we tackle this challenge.&nbsp;</p><p>Read our in-depth analysis:</p><p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol-privacy-pools-approaches-compared/">https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol-privacy-pools-approaches-compared/</a></p>We analyze Panther's solutions against ‘Privacy Pools’, both aiming to exclude malicious actors from privacy-preserving systems. Integrating PureFi as Panther’s first accredited compliance integration <p>Although PureFi’s integration into v1 had already been approved by the Panther DAO, this month we formalized it with an announcement. With this, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol-joins-forces-with-purefi-to-enable-compliance-in-prifi/">PureFi joins Panther in enabling compliant DeFi privacy</a>.</p><p>Privacy integrations enable Panther to:</p>  Improve its decentralization  Apply compliance at a protocol level  Provide on-chain support for ZK-compatible attestations &amp; signatures  <p>These&nbsp; integrations also prioritize neutrality. Through our team’s collaboration with compliance providers like PureFi Protocol, they will be able to issue zero-knowledge proofs for Panther users that submit their data and achieve passing AML scores, ensuring Panther remains uninformed of user data.</p><p>Integrating third-party compliance tools like PureFi underscores Panther's dedication to shaping a DeFi ecosystem where privacy tools are normalized and malicious actors are diligently screened out.</p>PureFi &amp; Panther’s integration illustrated. Ecosystem  Panel with PureFi <p>We hosted a meeting with PureFi Protocol to discuss our upcoming v1 integration.</p><p>Panther’s CEO Oliver Gale, CTO Anish Mohammed, and Head of Product Saif Akhtar joined PureFi’s CEO Slava Demchuk, CTO Mykhailo Tiutin, and COO Vasily Vidmanov to break down the complexities of the integration and answer all your questions.&nbsp;</p><p>This was a great opportunity to showcase how Panther and PureFi are working together to make privacy-preserving DeFi a no-brainer.</p><p>You can listen back to this Twitter Spaces at:</p> <blockquote><p>We'll be hosting a panel with <a href="https://twitter.com/PureFi_Protocol?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@PureFi_Protocol</a> to discuss our v1 integration!<br><br>We'll have Panther CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/OriginalOlii?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@OriginalOlii</a>, CTO <a href="https://twitter.com/anishmohammed?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@anishmohammed</a>, Product Head <a href="https://twitter.com/saifonblock?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@saifonblock</a> with CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/demchukvm?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@demchukvm</a> , CTO <a href="https://twitter.com/mtiutin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@mtiutin</a> and COO Vasily Vidmanov from PureFi.<br><br>Set a reminder: <a href="https://t.co/HXZ3933KX8?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">https://t.co/HXZ3933KX8</a></p>— Panther Protocol (@ZKPanther) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther/status/1708924109906727164?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">October 2, 2023</a></blockquote>

From the beginning, the internet was designed as a public network, and a wise assumption is that all communications are not private by default. This is the problem that Nym aims to&nbsp;solve.</p><p>It’s true that platforms like Discord do not preserve privacy. It is helpful to think of them as a digital equivalent to a mall — a commercial space where everything you do is visible, but where you can also meet all kinds of&nbsp;people.</p><p>Enabling privacy for everyone starts with making education accessible for everyone. Shipyard will be hosted in such malls and public plazas precisely to make the event as accessible as possible.</p><p>Just as a festival or a marketplace would be held in a large, public, outdoor venue — so are the events of Shipyard, where newcomers can meet and learn all about the new privacy primitives shaping the internet. In the real world too, you also trade the privacy of your home for public&nbsp;events.</p><p>However, anyone seeking more intimate conversations can always step in to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#general:nymtech.chat">Nym’s privacy-preserving Matrix server and Element channels</a> — like moving from the public plaza into the Nym social&nbsp;club.</p><p>While much of Shipyard will be out in the open, attendees can always step inside to the quieter, more private space where you’re able to engage more deeply with other community members and the core&nbsp;team.</p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">So visit Discord</a> for the ‘public plaza’, to meet people from around the world! But beware, there are no privacy protections.</p><p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/#general:nymtech.chat">And hop into Matrix/ Element</a> for the ‘social club’ — step inside for more intimate conversations with the Nym core community and&nbsp;team.</p><p>Head to<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/BftsP0JrkWc?feature=shared"> Youtube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nymtech">Twitch</a> to watch the live lectures.</p><p>And visit the <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/">Nym Shipyard website</a> for learning material, which will also be shared on Discord and Element prior to the&nbsp;exams.</p> How to maximise your privacy during&nbsp;Shipyard <p>That said, Nym is a privacy-first organisation, and it’s completely understandable if Shipyard attendees would like to join in the most private way possible.</p><p><a href="https://mirror.xyz/0x8ebA38B680ab24276138173e42469348b941E87a/QorAan7iKvyh9f3PnbEyAocdcIainlAaJYNxT8W_6j4">Here’s how to privacy enhance your Shipyard experience</a> (and thanks to<a href="https://officercia.mirror.xyz/"> officercia.eth</a> for the detailed Telegram privacy steps — check out his page for more hands-on opsec&nbsp;advice.)</p><p>To complete Shipyard with maximum privacy, follow these&nbsp;guides:</p><p>Resources</p>  <a href="https://mirror.xyz/0x8ebA38B680ab24276138173e42469348b941E87a/QorAan7iKvyh9f3PnbEyAocdcIainlAaJYNxT8W_6j4">How to maximise your privacy during&nbsp;Shipyard</a>  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/element-matrix-over-the-nym-mixnet-private-decentralised-and-secure-messaging-ac7f47bc47af">Matrix/ Element chat over&nbsp;Nym</a>  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/configuring-nymconnect-with-telegram-9ca6425d95b6">Telegram over&nbsp;Nym</a>  <a href="https://blog.notrustverify.ch/pastenym-a-privacy-friendly-sharing-service-ac3d5f337bde">PasteNym for sharing texts and links during&nbsp;Shipyard</a>  <p>Welcome to Nym Shipyard Level&nbsp;1!</p><p>See you at the opening ceremony, and don’t forget to join the Nym community on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#general:nymtech.chat">Element</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a>, and <a href="https://t.me/nymtech">Telegram</a>.</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-shipyard-a-privacy-academy-in-the-public-squares-328cdacab037">Nym Shipyard: a privacy academy in the public squares</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Danny Ryan is a coordinator at the Ethereum Foundation. He’s been on Bankless many times before. Usually, we’re talking about the Ethereum roadmap and what’s coming next. This time we’re talking about something different…a risk to Ethereum that Danny sees. A little over a year ago, Danny wrote a blog post titled “The Risk of LSDs”... discussing the various risk vectors that a dominant LSD presents to Ethereum…even naming Lido specifically in the process.&nbsp;</p> <p>------ ✨ DEBRIEF | Ryan &amp; David unpacking the episode: <a href="https://www.bankless.com/debrief-danny-ryan">https://www.bankless.com/debrief-danny-ryan</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ A lot of people have decided that liquid staking with Lido is the place to do it. At the time of recording Lido has over 30% of all staked Ether. Does this present a systemic risk to Ethereum?</p> <p>We did an episode called, “In Defense of Lido” with researcher Hasu who argued that Lido does not pose a systemic risk to Ethereum. In fact, Lido’s dominance is better than many other alternatives. We left that conversation half-finished when we published it in August 2023.&nbsp;</p> <p>In today’s episode, we cover part two of that debate with Ethereum researcher and guest Danny Ryan who argues the opposite. Lido is a systemic risk to Ethereum and what to do about it.</p> <p>We believe our role as podcasters for issues like this is to voice both sides of the argument in long-form conversations and healthy debate. It is exactly the kind of thing you don’t get on Twitter. That’s why we’ve given voice to both sides of this issue.&nbsp;</p> <p>We think there are good actors who care about this ecosystem at Lido and in the broader Ethereum community and we’re sure this episode won’t be the last word on this subject.</p> <p>----- 🏹 Airdrop Hunter is HERE, join your first HUNT today <a href="https://bankless.cc/JoinYourFirstHUNT">https://bankless.cc/JoinYourFirstHUNT</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ 📣 a16z Startup School | Apply Before Oct. 20th <a href="https://bankless.cc/a16z-startup-school">https://bankless.cc/a16z-startup-school</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>🐙KRAKEN | MOST-TRUSTED CRYPTO EXCHANGE ⁠<a href="https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2%C2%A0%20%E2%81%A0">https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2&nbsp; ⁠</a></p> <p>🦊METAMASK PORTFOLIO | MANAGE YOUR WEB3 EVERYTHING <a>⁠https://bankless.cc/MetaMask&nbsp;</a></p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM ⁠<a href="https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a></p> <p>🗣️TOKU | CRYPTO EMPLOYMENT SOLUTION <a href="https://bankless.cc/Toku">https://bankless.cc/Toku</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🦄UNISWAP | ON-CHAIN MARKETPLACE ⁠<a href="https://bankless.cc/uniswap">https://bankless.cc/uniswap&nbsp;</a></p> <p>🔗 CELO | CEL2 COMING SOON <a href="https://bankless.cc/Celo">https://bankless.cc/Celo</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ TIMESTAMPS</p> <p>0:00 Intro 7:41 Is Lido a Threat to Ethereum 8:57 &nbsp;Blog Post Thinking Change? 19:30 Uniswap 21:20 Theoretical Main Risks 25:45 God Mode&nbsp; 27:20 Practical Main Risks 34:00 Hasu Counter-Arguments&nbsp; 38:25 Permissionless Validator Set Mitigation 42:30 Veto Power Mitigation Argument 46:55 How Likely is the Lido Risk? 51:26 Client Team Positioning&nbsp; 55:00 How Special is the Lido Case?&nbsp; 57:45 One LST Inevitability &nbsp; 1:02:30 Solutions&nbsp; 1:06:55 Profit Maximization&nbsp; 1:09:00 Action Steps For Ethereum Decentralization&nbsp; 1:11:53 Can Ethereum Devs Do Something?&nbsp; 1:20:10 Hasu Questions Answered by Danny&nbsp; 1:22:45 Magnitude of the Lido Threat 1:24:20 How Can Lido Fix This?&nbsp; 1:25:59 Stick &amp; Carrot for Lido 1:26:27 Silverlining of Lido Threat 1:29:05 Next Conversations&nbsp; 1:32:16 Closing &amp; Disclaimers &nbsp;</p> <p>----- RESOURCES</p> <p>Danny Ryan <a href="https://twitter.com/dannyryan">https://twitter.com/dannyryan</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Danny Ryan Blog Post <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd">https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Hasu’s Bankless Interview <a href="https://youtu.be/IfuUdIblfrY">https://youtu.be/IfuUdIblfrY</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>----- Not financial or tax advice.

<p>Back in 2017, there was no DeFi as we know it today, yet MakerDAO were already envisioning and building towards what they thought to be a certainty. The backbone of DeFi is represented by stable coins, and MakerDAO quickly understood this: they set out to build a decentralised stable coin, $DAI (and its precursor $SAI). Being collateral-backed, the smart contract needs to know the value of that collateral, but any off-chain price data is not readily available on-chain. This is where oracles come in and provide data feeds on-chain. MakerDAO’s internal oracle has been active since 2017 on Ethereum and has recently branched out, forming Chronicle. By using aggregated Schnorr signatures, Chronicle solves the problem of oracle cost-efficient scaling.</p><p>We were joined by Niklas Kunkel, founder of Chronicle, to discuss the challenges and tradeoffs that oracles regularly face, and how Chronicle is solving them, continuing the ethos of early MakerDAO.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Niklas’ background and the early days of MakerDAO  How MakerDAO evolved over time and the adoption of DAI  MakerDAO’s core principles  Why Chronicle branched out from MakerDAO  Oracle challenges &amp; tradeoffs  Oracle validators  Business model for oracles  Providing oracle services to different blockchains  Schnorr signatures  Chronicle’s supported chains and oracle offerings  Real-world assets (RWA) and credit delegation  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/nomos_paradox">Niklas Kunkel on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ChronicleLabs">Chronicle on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/MakerDAO">Maker DAO on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Sebastien Couture &amp; Felix Lutsch.

Participating in this mission is actually very simple thanks to the NYM token: the life blood of the mixnet, which rewards node operators for their time, effort and&nbsp;risk.</p><p>Languages: <a href="https://medium.com/@NYM_Indonesia/nym-wallet-portal-anda-untuk-membangun-internet-pribadi-8ac32f677cde">Bahasa Indonesia</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymturkish/nym-cüzdanı-mahrem-interneti-oluşturmaya-yönelik-portalınız-8a45ae4a0758">Türkçe</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymfrance/nym-wallet-votre-portail-pour-construire-linternet-priv%C3%A9-554ab84c2f12">Française</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nym_china/nym-wallet-%E6%9E%84%E5%BB%BA%E9%9A%90%E7%A7%81%E4%BA%92%E8%81%94%E7%BD%91%E7%9A%84%E9%97%A8%E6%88%B7-ccc84c0e5f86">中文</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nym_ru/%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA-nym-wallet-%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%88-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BB-%D0%B2-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9-%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%82-7c5fd6a43132">Русский</a> // <a href="https://note.com/koko_crypto/n/na143bc364642">日本</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymspanish/la-wallet-de-nym-tu-entrada-para-construir-la-internet-privada-5eae35fee8e6">Español</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymportugues/nym-wallet-o-seu-portal-para-construir-a-internet-privada-3193f09b10a1">Português</a></p><p>And the portal to engaging with the NYM token is the <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/wallet">Nym Wallet</a>. Scroll on to learn all about the Nym Wallet, why it matters, and how to use&nbsp;it.</p> WTF is Nym&nbsp;Wallet? <p>The <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/wallet">Nym Wallet</a> is an application that allows users to buy and hold NYM tokens but also to ‘delegate stake’ and ‘bond’ them. These are crucial components of the carefully crafted token economics that power the&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Not only does the Nym Wallet help reward operators to run and maintain the private internet but it also rewards token holders&nbsp;too.</p><p>If you already know about delegating and bonding, skip the next section and head straight to the Using Nym Wallet tutorial at the bottom of this blog&nbsp;post.</p><p>For everyone else, let’s take a look at how delegating and bonding in Nym Wallet contributes to the private internet.</p> Delegating and bonding in Nym&nbsp;Wallet  For token&nbsp;holders <p>Anyone holding tokens can ‘delegate stake’ to mix nodes of their choice, using the wallet. This signals the node’s reputation in the community. In return, delegators receive a share of mix nodes’ rewards for running a good operation, incentivising them to stake on well-performing nodes.</p><p>With this one small step of delegating stake, token holders are contributing to the health of the Nym ecosystem, and helping to build an anti-surveillance business model on the internet.</p> For node operators <p>Node operators ‘bond’ to their own mix nodes. This is an initial investment that shows their commitment to the community, and allows them to enter the Nym mixnet. It also lets the mixnet know that you are a node operator.</p><p>Together, the amount of delegated stake and bonded stake determines the mix node’s overall reputation — and its chance of being picked for the ‘active set’ that mixes traffic in the ‘epoch’, i.e. the hour-long configuration of the&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Good mixing performance, such as consistent uptime and data transfer, increases the rewards that mix nodes receive and therefore the rewards token holders receive for delegating too.</p><p>This is the underlying Nym token economics in action <a href="https://nymtech.net/nym-whitepaper.pdf">as set out in the original whitepaper</a>.</p><p>See also: <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/staking-in-nym-introducing-mainnet-mixmining-f9bb1cbc7c36">For a deeper dive on the Nym token economics click&nbsp;here</a></p><p>There’s plenty of ongoing work in the Nym Wallet <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/token-swaps-on-nym-wallet-coming-soon-25144cbfbcae">including in-app token swaps</a> and the development of a web app to make delegating easy on mobile&nbsp;devices.</p><p>You’ll be using Nym Wallet a little differently depending on if you’re a token holder or a node operator. Let’s take a&nbsp;look:</p> Using Nym Wallet to delegate and bond&nbsp;stake <p>1. <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/wallet">Download and install Nym Wallet for your chosen operating system: Linux, Mac, or&nbsp;Windows</a>.</p><p>2. Create your account. On the next page you will be prompted to save your mnemonic. This is your 24-word passphrase for accessing Nym Wallet. Write it down, and keep it safe. Don’t share this with&nbsp;anyone.</p><p>The following page will prompt you to create an optional password. Use security best practice, such as a trusted open source password manager like <a href="https://keepass.info/">Keepass</a>. Keep your password safe, and don’t share it with&nbsp;anyone.</p><p>You will be asked to verify your mnemonic:</p><p>Now you can sign in with your password or your mnemonic.</p><p>When you’re signed in, the dashboard looks like&nbsp;this:</p><p>3. Now you’ve signed in to Nym Wallet, navigate to the Buy button on the left of the dashboard and follow the instructions to buy the native NYM token with&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p><p>Congratulations, now you’re holding&nbsp;NYM!</p><p>Note: NYM is a utility token for using and participating in the Nym privacy infrastructure. NYM should not be purchased for speculation, it is not a general purpose payment mechanism nor cryptocurrency like&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p><p>Alternatively, if you already own NYM or someone is sending you NYM, click on Receive. A QR code and wallet address will appear on your&nbsp;screen.</p><p>You can also buy native NYM on some exchanges. (Alternatively, you can get ERC-20 version of NYM on most major exchanges. However, it is currently impossible to delegate or bond with ERC20 tokens. You’ll <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/bridging-staking-and-earning-nym-tokens-8f19f42f171e">need to ‘bridge’ these tokens over to the native NYM token — see here for a&nbsp;guide</a>).</p><p>The native NYM token is available on <a href="https://www.kraken.com/">Kraken</a>, while the ERC-20 token is available on <a href="https://www.okx.com/">OKX</a>, <a href="https://www.huobi.com/">Huobi</a>, <a href="https://www.gate.io/">Gate</a>, and <a href="https://www.bybit.com/">Bybit</a>. View all exchanges on the NYM page for <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nym/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p><p>In <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/token-swaps-on-nym-wallet-coming-soon-25144cbfbcae">an upcoming release of Nym Wallet, holders will be able to swap tokens directly in Nym Wallet, making engagement with the Nym ecosystem much simpler for ERC-20 token&nbsp;holders</a>.</p><p>If you’re a token holder read up to step 5 to learn how to Delegate and start earning rewards with Nym&nbsp;Wallet.</p><p>If you’re an operator, skip to step 7 and learn how to Bond your node on Nym&nbsp;Wallet.</p><p>4. To delegate, select the Delegation button on the left side of the dashboard. Next, select the list of mixnodes from the prompt to decide where to delegate your&nbsp;NYM.</p><p>5. The Mainnet Explorer shows all mix nodes in the Nym mixnet. The list can be sorted by active, standby, or inactive nodes. Clicking any of the nodes will bring up important information including total data packets sent and received, the location of the node, profit margin, and stake saturation.</p><p>Stake saturation is a particularly important point. You do not want to delegate to a node that has already reached 100% stake saturation. This is the maximum stake that any node can reach, and any added delegation beyond 100% saturation will not yield more rewards to you or anyone&nbsp;else.</p><p>So delegate your stake to nodes which are not fully saturated, or even better, spread your stake across multiple nodes. <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/want-to-stake-in-nym-here-is-how-to-choose-a-mix-node-to-delegate-nym-to-c3b862add165">A deeper dive on node selection is available here</a>.</p><p>6. Once you’ve decided on a node, copy the Identity Key and head back to Nym Wallet. Click the Delegate button. Paste the Identity Key into the corresponding field, and then enter the amount of NYM you would like to stake. A summary will pop up including the small delegation fee. If you’re happy, hit&nbsp;Confirm.</p><p>That’s it! With this delegation, you’re building the future private internet. You can Undelegate your stake at any time. Rewards earned will then be reflected in your Nym Wallet balance when the stake is removed from the node. You can view how your delegated stake is performing in Nym&nbsp;Wallet:</p><p>7. Operators might primarily use the Nym Wallet to bond tokens so they can join the mixnet. Of course, they can delegate stake too. Everything up to step 3 is the same, but bonding works a little differently to delegating.</p><p>To run a mix node and start a privacy business with Nym, you’ll need to go over these <a href="https://nymtech.net/operators/preliminary-steps.html">preliminary steps</a> and then <a href="https://nymtech.net/operators/nodes/mix-node-setup.html">set up a mix&nbsp;node</a>.</p><p>When you have your NYM tokens and you’re ready to bond, select the Bonding option on the dashboard.</p><p>You’ll be prompted to enter your mix node details. Enter these, and hit&nbsp;next.</p><p>You’ll then be prompted to enter the amount of NYM tokens you’d like to bond, the operating cost of your mix node, and the profit margin of your mix node. Enter these and hit&nbsp;next.</p><p>You’ll be asked to run a sign command with your gateway. Copy and paste the below long signature into your command line interface:</p> ./nym-mixnode sign - id &lt;YOUR_ID&gt; - contract-msg &lt;PAYLOAD_GENERATED_BY_THE_WALLET&gt; <p>Copy the resulting signature. It will look something like&nbsp;this:</p> &gt;&gt;&gt; The base58-encoded signature is:<br>2GbKcZVKFdpi3sR9xoJWzwPuGdj3bvd7yDtDYVoKfbTWdpjqAeU8KS5bSftD5giVLJC3gZiCg2kmEjNG5jkdjKUt <p>Paste this into Nym Wallet and you’re&nbsp;done.</p><p>Congratulations — you’ve bonded your mix&nbsp;node!</p><p>The Nym Wallet is your interface to contribute to the Nym privacy ecosystem.

<p><code>zcashd</code> 5.7.0 deprecates <code>fetch-params.sh</code> and <code>zcash-fetch-params</code> and bundles zk-SNARK parameters directly so they do not need to be downloaded or stored separately.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unless you need to generate transactions using the deprecated Sprout shielded pool, you can delete the parameter files stored in these directories to save space, as they are no longer read or used by <code>zcashd</code>: </p>



 
 <code>~/.zcash-params</code>&nbsp;(on Linux); or 



 <code>~/Library/Application Support/ZcashParams</code>&nbsp;(on Mac); or 



 <code>C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\ZcashParams</code>&nbsp;(on Windows) 
 



<p>If you do wish to use the Sprout pool, you will need the <code>sprout-groth16.params</code> currently available for download <a href="https://download.z.cash/downloads/sprout-groth16.params">here</a>.</p>



<p>Additionally, 5.7.0 reports new mempool metrics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>All node operators, which include our mining and other ecosystem partners, should upgrade to this latest version as soon as possible. Please note that version 5.6.1 will expire on or around Wednesday, October 11.</p>



<p>Additional changes have been included in this release. For technical details, please read the full release notes available at <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/releases/tag/v5.7.0">https://github.com/zcash/zcash/releases/tag/v5.7.0</a>.</p>

			 by the Zcash Foundation Board 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>Over the past few months, members of the Zcash community have begun discussing what should happen after the current Dev Fund sunsets in late 2024. The Zcash Foundation (ZF) looks forward to supporting the Zcash community in debating and deciding whether or not to institute a new ecosystem funding mechanism.&nbsp;</p><p>As a party to the Zcash <a href="https://zfnd.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Zcash_Trademark_Donation_and_License_Agreement_20191106.pdf">Trademark Donation and License Agreement</a>, ZF is committed to enacting the clear consensus of the Zcash community when it comes to approving and implementing proposed changes to the Zcash protocol (aka network upgrades). The introduction of a new funding mechanism to replace (or extend) the current Dev Fund falls within this remit, as it would involve a change to the Zcash protocol.</p><p>Therefore, ZF proposes that we follow a similar approach to the tried and tested process that resulted in the creation and adoption of ZIP 1014.&nbsp;</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 History Lesson: How the first Dev Fund was created 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>During 2019, the Zcash community began discussions about what should happen after the end of the Founders Reward in late 2020. In August 2019, the Zcash Foundation set forth a <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcash-foundation-guidance-on-dev-fund-proposals/">process and timeline</a>, and described how it would assess community sentiment towards proposals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Community members drafted <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/future-of-zcash-dev-funding-megathread-everything-in-one-place/34063">twenty proposals</a>. Following extensive community debate, these twenty were whittled down to thirteen (preserved in the <a href="https://zips.z.cash/">Zcash ZIPs repository</a>, as ZIPs 1001 thru 1013), which were presented to the community in November 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Community sentiment was gathered using three mechanisms:&nbsp;</p>
 
 a <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/68dcd8ba-08b5-11ea-95c2-1a34a475f69c/view">poll of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel</a> (previously known as the Community Governance Panel or CGP), in which 48 people voted, 
 a <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/community-sentiment-collection-poll-on-nu4-dev-fund-zips/35439/">forum poll</a>, in which people who had joined the forum before March 2019 were eligible to vote, and in which 71 people voted, and 
 a <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/staked-poll-on-zcash-dev-fund-debate/34846/7">staked poll</a> of coinholders (in which <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AHq-KoiE0mKmllcr_LTwS5tNacf5HHt_VFKPL_tYlHU/edit#gid=0">over 105,000 ZEC was staked for polling purposes by 17 distinct Zcash addresses</a>).&nbsp; 
 
 &nbsp; 
<p>ZF also <a href="https://zfnd.org/restarting-community-sentiment-collection-for-dev-fund-proposals/#on-miner-signaling">invited miners to signal their sentiment</a> but no miners did so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results of the ZCAP (CGP), forum (F), and staked poll (CH) can be found <a href="https://electriccoin.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Dev-Fund-Results.pdf">here</a>&nbsp;(with credit to ECC for creating the graphic).&nbsp;</p>
<p>ZF and ECC worked together to draft a new, mutually-agreeable proposal based on the proposals that had received the most support from the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result was a draft of <a href="https://zfnd.org/polling-community-sentiment-on-zip-1014/">ZIP 1014</a>, which proposed instituting a Dev Fund, consisting of 20% of newly minted coins and lasting until the next halving event (projected for late 2024).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In January 2020, two mechanisms were used to assess community sentiment regarding ZIP 1014, and to decide on some final details, including how the Dev Fund should be divided among its recipients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Zcash Foundation conducted a <a href="https://zfnd.org/polling-community-sentiment-on-zip-1014/">combined poll</a> of users who participated in the forum poll during the first round of community sentiment gathering, alongside the pre-existing Zcash Community Advisory Panel. This combined group numbered 119, and <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/43b9bec8-39a1-11ea-914c-b6e34ffa859a/view">88 voted in the poll</a>, which approved ZIP 1014 by 77 votes to 11.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/staked-poll-on-zcash-dev-fund-debate/34846/111">staked poll</a> of coinholders was coordinated by Zooko and Andrew Miller, in which 24 distinct Zcash addresses staked over 119,000 ZEC for the purposes of the poll. All but one of the participants in this poll (representing 99.9% of the staked coins) voted to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSlHXhA_NoJy0RW3Gc6YY3bmYcKT_YF8oS_BrSkBnvEGGaJ56WYo7iL_9shuoh-z_DZMYojA6FpLoJv/pubhtml">approve ZIP 1014</a>.</p>
<p>ZF and ECC subsequently agreed that ZIP 1014 should be implemented in the Zcash protocol, and it duly activated in November 2020.&nbsp;</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			  Process and Timeline for Submitting Proposals 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>Both ZF and ECC agree that it is desirable to gain clarity regarding the future of funding in the Zcash ecosystem sooner, rather than later. Therefore, we aim to conduct a first round of community sentiment gathering by polling ZCAP in December (alongside the Zcash Community Grants election).&nbsp;</p><p>With that in mind, teams and organisations that are interested in receiving protocol funding should publicly announce their interest as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>As with the process that led to ZIP 1014, we invite community members to post proposals to the Zcash community forums, in the form of a draft ZIP for review and discussion by the community.</p><p>We will consult with the ZIP editors on whether they are willing to provide editorial feedback on the draft ZIPs (something that Daira and str4d did last time, and which was very useful in clarifying the proposals), and, if so, what deadline would be appropriate for submitting pull requests to the ZIPs Github repo in time for a December round of community sentiment gathering.&nbsp;</p><p>We will host community calls where specific proposals can be discussed, and the community can ask questions of those who are putting forward proposals.&nbsp;</p><p>After the first round of voting, we will assess the results and, if necessary, do further rounds of proposal revision and sentiment-gathering, in order to zero in on a proposal that we are confident represents the clear consensus of the Zcash community</p><p>While we don’t currently intend to formally analyze sentiment beyond the ZCAP poll, we are interested to hear suggestions and ideas&nbsp; for other means of assessing community sentiment, and we will consider other forms of community feedback collected by other parties if it is valuable and informative, and was collected in good faith.</p><p>If you have suggestions or ideas, please post them to the Zcash Community Forum, in the Governance category.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 A Note on Impartiality 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>We at the Zcash Foundation believe that the work we have carried out over the past few years has been of benefit to Zcash and the Zcash community. We hope that the Zcash community agrees, and is willing to continue funding the work of the Foundation.</p><p>However, for the avoidance of any doubt, if the Zcash community decides that the Dev Fund should end and not be replaced (or that it should be replaced but that ZF should not receive any funding), ZF will support that decision, and do what is necessary to enact it (including implementing the new consensus rules in Zebra).&nbsp;</p><p>If the Zcash community does decide to create a new Dev Fund, ZF recommends furthering the decentralization of the Zcash ecosystem by increasing the number of Dev Fund recipients, with at least one recipient in a jurisdiction outside the United States. We also recommend that any new recipients should be nonprofit entities with tax-exempt status, that are subject to legally-enforceable governance requirements similar to those required of&nbsp; 501(c)(3) organizations (e.g. prohibition of private inurement, restrictions on excessive executive compensation, financial disclosure requirements to ensure transparency and accountability).&nbsp;</p><p>We look forward to helping the Zcash community reach consensus on this important decision, which will have a far-reaching impact on the future of Zcash!</p>

The total budget for this round of Minor Grants is $75,000.</p><p>Minor Grant applications are submitted to a poll of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP). To be eligible for funding, applications must receive greater than 50% approval in the poll, and grants will be funded in order of priority determined by the level of ZCAP’s approval, and as the total budget ($75,000) permits.</p><p>We’re pleased to present 20 applications that were submitted to this round of the Minor Grants program. Below are the links to the grant applications (in PDF format), listed in alphabetical order:</p><p>You can also <a href="https://zfnd.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zcash_Minor_Grants_applications_October_2023.zip">download a ZIP file containing all 20 PDFs</a> (6MB).&nbsp;</p>

<p>When we compute a ZK circuit we are not just executing some code, but proving that we have executed the code correctly.</p><p>Take a program that computes x + y = z. It's not enough for a ZK program to simply output z, the program also needs to prove that x + y was executed correctly to arrive at the value&nbsp;z.</p><p>Producing the proof requires establishing constraints.</p><p>In other words, circuits are comprised of constrained functions -meaning ZK programs that generate proofs based on a set of constraints.</p><p>So why then, would you need a function with no constraints — an unconstrained function? You might think unconstrained functions would be unsafe, given their name — like taking the guardrails off of a ZK circuit. And you’d be&nbsp;right!</p><p>Circuit code without constraints can be “proven” to create any outcome! Rather than creating a proof that deterministically proves the validity of a piece of code, unconstrained functions allow you to execute code that would otherwise be very expensive or difficult to compute inside the&nbsp;circuit.</p><p>But being able to execute logic outside of a circuit is critical for both circuit performance and constructing proofs on information that is external to a&nbsp;circuit.</p> When to&nbsp;use <p>Generally, we want to use unconstrained functions whenever there’s something that’s easy to verify but hard to compute within the&nbsp;circuit.</p><p>An unconstrained function simply executes code as you would expect in a normal programming execution environment.</p><p>In this post we want to make sure that developers who are tapping into the performance benefits of unconstrained functions aren’t incorrectly implementing unconstrained functions in a way that leads to worse security for their programs. Incorrect usage of unconstrained functions could lead to bugs, and zk development overall is a newer, scarier paradigm. We want to make it easy for developers to use <a href="https://aztec.network/aztec-nr/">Noir</a> to write performant and secure ZK programs, and unconstrained functions can help them optimize their circuits when implemented correctly.</p> Simple division <p>Assuming proving divisions in ZK is costly while proving multiplications is easy, and we want to prove the computation of 100 /&nbsp;5.</p><p>Proving 100 / 5 = x directly in ZK would be inefficient:</p>Unconstrained Functions in Noir&nbsp;6<p>Instead, we might use unconstrained functions to optimize our circuits. A more optimized approach would&nbsp;involve:</p><p>1. Computing 100 / 5 = x in an unconstrained manner</p><p>2. Proving x * 5 = 100 in&nbsp;ZK</p><p>Here’s a way to optimize the same division operation:</p>Unconstrained Functions in Noir&nbsp;7<p>Cautious readers however might notice both the code excerpts above yield approximately the same number of constraints in Noir’s abstract circuit intermediate representation (ACIR) given the optimization is simple enough to implement in Noir’s compiler.</p><p>The key intuition here is that in a ZK execution environment, proving multiplications is cheaper than proving divisions.</p><p>Given all Noir programs compile to an intermediate representation called the Abstract Circuit Intermediate Representation (ACIR), we can judge circuit optimization on both ACIR opcodes and the ultimate number of backend circuit&nbsp;gates.</p><p>This simple division case has 2 ACIR opcodes and 7 final backend circuit gates. The unoptimized version where we check assert(x == 20) has 3 ACIR opcodes and 8 final backend circuit sizes. Our optimization reduced the final backend size by one gate. Given this is a super simple example, let's dive into a more complex case where the optimizations are more meaningful.</p> A more complex&nbsp;example <p>Colin Nielsen, developer in the Noir community wrote the following code for converting unsigned integers (uints) to u8 arrays, without the use of unconstrained functions.</p><blockquote>👀 See Colin’s <a href="https://twitter.com/colinrives">Twitter</a> +&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/colinnielsen">Github</a></blockquote><p>Here’s the unoptimized code:</p>Unconstrained Functions in Noir&nbsp;8<p>This code has 91 total ACIR opcodes and a circuit size of 3,619. A lot of the operations in this function are already optimized away by the compiler (e.g., all the bitshifts turn into divisions by constants).</p><p>However, we can save a bunch of gates by casting to u8 a bit earlier. This automatically truncates the bitshifted value to fit in a u8, which allows us to remove the XOR against&nbsp;0xff.</p><p>This is what the slightly-optimized code looks&nbsp;like:</p>Unconstrained Functions in Noir&nbsp;9<p>ACIR opcodes generated: 75</p><p>Backend circuit size:&nbsp;3,143</p><p>Already, this saves us ~480 gates in total, but we can do&nbsp;better.</p><p>This code is all constrained, so we’re proving every step of the calculation using num. But in fact, we don't actually care about how we make the calculation, just that the computation is&nbsp;correct.</p><p>This is where unconstrained functions come&nbsp;in.</p> Optimizing with unconstrained functions <p>It turns out that truncating a u72 into a u8 is hard to do inside of a SNARK. Each time we do this operation to truncate down into u8, we lay down 4 ACIR opcodes, which get converted into multiple&nbsp;gates.</p><p>It’s actually much easier to calculate num from out, rather than the other way around. All we need to do is multiply each element of out by a constant and add them all together, both of which are relatively easy operations to do inside of a&nbsp;SNARK.</p><p>So, instead of truncating u72 into u8, we can run u72_to_u8 as unconstrained function code in order to calculate out. Then, we can use that result in our constrained function and assert that if we were to do the reverse calculation, we'd get back&nbsp;num.</p><p>An example of what this looks like is&nbsp;below:</p>Unconstrained Functions in Noir&nbsp;10<p>Total ACIR opcodes generated: 78</p><p>Backend circuit size:&nbsp;2,902</p><p>This usage of unconstrained functions ends up optimizing our circuit even further and taking off another ~250 gates from our&nbsp;circuit!</p><p>We’ve ended up with more ACIR opcodes than before, but these are easier for the backend to prove (resulting in fewer gates overall). This is the beauty of using unconstrained functions — optimizing code that’s easy to verify but hard to compute within the&nbsp;circuit.</p><p>Put differently, unconstrained functions allow you to reformulate certain pieces of code that are easier to check than to execute directly in a ZK&nbsp;circuit.</p> Resources <p>For more on unconstrained functions, see this post by Tom French in the official Noir docs: <a href="https://noir-lang.org/language_concepts/unconstrained/">https://noir-lang.org/language_concepts/unconstrained/</a></p><p>Are you a developer interested in getting started with&nbsp;Noir?</p><p>Jump into the <a href="https://github.com/noir-lang/noir-starter">noir-starter Github repo</a> and when you’re ready <a href="https://aztec.network/grants/">apply for a Grant</a> — we’re currently supporting Noir use-cases through the end of&nbsp;2023.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/unconstrained-functions-in-noir/">https://aztec.network</a> on September 26,&nbsp;2023.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/unconstrained-functions-in-noir-b6884d697679">Unconstrained Functions In Noir</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol">The Aztec Labs Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p><p>Horizen EON Forger Nodes will soon be available to the public for anyone who wishes to participate in the EON network.</p>



<p>Available on the Proof-Of-Stake Horizen EON chain, these nodes are different from the Proof-Of-Work Horizen mainchain nodes. How do these two types of nodes differ, and how do they each play a critical role in securing the network?</p>



<p>Before understanding the importance of these forger nodes, it’s important to first remember or learn some blockchain terms.</p>



 What is the Horizen mainchain and the Horizen EON sidechain? 







<p>The Horizen mainchain is a <a href="https://www.horizen.io/academy/layer-0/">layer 0</a> chain whose native cryptocurrency is ZEN. It doesn’t natively support smart contracts but natively supports the creation of sidechains.</p>



<p>A sidechain is an independent blockchain that runs parallel to the Horizen mainchain and inherits its security. Sidechains can be used to extend the capabilities of the mainchain, for example by enabling smart contracts, token minting, voting, etc. In addition, ZEN can be transferred back and forth between the mainchain and sidechains (as a gas token) using the forward and backward transfer mechanism.</p>



<p>The Horizen sidechains and the mainchain are independent of each other. A sidechain can have its own consensus and does not rely on the mainchain to grow and add more blocks.</p>



<p>Horizen EON is a dedicated sidechain that implements an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This brings smart contract capabilities to the Horizen ecosystem.</p>



<p>Thanks to the forward and backward transfer mechanism, it’s possible to mint ZEN on Horizen EON by locking an equal amount of ZEN on the mainchain and vice versa. This is important for two reasons:</p>



 
 ZEN are required to pay gas fees on Horizen EON. 



 Horizen EON brings programmability to ZEN. Once ZEN are transferred to Horizen EON, it’s possible to operate on them with all the flexibility enabled by smart contracts.&nbsp; 
 



 Why does the Horizen EON sidechain need forger nodes? 







<p>Horizen’s mainchain operates on a proof-of-work consensus, meaning that it is the miners (in this case, ASICs) who compete to add new blocks to the blockchain and validate transactions.</p>



<p>Currently, The Horizen blockchain has a block reward system where the miner who completes the block receives 60% of the reward for this work. Then 10% goes to the Secure Nodes operators, 10% to the Super Nodes operators, and 20% to the ecosystem Treasury.</p>



<p>Secure Nodes and Super Nodes may sound like a hybrid POS/POW system, but they’re not. On Horizen, Secure Nodes and Super Nodes were created to add an extra layer of security to the network by allowing the community to keep a copy of the blockchain and be compensated for verifying transactions validated by miners.</p>



<p>This multi-layer node system has been in place since 2018. In the meantime, the needs of the network have evolved, particularly with the release of Zendoo and Horizen EON, Horizen’s EVM-compatible sidechain. As a result, the current Secure Node minimum requirements are no longer sufficient to provide any benefit to the Horizen network. Furthermore, with <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/upcoming-deprecation-of-the-horizen-mainchain-shielded-pools/">the removal of the shielded pools on mainchain</a>, the need for Secure Nodes is diminished. The subpar performance and the lack of usage of Secure Nodes pose a burden to the chain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, there is a strong need for forger nodes in the EON chain. The Horizen EON chain is consensus and scalability-independent. To achieve consensus independence, it is necessary for the chain to have its own nodes to validate the transactions taking place on its chain.</p>



 Forger nodes permit to secure the network 



<p>In a Proof-of-Stake chain, the nodes are called forger nodes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forger nodes play a critical role in PoS consensus by creating blocks, validating transactions, enhancing security, and promoting efficiency and decentralization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forger nodes are critical to Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus for several reasons:</p>



 
 Block production: They create new blocks in the blockchain, with their chance of being selected often based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold as collateral. 



 Transaction validation: Forger nodes validate and add transactions to the blockchain, ensuring that only valid transactions are recorded. 



 Security: They’re financially motivated to act honestly because they’ve staked their own tokens as collateral, risking loss if they behave maliciously. 



 Energy efficiency: PoS is more environmentally friendly than PoW because it doesn’t require the same amount of computing power. 



 Sybil attack resistance: PoS networks are less vulnerable to Sybil attacks, where an attacker creates many fake nodes to gain control. 



 Decentralization: Forging nodes contribute to network decentralization, allowing a wider range of participants to be involved. 
 



<p>There is an open Zen Improvement Proposal (ZenIP) for redirecting Secure Node block rewards to EON forger node. The purpose of this proposal is to drive the success of the Horizen EON network by increasing the security and decentralization through forger nodes. The current Secure Node operators are well-equipped to provide this type of support. For more information about this ZenIP, please visit “ <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42206-explained-redirect-horizen-secure-node-rewards-into-horizen-eon/">ZenIP 42206 Explained: Redirect Horizen Secure Node Rewards Into Horizen EON</a>”.</p>

 The launch of the Horizen DAO marks the beginning of a new era of participatory governance for the Horizen community. 



<p><a href="http://horizen.io">Horizen</a> is an open-source, public protocol with a broad and diverse ecosystem that includes developers, miners, node operators, and $ZEN holders across multiple blockchain networks. The launch of the Horizen DAO makes it easier for Horizen community members to get involved in governance and make their voices heard in the direction of the project.&nbsp;</p>



 About Horizen DAO 



<p>DAO stands for “Decentralized Autonomous Organization,” which has emerged as the standard for decentralized governance in the blockchain space and beyond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Horizen has always been a community-driven project and has long recognized that a strong social layer is crucial for maintaining integrity across the ecosystem. This approach is directed by the guiding values of:</p>



 
 Transparency 



 Accountability 



 Security 



 Community involvement 



 Continuous improvement 



 Social responsibility 
 



<p>Read more about the Horizen guiding values on<a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/about"> the Horizen governance page</a>.</p>



 Proposal Phases and Voting Process 



<p>The Horizen DAO further decentralizes decision-making for technical, non-technical, and other substantive improvements to the system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Protocol Improvement Proposals (IPs) are an established mechanism used to select and implement new features and core protocol changes in many blockchain projects. In Horizen’s case, this IP process is the key tool for the Horizen DAO’s community-led governance. With Horizen’s native token, $ZEN, serving as the governance token for both the Horizen mainchain and the EON sidechain, IPs for each are called, respectively, ZenIPs and EONIPs.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>


 
 


<p>$ZEN holders are the ultimate decision-makers for the future of Horizen and exercise governance over the network’s evolution through participating in the Horizen DAO. Any $ZEN holder can vote on improvement proposals, and those who hold (or who have been delegated) the requisite amount of $ZEN may put forth proposals to the community. To facilitate effective community governance, users will also be able to delegate voting power to individuals they view as effective stewards of the Horizen ecosystem guiding values.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Detailed information about Horizen DAO, including the improvement proposal phases, voting process, Constitution, and more, can be found on <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/about">the Horizen Governance page</a>. So check out the site and get involved to help shape the future of Horizen–we’re glad you’re along for the journey!</p>

<p>With the <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/node-software-upgrade-zen-4-1-0-is-available-to-download/">hard fork that was activated at block 1426200</a> (September 26th 2023), private addresses can no longer receive ZEN from transparent addresses. This affects both Secure and Super Nodes’ ability to continue to perform challenges, and the ability to set up new nodes which currently requires a balance in a shielded address.</p>



<p>Starting September 26, 2023, challenges in both systems are suspended indefinitely. The increased requirements of successfully validating certificates introduced with the registration of EON will serve as a substitute for challenges in the interim.</p>



 Steps for Node Operators 



<p>Existing Nodes<br>There should be no effect on any existing nodes unless the node’s wallet is replaced. See New Nodes below.</p>



<p>Any API calls from a node operator requesting a manual challenge should be stopped.</p>



<p>New Nodes<br>If a new node is created (or a new wallet is created) it will need to follow the current guide. One private address will still need to be created and a very small amount of ZEN sent to it to give the private address a balance. The ZEN will need to be sent from another private address. This is a workaround until a new version of the Nodetracker is published.</p>



 System Changes 



 
 An updated version of the Nodetracker software that removes the check for private addresses will be available for new nodes once testing is complete. 



 An updated version of the tracking server software that disables challenges (instead of just suspending) will be rolled out once testing is complete. 
 



<p>After the system changes have been implemented, Node Operators are free to start withdrawing funds previously required for challenges from their shielded addresses to transparent addresses.</p>

  Partnering with PartyKit: Everything is Better with Friends  <p>Sunil and his team are turning lonely online tasks into collaborative multiplayer experiences.</p>   
	By Bogomil Balkansky	 



Published September 26, 2023
  



Team PartyKit: CXO Sylwia Vargas, Founder Sunil Pai and CTO Jani Eväkallio.



 
<p>I am a student of antiquity. At age 10, while many of my peers in the tech industry were learning how to code, I was buried somewhere between the sixth and fifth centuries BC, learning Latin and ancient Greek. (To this day I have some highly marketable skills—like reciting Virgil in the original.) One lesson that stuck with me from those studies is something Aristotle said many centuries ago: that we humans are “social animals.” As markets and technologies have come and gone, this part of our nature has been slow to change; <a href="https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/this-study-of-300000-people-reveals-1-secret-to-living-a-longer-healthier-life.html">dozens of studies</a> on health and longevity show that no matter what we do in life, it is better with friends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By that measure, the Internet is not an ideal environment for us—because our digital experiences are so often lonely. We spend 8-10 hrs a day in front of our screens largely alone. Collaborative editing in Google Docs, collaborative design in Figma, and multiplayer video games are the rare exceptions that give us a taste of what the good life on the internet could be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The view that all business apps require multiplayer collaboration is not necessarily universally held. The skeptic might ask how many Google Docs and Figmas there can be, i.e., how many apps truly require real-time, multiplayer collaboration?</p>



<p>Such skepticism is a failure of imagination, anchored in how things have been rather than how things can be. The fact is very few business processes are truly single-player; even something as mundane as expense reports requires collaboration, as does every other workflow that involves approvals. But these naturally multiplayer experiences have been artificially constrained into sequential, asynchronous workflows that can take weeks to complete.</p>



<p>Imagine instead you could just tag your manager or colleague in finance—or your friendly AI-driven finance copilot—to review your expense report, and they could flag anything that needs fixing on the spot. Historically, creating that kind of collaborative experience required a lot of hard work and technical sophistication. The likes of Google could do it, but your average SaaS startup could not. And while some new technologies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">CRDT</a> libraries have been inching us closer to multiplayer experiences, they still require a lot of technology integration and many hours of engineering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enter <a href="https://www.partykit.io/">PartyKit</a>, a developer-friendly platform for real-time human-to-human and human-to-AI collaboration. PartyKit does the heavy lifting for you, enabling multiplayer experiences with a few lines of Javascript code. It is easy to customize; it includes all the analytics, and other tools you need to build production apps; and because it is open source, it can run on your organization’s own infrastructure—or even your own laptop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we first met PartyKit founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunil-pai-a47732253/">Sunil Pai</a> earlier this year, we fell in love with his velocity and can-do attitude. Case in point is the way he got hired at Cloudflare: after he complained on X (formerly known as Twitter) about certain aspects of the developer experience, they invited him to join the team and fix it—which he did. During <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/sequoia-arc/">Sequoia Arc</a>, we got to know Sunil very well, and were impressed with his contagious enthusiasm for his creation; he was quick to show anyone who was interested a demo on his phone. As they say, ABC—always be closing!</p>



<p>During the beta period, we were also impressed with the diversity of applications users found for PartyKit, from a <a href="https://www.tldraw.com/">drawing app</a> to a <a href="http://v/">state machine</a> to an <a href="https://sitegpt.ai/">LLM-based customer service agent</a>. And those are just small hints of what’s to come; as we celebrate the general availability of the platform, we will no doubt be surprised in the weeks and months ahead by the multitude of use cases PartyKit enables! We are proud to support Sunil and his team as they continue to grow, and we look forward to the better, less lonely internet we’ll all enjoy as they work to make collaborative multiplayer experiences the norm.</p>

 📖 Deep dive: How Machiavellian principles could help fix decentralized governance <p>Miles Jennings</p><p>Whatever you make of Renaissance-era Italian philosopher and political operator Niccolo Machiavelli (who inspired the word “Machiavellian” for better or worse), many of the principles he explored in his writings remain relevant today. For instance, we can see echoes of such principles -- on leadership and the preservation of political liberty -- in both the Federalist Papers and design of the U.S. Constitution.&nbsp;</p><p>But several Machiavellian principles can also be applied to fix decentralized governance, particularly issues with DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) in web3. How? Because Machiavelli’s philosophy during that time was developed with a very pragmatic understanding of the struggle for social power, as well as the premise that no mechanism exists to guarantee virtuous actions.&nbsp;And while most DAOs have developed, as a first step, simplified models of governance based on direct democracy, indirect democracy, and corporate governance -- these approaches have failed to overcome the complex sociopolitical realities involved in decentralized governance. </p><p>So in this set of articles, Jennings examines issues facing DAOs today; and outlines current solutions such as subDAOs, delegate programs, governance minimization, and others, as well as their limitations. Jennings then shares how 4 Machiavellian principles can help design more effective DAOs and better decentralized governance, including minimizing governance and checking-and-balancing the leadership class.</p><p>read more on Machiavelli for DAOs:<br>…<a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/machiavelli-principles-dao-decentralized-governance/">Principles for Fixing Decentralized Governance</a> (part 1)<br>…<a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/machiavelli-daos-designing-effective-decentralized-governance/">Designing Effective Decentralized Governance</a> (part 2)</p><p>share on: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1705276359831060654?s=20">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0x22ba35">Farcaster</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7111042659175059456">LinkedIn</a><br><br>see also: </p>  <p>“a16z suggests Machiavelli to fix decentralized governance”, by Ana Paula Pereira in <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/a16z-machiavelli-fix-decentralized-governance">Cointelegraph</a>&nbsp;</p>  <p>“Lightspeed Democracy: What web3 organizations can learn from the history of governance”, by Andrew Hall and Porter Smith on <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/lightspeed-democracy-what-web3-organizations-can-learn-from-the-history-of-governance/">a16zcrypto.com</a></p>   🇬🇧 Announcing: Crypto Startup School goes to London <p>Jason Rosenthal&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/crypto-startup-school/">Crypto Startup School</a> (CSS) is our popular accelerator program for early-stage companies, providing expert guidance, capital, and resources tailored for crypto founders.

<p>Protecting users from total transparency is crucial for addressing one of the main hurdles facing DeFi adoption: data privacy.</p><p>In a system where blockchain transparency can be maliciously exploited, alpha decay and surveillance are inevitable, making the current state of decentralized finance incompatible with traditional services. As such, addressing our networks’ inherent concerns can only be done with robust controls and proactive strategies in place to prevent the misuse of decentralized tools.</p><p>To this end, and in an ecosystem milestone, <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther Protocol</a> and its DAO are debuting a suite of zero-knowledge compliance solutions. This initial release integrates <a href="https://purefi.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">PureFi</a>'s services to create a path to compliance and data privacy in DeFi. </p> Panther Protocol’s approach to compliance <p>Panther Protocol’s goal is to create a cross-chain architecture that enables seamless access to DeFi while preserving the privacy of users’ data and activity. The protocol leverages the security and liquidity of existing networks while integrating zero-knowledge technology for users to have full control over their data. The protocol’s v1 also integrates these features into a solution that DeFi enthusiasts can use to access their favorite protocols.</p><p>In a first-of-its-kind approach that complements its decentralized structure, Panther introduces an innovative method to manage compliance risks. Panther integrates third-party<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/"> compliance providers</a>, operating autonomously from the protocol, to authenticate users, offering them a unique set of credentials after users complete a series of verifications. These credentials then serve the dual purposes of:</p>  Crafting zero-knowledge proofs directly within their browsers.  Seamlessly integrating with blockchain-based <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">DIDs </a>and similar platforms.  <p>Due to the flexibility of this design, Panther users can access the protocol without being bound to a single compliance provider, being able to choose from a variety of them. Once verified, users can then present these credentials as an irrefutable attestation to their authenticity, granting them unhindered access to the protocol. As a result, Panther can retain its neutrality while giving users a path to complying with regulations.</p> Integrating PureFi<br> <p>In the process of selecting a compliance vendor suitable for Panther’s compliance flow and willing to support the proposed architecture, the Panther DAO elected PureFi.</p><p>PureFi has gained recognition in the Web3 space by pioneering the use of technologies such as decentralized verifiable credentials. The protocol’s goal is to become a one-stop decentralized compliance solution that onboards institutional money to DeFi. PureFi also actively participated in the Panther DAO’s discussions surrounding compliance integrations.</p><p>For Panther’s v1 release, the integration will fulfill the following functions (with all zero-knowledge capabilities built by the Panther team and PureFi in charge of compliance procedures):</p>  Capturing users’ data (email, name, birth date, and nationality) upon their first attempt to access the protocol.  Issuing a signed zk-friendly attestation of the user sharing their data, tied to the user’s wallet (which the user can use as a “Master” account to identify themselves).  Running KYT checks (aka “wallet screening”) to analyze AML/CTF risks of a deposit/withdrawal, both on the receiver’s and sender’s end, and issuing zk-friendly KYT attestations upon passing.  Maintaining an on-chain list of valid cryptographic keys (i.e., certificates) of compliance providers, including the EdDSA public key available on Polygon.  Escrowing the compliance provider’s backup keys with a reliable 3rd party, e.g., a law firm, to be used in case PureFi goes offline.  <p>Importantly, the integration is designed to be compatible with any compliance provider or multiple of them simultaneously.</p> In Summary <p>Zero-knowledge, decentralized compliance, and self-sovereign identity solutions create a technology stack that, for the first time ever, opens a seamless path to compliance while protecting users’ privacy. Panther and PureFi are proud to announce a collaboration that will set the foundation for greater adoption of these solutions and Decentralized Finance as a whole.</p><p>Panther’s <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/">compliance integrations</a> can already be tested by ZK technology and DeFi enthusiasts at <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet/testnet-stages?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther’s Testnet Stage 1</a>, released earlier this month. To test, read <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage-1-compliance-integrations-is-now-live-heres-how-to-test/">Panther’s official Stage 1 announcement</a>. Testers can go through the verification flow, create Panther Accounts, and get an exclusive look at Panther's v1!</p> About PureFi Protocol <p>PureFi Protocol allows dApps to fully comply with local and global regulations while preserving decentralization and user anonymity.</p><p>Developed by AMLBot in partnership with Hacken Foundation to provide a full-cycle solution for crypto asset analytics and AML/KYC procedures for the Web3 infrastructure.</p><p><a href="https://purefi.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> |<a href="https://dashboard.purefi.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Dashboard</a> |<a href="https://wp.purefi.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Whitepaper</a> |<a href="https://t.me/purefiprotocol?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> TG Chat</a> |<a href="https://t.me/purefipro?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> TG ANN</a> |<a href="https://medium.com/purefi?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Medium</a> |<a href="https://twitter.com/Purefi_Protocol?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Twitter</a></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther's zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

<p>On stage at Messari Mainnet today in New York, Brave, Electric Coin Co. (ECC), and Filecoin Foundation announced that they are teaming up to bring innovative new privacy features to the Brave browser and its integrated Web3 wallet.</p>

 Private transactions for all&nbsp; 
<p>With support from ECC, Brave will integrate the Zcash protocol in the browser’s built-in crypto wallet so users can securely store, send, and receive ZEC alongside other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The integration underscores Brave’s commitment to blending privacy, transparency, and user choice. With private transactions possible alongside public ones, users will have greater control over their Web3 activity.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m excited about integrating Zcash into the Brave web browser because privacy should be normal. The Brave browser is a tool that tens of millions of people are using for everyday communication, web browsing, shopping, and other activities. This gives them access to money that respects their security and consent. I’m thrilled for this launch — and what’s to come — as a result of this partnership with Brave and Filecoin Foundation.”</p>
<p>— Zooko Wilcox, CEO, Electric Coin Co.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“This partnership with like-minded organizations reinforces Brave’s mission for a more private and user-first Web. Not only do we hope to make it simple to use ZEC for private transactions, but we also aim to maximize privacy during key moments of purchase or exchange.”</p>
<p>— Yan Zhu, CISO, Brave</p>
</blockquote>

 A private and decentralized messaging feature 
<p>Brave, ECC, and Filecoin Foundation also teased plans on stage to develop a new, privacy-based feature in the Brave browser that will offer private messages and media transmission via the Zcash protocol. InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) – the technology underlying the Filecoin protocol – will play a crucial role in providing secure storage for the encrypted content.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We’re thrilled to be a part of this important project. We believe cryptocurrency can be the foundation for a better Internet — an alternative to big tech that puts people in control of their own data, protects user privacy and security, and permanently preserves humanity’s most important information.”</p>
<p>— Marta Belcher, President, Filecoin Foundation</p>
</blockquote>


    
    

    


    



    
    

<p>Brave</p>
<p>Brave Software’s fast, privacy-oriented browser, combined with its blockchain-based digital advertising platform, is reinventing the Web for users, publishers, and advertisers. Users can opt into privacy-respecting ads that reward them with the Basic Attention Token (BAT), a frequent flyer-like token they can redeem or use to tip or contribute to publishers and other content creators. Brave is a driving force leading the way for Web3 adoption, directly supporting Web3 into the broader Web through its privacy browser, independent search engine, and browser-native, multi-chain crypto wallet. Brave currently has over 60 million monthly active users and 1.8 million Creators. Learn more at <a>brave.com</a>.</p>
<p>Electric Coin Co.</p>
<p>Electric Coin Co. launched Zcash in 2016 and continues to support the protocol and user experience, alongside other developers and teams. Zcash is a cryptocurrency built to empower economic freedom. It is similar to Bitcoin in its design, but it uses a privacy technology that encrypts transaction information and allows users to shield their assets. Our vision for Zcash is that it will provide equal access to economic systems and give everyone the ability to participate in economic activity.

<p>Filecoin Foundation</p>
<p>Filecoin Foundation (FF) facilitates governance of the Filecoin network, funds research and development projects for decentralized web technologies, and supports the growth of the Filecoin ecosystem and community. Its mission is to preserve humanity’s most important information. Learn more at <a href="https://fil.org/">fil.org</a>.</p>

 <blockquote>Different approaches to private asset velocity in light of the Privacy Pools paper.</blockquote> <br>Introduction <p>Public blockchains inherently champion transparency. The cornerstone of this architecture allows anyone to validate transactions without dependence on centralized intermediaries. This transparency, while advantageous in many respects, also accentuates the pressing need for privacy, especially given the escalating prominence of platforms like Bitcoin and Ethereum, their DeFi applications, and adoption by institutions.<br><br>The industry has various challenges to solve to deliver privacy-enhancing protocols: transaction linkability, network privacy, and private key management are some. There have been commendable strides in these areas, such as the development of Layer-1 blockchains like <a href="https://z.cash/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Zcash</a>, which offers private transactions, and smart contract solutions like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_Cash?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Tornado Cash</a>, which breaks the transaction link between deposit and withdrawal addresses on Ethereum. Due to their permissionless nature and approach, these systems are currently not designed for risk management. Notably, Tornado Cash was rampantly used for cybercrime money laundering activities. According to Buterin: “Tornado Cash has also been used by various bad actors. Deposit data suggests that hacker groups have moved funds from illicit sources through the protocol.” (<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4563364&amp;download=yes&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Buterin et al.</a>, page 1). While Tornado Cash had its pitfalls, notably its usage by malicious actors (causing the protocol to get internationally sanctioned), the root cause of such vulnerabilities isn't necessarily technological but rather structural and was meant to be exploited.<br>At its core, the true sentiment we need to grapple with is this: compliance, while ensuring standardized behavior and safeguarding user interests, undeniably carries a cost – both financial and in terms of user accessibility. There's an exclusionary element to compliance, where stringent checks can sometimes inadvertently alienate non-malicious users. Furthermore, the absence of clear regulatory frameworks around decentralization and DAOs has ushered in shades of ambiguity. This uncertain environment is ripe for exploitation.</p><p>Historically, many actors in the space prioritized rapid growth over diligent compliance, often underestimating or even ignoring the long-term repercussions of such a strategy. Their motivations were straightforward – to reduce immediate costs and accelerate expansion. But such a strategy is inherently flawed. With today's well-informed user base demanding greater clarity and accountability, the repercussions of neglecting compliance have grown exponentially in magnitude. Simply put, compromising compliance for short-term gains threatens the longevity and credibility of any decentralized system.</p><p>It's essential to differentiate between ideologic and economic motives. While the decentralized movement was born from a <a href="https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">desire for autonomy and freedom from permissionless surveillance</a>, its sustained growth and mainstream adoption are undeniably tethered to economic incentives. In this case, ideology isn't the dominant force; it's the potential for economic upside. Similarly, while security concerns are paramount, they represent a distinct set of challenges, separate from those posed by compliance.</p><p>Thus, as we critique systems like Tornado Cash, it's imperative to understand that their vulnerabilities aren't just a result of technology but are deeply intertwined with larger strategic challenges and a blind eye toward solving compliant access.<br><br><a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther Protocol</a>, however, envisions a refined balance. Our goal is to augment data privacy on public blockchains while introducing a flexible approach to compliance, making it accessible to a diverse user base, from individuals to institutional giants.<br></p> Panther’s overall approach <p>Panther Protocol refines and extends the Shielded Pool concept and has developed advanced <a href="https://research.metastate.dev/multi-asset_shielded_pool?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Multi-Asset Shielded Pools</a> to include compliance features enabled by zero-knowledge proofs.</p>  Users can deposit into a <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-shielded-pools-the-cornerstone-of-panther-protocol/">Multi-Asset Shielded Pool</a> (or simply Shielded Pool) only after <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/">presenting a ZK proof of their verified status</a>, an action that's verifiable on-chain.  Transactional activities like deposits or withdrawals necessitate a ZK proof to vouch for the purity of the associated wallet address.  Upon providing the necessary proofs, users activate a zero-knowledge <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/panther-accounts?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Account</a> (or zAccount), which serves as a unique user identity record, tethering all their transactions.  Situations like regulatory scrutiny may necessitate users to reaffirm their credentials, leading to zAccount reactivation.  All interactions with the protocol are strictly based on zero-knowledge proofs, ensuring minimal data exposure on-chain.  With the zAccount system, all transactions from the same user are interconnected, and a ZK proof can be generated to showcase the volume or assets dealt with, offering a possible avenue for regulatory review.  <p>In a pioneering approach that seamlessly complements the decentralized structure we've discussed, Panther introduces an innovative method to manage compliance risks. At the heart of this strategy is the inclusion of a<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/"> compliance provider</a>, operating autonomously from the Protocol. This provider's principal role is to authenticate users, offering them a unique set of credentials after a series of verifications. These credentials then serve a dual purpose:</p><p>First, they enable users to craft zero-knowledge proofs directly within their browsers—a testament to the strategy's user-centric design. Second, in line with the modern digital identity landscape, these credentials can be seamlessly integrated with blockchain-based <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">DIDs </a>and similar platforms. Panther's vision extends even further. In a move that underscores flexibility and choice, users aren't bound to a single compliance provider. They can seek verification from any compliance provider of their choice. Once verified, users can then present these credentials as an irrefutable attestation to their authenticity, granting them unhindered access to the protocol. This strategic integration ensures multilevel compliance and amplifies user trust, forging a pathway to a more secure decentralized future.</p> <br>The Solution for the problems presented in the Privacy Pools paper. <p>In a quest to strike the right balance between privacy and compliance in decentralized finance, Panther unveils a revolutionary approach that aspires to solve the same set of issues as presented in the paper titled “Blockchain Privacy and Regulatory Compliance: Towards a Practical Equilibrium”, also known as the “<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4563364&amp;download=yes&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Privacy Pools” research paper</a>, by thought leaders such as <a href="http://vitalik.ca/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Vitalik Buterin</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ameensol?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Ameen Soleimani</a>. As highlighted in their work, "Privacy Pools-like systems allow users to achieve more privacy around their financial transaction histories and activity while retaining the ability to prove their disassociation with known illicit activity. We expect that honest users will be incentivized to participate in such a scheme by a combination of two factors: (i) the desire for privacy, and (ii) the desire to avoid suspicion.” (p.8)</p><p>Central to the Privacy Pools model is a foundational idea: "Instead of merely zero-knowledge-proving that their withdrawal is linked to some previously-made deposit, a user proves membership in a more restrictive association set." (p.4) However, Panther diverges here, adopting a more tailored approach suited for real-world applicability. Panther operates on the positive constraint that all deposits emanate from verified users with authenticated wallets. This eradicates the need for additional proof during fund withdrawals.</p><p>Users can:</p>  Attest ownership of the originating Account for their deposits.  Showcase credentials affirming the withdrawal to an address in good standing, either owned by them or a validated Account holder within Panther.  When directing withdrawals <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/defi-adaptors?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">to other DeFi protocols</a> or centralized exchanges, they can offer proof of 'source of funds', which is verifiable by the receiving party.  <p>Another aspect highlighted in the Privacy Pools paper is the inventive adaptation of the Tornado cash UTXO model. However, one of the challenges presented is the maintenance of reliable and upright Associate Set Providers within a decentralised framework. These systems employ third-party entities known as ASPs to establish association sets. While the association data resides off-chain, its Merkle proof is recorded on-chain, ensuring ASPs maintain data integrity. ASPs might encompass compliance providers or even wallet screening oracle services.</p><p>The Privacy Pools paper underscores the necessity of expansive association sets to attain the desired privacy level and to lure good depositors, distancing them from malicious actors. Panther's answer to this is the creation of "<a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools/zones?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Zones</a>". Differently from the association sets of Privacy Pools, Zones are logical divisions within a Shielded Pool, each identified by a unique Zone-ID ingrained in every UTXO commitment. This allows for entities to create and tailor their own Zone, shaping membership criteria, selecting compliance providers, meeting regulatory demands, and even facilitating interactions with other Zone members. Notably, while these Zones provide tailored functionalities, they share the same anonymity set, as they all operate under the unified MASP architecture, reinforcing the strength and integrity of the system.</p><p>For instance, as a Zone Manager, an institution would have the capability to:</p>  Designate which Zones can transact their Zone and vice versa.  Choose a new compliance provider or integrate an existing one tailored for its Zone.  Define KYC renewal durations for Zone members.  Set transactional boundaries, including deposit, withdrawal, and internal transfer limits.  <p>The advent of "Zones" thus arms regulated entities and institutions with a formidable toolset, enabling them to seamlessly conduct privacy-preserving on-chain transactions and interact with protocols, welcoming a broader spectrum of participants into the world of DeFi. This agility comes out of Panther’s UTXO design and is instrumental in tapping into new opportunities and maximizing the potential of decentralized finance.<br></p> Panther Protocol &amp; the advanced UTXO model <p>Before the broader public became acquainted with the intricacies of the Privacy Pools paper, which mentions, "The simplified, privacy-preserving coin systems above only support coin transfers in the same denomination. Zcash supports arbitrary denominations through its use of a UTXO model," (p.6) Panther Protocol was already ahead of the curve. Panther crafted a pioneering system that not only facilitated transactions in diverse denominations, but also tackled real-world challenges to amplify on-chain transactional privacy. Additionally, Panther's advanced Shielded Pools are designed to support a wide range of assets, including:</p>  <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">ERC-20</a>: The standard for fungible tokens on Ethereum, allowing for a consistent interface across multiple token contracts.  <a href="https://ethereum.org/nl/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">ERC-721</a>: A standard for representing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that can be used to represent ownership over unique items or pieces of content.  <a href="https://ethereum.org/nl/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-1155/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">ERC-1155</a>: A more generalized standard that supports both fungible and non-fungible tokens, enabling the creation of multiple token types within a single contract.  <p>With these integrations, Panther Protocol not only serves as a privacy shield for traditional tokens, but also for the blossoming world of NFTs, showcasing its versatility and forward-thinking approach.</p><p>Let’s dig a little deeper into Panther User Accounts and how they enable Compliance:</p><p>1. User Account UTXOs ( or zAccounts): At the heart of Panther's approach lies the concept of the "User Account UTXO" — a distinctive type of UTXO nestled within the broader UTXO Merkle Tree. This can be imagined as a dynamic address book or user registry that can be activated based on several criteria, such as:</p>  Association with a social network account.  Linkage to an Ethereum address.  Ties to a user’s KYC records.  <p>2. Activation and Non-Interactive Transfers: Upon Account activation, the user account registry establishes a link between the public root spending key, public reading key, and a "public" Ethereum address associated with the user. This elegant arrangement enables non-interactive transfers within the Shielded Pool, eliminating the need for the sender to fetch the receiver’s pubkeys.</p><p>3. Accounts and their utility: The fields encapsulated within the zAccount UTXO pave the way for a myriad of functionalities. For instance:</p>  The "Nonce" serves as a transaction counter for user accounts, helping in linking and ordering transactions under the same Account.  Parameters such as "Order" and "Quantity" further enhance transactional clarity.  This feature might also be employed for disclosures to provide proof of completeness.  <p>4. Expiry Time &amp; Renewal Mechanisms: Recognizing the absence of a foolproof exclusion proof, Panther has instituted an "Expiry Time"mechanism, which mandates periodic renewals of user accounts. Potential renewal methodologies could range from:</p>  Aligning with KYC renewals.  Adopting a permissionless approach.  Re-verification of humanity.  Using a zk-proof to validate the total volume of transactions remaining under specified limits.  <p>Panther Protocol's nuanced use of the UTXO model paints a future where transactions are not only private but also flexibly aligned with the intricate demands of the world of DeFi.</p> <br>Navigating the DeFi space with Panther Protocol <p>Panther's architecture, with its foundational pillars of privacy, is crowned with a structure for on-chain compliance. Yet, one might wonder –what avenues are available to Panther users to leverage the augmented privacy derived from their Panther-based transactions?</p><p>This is precisely where Panther distinguishes itself from conventional privacy paradigms:</p><p>1. Seamless integration with premier DeFi protocols<br>Panther has engineered private adaptors in collaboration with eminent DeFi protocols such as <a href="https://uniswap.org/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Uniswap </a>and <a href="https://www.curve.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Curve</a>. This enables users to execute  ‘one-click’ swaps, instantly privatizing and verifying the transaction from a regulatory standpoint.</p><p>2. Diverse platform Adaptors<br>Our vision goes beyond mere swaps. We anticipate adaptors that <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zswap-and-defi-adaptors-unlocking-private-defi-usage/">bridge Panther with an eclectic range of platforms</a>, spanning from NFT marketplaces to lending hubs and beyond.</p><p>3. zTrade: Panther’s Dark Pool<br>Panther includes an innovative solution for confidential and compliant dark pool transactions. With <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/ztrade-otc-trading?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zTrade</a>, users can preserve their trading strategies, mitigate counterparty risks, and effortlessly execute voluminous trades at pre-negotiated rates, all within the Shielded Pool.<br></p> Conclusion <p>In the ever-evolving world of decentralized technology, the quest for innovation remains perpetual. As the landscape gravitates towards establishing fully permissionless and decentralized privacy solutions, the challenge is ensuring these platforms don't inadvertently provide refuge to malicious actors. Panther recognizes this dilemma and has meticulously worked to strike a balance. By weaving in compliance features, we ensure a blend of unwavering privacy without compromising the ethos of decentralization.</p><p>An essential distinction to note is that while Panther's system might appear to have rules-based access on the surface, it operates within a decentralized framework. No centralized entity dictates or establishes the rules. Instead, the rules of compliance, tiers, and other requirements are orchestrated by the Panther DAO or by the institutional entities that will own and oversee the Zones. This approach signifies a pioneering stride in the blockchain world, merging decentralized ethos and structured compliance advantages.</p><p>Moreover, as government-issued identities gain traction in various developing nations and blockchain-based DIDs persist, the symbiosis with Panther becomes increasingly potent. We are confident that such integrations will pave the way for scalable, secure, and trustful access methods, aligning with the vision of a more inclusive and transparent decentralized world.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther's zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p><p></p>

      Generative AI’s Act Two         
	By Sonya Huang, Pat Grady, and GPT-4	 



Animation: James Buckhouse, Midjourney and Runway



Published September 20, 2023
        One year ago, we published a hypothesis that generative AI would become a profound platform shift in technology. Then came the firestorm.      



 
<p>Scientists, historians and economists have long studied the optimal conditions that create a Cambrian explosion of innovation. In generative AI, we have reached a modern marvel, our generation’s space race.</p>



<p>This moment has been decades in the making. Six decades of Moore’s Law have given us the compute horsepower to process exaflops of data. Four decades of the internet (accelerated by COVID) have given us trillions of tokens’ worth of training data. Two decades of mobile and cloud computing have given every human a supercomputer in the palm of our hands. In other words, decades of technological progress have accumulated to create the necessary conditions for generative AI to take flight.</p>



<p>ChatGPT’s rise was the spark that lit the fuse, unleashing a density and fervor of innovation that we have not seen in years—perhaps since the early days of the internet. The breathless excitement was especially visceral in “Cerebral Valley,” where AI researchers reached rockstar status and hacker houses were filled to the brim each weekend with new autonomous agents and companionship chatbots. AI researchers transformed from the proverbial “hacker in the garage” to special forces units commanding billions of dollars of compute. The arXiv printing press has become so prolific that researchers have jokingly called for a pause on new publications so they can catch up.</p>



<p>But quickly, AI excitement turned to borderline hysteria. Suddenly, every company was an “AI copilot.” Our inboxes got filled up with undifferentiated pitches for “AI Salesforce” and “AI Adobe” and “AI Instagram.” The $100M pre-product seed round returned. We found ourselves in an unsustainable feeding frenzy of fundraising, talent wars and GPU procurement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And sure enough, the cracks started to show. Artists and writers and singers challenged the legitimacy of machine-generated IP. Debates over ethics, regulation and looming superintelligence consumed Washington. And perhaps most worryingly, a whisper began to spread within Silicon Valley that generative AI was not actually useful. The products were falling far short of expectations, as evidenced by terrible user retention. End user demand began to plateau for many applications. Was this just another vaporware cycle?</p>



<p>The AI summer of discontent has sent critics gleefully grave dancing, reminiscent of the early days of the internet, where in 1998 one famous economist declared “By 2005, it will become clear that the Internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s.”</p>



<p>Make no mistake—despite the noise and the hysteria and the air of uncertainty and discontent,&nbsp; generative AI has already had a more successful start than SaaS, with &gt;$1 billion in revenue from startups alone (it took the SaaS market years, not months, to reach the same scale). Some applications have become household names: ChatGPT became the fastest-growing application with particularly strong product-market fit among students and developers; Midjourney became our collective creative muse and was reported to have reached hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue with a team of just eleven; and Character popularized AI entertainment and companionship and created the consumer “social” application we craved the most—with users spending two hours on average in-app.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, these early signs of success don’t change the reality that a lot of AI companies simply do not have product-market fit or a sustainable competitive advantage, and that the overall ebullience of the AI ecosystem is unsustainable.</p>



<p>Now that the dust has settled for a bit, we thought it would be an opportune moment to zoom out and reflect on generative AI—where we find ourselves today, and where we’re possibly headed.&nbsp;</p>



 Towards Act Two 



<p>Generative AI’s first year out the gate—“Act 1”—came from the technology-out. We discovered a new “hammer”—foundation models—and unleashed a wave of novelty apps that were lightweight demonstrations of cool new technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We now believe the market is entering “Act 2”—which will be from the customer-back. Act 2 will solve human problems end-to-end. These applications are different in nature than the first apps out of the gate. They tend to use foundation models as a piece of a more comprehensive solution rather than the entire solution. They introduce new editing interfaces, making the workflows stickier and the outputs better. They are often multi-modal.</p>



<p>The market is already beginning to transition from “Act 1” to “Act 2.” Examples of companies entering “Act 2” include <a href="http://harvey.ai">Harvey</a>, which is building custom LLMs for elite law firms; <a href="http://glean.com">Glean</a>, which is crawling and indexing our workspaces to make Generative AI more relevant at work; and <a href="http://character.ai">Character</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ava-your-digital-friend/id6446257579">Ava</a>, which are creating digital companions.&nbsp;</p>



 Market Map 



<p>Our updated generative AI market map is below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike last year’s map, we have chosen to organize this map by use case rather than by model modality. This reflects two important thrusts in the market: Generative AI’s evolution from technology hammer to actual use cases and value, and the increasingly multimodal nature of generative AI applications.</p>
 







 
<p>In addition, we have included a new LLM developer stack that reflects the compute and tooling vendors that companies are turning to as they build generative AI applications in production.</p>
 







 
 Revisiting Our Thesis 



<p>Our original <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-a-creative-new-world/">essay</a> laid out a thesis for the generative AI market opportunity and a hypothesis for how the market would unfold. How did we do?</p>



<p>Here’s what we got wrong:</p>



 
 Things happened quickly. Last year, we anticipated it would be nearly a decade before we had intern-level code generation, Hollywood-quality videos or human quality speech that didn’t sound mechanical. But a quick listen to Eleven Labs’ voices on TikTok or Runway’s AI film festival makes it clear that the future has arrived at warp speed. Even 3D models, gaming and music are becoming good, quickly.&nbsp; 



 The bottleneck is on the supply side. We did not anticipate the extent to which end user demand would outstrip GPU supply. The bottleneck to many companies’ growth quickly became not customer demand but access to the latest GPUs from Nvidia. Long wait times became the norm, and a simple business model emerged: pay a subscription fee to skip the line and access better models.&nbsp; 



 Vertical separation hasn’t happened yet. We still believe that there will be a separation between the “application layer” companies and foundation model providers, with model companies specializing in scale and research and application layer companies specializing in product and UI. In reality, that separation hasn’t cleanly happened yet. In fact, the most successful user-facing applications out of the gate have been vertically integrated. 



 Cutthroat competitive environment and swiftness of the incumbent response. Last year, there were a few overcrowded categories of the competitive landscape (notably image generation and copywriting), but by and large the market was whitespace. Today, many corners of the competitive landscape have more competition than opportunity. The swiftness of the incumbent response, from Google’s Duet and Bard to Adobe’s Firefly—and the willingness of incumbents to finally go “risk on”—has magnified the competitive heat. Even in the foundation model layer, we are seeing customers set up their infrastructure to be agnostic between different vendors.&nbsp; 



 The moats are in the customers, not the data. We predicted that the best generative AI companies could generate a sustainable competitive advantage through a data flywheel: more usage → more data → better model → more usage. While this is still somewhat true, especially in domains with very specialized and hard-to-get data, the “data moats” are on shaky ground: the data that application companies generate does not create an insurmountable moat, and the next generations of foundation models may very well obliterate any data moats that startups generate. Rather, workflows and user networks seem to be creating more durable sources of competitive advantage. 
 



<p>Here’s what we got right:</p>



 
 Generative AI is a thing. Suddenly, every developer was working on a generative AI application and every enterprise buyer was demanding it. The market even kept the “generative AI” moniker. Talent flowed into the market, as did venture capital dollars. Generative AI even became a pop culture phenomenon in viral videos like “Harry Potter Balenciaga” or the Drake imitation song “Heart on My Sleeve” by Ghostwriter which has become a chart-topping hit. 



 The first killer apps emerged. It’s been well documented that ChatGPT was the fastest application to reach 100M MAU—and it did so organically in just 6 weeks. By contrast, Instagram took 2.5 years, WhatsApp took 3.5 years, and YouTube and Facebook took 4 years to reach that level of user demand. But ChatGPT is not an isolated phenomenon. The depth of engagement of Character AI (2 hour average session time), the productivity benefits of Github Copilot (55% more efficient), and the monetization path of Midjourney (hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue) all suggest that the first cohort of killer apps has arrived. 



 Developers are the key. One of the core insights of developer-first companies like Stripe or Unity has been that developer access opens up use cases you could not even imagine. In the last several quarters, we have been pitched everything from music generation communities to AI matchmakers to AI customer support agents. 



 The form factor is evolving. The first versions of AI applications have largely been autocomplete and first drafts, but these form factors are now growing in complexity. Midjourney’s introduction of camera panning and infilling is a nice illustration of how the generative AI-first user experience has grown richer. Across the board, form factors are evolving from individual to system-level productivity and from human-in-the-loop to execution-oriented agentic systems. 



 Copyright and ethics and existential dread. The debate has roared on these hot-button topics. Artists and writers and musicians are split, with some creators rightfully outraged that others are profiting off derivative work, and some creators embracing the new AI reality (Grimes’ profit-sharing proposition and James Buckhouse’s optimism about becoming part of the <a href="https://buckhouse.medium.com/augmented-imagination-a3f4519f9784">creative genome</a> come to mind). No startup wants to be the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90942310/ai-napster-who-going-to-own-it-next">Napster or Limewire to the eventual Spotify</a> (h/t Jason Boehmig). The rules are opaque: Japan has declared that content used to train AI has no IP rights, while Europe has proposed heavy-handed regulation.&nbsp; 
 



 Where do we stand now? Generative AI’s Value Problem 



<p>Generative AI is not lacking in use cases or customer demand. Users crave AI that makes their jobs easier and their work products better, which is why they have flocked to applications in record-setting droves (in spite of a lack of natural distribution).&nbsp;</p>







<p>But do people stick around? Not really. The below chart compares the month 1 mobile app retention of AI-first applications to existing companies.&nbsp;</p>







<p>User engagement is also lackluster. Some of the best consumer companies have 60-65% DAU/MAU; WhatsApp’s is 85%. By contrast, generative AI apps have a median of 14% (with the notable exception of Character and the “AI companionship” category). This means that users are not finding enough value in Generative AI products to use them every day yet.</p>







<p>In short, generative AI’s biggest problem is not finding use cases or demand or distribution, it is proving value. As our colleague David Cahn writes, “the <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/follow-the-gpus-perspective/">$200B question</a> is: What are you going to use all this infrastructure to do? How is it going to change people’s lives?” The path to building enduring businesses will require fixing the retention problem and generating deep enough value for customers that they stick and become daily active users.</p>



<p>Let’s not despair. Generative AI is still in its “awkward teenage years.” There are glimpses of brilliance, and when the products fall short of expectations the failures are often reliable, repeatable and fixable. Our work is cut out for us.&nbsp;</p>



 Act Two: A Shared Playbook 



<p>Founders are embarking on the hard work of prompt engineering, fine tuning and dataset curation to make their AI products *good*. Brick by brick, they are building flashy demos into whole product experiences. And meanwhile, the foundation model substrate continues to brim with research and innovation.</p>



<p>A shared playbook is developing as companies figure out the path to enduring value. We now have shared techniques to make models useful, as well as emerging UI paradigms that will shape generative AI’s second act.</p>



<p>The Model Development Stack</p>



 
 Emerging reasoning techniques like chain-of-thought, tree-of-thought and reflexion are improving models’ ability to perform richer, more complex reasoning tasks, closing the gap between customer expectations and model capabilities. Developers are using frameworks like <a href="http://langchain.com">Langchain</a> to invoke and debug more complex multi-chain sequences. 



 Transfer learning techniques like RLHF and fine-tuning are becoming more accessible, especially with the recent availability of fine-tuning for GPT-3.5 and Llama-2, which means that companies can adapt foundation models to their specific domains and improve from user feedback. Developers are downloading open-source models from <a href="http://huggingface.co">Hugging Face</a> and fine-tuning them to achieve <a href="https://www.anyscale.com/blog/fine-tuning-llms-lora-or-full-parameter-an-in-depth-analysis-with-llama-2">quality</a> performance. 



 Retrieval-augmented generation is bringing in context about the business or the user, reducing hallucinations and increasing truthfulness and usefulness. Vector databases from companies like <a href="http://pinecone.io">Pinecone</a> have become the infrastructure backbone for RAG. 



 New developer tools and application frameworks are giving companies reusable building blocks to create more advanced AI applications and helping developers evaluate, improve and monitor the performance of AI models in production, including LLMOps tools like <a href="https://www.langchain.com/langsmith">Langsmith</a> and <a href="http://wandb.ai">Weights &amp; Biases</a>&nbsp; 



 AI-first infrastructure companies like <a href="https://www.coreweave.com/">Coreweave</a>, <a href="https://lambdalabs.com/">Lambda Labs</a>, <a href="https://mlfoundry.com/">Foundry</a>, <a href="https://replicate.com/">Replicate</a> and <a href="https://modal.com/">Modal</a> are unbundling the public clouds and providing what AI companies need most: plentiful GPUs at a reasonable cost, available on-demand and highly scalable, with a nice PaaS developer experience. 
 



<p>Together, these techniques should close the expectations vs reality gap for models as the underlying foundation models simultaneously improve. But making the models great is only half the battle. The playbook for a generative AI-first user experience is evolving as well:</p>



<p>Emerging Product Blueprints</p>



 
 Generative interfaces. A text-based conversational user experience is the default interface on top of an LLM. Gradually, newer form factors are entering the arsenal, from Perplexity’s <a href="https://twitter.com/alexgraveley/status/1659276299091812353">generative user interfaces</a> to new modalities like human-sounding voices from Inflection AI.&nbsp; 



 New editing experiences: from Copilot to Director’s Mode. As we advance from zero-shot to <a href="https://thezbook.com/ask-adjust-the-future-of-productivity-interfaces">ask-and-adjust</a> (h/t Zach Lloyd), generative AI companies are inventing a new set of knobs and switches that look very different from traditional editing workflows. Midjourney’s new panning commands and Runway’s Director’s Mode create new camera-like editing experiences. Eleven Labs is making it possible to manipulate voices through prompting. 



 Increasingly sophisticated agentic systems. Generative AI applications are increasingly not just autocomplete or first drafts for human review; they now have the autonomy to problem-solve, access external tools and solve problems end-to-end on our behalf. We are steadily progressing from level 0 to level 5 autonomy.&nbsp; 



 System-wide optimization. Rather than embed in a single human user’s workflow and make that individual more efficient, some companies are directly tackling the system-wide optimization problem. Can you pick off a chunk of support tickets or pull requests and autonomously solve them, thereby making the whole system more effective? 
 



 Parting Thoughts 



<p>As we approach the <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-paradox-perspective/">frontier paradox</a> and as the novelty of transformers and diffusion models dies down, the nature of the generative AI market is evolving. Hype and flash are giving way to real value and whole product experiences.</p>



<p>At Sequoia we remain steadfast believers in generative AI. The necessary conditions for this market to take flight have accumulated over the span of decades, and the market is finally here. The emergence of killer applications and the sheer magnitude of end user demand has deepened our conviction in the market.</p>



<p>However, Amara’s Law—the phenomenon that we tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run—is running its course. We are applying patience and judgment in our investment decisions, with careful attention to how founders are solving the value problem. The shared playbook companies are using to push the boundaries on model performance and product experiences gives us optimism on generative AI’s second act.</p>



<p><br>If you are building in the AI market with an eye towards value and whole product experiences, we would love to hear from you.

  AI’s $200B Question  <p>GPU capacity is getting overbuilt. Long-term, this is good. Short-term, things could get messy.</p>   
	By David Cahn	 



Published September 20, 2023
  



 
<p>The Generative AI wave, which began last summer, has gone into hyperspeed. The catalyst for this double acceleration was Nvidia’s Q2 earnings guide and subsequent beat. This signaled to the market an insatiable level of demand for GPUs and AI model training.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before Nvidia’s announcement, consumer launches like ChatGPT, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion had raised AI into the public consciousness. With Nvidia’s results, founders and investors were delivered empirical evidence that AI can generate billions of dollars of net new revenue. This has shifted the category into its highest gear yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While investors have extrapolated much from Nvidia’s results—and AI investments are now happening at a torrid pace and at record valuations—a big open question remains: What are all these GPUs being used for? Who is the customer’s customer? How much value needs to be generated for this rapid rate of investment to pay off?</p>



<p>Consider the following: For every $1 spent on a GPU, roughly $1 needs to be spent on energy costs to run the GPU in a data center. So if Nvidia sells $50B in run-rate GPU revenue by the end of the year (a conservative estimate based on analyst forecasts), that implies approximately $100B in data center expenditures. The end user of the GPU—for example, Starbucks, X, Tesla, Github Copilot or a new startup—needs to earn a margin too. Let’s assume they need to earn a 50% margin. This implies that for each year of current GPU CapEx, $200B of lifetime revenue would need to be generated by these GPUs to pay back the upfront capital investment. This does not include any margin for the cloud vendors—for them to earn a positive return, the total revenue requirement would be even higher.</p>







<p>Based on public filings, much of the incremental data center build-out is coming from big tech companies: Google, Microsoft and Meta, for example, have reported increased data center CapEx. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9dfee156-4870-4ca4-b67d-bb5a285d855c">Reports</a> indicate that Bytedance, Tencent and Alibaba are big Nvidia customers as well. On a go-forward basis, companies like Amazon, Oracle, Apple, Tesla and Coreweave should also be important contributors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The important question to be asking is: How much of this CapEx build out is linked to true end-customer demand, and how much of it is being built in anticipation of future end-customer demand? This is the $200B question.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-passes-1-billion-revenue-pace-as-big-companies-boost-ai-spending?rc=0uxjjk">The Information</a> has reported that OpenAI is generating $1B in annual revenue. Microsoft has said it expects to generate $10B in AI revenue from products like Microsoft Copilot. Let’s assume Google will generate a similar amount of revenue from its AI products, such as Duet and Bard. Let’s also assume Meta and Apple each generate $10B in revenues from AI. Let’s use a $5B placeholder for Oracle, Bytedance, Alibaba, Tencent, X and Tesla. These are all dummy assumptions—the point is that even if you assume extremely generous gains from AI, there’s a $125B+ hole that needs to be filled for each year of CapEx at today’s levels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a large opportunity for the startup ecosystem to fill this hole. Our goal is to “follow the GPUs” and find the next generation of startups that leverage AI technology to create real end-customer value. We want to invest in these companies.</p>



<p>The goal of this analysis is to highlight the gap that we see today. AI hype has finally caught up to the deep learning technology breakthroughs in development since 2017. This is good news. A major CapEx buildout is happening. This should bring AI development costs down dramatically over the long-term. You used to have to buy a server rack to build any application. Now you can use the public clouds at a much lower cost. Likewise, today many AI companies are using a large portion of their venture capital on GPUs. As today’s supply constraints give way to a supply glut, the cost of running AI workloads will come down. This should spur more product development. It should also attract more founders to build in this space.</p>



<p>During historical technology cycles, overbuilding of infrastructure has often incinerated capital, while at the same time unleashing future innovation by bringing down the marginal cost of new product development. We expect this pattern will repeat itself in AI.</p>



<p>For startups, the takeaway is clear: As a community, we need to shift our thinking away from infrastructure and towards end-customer value. Happy customers are a fundamental requirement of every great business. For AI to have an impact, we need to figure out how to leverage this new technology to make people’s lives better. How can we translate these amazing innovations into products that customers use every day, love and are willing to pay for?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The AI infrastructure build out is happening. Infrastructure is not the problem anymore. Many foundation models are being developed—this is not the problem anymore, either. And the tooling in AI is pretty good today. So the $200B question is: What are you going to use all this infrastructure to do? How is it going to change people’s lives?&nbsp;</p>

 The most ambitious software release in Aztec Labs’&nbsp;history <p>Today we’re proud to announce the Aztec <a href="https://aztec.network/sandbox/">Sandbox</a>, a local developer testnet for building end-to-end applications on&nbsp;Aztec.</p><p>Aztec is designed to be the endgame for blockchain privacy — the most complete solution for privacy-first blockchain applications ever attempted.</p><p>The Aztec Sandbox is the first milestone toward that endgame, allowing developers to write applications that leverage a full suite of privacy primitives:</p>  Private smart contract composability (including public-private composability)  Private L1-L2 function&nbsp;calls  Private state management  Hidden function execution  <p>All enabled by an intuitive software development environment that abstracts the complicated mechanisms necessary to protect user&nbsp;privacy.</p><blockquote>⬇️ Download the Aztec Sandbox at <a href="http://sandbox.aztec.network/">sandbox.aztec.network</a>.</blockquote> Background <p><a href="https://aztec.network/">Aztec Labs</a> has been laying the foundation for a privacy-preserving Ethereum L2 for&nbsp;years.</p><p>Yet building the Sandbox has taken just 5 months-a testament to the quality of our team and the ever-improving modularity of Aztec’s technology.</p><p>The Sandbox is the first major step on a development roadmap that includes a multi-phase testnet for Aztec’s execution environment, fee model, sequencers, and provers-all culminating in a privacy preserving zkRollup that is fully decentralized at mainnet&nbsp;launch.</p> What comes in the&nbsp;box? <p>The Aztec Sandbox is a comprehensive software release providing developers with a fast, lightweight local Aztec node, with features similar to Ethereum’s Ganache or Anvil local node packages.</p><p>Alongside Aztec’s local node testing environment, the Sandbox includes powerful tools and frameworks that allow developers to write and test smart contracts:</p>  Aztec Node: build and publish rollup blocks with Aztec’s node&nbsp;software  <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/master/yarn-project/aztec-rpc">Aztec RPC Server</a>: decrypt and store client-side private state, execute private functions and submit transactions to the Aztec&nbsp;Node  <a href="http://aztec.nr/">Aztec.nr</a>: write smart contracts using a comprehensive framework that extends Noir-an open-source zero knowledge programming language-with private smart contract functionality  <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/about_aztec/roadmap/features_initial_ldt#aztecjs%20">Aztec.js</a>: make RPC calls to an Aztec Node via Aztec’s Typescript wrapper  <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/docs/docs/dev_docs/cli/main.md">Aztec CLI</a>: interact directly with an Aztec Node using Aztec’s command-line tool  <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=noir-lang.vscode-noir">Noir VS Code Extension</a>: write Noir conveniently. Syntax highlighting, debugging and [other features] that make writing smart contracts in Noir utterly&nbsp;painless  <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/master/yarn-project/noir-contracts/src/contracts">Code examples</a>: get inspired by Aztec Labs-written example private smart contracts and example wallet implementations  <p>Developers should be aware that they are early adopters. You may encounter bugs or&nbsp;hiccups.</p><p>No fret.</p><p>For support related to the Aztec Sandbox, join our <a href="http://discourse.aztec.network/">Discourse forum</a>, where you can get hands-on support from Aztec Labs’ developer relation teams and build alongside the Aztec developer community.</p><blockquote>🗣 Join the conversation on Aztec Labs’ <a href="http://discourse.aztec.network/">Discourse</a></blockquote> Get Started in&nbsp;Minutes <p>The Aztec Sandbox provides a local development system for building and testing Aztec smart contracts in a fast, safe, and free environment.</p><p>The process of downloading the Sandbox, installing client libraries, and using it to deploy and use a fully private token contract on a local Aztec node takes less than 10&nbsp;minutes.</p><p>First, navigate to <a href="http://sandbox.aztec.network/">sandbox.aztec.network</a></p><p>Or curl the&nbsp;site:</p><p>/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL 'https://sandbox.aztec.network')"</p><p>A package will then download and execute, spinning up two Docker containers:</p>  Anvil  Aztec Sandbox  <p>The Sandbox will create servers on localhost ports 8545 (Anvil) and 8080 (Sandbox); ensure those ports are free to prevent any conflicts.</p><p>Within a few seconds the Sandbox should be up and&nbsp;running!</p> What can you do with&nbsp;it <p>The Sandbox is the starting point for Aztec smart contract and application developers. The Sandbox helps future-looking developers get a head-start interacting with ZK-native blockchain environments.</p><p>And as pioneers in smart contract privacy, developers will need to add a few useful heuristics to their public-blockchain mental models. Some new concepts&nbsp;include:</p>  Private state management  Account abstraction models  Understanding patterns to keep private information private  Transaction paths which span both private and public function execution  Organizing contracts into privately executable logic and publicly executable logic  <blockquote>For more about UTXO abstraction and how Aztec makes it convenient to manage manipulating private state, read our blog post <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/privacy-abstraction-with-aztec/">here</a>. For more information relating to privacy preservation best practices, see <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/dev_docs/privacy/main">here</a>. And for more about transaction architecture, see&nbsp;<a href="https://aztec.network/blog/aztecs-transaction-anatomy/">here</a>.</blockquote><p>Using Aztec.js, developers can build full-fledged applications that let&nbsp;users:</p>  write, deploy and test private smart contracts  create accounts (choosing one of various account abstraction schemes!)  manage their&nbsp;wallets  send transactions to the network and track their&nbsp;progress  query current chain state such as chain ID, block number,&nbsp;etc.  <p>Learn more about how to write an Aztec smart contract along with ready-made examples and walkthrough guides&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aztec.network/dev_docs/contracts/main">here</a>.</p> Use-cases we’re excited to&nbsp;see <p>Aztec’s <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/master/yarn-project/noir-contracts/src/contracts">smart contract examples</a> include a broad swath of use&nbsp;cases</p>  Public and private token contracts  Private DeFi  Oracle price&nbsp;feeds  Air-drop contracts  Two-party private&nbsp;escrow  Account contracts that can privately validate account credentials  <p>We’re excited to see other application primitives including private identity, fully on-chain private games, and decentralized finance protocols offering privacy by&nbsp;default.</p><p>We can’t wait to see the explosion of higher-order privacy mechanisms that will be created by remixing and composing these basic primitives into complex smart contracts and full-fledged privacy-first applications.</p> What you can’t do&nbsp;(yet) <p>The Aztec Sandbox is our minimum viable local developer testnet. While developers can begin writing smart contracts, there is no shared in-production network.</p><p>While account creation, wallet management, smart contract creation, and transaction execution are all live, fee estimation, transaction sequencing, proving, and advanced key and address functionality will be released in future iterations of the&nbsp;Sandbox.</p><blockquote>🎻 For a full current list of limitations see&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aztec.network/dev_docs/limitations/main">here</a>.</blockquote><p>You can learn how to write and test Aztec smart contracts. You just can’t deploy production applications-yet.</p> What is Noir’s relationship to all&nbsp;this? <p>Aztec Labs first developed Noir as a standalone, open-source, universal language for zero-knowledge programming. Noir is designed to be compatible across proving systems while also being verifiable to any chain, not just&nbsp;Aztec.</p><p>​​It’s no surprise then, that we’ve chosen Noir as a basis for writing smart contracts on Aztec. Using Noir, we’ve written a collection of functions, types, methods, state variables, annotations, etc. which together provide a rich, syntactically pleasing framework, to aid developers in writing intuitive and legible private smart contracts.</p><p>Imaginatively, we called this framework <a href="http://aztec.nr/">Aztec.nr</a>.</p><p>Aztec applications written with the <a href="https://aztec.network/aztec-nr/">Aztec.nr</a> framework have the advantage of features and tools developers might expect to be packaged with any smart contract framework:</p>  Contracts (including callable contract functions and inter-contract function&nbsp;calls)  Persistent state variables  Contract address semantics  Access to msg.sender and other call context information  Access to transaction context information  Access to historic blockchain data  Events (logs) (both encrypted and unencrypted)  Cryptographic primitives  Cross-chain (L1 -&gt; L2 and L2 -&gt; L1) message&nbsp;passing  <p><a href="http://noir-lang.org/">Noir</a> is an open-source language with universal applicability to zero knowledge use-cases. In fact, our hope is Noir’s extensibility allows it to be used even in non-blockchain / web2 applications!</p><p>But with Aztec.nr, Noir now fits hand-in-glove with Aztec. Noir developers now have access to the best privacy infrastructure for their applications.</p><p>Noir developers: it’s time to come&nbsp;home.</p><blockquote>🏃 Get started now at <a href="http://sandbox.aztec.network/">sandbox.aztec.network</a>.</blockquote> Front-run the&nbsp;future <p>Joining now as a Sandbox developer represents a significant opportunity to gain early access and bend the blockchain universe toward more privacy, not&nbsp;less.</p><p>At Aztec Labs we’ve worked tirelessly to make zero knowledge cryptography accessible to non-cryptographers. The Aztec Sandbox now delivers that promise in a developer-friendly package.</p><p>We’re excited by the opportunity represented by this release to begin democratizing access to fully decentralized privacy-enabled applications.</p><p>We hope you are&nbsp;too.</p> Get started <p>The fastest way to get going with the Aztec Sandbox is our starter page at <a href="http://sandbox.aztec.network/">sandbox.aztec.network</a>, which allows you to download the Sandbox, deploy an example private token contract, and do basic interactions with the contract to transfer tokens between private addresses via the Aztec&nbsp;CLI.</p> Additional resources:   <a href="http://docs.aztec.network/">Documentation</a>  <a href="http://discourse.aztec.network/">Discourse</a>  <p>Originally published at <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/announcing-aztec-sandbox-the-endgame-for-smart-contract-privacy/">https://aztec.network</a> on September 20,&nbsp;2023.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/announcing-aztec-sandbox-the-endgame-for-smart-contract-privacy-f7f883ae352d">Announcing the Aztec Sandbox: The Endgame for Smart Contract Privacy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol">The Aztec Labs Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>In August 2023, Brave released <a>Leo—Brave’s native AI assistant</a>—on its <a>Nightly channel</a>. Since then we’ve incorporated a lot of user feedback, and made numerous improvements to the feature. There are more changes on the way, and soon we will launch Leo on our full release channel, making it available to our 60 million users.</p>
<p>We thought now would be a great time to share more about how Brave is thinking about Leo, and the future AI integrations within the browser.</p>

 Background: Brave as a user agent 
<p>Brave has always been a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent">user agent</a>. A user agent is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_%28computing%29">client</a> application that gives users better control of the content they access on the Internet, without conflicts of interest between server operators – including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_tracking">third parties</a> – and the user. Leo takes this concept one step further, moving beyond the limited stance of browsing content in the way the author or creator intended. With Leo, you’re not passively consuming web pages and videos, rather you’re actively exploring content: asking tangential questions, seeking clarifications, exploring diverse viewpoints, and overall tailoring the Web to your preferences.</p>
<p>Leo “understands” the current page you’re visiting—it’s the next best thing to talking directly with the author. In fact, in many ways it’s better, as Leo can independently analyze and reason about pages, free of the author’s or creator’s biases.</p>
<p>To be clear, Brave isn’t trying to create the world’s leading Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch. Instead, our goal is to link users with top LLMs and harness them in innovative and where feasible, privacy preserving ways. Our goal is to open novel, convenient, and private use cases that are often possible only in the context of a particular user’s browsing session.</p>
<p>As with all Brave products, Leo adheres to Brave’s core values and is built with privacy by design. User inputs are always submitted anonymously through a reverse-proxy to our inference infrastructure, giving users an AI experience with unparalleled privacy. Also, conversations are discarded immediately after the reply is generated and are not persisted on Brave’s servers. As we expand Leo’s development, we will continue to integrate privacy into its features and to innovate with new approaches to give our users the privacy they expect.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    


 General release channel availability: cost and viability&nbsp; 
<p>The first step to opening <a>this amazing feature</a> to our general release channel is to make sure the cost is viable for Brave to offer to its full user base. With more than 60 million users worldwide, the cost of running Leo as-is on our general release channel would be prohibitive without a paid option. For this reason, we’ll soon be offering a premium version of Leo. Alongside the free version of this feature, the premium version will cover the costs of hosting our premium models, and for paying the API access for other premium model choices.</p>
<p>This next update to Leo will include:</p>
 
 A seamless onboarding experience for the premium upgrade, including the ability to pay for premium access with BAT. 
 The ability to select different models directly in the main Leo interface. 
 The addition of integration points from other parts of the browser into Leo. 
 Access to better models such as Llama 2 70B, and Claude Instant (by Anthropic). 
 
<p>Here’s a table that summarizes the free / premium options:</p>

<p>We’re targeting mid to late Q4 for the Leo release.</p>

 Mobile parity 
<p>Mobile parity will most likely follow shortly after the desktop release.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The focus of the mobile release will be to make sure everything from the desktop release works on Android and iOS.</p>

 Roadmap 
<p>Major enhancements and features for Leo are described and grouped into categories below. Some of these features will be available with the first release, and others will roll out during each of our browser updates.</p>

 Local persistence of conversations, and full-page interactions 
 
 Ability to store and reference past conversations locally on your device, and continue these conversations at a later date. 
 Ability to sync these conversations across devices using Brave Sync. 
 Full-page interactive UI via a URL like brave://chat (or brave://leo). 
 

 Better answers 
 
 Provide Brave Search results to the model for up-to-date information. 
 Provide <a href="https://community.brave.com/">Brave Q&amp;A</a> and <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us">Brave Support</a> to the model for user questions. 
 Provide Brave News results to the model for help answering user questions. 
 Provide cryptocurrency context to the model for help answering Web3-related questions. 
 Provide a generalized extension framework, or adopt an existing form of extensions such as ChatGPT plugins. 
 

 Richer output 
 
 Image generation as part of Leo’s possible outputs. 
 Ability to highlight text within a page that’s currently being viewed to support Leo’s claims. 
 Ability for Leo to take actions on a user’s behalf (for example, for Leo to start a Web search, change the current page to dark mode, or change a browser setting). 
 Entity highlighting of response text to link to Brave Search (for example, if an output talked about Brave, it may highlight Brave and make it a Brave Search query). 
 

 Model expansions 
 
 Continually add access to the latest-and-greatest models. 
 Expand commercial relationships to offer more model choices for premium users. 
 Larger context sizes. 
 

 Better language support 
<p>Today, if Leo is prompted in another language, it can already answer in that language (such as French and Spanish). However, not all languages are covered, and a page’s context, when used, will likely determine the response language. We’d like to add better handling for languages, and overall to expand the number of languages, and the quality of the output of those languages, by adding better international models.</p>

 Chat interface and customization 
 
 At the time of writing, context for Leo interactions can derive either from the entire page, or it can work with no context at all. In the future, we’d like to make this better via context menus, allowing users to select a specific part of a page to supply the model its interaction context. 
 We’d like to offer access to Leo via omnibox (address bar) suggestions, a new tab card, and more. 
 A CodeLlama integration into developer tools and in the sidebar, with optional injection into the current page context. 
 

 Model personalization and personification 
 
 Customize Leo’s tone and summary styles for personalized interactions. 
 User-defined boundaries, mood, and context awareness. 
 

 Content consumption 
 
 PDF summarization: the ability to interface with not only web pages and videos, but also with PDF documents. 
 Using accessibility and other information available to help models understand web pages better. 
 Image understanding via drag and drop. 
 

 Writing tools 
 
 Tools for filling in editable fields on web pages (such as formatting and generating text). 
 Grammar, spelling, and other suggestions. 
 Content suggestions, and content auto-completion. 
 

 Local model support 
 
 We’d like to offer locally running models, and even allow users to configure their own models. Doing so would open more possibilities for assisting users with their local, private Brave data (for example, making a better suggestion bar or autocomplete suggestions). 
 

 Brave Ads &amp; Brave Rewards integration 
 
 We may offer a privacy-preserving ad-supported option for those users who don’t want to buy a premium subscription, but still want premium features. 
 Thinking beyond display ads, we’d like the model to help users make purchasing decisions, via context such as detailed product information; this could entail an ad catalog and all knowledge about the products behind those ads, but not advertise or give you phony or biased information (for example, if you were trying to buy a TV, Leo could tell you it knows of a less expensive TV, or one that offers features not available in the TV you’re currently asking about). 
 We’d like to investigate how to tie this recommendation engine to Brave Rewards. 
 In these shopping scenarios, the model would always genuinely act first as the user’s agent. For instance, it might respond that a TV you were viewing had a better price elsewhere than in an online ad you may have seen. 
 
<p>With Leo by their side, users can interact with the Web in groundbreaking new ways. The future of Leo outlined in this roadmap is exciting to us. Unlike other AI assistants, Leo is not a simple chat interface. Leo is a companion for helping you make sense of the Web as you browse, while preserving your privacy and helping you stay in charge of your experience.</p>

<p>A look into Aztec’s transaction architecture</p><p>We’ve all heard that “privacy UX sucks.” We tend to&nbsp;agree.</p><p>Users want to drive a car, not change the oil. We previously discussed how we abstract Aztec’s underlying UTXO architecture with Noir Lang and Aztec.nr, Aztec’s smart contract framework.</p><p>Today we’ll cover how we improve transaction processing via account abstraction and composable public-private design.</p><p>To date, protocols focusing on user privacy have exposed the underlying privacy architecture. And it turns out that users don’t like dealing with the nuts and bolts inside the&nbsp;machine.</p><p>We think user-friendly abstractions represent the future of intuitive UX in blockchains–a necessary step to bringing crypto to parity with web2. We’ll define transaction paths, explain what they mean, and explore how they future-proof the Aztec experience for developers and&nbsp;users.</p> Ethereum Accounts, A&nbsp;Primer <p>In Ethereum, every account is controlled by a private key, commonly derived from a mnemonic. If you’ve ever created an Ethereum wallet, you’ve seen the list of words you need to engrave, memorize, or at minimum jot down to secure your&nbsp;account.</p><p>Note that we’re talking about Ethereum externally-owned accounts here (EOA’s), not contract accounts, since on Ethereum, EOA’s are the only accounts that can initiate transactions.</p><p>When you initiate a transaction on Ethereum, the network expects a signature from the private key that controls the account. If you create a signature that matches the public key associated with the transaction, the transaction is submitted with a transaction payload that instructs the Ethereum Virtual Machine on exactly what functions to&nbsp;execute.</p> Account Abstraction, aka “Seed Phrases Ain’t It,&nbsp;Chief” <p>At Aztec Labs we’ve been thinking hard about forms of account authentication beyond signatures. The use of seed phrases has significant issues:</p>  No recovery: if you lose your phrase you may lose access to your account&nbsp;forever  Confusing hygiene: you should never, ever, ever copy your phrase to your computer’s clipboard using the copy and paste&nbsp;feature  Single point of failure: anyone who has your key has full access to your&nbsp;account  <blockquote>📕 Read this post by <a href="https://twitter.com/smpalladino">Santiago Palladino</a> for more about the account abstraction designs being developed for Aztec on our <a href="https://discourse.aztec.network/t/ideas-on-account-abstraction/339">Discourse forum</a></blockquote><p>So how do we get around seed phrases and private keys as the sole forms of account validation? Seed phrases are just one very secure but very flawed form of account validation. There are myriad methods of account validation, spanning the spectrum from very secure to totally insecure, from intuitive to confusing, including but not limited&nbsp;to:</p>  Key sharding  Plaintext passwords  TouchID and other biometric signature schemes  <p>Keep in mind account validation can be as secure as you want it to be. One simple account validation scheme would be: “If you click the ‘yes’ button the account is validated.” It wouldn’t be secure AT ALL, but you could do&nbsp;it!</p><p>Account abstraction is confusing as a term, since it encompasses “everything but seed phrases,” but the holy grail of authentication would include three&nbsp;factors:</p>  Something you know (like a password)  Something you have (like a hardware wallet or Yubi&nbsp;Key)  Something you are (like biometrics or a decentralized proof of identity&nbsp;scheme)  <p>Aztec allows for combining all&nbsp;three.</p><p>But Aztec’s improvements to Ethereum go beyond the implementation of alternate authentication schemes.</p><p>Aztec’s transaction anatomy is also a bit different — users send proofs of computation rather than signing transactions from an&nbsp;EOA.</p><p>Here is the flow diagram for an Aztec transaction:</p>  User connects wallet to&nbsp;app  User expresses transaction intent  App supplies transaction info to&nbsp;wallet  Wallet executes&nbsp;function  Prove account interaction  Prove function  Wallet generates kernel&nbsp;proof  App receives kernel&nbsp;proof  Wallet broadcasts transaction to&nbsp;network  Aztec node includes transaction in rollup&nbsp;block  Ethereum finalizes L1&nbsp;block  <p>We’ll talk through each in&nbsp;turn.</p> Anatomy of a private Aztec transaction <p>Before we carve the patient open and look at its guts, know that there are two transaction paths within Aztec: private transactions and public transactions, each with their own attributes.</p><p>At the center of these transactions is something called the kernel circuit. The kernel circuit is the beating heart of the Aztec system, and validates private transactions. We’ll get back to it in a&nbsp;second.</p><p>For now let’s talk about what a blockchain transaction in general&nbsp;is:</p>  Authorization: typically a signature, but as we’ll see can be many&nbsp;things  Intent: typically a transaction payload that includes instructions such as FROM, RECIPIENT, SIGNATURE, and fee information  <p>We already discussed how Aztec allows for new forms of authorization, but how does it process transactions?</p><p>Aztec is a completely new execution environment beyond the EVM, and uses client-based zero knowledge proofs to prove individual transactions. That means the application developer’s job is to constrain functions appropriately and prove user&nbsp;intent.</p><p>Application developers can constrain user intents by writing smart contracts using Aztec.nr. In the private transfer example, the circuits behind the smart contract are checking a few conditions:</p>  Does the user own &gt;10&nbsp;DAI?  If so, destroy 10 DAI of their notes by creating nullifiers against&nbsp;them  Create a new 10 DAI note for the transfer recipient  Broadcast and encrypt the message containing the 10 DAI&nbsp;note  <p>The nullifier, new note, an encrypted log are all made public, but kept encrypted, such that the public information tells you nothing about what happened. Roughly all an observer can see is “a transaction happened here but I’m not sure&nbsp;what.”</p><p>That’s the core of Aztec’s value proposition — we know with mathematical certainty transactions are happening that follow blockchain rules, but we can’t derive any information about those transactions.</p><blockquote>📕 See our <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/privacy-abstraction-with-aztec-def9da73eb5">previous piece</a> on how Aztec’s privacy abstraction works</blockquote> Public Transactions <p>The path for public transactions is slightly different, as Aztec relies on the familiar Ethereum account-based model for public transactions.</p><p>The key to Aztec’s public transactions are unconstrained functions–Aztec’s public VM bytecode. Unconstrained functions just do “normal code stuff.” And by “normal code stuff” we mean simply execution code rather than proving execution as in Aztec’s private execution path. Unconstrained functions don’t lay down constraints. They just executes&nbsp;code.</p><p>If Aztec is a world computer, then unconstrained functions are the instructions the computer understands. Just like the EVM executes Solidity, the Aztec VM executes Aztec bytecode.</p><p>One key difference between the private and public execution paths is when code gets executed. In the private transaction example, code must be executed and proven locally–that is, before proof of the transaction is sent to Aztec’s network of&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>In the public execution path, the wallet has to receive authorization, but doesn’t process the transaction, instead sending transaction details onward to an Aztec node which then creates a proof of execution and inserts the proof into a&nbsp;block.</p><p>Because privacy is no longer a concern with public transactions, they can be sent unencrypted to the node to do efficient batch processing, rather than relying on a user’s local&nbsp;device.</p> Conclusion <p>Privacy UX sucks. Zero knowledge is complicated. Our goal is two-fold:</p>  Simplify DevEx with tools like <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/introducing-aztec-nr-aztecs-private-smart-contract-framework-54d716710407">Aztec.nr </a>— a smart contract framework that makes it intuitive to reason about private state management  Simplify UX with abstractions that help users access the blockchain with better tools than EOA signature validation  <p>Great privacy-first applications will be built on the backs of best-in-class tooling that makes it easy to build powerful software that makes preserving privacy smooth and intuitive for&nbsp;users.</p><p>That means more code, less cryptography.</p> Keep in&nbsp;touch <p>To learn more about Aztec generally, keep up to date on our <a href="http://discourse.aztec.network/">Discourse</a>, where we discuss major protocol decisions like <a href="https://discourse.aztec.network/t/request-for-proposals-upgrade-mechanisms/605">upgrade mechanisms</a> and <a href="https://discourse.aztec.network/t/request-for-proposals-decentralized-sequencer-selection/350">decentralizing sequencers</a>.</p><p>For more technical news on Aztec and Noir, join our e-mail newsletter:</p><blockquote><a href="https://embeds.beehiiv.com/83354329-29bf-48be-ba17-a99d72424ace">📬 Subscribe here to the Aztec Labs Developer Dispatch, the latest news and releases about Aztec and&nbsp;Noir</a></blockquote> Join our&nbsp;team <p>Aztec Labs is on the lookout for talented engineers, cryptographers, and business people to accelerate our vision of encrypted Ethereum.</p><blockquote>👪 If joining our mission to bring scalable privacy to Ethereum excites you, <a href="https://boards.eu.greenhouse.io/aztec">check out our open&nbsp;roles</a>.</blockquote><p>And continue the conversation with us on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/aztecnetwork">Twitter</a>.</p> Acknowledgements <p>Thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/Blulinski">Bruno Lulinsky</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Maddiaa0">Maddiaa</a> for input on this&nbsp;piece.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/aztec-transaction-anatomy-53ad2d9bc35e">Aztec Transaction Anatomy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol">The Aztec Labs Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Summary:&nbsp;Reflections on advancing digital asset regulation in 2023. How can we eliminate roadblocks and engender robust and transparent markets?</p>



<p>Like so many of us who have busy lives and demanding careers, we preciously guard our time for private life and relaxation. For me, having an overabundance of free time between jobs was daunting in its own way. I am sure that many of you, in a period of calm, also tend to want to take stock of your life, read books, clean out your closets, listen to podcasts, and do all the “things” there normally isn’t time for, while paradoxically filling the time we wish to have more of.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eventually I found a balance where I enjoyed the calm and time for positive self-reflection through lots of running and reading. Like many of you, I could not escape thinking about my profession, which frankly, I love. I contemplated how we can build on the solid work already undertaken this year in the nascent regulation of digital assets, through further collaboration and analysis, while eliminating barriers and roadblocks that aren’t helping to engender robust, fair, liquid, open and transparent markets.</p>



<p>Improve&nbsp;</p>



<p><a></a><a>&nbsp;</a>“To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often.” -Winston Churchill</p>



<p>In discussing digital assets and the events of the past year, the saying, “don’t throw out the baby with the bath water”, is often used to emphasise the importance of not discarding the positives that DLT has delivered in seeking to improve financial markets through removal of bad practices such as fraud and market manipulation (to name just a couple) and increase participation in the financial system.</p>



<p>This can also be applied to regulation. There is a tendency to think that because there is new technology, the governing policies and regulations must also be completely new, yet this is not always the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Great Financial Crisis of 2007/2008 led to many useful reforms and strong global principles and standards in the (global) financial services sector. These provide a solid foundation that can be modified, improved, and built upon for the regulation of new technologies within financial markets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many global standard setting bodies (GSSBs) have already begun to consult on and modify their principles and recommendations to provide guidance for emerging regional frameworks. There are a few foundational pieces of work by the GSSBs that have been set out over the past few years such as FATF policies<a>[1]</a>, FSB recommendations<a>[2]</a>, and IOSCO principles<a>[3]</a> aiming to improve their existing guidance and requirements and mitigate any unintended gaps.</p>



<p>At a regional level, financial regulators around the world seek to implement the improvements made by the GSSBs while also enhancing and modifying local frameworks. In Europe, work on digital assets frameworks has been predominately grounded in MiFID II. The EU’s MiCA Regulation aims to complement MiFID II, and the UK’s recent consultations have also indicated that they will seek to improve upon these frameworks, and others that are already implemented in the region.</p>



<p>North America has taken approaches that vary widely by country. The US and Canada have drawn predominately on both existing securities and commodities frameworks.&nbsp;Some, such as Bermuda have been amending existing regulation for specific topics such as issuance or custody.</p>



<p>The Asia-Pacific region has also drawn on securities regulation, as well as payments regulation. The UAE is racing ahead with a bold new approach for virtual assets while balancing these with strong securities laws and a common law framework. South America, by contrast has seen some countries jumping straight to using digital assets as legal tender and/or as a permissible mode of payment.</p>



<p>From these few examples of recent policy developments, it is clear there are frameworks that should be built upon. Regulation does not need to start from a blank sheet of paper, and market participants must continuously improve and implement best practices from the responsible innovation of the previous decade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eliminate</p>



<p>“Their knowledge of their tools is purely empirical; and they have a firm belief in the mummery that surrounds them.” – Isaac Asimov, Foundation</p>



<p>The dangers of trust without a comprehensive understanding of digital assets and regulation are hazardous, and this is arguably evident in the rhetoric from all sides. It often appears that many are blind in their beliefs and will trust without question the technology or the current regulation from those who have taught it to them. While much of this works and appears to have a high degree of social utility, many do not have a true grasp on why it works, or how to closely interrogate any individual component to ensure it works in the future with a higher degree of social utility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Danger may present itself in overzealous faith in DLT, especially when compounded by new regulations that are not proportional and are ill-fitting to new digital technologies. If those who work in technology regulation allow ‘mummery’ to induce a haze of belief in the infallibility of innovation, bad actors will continue to undermine the ecosystem. Blind belief must be eliminated, and replaced with verifiable transparency, compliance, and technical understanding from both regulators and market participants.</p>



<p>Despite much work in 2023 to advance legal definitions, there remains a lack of clarity for many market practitioners. Unclear or undecided legal status for digital assets is a clear barrier for the market. There are other missing pieces as well such as a lack of a global taxonomy for digital assets that prevent clear dialogue and comprehensive development of global frameworks.</p>



<p>The persistent use of the term “crypto” when referring to any kind of digital asset muddies the waters and puts Shiba Inu coin into the same bucket as a fully reserved fiat stablecoin or a bank issued digital bond. That is not a particularly helpful association, and a comprehensive global taxonomy could serve to eliminate some of this conflation and confusion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it is important not to blindly believe in technology, it is also important not to vilify it. In a truly technologically neutral approach DLT is not a cult, to be either worshiped or rallied against. DLT-specific risk should be assessed based on its implementation model, lifecycle activity, and network archetype and then the risk management and controls configured accordingly, with regulatory treatment to match.</p>



<p>So, what isn’t working? Ideologically, blind belief, while either favourable or punitive towards digital assets and DLT can be harmful to the market as a whole. From a legal and regulatory lens, lack of clarity both in the terms used, and the legalities that apply must also eventually be replaced by specificity and global consensus.</p>



<p>Delegate&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In dealing with the future… it is more important to be imaginative and insightful than to be one hundred percent ‘right.’” – Alvin Toffler</p>



<p>Beyond the foundational aspects of existing regulation and the problems still to be eliminated, what are aspects of the digital assets market that are not ‘solvable’ so to speak, by immediate regulation?<a>[4]</a></p>



<p>DeFi is one such still evolving area where it may be prudent for regulators to delegate further analysis and research before imposing requirements. Recently, IOSCO published their consultation on DeFi<a>[5]</a>, and the BiS also published a report on the future of DeFi<a>[6]</a>. Yet it is still evolving rapidly and difficult even to define. Even if the right definition is agreed upon, an enterprise that is truly decentralised in nature would present regulatory challenges and a unique and imaginative approach may be necessary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another item that can, and perhaps should be delegated, is RegTech. The ability for regulators to access, analyse and interpret the digital assets market is imperative. There are many RegTech solutions being created by the private sector, and regulators who leverage those innovations to implement outsourced technology, will have a fresh capability for digital supervision and this is pivotal to complete the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are only two areas where perhaps creativity is needed to solve the problem. As progress is made, neither the public nor private sector may always have the ‘right’ answer, however with insight, and imagination, these answers can evolve to contribute to the broader framework in innovative ways.</p>



<p>My reading, running, and at times, at times self-absorbed reflections left me a singular conclusion – it is clear there is much to be improved upon, but not in the sense that what already exists is not beneficial or useful.</p>



<p>There is a wealth of knowledge and existing regulation that can be drawn from to build a comprehensive global digital assets framework. Dogma towards both technological developments and unclear policies should be eliminated to better support the further digital development of the global financial services ecosystem and mitigate risks.</p>



<p>While there are areas where regulation may not provide the (optimal) solution for society, further discovery through cross-sector, multi-jurisdictional, and public private sector cooperation remains pivotal to the success of a robust, transparent, viable, and innovative digital assets market for everyone.</p>



<p>Improve, Eliminate, Delegate.</p>

<p>Toward a fully decentralized privacy-first Layer&nbsp;2</p><p>Today, Aztec Labs is thrilled to share the winning proposal from Aztec’s Sequencer Selection Request for Proposals (RFP) — “Fernet”.</p><p>At the heart of Fernet’s design is a fully permissionless, random leader election. This allows anyone to participate in building Aztec blocks and operating the network, cementing Aztec’s position as a decentralized Layer-2 zk-rollup.</p><blockquote>📕 <a href="https://hackmd.io/@aztec-network/fernet">Read the 3-minute summary of Fernet’s decentralized sequencer selection protocol</a></blockquote> Why Fernet? <p>The Aztec Labs team, with input from various industry leading experts, chose Fernet over the B52 protocol (and other designs submitted during the RFP process) due to its simplicity, safety, and ease of implementation.</p><blockquote><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/aztec-sequencer-selection-finalists-122dbc6bb4">📕 Read our previous announcement sharing B52 &amp; Fernet as the two sequencer selection finalists</a></blockquote><p>The random leader election in its design ensures that all participants have an equal opportunity to contribute. This not only fosters inclusivity and decentralization but also contributes nicely to the network’s censorship resistance properties, alongside features like <a href="https://discourse.aztec.network/t/forcing-transactions/606">forced transactions</a>.</p><blockquote>The Aztec Labs team could speak for hours on the tradeoffs and why this decision was made. We would love to engage in discussions, Twitter Spaces, or otherwise! Please <a href="mailto:hello@aztec.network">reach out to our team</a> for more information if you are curious and would like to discuss&nbsp;further.</blockquote> Dive Deeper with BlockScience <p>To provide a comprehensive and independent perspective on our decision, we engaged BlockScience — a third-party firm specializing in complex systems engineering.</p><p>We’re excited to present BlockScience’s detailed report contrasting B52 and Fernet, shedding light on the broad set of considerations and trade-offs between random leader elections and enshrined MEV auctions.</p><p>This report — in addition to significant internal debate and research — culminated in our choice of&nbsp;Fernet.</p><blockquote>📑 <a href="https://hackmd.io/@blockscience/Aztec_Sequencer_Selection">Read the BlockScience Report</a></blockquote><p>We will be hosting a Twitter Spaces with BlockScience tomorrow, Tuesday September 19th, at 11am EST to answer questions from our community and discuss their&nbsp;report!</p> Acknowledgements <p>We are very appreciative of the numerous individuals that lent their expertise, feedback, and insights.

      Bringing Generative AI to Healthcare         
	By Josephine Chen

Published September 14, 2023
        Where startups have traditionally struggled, LLMs have the potential to unlock growth and disruption.      



 
<p>Healthcare is a massive market rife with administrative inefficiencies. Of the over $4T in annual spend in the U.S. alone, $300B of that is administrative opex, mostly in repetitive, labor intensive processes. Generative AI is especially well suited to attack the labor costs of this services-heavy industry. As we have seen in legaltech, LLMs may unlock growth and disruption in a traditionally difficult vertical for software. Right now, the main applications of this technology target cost saving and automation in back office operations and making workflows more efficient for frontline staff, but the dream is for generative AI to dramatically improve patient outcomes.</p>



<p>We are already seeing innovative companies attack specific use cases, such as medical scribing, patient engagement and other workflows like prior authorization—and new opportunities are being discovered every day. The battle is already brewing. Faced with the familiar incumbents’ advantages in distribution, new entrants must lean on all their speed, ambition and creativity to break through, succeed and endure.&nbsp;</p>



 Market Background 



<p>Over the past decade, many new healthcare software companies confronted unfavorable market dynamics. Providers operate with razor thin margins and are often unwilling to spend on the promises of long-term cost efficiencies. Payors also suffer low margins and are a concentrated buyer group, with the top 5 players commanding more than 50% market share. These organizations can be slow moving and sales cycles can be incredibly long, creating roadblocks for upstarts.</p>



<p>It is no surprise that the biggest success stories in digital health have largely sidestepped these barriers by:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Benefiting from one-time regulatory changes (Epic, Cerner, Aledade) 



 Focusing on healthcare delivery within specific verticals of care (Maven for fertility, Livongo for diabetes, Hinge/Sword for MSK, Lyra/Headway for mental health) 



 Delivering a product experience adjacent to care (Zocdoc to help patients find doctors and book appointments, Doximity to help doctors connect with each other)&nbsp; 
 



<p>On the other hand, success in attacking core healthcare operations are few and far between, with the rare bright spots generally emphasizing revenue enablement over cost reduction (e.g., Viz, Cedar). The picture is even dimmer on the payor side. Frustrated with the intransigence of payors to adopt new technology, some startups have marched into the payor market instead, often with similarly disappointing outcomes.</p>



<p>GenAI tackles these constraints directly. It overcomes the buyers’ “poverty trap” by delivering large and immediate value, while maintaining robustness to unstructured data and operating environments. Its novelty factor and recognizable impact help to galvanize buyers, especially those who hope to appear innovative among peers. Most importantly, new entrants can leverage genAI to get a foot in the door and a chance to attack the broader healthcare software stack. The companies in our landscape represent these opportunities across six broad categories of front and back office operations.</p>
 







 
 Front Office 



<p>Patient-facing workflows are well-suited to LLMs because they are natural language interfaces that require the flexibility to address a wide range of conditions and special cases. There is also the potential for alignment here between care providers, payors and pharma companies, creating vectors for monetization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patient Engagement<br>There are 3 parts to patient engagement—pre-consultation discovery, patient intake and post-consultation care adherence. Discovery and intake are good fits for generative AI, which can access unstructured data to reduce search friction and help patients find the right provider more easily.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The best opportunity here is to improve post-visit care adherence. Patients take only half of the medication prescribed for chronic conditions leading to more than $100B in unnecessary health expenses. The solution can be as simple as automating the texts and calls that remind patients to go to follow up appointments, take medications and answer their basic questions. These tasks are currently done by legions of nurses and case managers. Cleveland Clinic, for example, gets 6M calls every month. Because payors bear the cost of non-adherence from aggravated ailments while pharma loses revenue for drugs not taken, there may be creative go-to-market angles here that startups can leverage.</p>



<p>Documentation<br>Patient-doctor interactions during consultations generate a load of manual process work, particularly transcribing these conversations into EHR fields and coding them appropriately. This taxes already overworked medical professionals and is often blamed for elevated professional burnout rates. There are an estimated 100K medical scribes today, up from 20K in 2016. With an average spend of $40-50K per scribe per year, this seemingly narrow use case costs at least $4B, exclusive of physicians’ opportunity costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the long term, players here have strong platform potential. They can deepen their features on the captured data, providing better referencing and workflows and eventually becoming a first-class system of record. Some documentation companies are already expanding downstream into areas such as coding and billing.</p>



<p>This is not a new insight, but there is a clear “why now.” The last generation of startups fell short because the tech was not ready, but the problem lends itself well to today’s LLMs, particularly Whisper and GPT4 models. Ironically, the risk now is that it is too easy and the tech will almost surely commoditize. In the market of smaller health systems and clinics, startups will need to go beyond the scribing wedge to create an all-in-one suite for provider operations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clinical Decision Making<br>As shown in legaltech, genAI can provide an interface to organize, retrieve and synthesize complex medical facts, notes and research. Physicians have traditionally been reluctant to embrace new workflows, but other use cases are potentially open to attack. For instance, one could envision LLMs empowering physicians to query a vast corpus of drug information or providing more personalized care for a patient.&nbsp;</p>



 Back Office 



<p>Much of the back office workload stems from the conflicting incentives between payors and providers. Providers often get paid for the service, rather than the outcome. Payors are naturally skeptical of what providers represent as necessary and would rather not pay for a service or drug. As a result, payors force providers through complex frameworks and arduous processes to justify their reimbursement requests and deny more than 1 in 10 claims. Payors are also burdened by the need to manually review and adjudicate claims. Both sides thus employ thousands of nurses and administrative staff to handle these tasks.</p>



<p>Prior authorization<br>Prior authorization is the arduous process insurance companies impose on physicians to seek approval before they can prescribe certain drugs to a patient or schedule certain procedures. In 2021, physicians submitted more than 35 million prior authorization requests to Medicare Advantage payors, of which 2 million were denied. AI-enabled automations arm the providers, patients and pharma companies—whose incentives are all aligned—against this death by administration. LLMs have been able to generate prior authorization forms with remarkable accuracy out of the box, which is why so many startups have started here.</p>



<p>There is a risk that this need may get regulated away. As the number of prior auths have grown so egregiously over the last few years, regulatory intervention looks increasingly likely. New policies that reduce the burden of prior auths overall would dramatically reduce the value of these products. And, as with AI-scribes, the technology to generate a prior authorization form is also fairly commoditized, so companies have to build out additional workflows to endure.</p>



<p>Coding<br>Medical coders read physician notes and look at labs to identify the right code for the diagnosis and procedure. These codes are then used for insurance billing. The medical coding market in the U.S. is worth around $21B, comprising about 35K medical coders. Despite all that labor, almost $20B of revenue is lost by U.S. hospitals annually due to coding errors, which has led to a cottage industry of local consulting firms that help providers “discover” missing revenue.</p>



<p>While most of the traditional solutions are rule-based, multimodal LLM models can collate unstructured physician notes, lab panels, and imaging to determine the right diagnosis codes. Automation can also reduce the administrative back and forth with payors and will be a natural lead into the massive opportunity that is revenue cycle management. Incumbents in the documentation space will also have a formidable advantage here.</p>



<p>Revenue Cycle Management<br>Medical billers create and submit a medical claim to the payor once they get the codes for the procedures/office visit. While claim submission is automated, following up on them is not. The combination of investigating and appealing rejected claims, verifying eligibility and benefits of all treatments and dealing with payors is probably the most significant administrative headache for provider systems. Eleven percent of all healthcare insurance claims were denied in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two ways to attack the RCM market: workflow automations or handling the billing itself. Automation comes with some tech risk and significant amounts of incumbent advantage (e.g., UiPath incorporating LLMs), while billing suffers from protracted sales cycles. The best entrypoint may be to expand into RCM over time from adjacent use cases.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Disruption in healthcare has historically been difficult and the windows of opportunities fleeting and narrow, but generative AI may finally provide the unlock. We are excited to meet teams who dare to reimagine the next decades of healthcare.</p>

 Noir gets extended with smart contract functionality <p>Today we’re announcing Aztec.nr, a powerful new smart contract framework for Aztec applications. Aztec.nr enables smart contract developers to intuitively manage private&nbsp;state.</p><p>In other words, Aztec now has a smart contract language.</p><blockquote>👀 <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-nr">Explore the Aztec.nr Github repo&nbsp;here</a></blockquote><p>Aztec.nr is a framework built on top of <a href="http://noir-lang.org">Noir</a>, an open-source, universal zk programming language to which Aztec Labs is a core contributor.</p><p>Aztec.nr allows developers to write private smart contracts in Noir and extend their functionality with templated functions that simplify state management.</p><p>Last week we teased how simple and intuitive private state management would be on&nbsp;Aztec.</p><blockquote>📕 Read the first post in this series: <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/privacy-abstraction-with-aztec-def9da73eb5">Privacy Abstraction with&nbsp;Aztec</a></blockquote><p>Today we’re explaining how Aztec.nr works and showing how you can get started building smart contracts and full-fledged privacy-preserving applications on&nbsp;Aztec.</p> The point of&nbsp;Aztec.nr <p>The Aztec.nr framework helps you deal with complex note management that is critical to privacy preservation within smart contract development.</p><p>But it does so in a way that makes it so that developers don’t have to rebuild smart contract functionality from scratch every time they write a Noir&nbsp;program.</p><p>Without Aztec.nr, you wouldn’t be able to emit events, make calls to other contracts, or even have the notion of a contract or an address. You’d have no msg.sender or access to historic blockchain.</p><p>Aztec.nr takes Noir — a general zero knowledge programming language — and gives it the smart contract functionality and syntax developers might expect coming from Solidity.</p><p>Developers can now access a complete set of smart contract features:</p>  Contracts (including callable contract functions and inter-contract function&nbsp;calls)  Persistent state variables  Contract address semantics  Access to msg.sender and other call context information  Access to transaction context information  Access to historic blockchain data  Events (logs) (both encrypted and unencrypted)  Cryptographic primitives  Cross-chain (L1 -&gt; L2 and L2 -&gt; L1) message&nbsp;passing  <p>For examples of Aztec.nr at work, check out examples&nbsp;of:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/yarn-project/noir-contracts/src/contracts/uniswap_contract/src/main.nr">a swap&nbsp;contract</a>  <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/yarn-project/noir-contracts/src/contracts/lending_contract/src/main.nr">a lending&nbsp;contract</a>  <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/yarn-project/noir-contracts/src/contracts/card_game_contract/src/main.nr">a card game&nbsp;contract</a>   How we got&nbsp;here <p>At Aztec Labs we harbor two very strong&nbsp;beliefs:</p>  Privacy is the major unlock for the next leg of adoption. Having every single address, transaction, and balance exposed in plaintext is a non-starter for everyday users, businesses, and institutions coming on-chain.  Privacy UX has to be better than the existing state of the art in blockchains. Privacy-preserving technology is only useful if the experience of using it isn’t better than what is available today.  <p>The Aztec.nr framework is a major step in improving the developer experience for managing private state — functionality that “vanilla” Noir doesn’t&nbsp;have.</p><p>For example for a simple private token contract, Aztec.nr includes helper functions like:</p>  get_balance  increment  decrement  etc.  <p>In other words, the kinds of functions you might expect to call in a standard token contract!</p><p>Let’s walk through this private token contract to show you how Aztec.nr helps with abstracting private note management:</p><blockquote>Follow along in the Github repo of our private token contract example&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/yarn-project/noir-contracts/src/contracts/private_token_contract/src/main.nr">here</a></blockquote>How private notes can be&nbsp;managed<p>Say Alice wants to send funds to Bob. Practically, she would have to aggregate all of the existing non-nullified notes they have of the asset she were sending, add up the values, and once she had enough notes to send the amount, create a change note to reconcile her&nbsp;balance.</p><p>For example, say Alice had two UTXO’s of 0.25 ETH each, and wanted to send 0.4 ETH to Bob. In order to spend the note Alice would have to sum the two 0.25 ETH notes together, nullify them both, and create a change note for herself of 0.1&nbsp;ETH.</p><p>Thankfully, Aztec.nr makes it easy to manage notes. Take for example the decrement and decrement_by_at_most functions written by the Aztec Labs team for the private token example&nbsp;above.</p><p>Here’s how decrement_by_at_most works:</p><blockquote>Follow along with the decrement_by_at_most example&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/0247b859d88781740fa990801a24881c09c5ca3c/yarn-project/aztec-nr/value-note/src/utils.nr#L59">here</a>.</blockquote><p>1. Find notes to decrement. The function begins by getting some notes that add up to max_amount or less from the set of notes owned by&nbsp;owner.</p><p>2. Destroy selected notes. It then iterates over these selected notes and destroys them, adding their values to a variable decremented.</p><p>3. Handle Change: If the total value of the destroyed notes (decremented) is greater than max_amount, it creates a new note with the excess value (change_value) and assigns it back to the&nbsp;owner.</p><p>4. Return the Decrement: Finally, the function returns the total value that was decremented, which is stored in decremented.</p><p>The decrement example is a perfect showcase for how Aztec.nr makes it easy to manage notes and nullifiers with built-in get, insert, replace, and remove functions.</p><p>If a dev wanted to write this without Aztec.nr (as in, write it with “vanilla” aka non-smart-contract Noir), they would have to write their own Merkle trees to insert and prove membership of notes and support non-membership checks for nullifiers.</p><p>But as a developer, you don’t have to worry about rebuilding core privacy primitives — the Aztec Labs team has already done all of that work on your&nbsp;behalf.</p><p>You just focus on smart contract&nbsp;logic.</p> When will I get to play with all this cool&nbsp;tech? <p>Soon, anon,&nbsp;soon.</p><p>We’ll soon release a local developer environment for developers to write and test Aztec smart contracts against a local instance of an Aztec&nbsp;node.</p><p>Developers will soon get a full-fledged development kit for building smart contracts and applications on Aztec, supported by Aztec.nr’s functionality.</p><p>But for now, you can preview what comes in the&nbsp;box.</p><blockquote>Explore the Aztec.nr Github repo&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-nr">here</a></blockquote><p>Start familiarizing yourself with Noir syntax, since Aztec.nr is simply a smart contract framework written in vanilla&nbsp;Noir.</p><p>To get started learning Noir, check&nbsp;out:</p>  The <a href="https://github.com/noir-lang/noir-starter">Noir starter</a>&nbsp;repos  The official <a href="https://noir-lang.org/">Noir&nbsp;docs</a>  <p>Finally, sign up for Aztec Labs’ developer e-mail list to stay apprised of all technical developments across Noir and&nbsp;Aztec:</p><blockquote><a href="https://embeds.beehiiv.com/83354329-29bf-48be-ba17-a99d72424ace">📬 Subscribe here to the Aztec Labs Developer Dispatch, the latest news and releases about Aztec and&nbsp;Noir</a></blockquote><p>To learn more about Aztec generally, keep up to date on our <a href="http://discourse.aztec.network">Discourse</a>, where we discuss major protocol decisions like <a href="https://discourse.aztec.network/t/request-for-proposals-upgrade-mechanisms/605">upgrade mechanisms</a> and <a href="https://discourse.aztec.network/t/request-for-proposals-decentralized-sequencer-selection/350">decentralizing sequencers</a>.</p> Join our&nbsp;team <p>Aztec Labs is on the lookout for talented engineers, cryptographers, and business people to accelerate our vision of encrypted Ethereum.</p><blockquote>If joining our mission to bring scalable privacy to Ethereum excites you, <a href="https://boards.eu.greenhouse.io/aztec">check out our open&nbsp;roles</a>.</blockquote><p>And continue the conversation with us on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/aztecnetwork">Twitter</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/introducing-aztec-nr-aztecs-private-smart-contract-framework-54d716710407">Introducing Aztec.nr: Aztec’s Private Smart Contract Framework</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol">The Aztec Labs Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

      Retooling the Status Quo         
	By Emma Starer Gross

Published September 13, 2023
        David Hsu’s rebellious spirit led him to re-imagine the world of software.      



 
<p>David Hsu looked out the window of his childhood bedroom in Palo Alto. It was 2017, and for the greater part of the year, the room had served double duty as Hsu’s living quarters as well as the headquarters for his peer-to-peer payments startup, Cashew. Hsu’s parents had welcomed their son and the Cashew team into their home, sharing meals, couch space and the washing machine with the 20-something-year-olds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few months earlier, Cashew had been accepted to Y Combinator, but more recently, on Demo Day, when participants present their companies to potential investors, the Cashew team remained seated. They had nothing. Unable to make Cashew’s financial model work, Hsu and his team had burned through half their cash, and would ultimately decide to call it quits.</p>



<p>Hsu recalls the pain of this moment. “Our peers were up on stage raising all this money, and we felt like we let all the people who believed in us down,” he says. “I remember thinking, ‘What are we doing? Why are we burning away our savings, working on an app that loses money on every transaction?’” Mulling it over in his childhood bedroom, with its walls covered in punk-rock posters—relics that reflected his teenage rebelliousness and fighting spirit—Hsu decided he wasn’t done yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Failure is something you can recover from,” Hsu says. “I thought, ‘Okay, what did we learn? And how can we apply that to what’s next?’” From this soul searching, Retool was born.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Retool is a software development platform that offers drag-and-drop, customizable building blocks for developers to quickly assemble commonly-used software systems—admin panels, support dashboards, customer portals and more—so that they can focus on core features that set their businesses apart. “Our view was that the way people were building software was ridiculously inefficient,” Hsu says. “There’s no need for everybody to be constantly writing all this boilerplate code.” While critics bristled initially at this belief and found elements of Retool’s business counterintuitive, Hsu stuck to his guns. Today, the platform launched from Hsu’s childhood bedroom powers tens of thousands of companies including Disney, Airbnb and Mercedes-Benz.</p>

<p>When Hsu was 16, his parents told him they’d had enough. His grades were terrible and his friend group—fellow punk-rock fans who favored mosh pits and garage jam sessions over school—was, in their eyes, even worse. Hsu’s parents, who had immigrated from China to the United States for post-graduate studies, had tried everything, from curfews to taking away Hsu’s bicycle (Hsu simply walked instead). They informed their son they were moving him to Saratoga, a quaint suburb near Palo Alto. No more wayward friends, no more East Bay counterculture to distract him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hsu acknowledges that, angry as he was, the change helped. With fewer diversions, he started thinking about his future. Hsu was already an avid Hacker News reader and remembers an essay where Paul Graham, the venture capitalist who co-founded Y Combinator, described the creation of startups as “almost a measurement of the accuracy of your worldview. In a startup, there’s nowhere to hide,” Hsu says. “You can’t hide behind the work of others, you can’t fake your way to long-term success. You have to work hard (since otherwise you fail), you have to be smart (since otherwise you fail), and you have to be correct often enough (since otherwise you fail). But if you do it right, the impact of your work is remarkable: you can create something that actually puts a dent in the universe.” As a rebellious teenager who dreamed of having an impact and proving to others that his worldview was correct, Hsu was enamored by this challenge.</p>



<p>This fascination was heightened by the fact that Hsu’s high school experience coincided with the rise of Twitter and the Arab Spring. “I watched as this website, which was created in a matter of days, just miles from where I lived, topple a dictator halfway around the world,” Hsu says. “Technology could change peoples’ lives for the better, and that was exhilarating to me.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Silicon Valley founder trope would suggest Hsu might forgo or drop out of college to focus on technology. Instead, he did the opposite. He hunkered down, was admitted to Oxford to study philosophy and computer science, graduated high school early, and spent a gap year in China. “I wanted to learn more about the innards of computers,” Hsu says. “But I also wanted to leave the bubble of Palo Alto.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for his interest in philosophy, Hsu says it stemmed from Douglas Hofstadter’s Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid. He recalls a particular chapter about the relationship between ants and anthills. In it, a crab, anteater and tortoise discuss the paradox of how individual ants (who are not intelligent), when formed into a colony, can demonstrate signs of intelligence at the colony level. “This phenomenon is similar to neurons in the brain, where any individual neuron isn’t doing anything particularly smart,” Hsu says. “But then you put all the neurons together and you create a brain. That’s pretty smart.” Back in 1979, Hofstadter also used this logic of emergent intelligence to predict computers gaining the power to think like humans. “These philosophical ideas about humanity and science really interested me,” Hsu says. And then, of course, “the other reason I chose this area of study was that philosophy is kind of a big f*** you to your parents.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“What’s the worst that could happen?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was 2015 and Hsu, now in his senior year at Oxford, had gone out for ice cream with classmates. “We wanted to pay each other back,” Hsu says, “But England didn’t have an easy way for people to send money to each other.” Venmo, so popular in the United States, didn’t exist in the U.K. Hsu turned to his friends: “I was like, ‘It can’t be that hard. I bet we can build something similar.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One year earlier, on a whim, Hsu had joined his college’s Ball Committee, which organized the school’s seasonal dances. He quickly realized that ticketing for the balls was an unwieldy process. “Technology is unevenly distributed across the world,” Hsu says. “In the U.S., you have good ticketing platforms, but there wasn’t anything good in England.” So Hsu, having never built a production ticketing system before, decided to engineer a system where students could RSVP to the balls, buy tickets in advance, and check in by scanning their wristbands by the door. “It wasn’t particularly complicated, but attendees were shocked: there were no queues for purchasing tickets, the site handled thousands of concurrent users successfully, and scanning the wristband admitted you directly to the ball,” Hsu says. “If I had been back in Silicon Valley and built a ball ticketing site, no one would have cared. But at Oxford, where there were very few computer scientists, the skillset I had was valuable, and I was happy to have found a use for it.”&nbsp;<br>Back at the ice cream parlor, Hsu saw a similar opportunity and laid out his argument: there was a need in the U.K. for a peer-to-peer payments system. No one had built one; why shouldn’t they? What’s the worst that could happen?</p>
 







 
<p>“It’s a terrible idea,” John Collison said. The Stripe co-founder sat across from Hsu in Mountain View, at Y Combinator’s office. It was the winter of 2017, and in the time since the ice cream outing, Hsu had graduated from Oxford, launched Cashew, gained a small, local following for the app, and been accepted to Y Combinator.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hsu had 30 minutes booked with Collison. He spent the first three minutes pitching Cashew. Collison, in turn, took the next three explaining why it wouldn’t work: Cashew lost money on every transaction with fees paid to credit card providers, and while this was negligible in the startup’s early stages, if the app’s adoption continued, the cost would become a death sentence. Building out a business model that could offset transaction costs in the U.K. would be next to impossible. “I had arguments against what he said, but he rebutted each one,” Hsu says. “He was like, ‘no, nope, no, no, no.’ After maybe 10 minutes of our 30-minute allotted time, there was nothing left to say.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Had Hsu taken a page from his philosophy textbook, perhaps he would’ve listened to Collison. Hsu says one of his main takeaways from studying philosophy relates to the idea that reality isn’t objective. “People see the world from different angles,” Hsu says. “The way we react to things, evaluate pros and cons, and generate opinions is based on our own axioms and lived experiences. There’s no one ‘right way’ or ‘right reality.’ And so approaching situations with empathy and humility, seeing the world through someone else’s perspective, and then often revising your previously held beliefs, is critical.”</p>



<p>Still fresh from uni, however, this lesson hadn’t fully registered. Hsu left his meeting with Collison (respectfully) defiant and determined to prove him wrong. “And then, of course,” Hsu says, “he was right.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the spring of 2017, the company was hemorrhaging money in transaction fees and its bank account was rapidly dwindling. The Cashew team had attempted to cut its losses by convincing retailers to take payments via a Cashew digital wallet, but its development proved costly and time-intensive. “Looking back, I was incredibly naive,” Hsu says. “I had a pie-in-the-sky sort of attitude about what I thought of as this rebellious undertaking that everyone said wouldn’t work. Cashew had started as a project with friends, right? But after Y Combinator invested in us, after I moved back home, it was like, ‘Okay, this is real now. It’s time to get serious.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Cashew’s Achilles’ heel was its financial model, Hsu recognized that the internal systems the team had developed to support the app were powerful. The process of building these systems, however, had been repetitive and inefficient. “I remember always thinking, ‘I wish there was a faster way to build this software,’” Hsu says. “And so, post-Cashew, we had this idea of, ‘What if we took the code that we already had from Cashew and repurposed it? What if we gave it to other developers so they didn’t have to build the same internal systems from scratch?’” Hsu says. “This was the provenance of Retool.”&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I remember always thinking, ‘I wish there was a faster way to build this software.’”</p>
David Hsu</blockquote>



<p>As with Cashew, Hsu’s new idea—offering visual building blocks for engineers—had its share of naysayers. “Most people thought it was a pretty bad idea,” Hsu says. “Why would engineers buy something they could build themselves? Why not target non-coders? Why give engineers a vitamin when you could give non-coders a lifesaver?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Companies offering low-code or no-code solutions were trending at the time, but Hsu’s take was that, in the case of what Retool was looking to solve for, targeting non-coders was unrealistic. “Yes, these are building blocks, but they’re not one size fits all. They require customization and stitching together into a system that is fairly complex,” Hsu says. “You need to be able to talk to your computer, and to code, to achieve this.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for the argument of why engineers wouldn’t simply build the features Retool was offering themselves, Hsu’s view was that a company’s edge is its core product, not its internal systems. “Why not provide building blocks for those internal systems so that engineers can focus on their company’s core product, the custom stuff that’s fun, creative, exciting and differentiating?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the echoes of “this won’t work” from a previously failed endeavor might have stopped someone else, Hsu’s individualistic streak won out again. But he was also no longer the “pie-in-the-sky” college graduate who pitched John Collison and plowed ahead despite his warnings. His experience with Cashew had taught him “just because you’re a contrarian, it doesn’t mean you’re right,” Hsu says. “To know whether you’re a contrarian and right, or a contrarian and wrong, you have to take the time to fully understand the world in which you’re operating, the customers you’re serving and the business you’re building.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To achieve this, Hsu began talking to other engineers to see if a product like Retool might be useful to them. “I remember one day going into Y Combinator in Mountain View and going around to all the other startups asking, ‘Is it just us, are we the weird ones, or would this be helpful?’ And they responded enthusiastically to the idea,” Hsu says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bryan Schreier, the Sequoia Partner who led Retool’s Series A funding, was one such early enthusiast. “I used to work at Google, and I managed a large team of engineers who built internal tools. Despite being mission-critical, those engineers couldn’t wait to graduate and take on higher-value work. And when they did leave internal tools, they went on to build Gmail and Google Drive. If we had had something like Retool, we could have liberated all those engineers and the team wouldn’t have needed to exist at all,” says Schreier, “so for me, it was just clearly obvious that a company should address this space.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>This support from the YC collective left Hsu determined to pursue Retool in earnest. “Later that day, during the 20-minute drive home to Palo Alto, I had this conviction that our contrarian view was right. That the way engineers built software was ridiculous. We could build a company to change that,” says Hsu.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When he returned to YC for Demo Day in the summer 2017, Hsu stood confidently in front of an audience of investors. The team had already signed a large enterprise customer to a $1.5 million pilot. Redemption achieved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In keeping with his commitment to know his own company nuts to bolts, instead of hiring a head of sales at the onset, Hsu took on the role himself. “I’d never done sales before and always pictured that scene in Glengarry Glen Ross where it’s all about charisma and closing,” Hsu says. “In reality, sales hinges on empathy and being able to explain your product. It’s about figuring out what a win-win situation could look like for both of you to work together.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each time a customer signed up for Retool, Hsu remembers “it felt unbelievable.” But these achievements were ones he and his team barely acknowledged. After the failure of Cashew, Hsu was skeptical of success. “I didn’t want to celebrate prematurely. Every customer felt like it might be our last. Eventually someone’s going to find out that we’re writing code from my parents’ house!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Parental HQ notwithstanding, Retool’s users grew steadily in numbers, and Hsu’s approach to his new venture reinforced just how far he had come from his Cashew days. “With Retool, we prioritized having a sustainable business from the get-go, so we cared quite a bit about unit economics and stayed very lean as a company. Compared to Cashew, where every transaction cost us money, this was a pretty different mindset. Here, people were paying us to use the software we wrote—in my childhood bedroom. Wow.”</p>



<p>Today, Retool has tens of thousands of customers; it’s helped businesses save hundreds of millions in operational costs; it boasts use cases including forecasting for the Olympics and operating networks of satellites. But Hsu’s focus on pragmatism with respect to his business remains strong. “Yes, Retool’s much larger now,” Hsu says. “But even today, we don’t want to oversell ourselves.” As Retool’s customer base grows, Hsu feels it’s more important than ever to remain empathetic and open-minded in order to understand their increasingly varied and complex needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, in 2017, a customer suggested that Retool be able to connect to application programming interfaces (APIs) as opposed to just a company’s databases. “For a while, we pushed back on this,” Hsu says. “We were like, ‘We think connecting to databases alone is fine and this is a request we can ignore.’ But then we self-reflected and thought, ‘Actually, you know, why not? Is it a core belief of ours that Retool must not connect to APIs? No.’ So we changed our mind, and today APIs are our most popular resource.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Our approach was, rather than immediately jumping on the AI bandwagon, let’s talk to our customers and understand how we could use AI to actually deliver value to them.”</p>
David Hsu</blockquote>



<p>The ability to connect to APIs has proven fruitful in other ways, perhaps most significantly in putting the pieces in place to help Retool’s customers make use of AI—a shade of Hofstadter’s Gödel, Escher, Bach prediction realized. “There’s a lot of hype around AI, and we’ve seen a lot of startups in Silicon Valley try to rebrand themselves as AI companies,” Hsu says. “Our approach was, rather than immediately jumping on the AI bandwagon, let’s talk to our customers and understand how we could use AI to actually deliver value to them.” They found that most of their customers were interested in AI, but weren’t sure how to approach it or how it could help them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result of these conversations, Retool developed a <a href="https://retool.com/products/ai">suite of AI features</a> that work in tandem with its current library of tools. “These features fall into two categories,” says David Dworsky, Retool’s Product Manager for AI. “The first category helps engineers build applications faster—so using AI to assist with code generation, query generation and debugging. The second category helps companies expedite AI-powered workflows that are specific to them. So if you’re an insurance company, using AI to match a claim with a policy. Or if you’re a fintech company, using AI to flag fraudulent transactions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because Retool is already connected to its users’ databases and APIs, “you can start stitching AI actions together with that data in literally a matter of minutes, without having to become an AI expert,” Dworsky says. “And we’re enabling these actions to be backed by whatever vendor a company wants to use—OpenAI, LLaMA, Cohere, etc. Our key insight here was to maintain flexibility behind the scenes, while making our AI features really intuitive to use.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For 16-year-old Hsu, a teenager with punk aspirations, siloed from friends and under the rule of parents, the prospect of founding a startup and getting to be his own boss was enticing. But today, at 28, Hsu recognizes that the job demands more than just rebellion. “Yes, you have to have your own differentiated view of the world and stand by it,” Hsu says. “But, when it comes to every element of your business, you have to be open-minded. You have to acknowledge when you are wrong, be willing to change your beliefs, and take a philosophical approach to understanding your customers and the world.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hsu no longer works out of his childhood bedroom: Retool now operates out of offices in San Francisco, New York and London. While the Retool of today differs from the company at its outset, Hsu has made sure its humble beginnings aren’t forgotten, documenting the company’s journey via photos. “That’s a piece of advice I have for founders,” He says. “Take pictures every step of the way. Five, six years out, you can look back and see how far you’ve come.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the case of Retool, the photos on its walls show a team that has expanded from a nonconforming party of just a few, to hundreds of people around the globe who recognize the value of thinking outside the box, and the possibilities that come with questioning, retooling—and occasionally rebelling against—the status quo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today we are excited to announce our partnership with ZebPay, one of India’s leading crypto exchanges. ZebPay represents a new custodial account provider option for <a>Brave Rewards</a> users in India, and is available in Brave version 1.58 on both desktop and Android.</p>
<p>With this partnership, Brave Rewards users in India will now be able to connect a ZebPay account to Brave Rewards in order to begin earning <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">Basic Attention Tokens (BAT)</a>. Existing users in India with <a>previous earnings</a> will also be able to connect a ZebPay account and have their balances redeemed for BAT and transferred to their ZebPay accounts.</p>
<p>In the near future, creators will also be able to connect a ZebPay account to their <a href="https://creators.brave.com">Brave Creators</a> account, allowing them to receive BAT contributions from Brave Rewards users.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to partner with ZebPay to enable our millions of Brave users in India to benefit from their Brave Rewards experience,” said Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave. “With this custodial integration, users can seamlessly access their BAT payouts in their ZebPay account and get rewarded for their online attention.”</p>
<p>“We are excited to be the exclusive partners for Brave Rewards in India,” said Rahul Pagidipati, CEO of ZebPay. “This strategic partnership not only reinforces our commitment to empowering users but also demonstrates our unwavering support of the crypto ecosystem in India. By enabling users to seamlessly transfer Brave Rewards to ZebPay, we are unlocking a new realm of possibilities for crypto enthusiasts. This is a testament to ZebPay’s vision of creating a more inclusive and accessible crypto ecosystem where users can fully harness the potential of their digital assets.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brave provides users with a better Internet experience by protecting their privacy. The Brave browser blocks invasive ads and trackers, which provides a faster (3-6x) and more private Internet experience, as well as less battery drainage. Brave users can earn BAT for seeing privacy-preserving ads in Brave. Online creators can also earn BAT from Brave users with <a href="https://creators.brave.com">Brave Creators</a> by publishing great content across a range of platforms including YouTube, Twitter/X, Vimeo, Github, Twitch, or their own website.</p>

 Instructions 
<p>To connect a ZebPay account to Brave Rewards, first make sure you’re on the latest version of Brave (version 1.58 or above). On Android, some users may only see Brave version 1.58 on the app store in a few days.</p>
 
 Open the Brave Rewards panel by selecting the BAT icon in the URL bar. Select “Connect account”, and then select ZebPay as your account provider. 
 


    
    

    


    



    
    

 
 Follow the steps on ZebPay. If you don’t already have a ZebPay account, create one and then complete these steps. Make sure to complete all ID verification steps for your account on ZebPay. 
 


    
    

    


    



    
    

 
 Voilà! Once your ZebPay account is connected, you’ll see a “Connected” status and a ZebPay zebra icon in the Brave Rewards interface.

<p>Deirdre Connolly joined the Zcash Foundation in <a href="https://zfnd.org/the-zcash-foundation-welcomes-a-core-engineer/">May 2019</a>. Over the past four years, she has been a key member of the Foundation’s engineering team, helping it grow from two people to nine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deirdre has been a key contributor to the development of both the Zebra node and the Foundation’s FROST implementation. She co-authored the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost/">FROST specification</a> (and will continue to contribute to that effort), and has served as a ZIP editor since 2020, helping steer Zcash through the lengthy and challenging NU5 upgrade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Outside her work with the Foundation, Deirdre co-hosts the <a href="https://securitycryptographywhatever.com/">Security Cryptography Whatever</a> podcast, and is fascinated by isogeny-based cryptography. She has also held a long-standing interest in quantum-resistant cryptography, and she has been tempted away from the Zcash Foundation by an opportunity to pursue this topic more deeply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her departure is bittersweet in that, while we are disappointed that her future career path lies outside the Zcash Foundation, we are pleased that she has found an opportunity that will allow her to further develop her talents as a cryptographer, and that she will continue to contribute to Zcash as a member of the Zcash Foundation’s Technical Advisory Board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On behalf of the Zcash Foundation team members past and present, and the Zcash community as a whole, we want to thank Deirdre for her contributions to Zcash and the broader mission of financial privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>with @alive_eth @danboneh @smc90</p><p>This week's all-new episode covers the convergence of two important, very top-of-mind trends: AI (artificial intelligence) &amp; blockchains/ crypto. These domains together have major implications for how we all live our lives everyday; so this episode is for anyone just curious about, or already building in the space.&nbsp;</p><p>The conversation covers topics ranging from deep fakes, bots, and the need for proof-of-humanity in a world of AI; to big data, large language models like ChatGPT, user control, governance, privacy and security, zero knowledge and zkML; to MEV, media, art, and much more. Our expert guests (in conversation with host Sonal Chokshi) include:&nbsp;</p>  Dan Boneh, Stanford Professor (and Senior Research Advisor at a16z crypto), a cryptographer who’s been working on blockchains for over a decade and who specializes in cryptography, computer security, and machine learning -- all of which intersect in this episode;  Ali Yahya, general partner at a16z crypto, who also previously worked at Google -- where he not only worked on a distributed system for a fleet of robots (a sort of "collective reinforcement learning") but also worked on Google Brain, where he was one of the core contributors to the machine learning library TensorFlow built at Google.  <p>The first half of the hallway-style conversation between Ali &amp; Dan (who go back together as student and professor at Stanford) is all about how AI could benefit from crypto, and the second half on how crypto could benefit from AI... the thread throughout is the tension between centralization vs. decentralization. &nbsp;So we also discuss where the intersection of crypto and AI can bring about things that aren't possible by either one of them alone...</p><p>pieces referenced in this episode/ related reading:</p>  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06616.pdf">The Next Cyber Reasoning System for Cyber Security</a> (2023) by Mohamed Ferrag, Ammar Battah, Norbert Tihanyi, Merouane Debbah, Thierry Lestable, Lucas Cordeiro  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14752.pdf">A New Era in Software Security: Towards Self-Healing Software via Large Language Models and Formal Verification</a> (2023) by &nbsp;Yiannis Charalambous, Norbert Tihanyi, Ridhi Jain, Youcheng Sun, Mohamed Ferrag, Lucas Cordeiro  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.01215.pdf">Fixing Hardware Security Bugs with Large Language Models</a> (2023) by Baleegh Ahmad, Shailja Thakur, Benjamin Tan, Ramesh Karri, Hammond Pearce  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03622">Do Users Write More Insecure Code with AI Assistants?</a> (2022) by Neil Perry, Megha Srivastava, Deepak Kumar, Dan Boneh  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09293">Asleep at the Keyboard?

<p>The PIVX community is dedicated to decentralized governance, allowing members to actively participate in shaping the project’s future. However, navigating a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) can be challenging, leading to reduced engagement. To address this issue, a comprehensive suite of PIVX DAO tutorials was created, aiming to empower the community and promote active participation in the DAO. <br>Let’s explore the significance of these tutorials and their impact on the PIVX community.</p><p>Voter apathy can hinder the effectiveness of any DAO, including PIVX. The tutorials will educate community members on launching proposals, voting, and tracking progress.

  Partnering with Co:Helm: The Co-Pilot for Health Care  <p>Abdel, Zahid and their team are giving clinicians a second set of hands—and fixing one of the biggest pain points for patients.</p>   
	By George Robson	 



Published September 11, 2023
  



Co:Helm co-founders Zahid Mahmood and Abdel Mahmoud.



 
<p>When your doctor orders a scan, prescribes a new medication, or tells you you need a surgery, you usually want to move as quickly as possible. But you also want to know it will be paid for, which for many patients in the U.S. means first getting your insurance company to sign off. In this “prior authorization” process, the insurer’s clinicians review your medical records—often a massive amount of different kinds of information, from test results to doctors notes, PDFs to imaging files—and compare them with a set of care guidelines to make a decision.</p>



<p>It is a time-consuming, manual process—and not just for the insurance company’s doctors and nurses, but for those on the provider side, as well, who sometimes spend hours responding to requests when they would otherwise be treating patients. Meanwhile, those patients have to wait for even the simplest approvals; in some cases, care is delayed as much as a month. And the problem is not just about speed, but also cost: <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare/our-insights/administrative-simplification-how-to-save-a-quarter-trillion-dollars-in-US-healthcare">One-quarter</a>, or $950 billion, of U.S. health care spending goes to administrative expenses, with as much as <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/briefs/administrative-waste-excess-health-spending?mkt_tok=ODUwLVRBQS01MTEAAAGHYLsgjXQJM8WofOYcJiWvqPptP5gxpsCn6iLacQY0QFcMunVE7Y0NWxKxNGRbiKYlHrnsLYiy0pwKPYQlNV7gki8eZRyyUMGkmpbleRKZUPxa">$570 billion</a> lost to inefficiencies that don’t improve patient outcomes.</p>



<p>We at Sequoia have seen again and again, across industries, that AI can be a powerful tool for solving just such challenges. But in this case, the trouble has been that while people with expertise in health care or AI are relatively easy to find, people with both are quite rare.</p>



<p>Luckily for us, though, <a href="https://www.co-helm.com/">Co:Helm</a> co-founders Abdel Mahmoud and Zahid Mahmood applied to <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/arc/">Arc</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Born in Libya, Abdel came to the U.K. as a refugee at 8 years old. By 15, he had his own software business—and by 18, he had joined the prestigious Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, where he became the youngest infantry officer in the U.K. Then Abdel became a doctor. He loved helping patients, but grew frustrated with the mountains of paperwork that kept him from spending more time with them, and eventually left medicine, returning to University College London for a master’s in computer science and going on to work in product at Facebook and Google.</p>



<p>Zahid, too, founded a company as a teenager—the first of his now-four founder journeys. He started the other two as side projects during a successful run as a software engineer building payment platforms for large insurance companies, which gave him deep expertise in the industry. He and Abdel became friends at UCL, and now they are teaming up to give doctors and nurses the extra set of hands that Abdel, when he was treating patients, always wished he had.</p>



<p>Co:Helm is an LLM-powered co-pilot for administration, handling all the work that comes before the clinical decision-making. Where it might take a nurse several hours to track down, organize and summarize hundreds of pages of records they need, Co:Helm can do it in seconds, allowing clinicians to increase their output tenfold and focus on what matters most: helping patients.</p>



<p>With partners including one of the top U.S. health plan administrators, Abdel, Zahid and their team will soon be making a difference for millions of patients, and the waitlist is growing quickly. We are proud to lead this seed round and help them hit the gas pedal as they <a href="https://www.co-helm.com/p/careers">hire</a> across engineering, sales and GTM, and regulatory roles. And while they are starting with prior authorization, there is a long list of pain points Co:Helm will ultimately be able to address, from case management to underwriting and beyond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fixing these problems will take grit, imagination, and both high IQ and EQ—but as we’ve seen ever since meeting Abdel and Zahid, those are defining qualities of the Co:Helm team. Throughout Arc, they also proved themselves to be great students: humble, eager for feedback, and serious about continuously improving their product. They have truly been a joy to work with, and we look forward to the joy of helping them build better health care.</p>

 Feature: Secrets, and how to prove them — a magician’s guide to zero knowledge proofs <p>with Michael Blau</p><p>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic (or so science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke famously said). One such area of sci-fi-like progress is that of <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/zero-knowledge-canon/">zero-knowledge</a> proofs (or ZKPs), a cryptographic tool that addresses two critical challenges in web3: scalability, and privacy. In particular, ZKPs could be the key to unlocking lower transaction fees and designing new privacy-preserving applications — ushering in many more crypto users. But beyond crypto, ZKPs can also help transmit sensitive data securely, combat illicit finance through <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/privacy-protecting-regulatory-solutions-using-zero-knowledge-proofs-full-paper/">privacy-preserving regulatory solutions</a>, and fight <a href="https://medium.com/@boneh/using-zk-proofs-to-fight-disinformation-17e7d57fe52f">disinformation</a>. </p><p>But what are ZKPs, really? There are many clever explanations out there, but even with the wealth of analogies available — from Waldo to Ali Baba’s Cave — it’s not easy to find an accurate, easy-to-grasp explanation of zero-knowledge proofs. Especially one that fully captures their superpowers, including for those who aren’t cryptography researchers or engineers.</p><p>So in this post and special demo, a16z crypto partner Michael Blau combines his background in magic with his work in crypto to explore a new analogy for demystifying ZKPs: a magic trick. Magic tricks, and magicians hiding secrets, can serve as a helpful mental model for understanding the key properties of ZKPs. Which makes sense, since zero-knowledge proofs in practice are indistinguishable from magic…  </p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/a-magicians-guide-to-zero-knowledge-proofs/">read more/ watch here</a><br>share: on <a href="https://twitter.com/blauyourmind/status/1700175388557885828">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0xb8bff3">Farcaster</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/a16zcrypto_magic-tricks-are-zero-knowledge-proofs-activity-7105942084783636480-sKAY">LinkedIn</a></p> Resource: ‘Back to school’ special playlists  The latest in crypto research  <p>Tim Roughgarden</p><p>With the goal of advancing the science and technology of the next generation of the internet, last year we <a href="https://a16z.com/announcing-a16z-crypto-research/">introduced</a> a16z crypto research — a new kind of multidisciplinary lab dedicated to helping shape crypto and web3 as a formal area of study. One of our goals was to help bridge the worlds of academic theory with industry practice, and one of the ways we do so (besides working with our portfolio and publishing our own work) is by bringing together the very best research talent across disciplines relevant to the space.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To that end, we’ve now hosted two immersive summer programs at the a16z crypto office — where we invite both established and emerging researchers to present their work and ideas, collaborate on some of the hardest problems in the ecosystem, and sharpen each other’s ideas by spending time with one another. You can watch many of the seminars (and listen in on our in-room conversations!) from summer 2022 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjQ9HCQMu_8yPGgfvsscHgt1w1KJkx8BN">here</a>, and from fall 2022/ spring 2023 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjQ9HCQMu_8yyzwwop1pq0MGCHC-WRC6B">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, we’re releasing new talks <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/introducing-our-summer-23-research-seminars/">from the latest summer 2023</a> program &amp; cohort. The initial drop included talks from a16z crypto research partners Joe Bonneau on distributed randomness beacons and Lera Nikolaenko on distributed data storage; as well as talks from Matt Green (Johns Hopkins) on “going beyond zero knowledge: next steps for compliance and constrained encryption on blockchains”; Sarah Meiklejohn (University College London, Google) on distributed key generation; and Ittai Abraham (Intel Labs, former VMWare; also <a href="https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/">Decentralized Thoughts</a> blog) on “it’s all about trust”. The second drop, themed “<a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1696632783194718451">cryptography week</a>”, features talks from Dan Boneh (Stanford, a16z crypto); Elaine Shu (CMU); Foteini Baldimitsi (GMU); and Ron Rothblum (Technion), <a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1696632783194718451">here</a>.

There are 3 main types of secrets most people have to hold for online access:</p>  <p>Passwords — which people use to access various websites and services. These must not only be kept secret, but be unique from service to service.</p>  <p>TOTP codes — which are often generated by an authenticator app or TOTP (time-based one time password) system. These provide two-factor authentication, where a second layer of security (hence the “two”, and “multi-” if more layers) helps protect access.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Seed phrases — “mnemonic” codes or recovery phrases that give direct control of all crypto wallets derived from that seed phrase. This reflects one of the empowering features of crypto wallets: Once you enter your seed phrase, you have total control of your assets without needing to move them from one custodian to another.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Note, these “secrets” aren’t all specific to crypto/ web3; anyone using the internet today should be using these practices (or something custom tailored for their needs)! And while our recommendation would be to harden everything to the maximum extent possible, the practical reality is that purchasing hardware wallets, webauthn keys, and machines with TEEs isn’t easy to do for most people (at least, not yet). Furthermore, losing secrets can sometimes be a greater risk than having them compromised: some information, once lost, can’t ever be found.&nbsp;</p><p>So one could consider this a “minimal viable security” approach. That minimum setup — using things many people already have — would be to use a well-vetted password manager to store your seed phrases and passwords; and a TOTP app on your phone to store and use TOTP codes for 2FA (two-factor authentication). Here’s more on why and how:</p><p>Do NOT use text messages on your phone (SMS) as a second factor for authentication. SMS is a very weak choice for 2FA, given <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220208">the rise</a> of SIM swapping/ jacking: where a hacker pretends to be you to your mobile provider (“I lost my phone and need help accessing it…”); then reroutes your phone number to their device; and then can then access any accounts linked to that phone. That’s why we recommend using authenticator apps (like Authy, Google Authenticator, etc.). Not all services allow two-factor authentication, unfortunately; so you should still make sure you’re using strong, unique passwords.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Store your passwords in a password manager. This is mostly to make having unique passwords for all internet services possible; otherwise most people default to reusing passwords across sites. A password manager secures each online account with a unique, complex password — and uses one strong “master password” to encrypt all the stored passwords (see for example <a href="https://1passwordstatic.com/files/security/1password-white-paper.pdf">1Password</a>, <a href="https://bitwarden.com/help/bitwarden-security-white-paper/">Bitwarden</a>, or <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/download/whitepaper-en.pdf">Dashlane</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Your master password should be at least 16 characters — preferably a randomly generated passphrase of at least 5 words, which is usually around 30 characters, but easier to remember. This is not an arbitrary recommendation; the GPU costs for computers to guess passwords by brute force <a href="https://support.1password.com/pbkdf2/">goes up exponentially</a> the more characters and words there are in a password. That’s why longer is better. Finally: Never forget the master password! If you have to, you can write down a password hint with pen and paper, store that in the safest place you can think of, and remember where it is.</p><p>Store an encrypted copy of your backup codes/ TOTP in cloud storage, and print them out in a secure hard safe. But what about storing your TOTP codes in a password manager? Some password managers do support this, but it is better to use two different applications so that both security “factors” — password, and TOTP — remain separated. So then where should you store seed phrases? While the answer is a bit more complicated, the short answer is: in your password manager. (If you have a crypto wallet with a lot of assets in it, consider a more complex scheme; otherwise, this approach should work for most).</p><p>related:</p>  <p>📑 <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/wallet-security-non-custodial-fallacy/">Wallet security: the ‘non-custodial’ fallacy</a> (with Nassim Eddequiouaq &amp; Riyaz Faizullabhoy)</p>  <p>🎧 <a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/crypto-web3-security-bridge-hacks-wallet-hacks-nomad-slope-MomCe42_">Bridge hack, wallet hack</a> (with Matt Gleason)</p>  <p>☑️ <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/11/12/16-steps-secure-you/">16 steps to securing your data, and life</a> (a16z)</p>  <p><br>-- Sonal Chokshi and a16z crypto teams</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6db3e133-2c70-4dbb-bb2a-d5ad55d3c1fa_550x69.png">   </a> <p><br>You’re receiving this newsletter because you signed up for it on our websites, at an event, or elsewhere (you can opt out any time using the ‘unsubscribe’ link below).
