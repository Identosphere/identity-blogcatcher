  Cookiecrumbler automates cookie notice detection using LLMs, enhancing Brave's privacy features while minimizing website breakage through scalable, region-specific blocking and community collaboration.

<!-- todo: use sanitize or simplify or whitelist

<div class='wrap'>

<p>This is the 33rd post in an <a>ongoing series</a> describing new privacy features in Brave. This post describes work done by Anton Lazarev (Sr. Research Engineer) and Moritz Schafhuber (Staff DevOps Engineer), and was written by Shivan Kaul Sahib (VP, Privacy and Security).</p>
<p>We’re excited to announce two major updates in Brave’s ongoing work to improve cookie consent notice blocking. First, we’ve open sourced <a href="https://github.com/brave/cookiecrumbler/">Cookiecrumbler</a>, a tool that automatically detects cookie consent notices on websites by using open-source LLMs and even suggests fixes for them. Second, we’re now <a href="https://github.com/brave-experiments/cookiecrumbler-issues/issues">publishing GitHub issues</a> with the results of our Cookiecrumbler crawls across popular websites, inviting the broader adblocking community to help refine and triage these findings.</p>

 The challenge of blocking cookie consent notices without breaking websites 
<p>Brave blocks cookie consent notices by default. These banners are both annoying and harmful to user privacy (given how websites often implement them). Worse, as we mentioned in <a>our blog post</a> announcing cookie consent notice blocking, researchers have found that many consent systems still track people, <a href="https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Nataliia.Bielova/papers/Matt-etal-20-SP.pdf">even when users reject all cookies</a>. These notices are especially useless in Brave, since we already block third-party tracking scripts and pixels (which protects you, for instance, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7316539316560695297">when your health plan provider accidentally shares your data with Google Ads</a>).</p>
<p>Blocking cookie consent notices offers clear benefits on privacy and reducing annoyances, but it also carries risks. Overly broad or incorrect blocking can break essential website functionality, from checkout flows to layout problems. We’ve encountered many issues (broken scrolling, blank pages) when a cookie consent notice block is applied indiscriminately. To reduce their maintenance burden, adblock list maintainers tend to rely on as few rules as possible for the widest coverage. However, cookie consent notice implementations can vary significantly from one site to another, making Web-wide generic rules a frequent source of breakage. In response, we’ve spent the past few months cleaning up community-maintained <a href="https://github.com/easylist/easylist/tree/master/easylist_cookie">cookie consent notice blocking lists</a>, removing generic rules that repeatedly cause problems.&nbsp;</p>

 Enter Cookiecrumbler 
<p>Cookiecrumbler lets us scale site-specific cookie consent notice blocking across the Web. It uses open-source LLMs to automate detection, which lets us identify cookie consent notices across all sorts of site-specific variations, including non-English notices. We chose an LLM-based approach to automate the task of identifying notices for a few reasons, among them:</p>
 
 It’s easier to perform (as cookie consent notices tend to use similar text) 
 It’s repetitive (which helps with the sheer scale of the Web) 
 It’s low-risk (allowing human reviewers to remove false positives upon visual inspection) 
 It’s cheap, as every crawl costs on the order of cents (while we experimented with bigger and more expensive models, smaller models also offered great results after some tweaking) 
 
<p>This kind of LLM-based automation frees up human reviewers to do the more nuanced work of actually blocking the notice. As mentioned before, poorly applied blocking rules can break core site elements. That’s why we retained human review as part of the process: filter list maintainers and community members help confirm and tweak Cookiecrumbler suggestions before they go live. We’re also working on improving the quality of blocking rule suggestions offered by Cookiecrumbler.</p>
<p>Cookiecrumbler also supports different locations and languages. Cookie consent notices can look very different depending on a visitor’s geographic region or language settings. Cookiecrumbler has support for various geographical vantage points, so that it can see the website as a user in a particular region would see it.</p>



    


    



      
      
    
<p>Cookie notice in Thai</p>
<p>Cookiecrumbler runs completely on Brave’s backend, and uses publicly available lists of top websites for detection purposes. We’re exploring how we can build Cookiecrumbler into the browser to bring smart cookie notice detection closer to the user. But, like everything we do at Brave, this will only happen after a full privacy review so we ensure Cookiecrumbler works with user privacy and choice in mind.</p>

 How Cookiecrumbler works 

 Website list creation 
<p>First, Brave creates a custom version of the <a href="https://tranco-list.eu">Tranco list</a> that’s tailored to different regions (since cookie consent notices are often region-specific). A prioritized list of websites per region helps us focus on the most popular websites for users in multiple countries.</p>

 Automated crawling 
<p>Next, a crawling <a href="https://github.com/brave/cookiecrumbler-tools/blob/main/crawl.py">script</a> running on our CI servers takes these lists of websites and calls the Cookiecrumbler API for each website and region.</p>

 Cookiecrumbler 
<p>Once the API call is made, the Cookiecrumbler process starts:</p>
 
 The Cookiecrumbler API receives the request from the crawling script running in CI, and launches <a href="https://pptr.dev/">Puppeteer</a> (a headless browser) to load the website. We use proxies to load the website from the desired region. 
 We identify and gather candidate HTML elements from the page that might be cookie consent notices. 
 These elements get passed to the LLM, which identifies whether they’re cookie consent notices. It also suggests a fix, if applicable. 
 Cookiecrumbler sends this response back to the crawling script. 
 

 Publishing crawl results 
<p>After a crawl is done, we take the list of websites for which Cookiecrumbler identified a cookie notice (along with the region for that cookie notice), and publish this list to <a href="https://github.com/brave-experiments/cookiecrumbler-issues/issues">a new GitHub repository</a>.</p>



    


    



      
      
    

 Privacy without site breakage 
<p>Brave already offers robust and privacy-first cookie consent notice blocking by default. Cookiecrumbler extends that with an automated, large-scale process to detect new and changing banners. In combination with our work on removing brittle generic rules, we’re able to use Cookiecrumbler to ship a cookie consent notice blocking experience that doesn’t cause frequent website breakage.</p>
<p>We first unveiled Cookiecrumbler (under a different name) at the <a href="https://adfilteringdevsummit.com/">Ad Filtering Dev Summit</a> last year. Since then, we’ve made significant progress in lowering false positives, adding support for multiple languages, and ensuring coverage across multiple geographical vantage points. We’ve already seen the benefits of Cookiecrumbler, with fewer reports of notice blocking-related breakage and higher user retention and growth overall. By detecting and addressing potential breakage points proactively, we’re delivering on Brave’s commitment to a privacy-first and user-first Web.</p>

<p>You’ve likely seen the headlines: governments are pushing social media giants for backdoor access to our everyday apps. In our hyper-connected world, digital privacy is facing an unprecedented and complex decline. Hardly a day passes without news of another data&nbsp;breach.</p><p>What was once a fundamental right is rapidly becoming a fragile privilege, eroded by technological advancements, corporate greed for data, and government surveillance. Even our simplest online actions — clicks, likes, and shares — freely provide personal information, often obscuring the significant loss of our privacy, autonomy, and sense of&nbsp;self.</p> What is Digital&nbsp;Privacy? <p>Digital privacy, a key component of the larger idea of privacy, focuses on how sensitive data produced and moved across digital platforms should be properly handled and used. This data includes everything from your personal information to your chat history and online&nbsp;actions.</p><p>The foundation of digital privacy erosion lies in the ever-expanding net of data collection. In 2025, this goes far beyond the simple tracking of website visits. From AI-powered surveillance to the internet of things, and the shadowy world of data brokers, here are some key stats on the erosion of digital privacy in&nbsp;2025.</p>  IoT: The International Data Corporation (IDC) <a href="https://infohub.delltechnologies.com/en-us/l/edge-to-core-and-the-internet-of-things-2/internet-of-things-and-data-placement/">estimates</a> that 41.6 billion IoT devices will be online in 2025, generating 79.4 zettabytes (ZB) of data. From smart refrigerators that track our eating habits to connected cars that record our driving behaviour and even biometric data like driver fatigue, a vast interconnected network of sensors is constantly gathering data about our lives within our most intimate&nbsp;spaces.  Mobile Devices: It might surprise you, but the average mobile user has around 80 apps installed — many of which go unused. I just counted while writing this and found 88 on my own phone! What’s even more concerning is that, as of 2025, nearly 83% of iOS apps (that’s 1.55 million) reportedly <a href="https://42matters.com/daily-apple-privacy-stats-and-app-tracking-transparency">track</a> private user&nbsp;data.  AI Surveillance: As an action movie enthusiast, I was particularly struck by the recent G20 film’s depiction of AI-generated deepfakes. This feels especially relevant given that the global facial recognition market is projected to hit <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/facial-recognition-market-101061">$8.8 billion</a> in 2025, signaling its widespread adoption. Think about what that means: someone could potentially create realistic images and videos that falsely implicate you.  Cookie Tracking: Surprisingly, less than half of internet users (only 46%) understand what internet <a href="https://allaboutcookies.org/internet-cookies-survey">cookies</a> are. 40% of users accept cookies without knowing their purpose when visiting a website. On a more positive note, 76% of users know how to clear and disable cookies. In another report by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, over 70% of websites actively track users’ browsing habits, gathering data that ranges from search history to location.  GenAI Apps: Highlighting a potential area of vulnerability, Cisco’s <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/data-privacy-benchmark-study.html#~about-the-study">2025 Data Privacy Benchmark Study</a> indicates that 48% of organizations are currently inputting non-public company information into Generative AI apps. This practice, while potentially boosting efficiency, introduces considerable risks to proprietary and confidential data if not managed carefully.  Expert’s Confidence: A concerning lack of assurance plagues the privacy field: a mere 20% of <a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/privacy-governance-report/">privacy professionals</a> express total confidence in their organization’s adherence to privacy&nbsp;law.   The Weakening Walls of Data Protection <p>While regulations like GDPR and CCPA aimed to bolster digital privacy, their effectiveness in the face of increasingly sophisticated data collection practices is being tested. Corporations are constantly finding new ways to navigate or circumvent privacy regulations. This includes complex terms of service agreements that users often blindly accept, the use of dark patterns to manipulate consent, and the strategic location of data processing centres in jurisdictions with weaker privacy&nbsp;laws.</p><p>The global nature of the internet makes cross-border data transfers essential for many services. However, the lack of consistent international privacy standards and the complexities of legal frameworks make it challenging to ensure that personal data receives adequate protection when transferred across&nbsp;borders.</p><p>Lastly, the sheer scale and resources of tech giants create a significant power imbalance between individuals and corporations. Navigating complex privacy policies and exercising one’s rights under data protection laws can be a daunting and time-consuming task, often leading to user&nbsp;apathy.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights.

  Partnering with Listen Labs: Next-Level Customer Obsession  <p>Alfred, Florian and their team are on a mission to give every business deep, insightful research at scale—and fast. 
</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bryan-schreier/">Bryan Schreier</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/charlie-curnin/">Charlie Curnin</a>	 



Published April 23, 2025
  



Alfred and Florian.



 
<p>Imagine your company wanted to be as customer-obsessed as possible, and realities such as time and space were no object. What would you do? You’d talk to every customer you could. You’d talk to them until you understood exactly who they are and what they think of your product. You’d find a way to synthesize all these conversations into a canonical understanding of customer behavior. And you wouldn’t do all of this just once. You’d do it regularly—every time you change anything about your product or service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nothing like this has ever been possible before. But today, it is.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://listenlabs.ai/">Listen Labs</a> is a giant leap forward in customer obsession. Businesses use their AI-powered platform to conduct market research beyond the constraints of what humans can do. Where traditional methods like interviews and surveys made companies choose between quality and quantity, Listen is enabling companies to understand their customers at both great depth and great scale. We at Sequoia are proud to support their next-level customer research, and to lead both their seed and Series A rounds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re customers of Listen at Sequoia, and were frankly blown away by how well the product addresses what every company wants—to deeply understand their customers, so they can improve their products, build stronger brands and acquire customers more effectively. Listen automates every step of customer research, from crafting questions and recruiting participants to conducting interviews and analyzing responses. The platform can reach millions of participants in more than 200 countries and simultaneously hold thousands of empathetic, insightful conversations. And it only takes hours, instead of weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Listen gives businesses clear insights, automatically generating presentations on par with the output of a management consultant—together with video highlight reels of a company’s customers providing key points of feedback. Fortune 500 companies spend tens or even hundreds of millions per year on such work—and Listen can deliver superior project results faster and at a far lower cost.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Listen’s achievements are no surprise given the backgrounds of founders Alfred Wahlforss and Florian Juengermann and their team. Florian, previously a national champion in competitive programming in Germany, and Alfred, a repeat founder with extensive user interview experience, first came together at Harvard to found an AI avatar app. It went viral, gaining 20,000 users on its first day—and they built an early version of Listen to learn as much about those users as possible. Alfred and Florian are obsessed not just with understanding customers, but also with <a href="https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/listenlabs">recruiting</a> the highest-caliber talent. Among their first hires were several medalists of the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) and International Collegiate Programming Content (ICPC).&nbsp;</p>



<p>To date, Listen has conducted more than 300,000 interviews for customers like <a href="https://listenlabs.ai/case-studies/microsoft">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://listenlabs.ai/case-studies/canva">Canva</a> and <a href="https://listenlabs.ai/case-studies/chubbies">Chubbies</a>. It’s also spread organically through Sequoia, where we’ve used it for everything from research on industry trends to gathering customer feedback during due diligence.</p>



<p>We’re excited about Listen because it has the potential to change how companies build their products and services across industries—enabling businesses from software to CPG to VC to iterate on everything from product prototypes to brand and advertising far faster. Deeply understanding your customers is a competitive advantage, and we’re proud to be by their side.&nbsp;</p>

  The Always-On Economy: AI’s Real Impact in the Next 5-7 Years  <p>Before we get to full-blown AGI, hybrid agent/human systems will remove temporal friction from the economy and create new opportunities.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/konstantine-buhler/">Konstantine Buhler</a>	 



Published April 21, 2025
  



 
<p>While discussions about artificial intelligence often oscillate between immediate applications and far-future scenarios of artificial general intelligence (AGI), there’s a crucial middle ground that deserves our attention. In the next 5-7 years, AI will reshape and accelerate our economy by enabling “always-on” operations across numerous sectors. This transformation isn’t merely theoretical—it’s already happening in some industries, offering a preview of our near future.</p>



 The present: Islands of always-on 



<p>The future is indeed already here, just unevenly distributed. Several sectors have already achieved “always-on” status through AI:</p>



<p>Financial markets exemplify this transformation as early adopters of AI way before the LLM era. What once required physical traders shouting in pits during limited hours has evolved into a 24/7 digital marketplace. This was the result of thousands of brilliant quants creating predictive algorithms to determine when to buy or sell—collectively known now as electronic market makers (e.g. Citadel Securities). The result is a smooth, convenient experience for consumers with better prices. Modern consumers can now execute trades at midnight on a Friday—an impossibility just a few years ago.</p>



<p>Healthcare has seen similar evolution. Companies like Viz.ai have revolutionized stroke detection, providing expert-level analysis around the clock in 40% of U.S. hospitals. Before such innovations, if a patient came in at an off hour they wouldn’t be guaranteed the highest quality diagnostic treatment. Now, with AI imaging always on, a LVO (large vessel occlusion) stroke can be detected any day or time. This technology is particularly vital for rural facilities lacking 24/7 specialist coverage, demonstrating how AI can democratize access to expertise. AI-powered devices now constantly track vital signs, creating an “always-on” healthcare presence that was previously impossible. These systems continuously monitor patients’ conditions remotely, immediately alerting providers to concerning changes and enabling data-driven decisions based on real-time information rather than periodic check-ins. The technology extends from hospital settings to patients’ homes with companies like Commure, which offer devices that can perform sophisticated diagnostics (like blood cell counts) through simple procedures such as finger-pricks.</p>



<p>Physical security has been transformed by AI into systems of perpetual vigilance. Previously, only high-value facilities had human-monitored camera systems. Today, AI-powered surveillance systems like Verkada use continuous computer vision to monitor countless cameras simultaneously, triggering notifications only when necessary and providing advanced pattern recognition beyond human capabilities. Similarly in law enforcement, police departments now use always-on AI platforms like Peregrine that function as tireless analysts. These systems unify disconnected data across agencies into actionable intelligence, continuously identifying connections between cases and monitoring threats in real-time. This capability was demonstrated at Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans, where the technology provided constant threat monitoring.</p>



 The near future: Expanding always-on operations 



<p>The next half-decade will see this always-on capability extend to numerous other sectors:</p>



<p>The days of “high call volume” messages and limited business hours are numbered. AI will handle front-line support continuously, with human managers available for escalations. Small businesses will compete with large corporations in providing 24/7 customer care, using AI to filter and escalate only truly urgent matters.</p>



<p>Rather than waiting for general-purpose robots, specialized systems will enable 24/7 operations in specific domains. For instance, automated food preparation systems will allow restaurants to operate continuously, maintaining consistent quality regardless of time or staffing constraints. AI-powered systems will enable autonomous manufacturing as robots work alongside human operators to maintain continuous production cycles. This will transform manufacturing by optimizing production flow and improving overall efficiency while maintaining the critical human judgment and creativity that drives innovation. Cobot exemplifies this type of future, and is already live in production in logistics and manufacturing operations to redefine human-robot collaboration.</p>



<p>Medical professionals will benefit from AI-powered documentation systems that operate continuously. Consider emergency surgeons responding to 3 AM calls—AI will automatically document these urgent communications, allowing doctors to focus entirely on patient care and superior outcomes rather than administrative tasks. AI note-takers like Freed and Abridge are transforming healthcare by eliminating documentation burdens. And always-on information systems like OpenEvidence help doctors keep up with the latest treatments instantaneously.</p>



<p>ChatGPT already provides students with a 24/7 tutor (that can also do their homework!) and education is primed to become one of the largest use cases for generative AI as its reliability improves and schools figure out how to incorporate it into their curricula responsibly. Not only will AI agents adapt to students’ level of understanding and cognitive needs, but as workers retrain to keep up with the changing job market there will be an increased demand for after hours adult education service as well.</p>



<p>Companies like XBOW have pioneered always-on penetration testing for enterprises. AI is forecast to increase the surface area for cyberattacks as criminals get better at writing their own malicious agents, but 24/7 security will rise to stay ahead of the bad guys.</p>



<p>Always-on will also have an impact on recruiting. 24/7 HR agents will allow candidates with jobs and families to interview for positions at 10 pm or on weekends, allowing great candidates who previously couldn’t schedule interviews to apply.</p>



<p>Fleets of autonomous vehicles will become mainstays in many communities, fulfilling Uber’s original mission to “make transportation as reliable as running water.” Unlike other services with capacity fluctuations, autonomous fleets will maintain consistent availability regardless of time. Benefits include eliminated surge pricing, reliable service in underserved areas, more efficient fleet utilization and reduced total vehicle requirements.&nbsp;</p>



 The Broader Implications 



<p>This shift toward an always-on economy will have profound effects:</p>



 
 Economic efficiency: The elimination of traditional business hours will reduce economic friction and increase asset utilization. 



 Global competition: Time zones will become less relevant as AI enables continuous operation across borders. 



 Work patterns: Traditional 9-to-5 schedules will evolve as systems operate continuously, requiring new approaches to human oversight and intervention. 



 Resource distribution: Peak demand periods will flatten as pricing mechanisms encourage off-hours usage. 
 



 The Always On Workforce 



<p>The real transformation AI brings in the next 5-7 years isn’t about replacing human intelligence—it’s about removing temporal constraints from our economy. This shift toward continuous operation will create new opportunities while challenging traditional business models and work patterns. Organizations that adapt to this always-on paradigm will find themselves at a significant advantage in an increasingly fluid and accelerated economic landscape.</p>



<p>The key to success will not lie in completely automating human tasks, but in thoughtfully integrating AI systems to enable continuous operations while maintaining human oversight where it matters most. This hybrid approach will define the next phase of economic evolution, creating a more responsive and efficient economy that never sleeps.</p>

<p>Crypto OG, checking in! I mean, I have been active in this space since Bitcoin was $400 and I’ve lived through the ICO boom, the NFT craze, the metaverse hype, and the meme coin madness, you name it. One thing’s crystal clear though: a lot of these price swings are pure speculation, not actual adoption. It’s the classic “buy the rumour, sell the news” playbook.</p><p>In January 2024, CoinGecko released a <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/how-many-cryptocurrencies-failed#:~:text=How%20Many%20Crypto%20Coins%20Have,the%202020%20%2D%202021%20bull%20run.">report</a> suggesting that over 50% of the cryptocurrencies listed on its platform between 2014 and 2023 had died. Bull runs are notorious for a high rate of listings, with a failure rate of approximately 70%. But it gets even more interesting.</p><p>A casual check of CoinMarketCap’s <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/number-of-cryptocurrencies-tracked/">new listings</a> underscores the speculative nature of the current market. The platform recorded over 70,000 new cryptocurrencies within 24 hours, 560,000 in the past week, and roughly 1.7 million in the last month. And we both know that a considerable chunk of these projects are pump-and-dump coins riding the wave of&nbsp;hype.</p><p>Against this backdrop of fleeting trends and project failures, we can’t ignore the many cryptocurrencies that have stood the test of time, PIVX being one of&nbsp;such.</p><p>PIVX (Private Instant Verified Transaction) is a cryptocurrency that has been around since 2016, evolving from a DASH fork into a project focused on privacy, security, and community governance. Moving beyond the speculative frenzy that often dominates crypto markets, let’s explore the fundamental value proposition of&nbsp;PIVX.</p> Privacy Matters <p>At its heart, PIVX prioritizes user privacy. Unlike public blockchains where transaction details are transparent, PIVX implements several key technologies to enhance anonymity. Its core privacy feature is zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge), a powerful cryptographic tool allowing users to conduct transactions without revealing the sender, receiver, or amount. This commitment to “optional” transactional privacy positions PIVX as a valuable tool for individuals and entities seeking financial confidentiality in an increasingly surveilled digital landscape.</p> Instant and Verified Transactions <p>PIVX lives up to its name by offering near-instant transaction confirmations. The blockchain network currently has a theoretical maximum throughput of 173 transactions per second (tps). This allows for quick and reliable payments, making PIVX a potentially viable option for everyday transactions.</p><p>Furthermore, the network employs a robust Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which not only secures the blockchain but also offers energy efficiency compared to Proof-of-Work systems. The PoS model also incentivizes network participation through staking rewards, fostering a stronger and more decentralized network.</p> Decentralized Governance and Community Power <p>A significant aspect of PIVX’s fundamental value lies in its strong emphasis on decentralized governance. Through its masternode network, PIVX holders have the power to propose, vote on, and fund development and marketing initiatives. This community-driven governance model ensures that the project’s direction aligns with the interests of its stakeholders, fostering a sense of ownership and long-term commitment. This decentralized decision-making process is a double-edged sword that can lead to voter apathy and plutocracy or a more agile and responsive development compared to projects governed by a central&nbsp;entity.</p><p>PIVX has maintained this structure for nearly a decade, meaning it works for the ecosystem.</p> Real-World Use Cases and&nbsp;Adoption <p>While privacy-focused cryptocurrencies sometimes face scrutiny, the demand for private transactions is undeniable. PIVX has seen adoption in various niches where confidentiality is paramount, including online merchants, freelancers, and individuals seeking to protect their financial data. The fast transaction speeds and low fees enhance its practicality for real-world use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>As regulatory landscapes evolve and awareness of digital privacy grows, the utility of privacy-enhancing cryptocurrencies like PIVX is likely to increase.</p><p>In conclusion, while market speculation inevitably influences the price of any cryptocurrency, evaluating the fundamental value of PIVX requires looking beyond short-term price fluctuations. Its strong focus on privacy, fast and secure transactions, decentralized governance, and growing real-world utility contribute to a compelling fundamental value proposition.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/beyond-speculation-evaluating-the-fundamental-value-of-pivx-63ce870638c9">Beyond Speculation: Evaluating the Fundamental Value of PIVX</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In November 2025, the current Dev Fund established under ZIP 1015 will expire, and 100% of block rewards will be allocated to miners. If a new Dev Fund is not in place by the time ZIP 1015 expires in November 2025, 100% of block rewards will go to miners.</p>



<p>Today we opened a <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/d55e9c6a-1b8a-11f0-8188-0ebcee0014ca/view">ZCAP poll</a> intended to assess whether there is community consensus to create a new Dev Fund and corresponding funding model and, if so, which proposal is preferred. This poll is part of our ongoing commitment to ensuring that the Zcash community has a significant and meaningful role in shaping decisions concerning the future direction of Zcash.</p>



<p></p>



 ZCAP Poll Questions 



<p>In this poll we are asking the following questions, and provide the following response options.</p>



 



<p>Q1: Which of the following funding proposals do you support? You can select more than one proposal.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Community and Coinholder Funding Model (C&amp;C) 



 Community-Governed Funding Model 



 Pure Coinholder Funding Model 



 Pure ZCAP Funding Model 



 Zcash Governance Bloc (zBloc) 



 The Dev Fund should end and 100% of the block reward should go to miners.&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



<p>Below is a summary of the five proposals:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Community and Coinholder (C&amp;C) Funding Model (C&amp;C) : Allocates 8% of block rewards to ZCG and 12% to a Coinholder-Controlled Fund, active until the third halving in November 2028. It gives ZCG and coinholders distinct decision-making roles, with grants from the coinholder fund requiring 420,000 ZEC to be approved. For more information, see this <a href="https://zips.z.cash/draft-ecc-community-and-coinholder">link</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Community-Governed Funding Model: Allocates 8% to ZCG and 12% to a ZCAP-Controlled Fund managed by the Zcash Foundation. It prioritizes community consensus, with a 50% participation threshold for ZCAP voting, and secures funds in a multisig wallet. For more information, see this <a href="https://github.com/jackgavigan/zips/blob/patch-3/zips/draft-jackgavigan-community-governed-funding.md">link</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pure Coinholder Funding Model: Allocates 20% of block rewards to a Coinholder-Controlled Fund, active until the third halving. Grants require 420,000 ZEC for approval and are managed exclusively by coinholder voting. For more information, see this <a href="https://zips.z.cash/draft-pm-pure-coinholder-funding">link</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pure ZCAP Funding Model: Allocates 20% of block rewards to a ZCAP-Controlled Fund managed by the Zcash Foundation. All funding decisions are made by ZCAP, with a 50% participation threshold, and funds are held in a multisig wallet. For more information, see this <a href="https://github.com/jackgavigan/zips/blob/patch-4/zips/draft-jackgavigan-pure-zcap-funding.md">link</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zcash Governance Bloc (zBloc): Allocates 20% of block rewards to a Community Fund split into Large and Minor Grant pools. Governance is shared across constituencies like Coinholders, ECC, and ZF, each with adjustable voting power and thresholds. For more information, see this <a href="https://zips.z.cash/draft-ecc-zbloc">link</a>.</p>



 



<p>Q2: Do you support prioritizing the extension of the Dev Fund and the implementation of a new funding model, even if it requires postponing NU7?</p>



 
 Yes 



 No 



 Abstain 
 



 



<p></p>



<p>The results of ZCAP polls are advisory but serve as an important signal to ecosystem participants, funders, and developers. The poll will close at 12:00 am UTC on May 1, 2025 and results will be shared by May 5th.</p>



 We Support Community Consensus 



<p>While the Zcash Foundation Board recently voted unanimously to endorse <a href="https://zfnd.org/why-the-board-endorses-the-community-and-coinholder-funding-model-cc/">the Community and Coinholder Funding Model (C&amp;C)</a> ZIP proposal, we deeply respect the voice of the Zcash community and are fully committed to upholding its collective decision even if it diverges from our Board’s recommendation. The Foundation will support the community’s choice and take the necessary steps to help implement it.</p>



 Why ZCAP Matters 



<p>This poll is part of our ongoing efforts to provide the Zcash community with a meaningful voice in decisions about the future of Zcash. As always, the results of ZCAP polls are non-binding but serve as an important signal to ecosystem participants, funders, and developers.</p>



<p>The ZCAP process is a transparent, community-driven way to surface the views and priorities of long-term Zcash supporters. Though advisory in nature, these votes play a vital role in informing decisions across the ecosystem. Thank you for lending your voice.</p>



<p>As always, we welcome feedback from the Zcash Community. If you have comments or suggestions, please join the conversation on the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/moving-the-dev-fund-discussion-forward/47464">Zcash community forum</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pioneering Quantum-Secure Infrastructure, Privacy Tools, and Cross-Chain Innovation</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>April 2025 — The XX Network is proud to announce the release of its 2025 Roadmap, highlighting a series of key advancements aimed at accelerating the development of quantum-secure, privacy-respecting technologies for the decentralized web.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As we continue to expand our ecosystem and empower developers, users, and partners, the roadmap outlines new features, critical infrastructure upgrades, and global community initiatives.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Key Focus Areas Include:</p>
<p></p>
 <p></p>
 Haven Messenger &amp; Browser Extension:<br>Haven is being architected with a modular messaging SDK, full React integration, and a modernized web app experience. Developers will gain access to a documented, flexible toolkit (xxdk) and a UI layer (xxdk-react) powered by hooks, Wasm, and custom state management. This overhaul positions Haven for long-term multi-platform support and privacy-first messaging. Haven’s PWA will also see a new ID system which uses a browser extension app for a more secure and convenient user experience. 
<p></p>
 Doxxier &amp; OpenVoice:<br>Doxxier, a secure large file transfer solution integrated into the XX mixnet, which will power a future whistleblower dapp. 
<p></p>
 Quantum XX Wallet:<br>Incorporating WOTS+ cryptography for next-generation, quantum-resistant transactions. 
<p></p>
 xxDK Upgrades:<br>Expanded support for React, React Native, Rust, and C to streamline development across platforms. 
<p></p>
 Core infrastructure:<br>Xx Foundation continues to work on infrastructure efficiency for core infra servers while it also works towards our ultimate goal of full decentralization of xx network. 
<p></p>
 Ecosystem Partnerships:<br>Integration with Quip.Network, a cross-chain quantum vault and atomic swap protocol, and Superset.Finance, focused on deep liquidity across chains and quick crypto access. 
<p></p>
 Community &amp; Outreach:<br>The Privacy Podcast Series continues with high-profile guests, alongside an international presence at conferences including Token2049 Dubai, Scytale Lugano, EthDam, and W3PN Amsterdam. Also, Ant Soccer Game will launch its game and an integration of the xx coin into their game is forthcoming after launch.

  Partnering with Finch: AI-Powered Justice  <p>Viraj, Ben, and their team are giving personal injury law firms the case staff of the future.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/alfred-lin/">Alfred Lin</a>	 



Published April 16, 2025
  



Team Finch.



 
<p>Movies and TV suggest the vast majority of legal work happens in the courtroom, where lawyers make grand speeches and shout “Objection!” But the reality is, law firms spend countless hours on mundane administrative work. At the typical personal injury firm, half of the team’s time goes to tasks such as conducting intake calls, drafting and formatting letters, and chasing down police and medical records—much of it happening before a case is even filed. At the same time, the paralegals who spearhead this work have become increasingly hard to find, with close to half of firms <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/association-legal-administrators-4058492/">expecting</a> 40% of their support staff to retire within five years.</p>



<p>It is a challenge making it ever more difficult for small, local practices to grow and compete with national firms, at a time when millions of Americans are already <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/making-justice-equal/">struggling</a> to access legal advice.</p>



<p>But now, those practices can arm themselves with the case staff of the future, thanks to co-founders Viraj Bindra and Ben Weems and their team at <a href="https://www.finchlegal.com/">Finch</a>. By combining elite paralegals with AI agents, the platform handles all of a personal injury firm’s pre-litigation work—not only generating documents, but also onboarding new cases, managing claims with insurance, coordinating with medical providers, and more. While Finch AI agents transcribe calls, request records, and open claims, its bilingual paralegals work directly with clients. It integrates natively into a firm’s case management system, email, and messaging systems with best-in-class, SOC 2 compliant security.</p>



<p>Just as delivery marketplaces once transformed the restaurant industry, AI automation is disrupting the world of law. It’s no surprise that Viraj and Ben both cut their teeth building marketplaces with our friends at DoorDash. A uniquely talented product thinker, Viraj became the company’s fastest-promoted PM, scaling Pickup, Grocery, Convenience, and International into billion-dollar businesses. Ben, meanwhile, went on to demonstrate his technical and operational prowess at two other Sequoia portfolio companies, Google and Catch. Together, they are an incredibly productive duo, and they share a genuine fascination with helping law firms level up—and helping more people get legal representation.</p>



<p>Happily, that is precisely what they’ve done since the launch of Finch’s successful beta. Partner firms report that it has cut their case staff time and costs by as much as two-thirds—and enabled them to grow as much as 40% month over month, dramatically expanding their caseloads. As Viraj, Ben, and their team expand to a public launch and announce this round of seed funding led by Sequoia, we are excited to be by their side—and to watch as more personal injury firms free themselves of administrative burdens, achieve their true potential, and widen access to justice.</p>

<p>Welcome to the Empeiria’s development update from March&nbsp;2025!</p><p>Over the past few weeks, our team has been hard at work advancing the core components of Emperia ecosystem. From preparing the mainnet for launch to enhancing tools like the Explorer and EMPE Wallet, we’re laying the groundwork for a robust, user-friendly, and developer-ready blockchain environment.</p><p>Here’s a look at some of the key milestones we’ve achieved recently and what they mean for our community and ecosystem.</p> 1. MCP: A New Standard for AI Agent Integration <p>We’ve made significant progress with our implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open-source standard pioneered by Anthropic that’s revolutionizing the AI agent landscape. MCP acts like a universal “plug and play” connector, making it effortless to link AI agents with various tools and data sources in a standardized way.</p>  Empe MCP Teaser: <a href="https://x.com/empe_io/status/1904896148860477728">https://x.com/empe_io/status/1904896148860477728</a>  <p>With our new MCP server for Issuer and Verifier tools, we’re enabling AI agents to issue credentials and verify data more easily, boosting their reliability and opening up exciting new possibilities. For developers, MCP simplifies tasks like defining schemas or managing servers, and it even allows for automation through compatible cloud apps. As MCP gains traction across the industry, we’re proud to be part of this shift toward a more interoperable and powerful AI ecosystem.</p><p>Learn more from documentation: <a href="https://github.com/empe-io/mcp-server">https://github.com/empe-io/mcp-server</a></p> 2. EMPE Hub: Your All-in-One Blockchain Portal <p>The EMPE Hub has been redesigned with a refreshed UI and revamped codebase a comprehensive management interface for all ecosystem interactions, empowering users with streamlined access to essential features.</p> EMPE Hub Core Features:   Token Staking &amp; Rewards: Easily stake tokens, monitor rewards, and manage validator selections.

   A new report highlights a disturbing trend in China — the increasing surveillance and arrests of Tibetans for offenses related to their phone and internet activity.  According to Human Rights Watch, at least 60 Tibetans have been arrested since 2021, a figure that is likely higher due to the government’s lack of transparency. The crackdown is part of a broader tightening of control in Tibet, where

The crackdown is part of a broader tightening of control in Tibet, where even basic cell phone use is now considered risky.</p><p>Maya Wang, associate China director at Human Rights Watch, explained that while cell phones were once welcomed by Tibetans in remote areas for maintaining connections, they have now “effectively become government tracking devices.” She&nbsp;added:</p><p>“For Tibetans, simply using a cell phone has become dangerous, and everyday activities like posting a humorous video or contacting loved ones abroad can bring arrest, detention, and torture.”</p><p>Many arrests stem from possessing content deemed illegal by the government, such as religious materials not officially sanctioned. One documented case involved the arrest of a man for creating a WeChat group “without permission” to celebrate the birthdays of elderly Buddhist&nbsp;monks.</p><p>Individuals have also been detained for sharing content that promotes the Tibetan language or opposes the use of Mandarin in schools. Several Tibetan-language websites hosting cultural and educational content have been shut down since&nbsp;2020.</p><p>Chinese police are employing invasive surveillance tactics, including mass phone searches and forcing Tibetans to download an application that grants access to sensitive user data. This allows authorities to monitor communications and online activity.</p><p>The intensified surveillance and arrests have created a pervasive climate of fear and self-censorship among Tibetans, severely restricting their fundamental rights to freedom of expression, access to information, and communication. The ability to maintain cultural and religious practices and connect with family abroad is increasingly curtailed.</p><p>The situation in Tibet highlights a concerning trend of governments leveraging technology to suppress dissent and control minority populations, raising critical questions about digital rights and state surveillance in the 21st&nbsp;century.</p><p>PIVX.

									<p>As we approach critical decisions about the future of Zcash governance and funding, the Zcash Foundation Board has unanimously agreed to endorse the <a href="https://zips.z.cash/draft-ecc-community-and-coinholder">Community and Coinholder Funding Model</a> (C&amp;C) ZIP proposal. This model represents a balanced, forward-looking approach that prioritizes decentralization, cooperation, and sustainability. Here’s why we believe it is the best path forward for Zcash.</p>
<p></p>
 Giving Coinholders a Voice 
<p>One of the most compelling aspects of this proposal is its focus on empowering coinholders with a meaningful voice in funding decisions. By allocating 12% of block rewards to a Coinholder-Controlled Fund, this model ensures that those who actively hold and support ZEC can directly influence how resources are distributed. This mechanism not only ensures decentralized decision-making but also strengthens accountability, aligning funding priorities with the interests of those invested in Zcash’s success.</p>
<p></p>
 Recognizing ZCG’s Success 
<p>Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) has been a remarkable advocate for ecosystem growth, particularly in supporting smaller-scale projects that bring tangible benefits to the ecosystem. From light wallets to educational platforms, ZCG has consistently funded initiatives that enhance usability and adoption. This proposal builds on their success by continuing to allocate 8% of block rewards to ZCG, ensuring that community-driven innovation remains a cornerstone of Zcash development.</p>
<p></p>
 Fostering Cooperation Between Core Groups 
<p>A recurring theme in Forum discussions has been the need for better collaboration among key organizations like ECC, ZF, and Shielded Labs. The C&amp;C model encourages cooperation by clearly defining roles and responsibilities while maintaining decentralized control over funds. By endorsing this ZIP proposal, we aim to further unify efforts across these groups, creating a more cohesive roadmap for Zcash’s future.</p>
<p></p>
 Promoting Positive Community Development 
<p>At its core, the C&amp;C proposal is about deliberately empowering the community and not consolidating power within large organizations. It provides mechanisms for transparent grant applications, community feedback, and coinholder voting, all designed to ensure that funding decisions reflect what’s best for Zcash as a public good. This approach minimizes risks while maximizing opportunities for growth and innovation.</p>
<p></p>
 Why This Model is the Least Risky 
<p>With the expiration of ZIP 1015 looming in November 2025, inaction would pose significant risks to Zcash’s development continuity. The proposed funding streams mitigate these risks by ensuring resources remain available for essential projects without introducing unnecessary complexity or centralization. Additionally, safeguards like multisig-controlled funds reduce vulnerabilities to theft or loss.</p>
<p></p>
 Looking Ahead 
<p>Endorsing this model is not just about solving immediate funding challenges, instead it’s about setting Zcash on a sustainable trajectory for years to come. By giving coinholders a voice, supporting proven programs like ZCG, and fostering collaboration among ecosystem partners, we believe this ZIP proposal offers the best chance to ensure Zcash continues to be a decentralized, community-driven protocol.</p>
<p>While we support the C&amp;C funding model, we deeply value the voice of the community and are fully-committed to honoring the collective decision made by the Zcash community, even if it differs from our recommendation. We invite you to share your thoughts and feedback as we move forward together.</p>

<p>Launched without a pre-mine in 2016, <a href="https://pivx.org/">PIVX</a> is an OG cryptocurrency with a consistent development history. This privacy-focused coin features distinctive tokenomics designed for a sustainable equilibrium between inflationary and deflationary forces.</p><p>If you’re considering holding PIVX for the long term, this guide will walk you through everything you need to understand about its tokenomics.</p> Key Elements of the PIVX&nbsp;Network  Dynamic Coin&nbsp;Supply <p>Unlike other cryptocurrencies that have a fixed maximum supply, PIVX has a dynamic supply model. New PIV coins are generated with each block and distributed as follows — 10 PIV to the Treasury, 6 PIV to Masternodes, and 4 PIV to&nbsp;Stakers.</p><p>Transaction fees are burned, serving as a balancing mechanism between inflation and potential deflation. However, it is worth mentioning that the coin burn does little to dampen inflation at the moment since fees on the PIVX blockchain are infinitesimal. This is expected to change as the project rollouts shielded staking and masternode rewards since SHIELDED fees are slightly&nbsp;higher.</p> Proof of Stake (PoS) Consensus <p>PIVX utilizes a PoS consensus mechanism, which is more energy-efficient than Proof of Work (PoW). Holders can stake their PIVX to secure the network and earn rewards (currently 13% annually).</p><p><a href="https://pivx.org/proof-of-stake">Staking</a> provides a direct financial incentive to hold PIVX and contribute to network security. Long-term holders can earn passive income by staking their PIVX. The barrier to entry for staking is low; even holding a small amount of PIVX in a compatible wallet allows participation. Meanwhile, PIVX offers cold staking, which allows users to delegate their staking rights to a separate online node while keeping their coins securely offline. This enhances security for long-term holders.</p><p>The frequency of staking rewards depends on the amount of PIVX being staked and the overall network weight (the total amount of PIVX being staked). Although rewards are random, the estimated daily reward for staking 10,000 PIV is approximately 4&nbsp;PIV.</p> Masternode Network <p>A layer of masternodes enhance network stability. Operators are rewarded for their commitment and participate in governance.</p><p>Running a PIV masternode requires a collateral of 10,000 PIVX but offers a larger share of the block rewards compared to staking. For holders with a significant amount of PIVX, running a Masternode can be a more lucrative way to earn rewards and actively participate in the governance of the&nbsp;network.</p> Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) <p>PIVX is governed by its community through a DAO. Masternode operators can vote on budget proposals, development initiatives, and other important decisions, ensuring the project’s direction is community-driven.</p><p>The strong emphasis on decentralized governance means that the future direction of PIVX is in the hands of its community, particularly those who have made a significant long-term investment by running masternodes. This can lead to more aligned and sustainable development.</p> Inflation Rate <p>The annual inflation rate of PIVX is dynamic and depends on the block reward, the number of masternodes, and the amount of PIV burned in transaction fees. The current max emission is 20 PIV per minute (shared between stakers, masternodes, and the treasury). This translates to a hypothetical annual inflation of around 11%. But in reality, the inflation rate is a lot lower since half of this amount is used to fund proposals that provide value to the ecosystem. The other half is used to reward stakers and masternodes, adding value to inflation.</p><p>Historically, the inflation rate has been relatively low and is designed to gradually decrease over time as network adoption grows and more fees are burned. While there’s no scarcity created by a hard cap, the burning mechanism can lead to a more stable or even deflationary supply in the long run if adoption increases.</p> Utility and&nbsp;Adoption <p>There is growing awareness about privacy and surveillance. PIVX’s focus on privacy through its SHIELD protocol provides a unique utility proposition in a growing market concerned with financial privacy. Furthermore, the blockchain offers near-instant transaction confirmations, enhancing the usability of PIVX for everyday transactions.</p><p>PIVX can be spent on thousands of gift cards on the <a href="https://cards.pivxla.bz/">PIVCards</a> website. It can also be used for flight and hotel bookings via Travala and in 100s of merchant&nbsp;stores.</p><p>Increased adoption and the development of a thriving ecosystem will drive demand for PIVX and positively impact its long-term value.</p><p>PIVX.

  AI 50: AI Agents Move Beyond Chat  <p>The 2025 edition of the AI 50 list shows how companies are using agents and reasoning models to take on real enterprise workflows.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/konstantine-buhler/">Konstantine Buhler</a>	 



Published April 10, 2025
  



 
<p>Artificial intelligence is entering a new phase in 2025. After years of AI tools mostly answering questions or generating content on command, this year’s innovations are about AI actually getting work done. The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/lists/ai50/?sh=14d96301290f">2025 Forbes AI 50 list</a> illustrates this pivotal shift, as startups on it signal a move from AI that merely responds to prompts to one that solves problems and completes entire workflows. For all the buzz around big AI model makers like OpenAI, Anthropic or xAI, the biggest changes to the story in 2025 are in these application-layer tools that use AI to produce real business results.</p>
 







 
 From chatbots to completing workflows 



<p>Historically, AI assistants could chat or provide information, but humans still had to act on the output. In 2025, that’s changing. For example, legal AI startup Harvey is showing that its software can do more than just answer legal questions—it can handle entire legal workflows, from document review to predictive analysis of cases. Its platform can draft documents, suggest revisions and even help automate negotiations, case management and client contact—suites of tasks that normally require a team of junior lawyers. This achievement earned Harvey a spot on the Forbes AI 50 list​, and it exemplifies AI evolving from a helpful tool to a hands-on problem solver.&nbsp;</p>



 Enterprise tools leading the way 



<p>Many of the standout AI 50 companies are enterprise tools that do on-the-job work. Sierra and Cursor, the only product of startup Anysphere, are emblematic of this new generation of business AI. Sierra automates customer service while vastly improving the experience, opening the way for companies to offer help to their customers at all hours. Cursor, meanwhile, has taken the software developer community by storm. Its technology allows anyone to not only autocomplete lines of code (à la GitHub CoPilot), but also generate entire features and applications simply by asking for it in plain English.&nbsp;</p>



 Robotics on the rise 



<p>Although we’re not yet at a point where companies are deploying robots en masse, startups focused on robotics have made meaningful strides in the past year as they integrate models built using transformers (the “t” in ChatGPT) with hardware. Robotics featured prominently in Nvidia’s keynote at its recent developer conference, with Jensen Huang claiming, “<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-keynote-at-gtc-2025-ai-news-live-updates/#:~:text=Physical%20AI%20for%20industrial%20and,Cosmos%20platforms%20leading%20the%20way.">physical AI for industrial and robotics is a $50 trillion opportunity</a>.” Figure AI recently announced its BotQ high-volume manufacturing facility capable of producing 12,000 of its humanoid robots a year along with its new generalist Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model, Helix. Another AI 50 company, Skild AI, is taking a different approach, focusing on developing a universal robotics foundation model, Skild Brain, that can be integrated into a wide variety of robots, rather than building its own. Skild is also planning to sell services to the robotics industry that use Skild Brain.</p>



 Consumers on the cusp of AI productivity 



<p>So far, everyday consumers have mainly encountered advanced AI via chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Anthropic’s Claude (and newcomers like Grok). Hundreds of millions have tried talking to these AI tools, but we’ve yet to see a truly mainstream app where AI completes everyday tasks for people. That is likely to change in 2026. With the technology maturing—and people realizing how AI can save them time and money at work—expect a wave of consumer-facing AI products that handle whole tasks on their users’ behalf. For example, Anthropic recently launched Claude Code, making software writing accessible to consumers. These new capabilities raise the prospect that AIs able to manage your schedule, book travel or organize your files end-to-end are on the horizon.&nbsp;</p>



 2025 as Turning Point, 2026 for Wider Adoption 



<p>This year is a turning point: AI graduated from an answer engine to an <a href="https://x.com/dharmesh/status/1790602530822426730">action engine</a> in the workplace. The 2025 AI 50 companies proved that AI can be trusted with meaningful workloads and deliver real results, setting the stage for broader adoption. As we head into 2026, expect the enterprise gains to start spilling into everyday life. Challenges like accuracy and security remain, but the momentum is undeniable. In 2025, AI gets real work done.</p>

<p>Namechain is an L2 developed by ENS Labs, to enhance the scalability and efficiency of managing decentralized identities on Ethereum. It is designed to work in tandem with ENS V2, which introduced a hierarchical registry system for more efficient subdomain management and custom resolvers. A key vision for Namechain is to unify multi-chain user identities, creating a "digital identity chain" that simplifies how users interact with the broader blockchain ecosystem. This is achieved through features like L2-to-L2 bridging, which allows users to initiate ENS-related activities from various Ethereum Layer 2 networks, not just Namechain itself.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  High level overview of ENS  Crosschain functionality through CCIP Read  Domain squatting  Onboarding ENS users via Paypal and Venmo  Google &amp; GoDaddy integrations  ENS V2 upgrade &amp; Namechain  Transferring tokens from Namechain to L1  Sequencer security assumptions  Scalability  New features &amp; use cases  ENS roadmap &amp; metrics  Ethereum ecosystem status  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/nicksdjohnson">Nick Johnson on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/ensdomains">ENS on X</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>A British court has finally confirmed that Apple is engaged in a legal tussle against the UK government over a controversial legal order related to the company’s encryption of iCloud accounts. The disclosure sheds light on a previously obscured dispute concerning government access to encrypted data.</p><p>The Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT), the UK’s specialized court for national security cases, issued a <a href="https://investigatorypowerstribunal.org.uk/judgement/apple-inc-v-secretary-of-state-for-the-home-department/">judgment</a> on Monday stating it would confirm “the bare details of the case.” The decision trails the government’s arguments that revealing any information about the legal proceedings would jeopardize national security.</p><p>This legal battle is linked to Apple’s <a href="https://medium.com/pivx/apple-vs-uk-epic-privacy-showdown-1ff73943f672">earlier decision</a> to disable end-to-end encryption for iCloud accounts belonging to its UK users. This move followed the issuance of a legal order from the British government, which reportedly demanded that Apple provide access to encrypted iCloud accounts. While the government has neither confirmed nor denied the existence of such a demand, and Apple has not explicitly stated the reason for disabling the encryption feature (citing potential legal restrictions), Apple has consistently maintained that “we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never&nbsp;will.”</p><p>The IPT’s summary judgment reveals that an initial hearing was held in private, with the identities of Apple and the Home Secretary kept confidential. This secrecy was intended to allow the government to argue for the entire case to remain secret without compromising that secrecy. However, the IPT has rejected the government’s plea for complete confidentiality, stating, “We do not accept that the revelation of the bare details of the case would be damaging to the public interest or prejudicial to national security.”</p><p>This decision by the IPT was influenced by representations made by numerous media organizations, civil society groups, and even U.S. senators and members of Congress. The judgment also noted public comments made by senior U.S. politicians that appeared to corroborate the existence of the legal order, with one comparing the British government’s actions to those seen in China. A former U.S. Director of National Intelligence also reportedly ordered a legal review of the secret directive, expressing “grave concern” about its implications.</p><p>Experts, including those within Britain’s own intelligence community, had previously called for greater transparency regarding the government’s attempts to access encrypted messaging platforms. Academics had also described the Home Office’s refusal to either confirm or deny the legal demand as unsustainable and unjustifiable.</p><p>Apple did not immediately provide a comment on the IPT’s judgment. A spokesperson for the British government stated, “We do not comment on legal proceedings. Nor do we comment on operational matters, including confirming or denying the existence of individual notices.”</p><p>However, the government spokesperson did challenge the characterization of the notice as a demand for a “backdoor” to iCloud accounts. They emphasized the legal safeguards surrounding the issuance of such notices, stating, “TCNs themselves do not directly provide access to data — relevant targeted warrants and authorisations must also be in place. Nor do TCNs extend powers to obtain access to data; their purpose is to ensure that those existing powers can continue to be exercised effectively.”</p><p>The spokesperson further argued for the necessity of such measures, stating that while technology companies should innovate and improve security, “unilateral moves which prevent investigations into terrorism or serious child abuse put public safety at grave risk.” They added that these powers are solely aimed at preventing serious crime and pursuing criminals, and do not infringe on free&nbsp;speech.</p><p>The government maintained its position that “we can, and must, have both” — protecting privacy while ensuring the ability to investigate serious crimes and terror&nbsp;threats.</p><p>The Investigatory Powers Tribunal announced that it would issue case management orders, including a timeline for the progression of the case, after both Apple and the British government have reviewed the terms of the private judgment and submitted their proposals to the&nbsp;court.</p><p>PIVX.

<p>Unlike many blockchain projects with a centralized team of founders and developers spearheading things, PIVX thrives on decentralized governance. In this governance model, control and decision-making powers are moved to the community of users rather than a centralized authority.</p><p>PIVX implements decentralized governance through a system that involves community proposals, discussions, and voting. This three-step process ensures that everyone is given a fair shot and say in the trajectory of the&nbsp;project.</p> Community Proposals <p>To ensure community-driven development, PIVX utilizes a proposal system that allows any member, and in principle even those outside, to suggest changes and improvements.</p><p>These proposals can address various aspects of the project, including product development, marketing, budget allocation, and community engagement.</p><p>To maintain the quality and integrity of proposals, a 50 PIV fee is required for submission. This fee is burned, serving as a spam deterrent and a deflationary mechanism.</p> Discussions <p>Beyond formal proposals and voting, open discussion forms a vital layer of PIVX governance. It’s crucial to recognize that not every idea needs to be formalized into a proposal. The discussion phase allows community members to freely explore concepts, provide feedback, and collaboratively refine ideas before they reach the proposal stage. It provides a platform for diverse perspectives and authors can use the feedback to strengthen their proposals, increasing their chances of success in the voting&nbsp;stage.</p><p>These discussions primarily take place across various community platforms, including Discord, the PIVX forum, and Telegram. These channels serve as open spaces for debate, collaboration, and the organic development of governance initiatives.</p> Voting <p>Masternode operators use their voting rights to express their support or opposition to proposals. The outcome of the vote determines whether a proposal is approved or rejected.</p><p>To secure funding from the PIVX treasury, a proposal requires a minimum of 10% net ‘yes’ votes. For example, if there are 1,500 active masternodes, a proposal would need at least 150 more ‘yes’ than ‘no’ votes to&nbsp;pass.</p> How are PIVX Proposals Funded? <p>PIVX’s treasury model differs from that of many cryptocurrencies. Instead of an always-available fund, the PIVX treasury is essentially reset monthly. At the end of each 30-day cycle, any unspent coins are burned, and a new budget of 432,000 PIV is allocated for community-driven initiatives. This monthly structure provides a defined window for authors to submit funding proposals.</p> How to Increase Your Chances of Getting Funding From&nbsp;PIVX <p>PIVX’s decentralized governance system offers a unique opportunity for community members to secure funding for projects that benefit the ecosystem. However, it’s important to understand that PIVX operates on a system of meritocracy. To successfully obtain funding, you must demonstrate that you’re willing to “pull your own weight” and bring tangible value. Here are a few points to note in this&nbsp;regard:</p>  Show You’re Invested: Active participation in the PIVX community through discussions, feedback, and contributions (even small ones) can build credibility and demonstrate your commitment.  Do Your Homework: Thoroughly research existing projects and identify gaps or areas where your proposal can make a significant impact. Avoid replicating existing efforts unless you can offer a substantial improvement.  Begin with Manageable Projects: Don’t immediately propose a massive, complex project. Starting with smaller, well-defined initiatives allows you to build a track record of successful execution.  Deliver on Promises: Completing smaller projects on time and within budget establishes trust and makes the community more likely to support your future endeavors.  Iterative Approach: Consider breaking down larger projects into smaller, fundable phases. This allows for community feedback at each stage and reduces the risk for the treasury.  Realistic Budget: Develop a realistic budget that justifies the requested funding. Be prepared to explain and defend your&nbsp;budget.  Community Benefit: Clearly articulate the benefits your project will bring to the PIVX community. How will it improve the ecosystem, attract new users, or enhance existing features?  Develop an MVP: If possible, create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to demonstrate the core functionality of your project. This provides tangible evidence of your capabilities and the project’s potential.  <p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

 PIVX Weekly Pulse (Mar 28th, 2025 — Apr. 3rd,&nbsp;2025) <p>Get your weekly PIVX fix! This summary covers everything from market trends and privacy updates to the latest community activities.</p> Top Stories   PIVX on the Edge: Exciting developments on the wallet front! PIVX is officially heading to Edge Wallet, likely becoming their most prominent privacy-focused asset. With the contract signed, the teams are now gearing up to collaborate on integration and marketing strategies.  Build on PIVX: NOWNodes, a PIVX node partner, is offering 4 months of premium access to their high-performance blockchain nodes and APIs through the newly launched PIVX Ecosystem Support Program. This initiative is designed to enable projects building on the PIVX blockchain to scale effectively with reliable infrastructure and round-the-clock support. Applications for the program are being accepted until May&nbsp;8th.   Market Pulse   Masternode Count: Masternode participation in the PIVX network is on the rise. There are currently 2,102 active masternodes, compared to 2,088 a week ago. The uptrend suggests that investors may be taking advantage of lower prices to purchase masternodes at a potential bargain.    Price Check: PIVX’s price performance this week saw the Daily USD Value fluctuate between $0.12 and $0.15 to yield a weekly average of $0.1358. Notably, this weekly average is lower than the previous week’s $0.165, indicating a continued decline. This trend aligns with the broader cryptocurrency market’s downward pressure, as reflected in the Fear and Greed Index’s current value of&nbsp;24.    Trading Buzz: The PIVX market experienced another week of reduced trading activity, as the weekly total volume fell to $12.98 million, compared to $13.73 million in the preceding week. This is a continuation of the multi-week pattern of declining trading&nbsp;volume.  <p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

<p>“I have never been congratulated so much for winning one game,” said a smiling Lee Sedol, at the packed press conference amid enthusiastic applause and camera flashes. The great 9-dan Go player had just defeated DeepMind’s AlphaGo in game four with an unexpected wedge move that his adversary critically underestimated. Two days later, AlphaGo would prevail, winning four of the tournament’s five games. It wasn’t Lee’s move 78 that captured the world’s imagination, but AlphaGo’s move 37 two games earlier. Move 37 was so unconventional that Lee and much of the audience thought it was a mistake before realizing how “beautiful” it was. It had a <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/03/two-moves-alphago-lee-sedol-redefined-future/">1-in-10,000</a> likelihood of being played by a human and was a landmark demonstration of AI’s ability to be superhumanly creative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the tense final minutes of game five, the AlphaGo team crammed into the VIP suite at the Seoul Four Seasons Hotel that had become its command center. The team lead, David Silver, was flanked on one side by DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis and on the other by Ioannis Antonoglou, the research engineer who accelerated the neural networks that made AlphaGo tick. The moment when Lee finally resigned marked the end of a two year journey that pushed the science of reinforcement learning (RL) to new heights, and the team reveled in the accomplishment.</p>



<p>For Ioannis, it was a vindication of what had seemed a risky career move, joining the AI startup in London in 2012 as employee #25 and researcher #6. “It was the only place in the world where people were seriously considering building AGI,” he recalls now, and he was amazed at what RL had achieved in such a short time. He wasn’t the only one who was amazed. In Chicago, a freshly minted PhD in quantum physics named Misha Laskin read the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16961">AlphaGo paper</a> and abruptly changed the course of his life. Here was something as beautiful as theoretical physics but with real world impact. Misha realized, “this was a real glimpse into what it will be like to live among superintelligence.”</p>



 AlphaGo and beyond 



<p>Ioannis’s first collaborator at DeepMind was Vlad Mnih, the researcher credited with building the first deep reinforcement learning agent, DQN (Deep Q Network). He asked Ioannis to write a clean implementation of DQN as a library that DeepMind could use to advance deep reinforcement learning research. “Ioannis’s attention to detail and intellectual rigour stood out right away,” says Vlad, “he would always ask why we were going with particular design choices, why we weren’t incorporating things like LSTMs sooner, etc.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>A year later, when David Silver started working on AlphaGo, DQN had demonstrated how to use deep reinforcement learning in game playing. AlphaGo built on this foundation with many sophisticated innovations including using Monte Carlo Tree Search, a powerful search algorithm that allowed it to explore possible future moves by simulating game outcomes. AlphaGo also featured a dual network architecture with a policy network to predict the next move and a value network to evaluate board positions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This was a monster of a system by contemporary standards and Silver knew that maximizing throughput and minimizing latency was mission critical to train the system and then deploy it for realtime game play. He tapped Ioannis to write kernels on GPUs that could speed up the neural networks they were training. DeepMind was acquired by Google in 2014 and Ioannis quickly moved on to implementing the system on Google’s first TPUs (tensor processing units). These first chips were extremely temperamental and hard to work with but Ioannis figured out how to tame them. “If I couldn’t get it to work,” Ioannis says now, “then we wouldn’t be able to achieve the things that we achieved with AlphaGo.”</p>



<p>After the triumphant victory in Seoul, Ioannis continued to work on expanding the capabilities of these game-playing agents with a small core team. “One of the first papers that we wrote was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270">AlphaGo Zero</a>,” he remembers. “We showed that you can actually get the same performance—actually much better performance than AlphaGo—starting from completely random behavior all the way to superintelligent behavior.” This tabla rasa approach combined with self-play was important to demonstrate that RL can scale to solve new problems.</p>



<p>Then the team built <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01815">AlphaZero</a>, which added superhuman-level play of chess and shoji starting from random play, with no domain knowledge except the game rules. The zero in this case also meant that the algorithm can learn to play any zero sum board game. Three years later they introduced <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08265">MuZero</a>, which added Atari games to its arsenal while no longer supplying game rules—just raw pixels. Using reinforcement learning on problems without access to a perfect simulator of the world, as you have in Go or chess, was a longstanding challenge that MuZero solved. “You can actually have a system that both learns the world dynamics,” says Ioannis, “and uses this learned model of the world to actually plan into the future.”</p>



 Transformers in Toronto 



<p>Although Misha was captivated by DeepMind’s research, it took him a while to find his way there. He caught the entrepreneurial bug and went through Y Combinator with an AI startup, but the frontier of AI research kept calling—he dove into a postdoc in Pieter Abbeel’s lab at Berkeley to hone his AI research chops. Like a good reinforcement learning agent, he maximized learning from this environment of other brilliant researchers. Entering as a former physicist had a side benefit: “Because I didn’t know anything, I had this kind of clean slate. And I think that enabled me to try some pretty simple things that other people thought were too obvious to try.” He adds that, “It was surprising to me how doing the simple thing correctly was hard. And oftentimes when people try something simple and it didn’t work, it’s because they didn’t try it hard enough.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the course of the next two-and-a-half years, Misha followed the interests he developed through self study, improving RL methods in the DeepMind Control Suite and Atari Games environments along with the OpenAI Gym. Specifically, he worked on <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2020/file/e615c82aba461681ade82da2da38004a-Paper.pdf">data augmentation</a> strategies and extracting high-level features from raw pixels (<a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/laskin20a/laskin20a.pdf">CURL</a>). The most cited paper he co-authored at Berkeley was <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2021/file/7f489f642a0ddb10272b5c31057f0663-Paper.pdf">Decision Transformer</a>, which reframed RL as a sequence modeling problem, leveraging the simplicity and scalability of the Transformer architecture.</p>



<p>In 2021, Misha interviewed with Vlad, who was starting a new general agents team for DeepMind in Toronto. “I was immediately struck by Misha’s enthusiasm and belief in the power of reinforcement learning and unsupervised approaches, so it was really exciting when he decided to join the team,” recalls Vlad. “Misha was very productive from the start. He got up to speed with Google infrastructure and started producing research results in a matter of weeks, the same amount of time it took him to find all the good coffee shops in Toronto.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vlad also appreciated the clean slate Misha brought with him from his academic research, “he liked to start on new problems with very simple approaches. It’s easy to overcomplicate things in research, but Misha seemed to have a knack for finding the simplest approach that will work on a problem.”</p>



<p>Vlad and Misha would go on to collaborate on a paper titled, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.14215">In-context reinforcement learning with algorithm distillation</a> after working together on a DeepMind hackathon project. “Misha and I decided to train a Transformer to mimic a reinforcement learning algorithm to see if it would exhibit self-improvement on tasks it wasn’t trained on,” says Vlad. “We had a lot of fun pair programming and getting the first prototype to work. This was an early example of in-context self-improvement, which has become a very active area of research in the LLM literature. We got really excited when we discovered that the Transformer learned a much more efficient RL algorithm than the one it was trained to mimic.”</p>



<p>Both Ioannis and Misha were pushing hard on how to make deep RL agents more capable and general through increased scale and algorithmic improvements. But on November 30, 2022, AI history took an abrupt turn. “Everything changed when ChatGPT came out,” Ioannis remembers. “I think that was a big moment for everyone in the industry to see that these systems are so powerful and they can be a starting point for something that’s even more intelligent.”</p>



 The Race to Gemini 



<p>ChatGPT’s success exposed that the value of deep reinforcement learning had been hiding in plain sight: Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) was a crucial part of its training, aligning the model’s outputs with human preferences and values. Like the Transformer itself, OpenAI didn’t invent deep RL, but was the first to deploy it at this scale.</p>



<p>ChatGPT’s ramp to 100 million users in two months sent shockwaves through the tech industry—but particularly at Google. Not only had OpenAI capitalized on the Transformer architecture, they had added an RL step in post-training to make a runaway consumer product. At the beginning of 2023, Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai called a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/20/technology/google-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence.html">code red</a>,” and enlisted the help of founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to help the company catch up to OpenAI. A few months later, the Google Brain team was merged with DeepMind to become Google DeepMind under the leadership of Demis Hassabis.</p>



<p>The code red brought the AlphaGo lineage of research to an end for Ioannis, who was tapped to lead the RLHF effort for Google’s new large language model (LLM) Gemini. Misha was looking to join the Gemini team as well and Ioannis asked him to lead on reward models. Over the next two years they worked together to launch Gemini 1 and 1.5. Misha was initially intimidated by Ioannis, but soon came to see his colleague in a new light. “What was interesting about the RLHF team that he led was that he was extremely people oriented and worked very hard on ensuring that the people were self-motivated. He would deeply understand what drove them and would figure out the direction to steer them to ensure that what they were doing was impactful for Gemini. I think that’s a superpower that he has as a leader.”</p>



<p>By December of 2023, Google had <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/#introducing-gemini">announced Gemini</a> and when v1.0 was released in February of 2024 it was comparable or better on most benchmarks to OpenAI’s GPT-4. This was a huge accomplishment but the team didn’t let up. A couple of months later it announced <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-next-generation-model-february-2024/#gemini-15">Gemini 1.5</a>, three months before OpenAI released its next major upgrade, GPT-4o. Gemini 1.5 improved compute efficiency through a Mixture of Experts architecture, added multimodal capabilities and a million token context window.</p>



<p>For Misha, the sudden prominence of LLMs was a revelation. “We were trying to solve the general agents problem, but we were looking at it completely the wrong way,” he says. “Because we thought that generality wasn’t solved.” For all their limitations and confabulations, LLMs are the most general systems ever invented. “They’re not very reliable,” Misha explains. “They can’t do any work for you autonomously. You can’t ask them to do something in the way that you would ask a coworker, but they’ll answer almost any question that you have.”</p>



<p>Combining that broad intelligence with the ability to take specific actions reliably was still an unsolved problem. “In AlphaGo, the reward is clear. You win the game or you lose. And in these systems where it’s clear, reinforcement learning works like magic,” says Misha. In most real life situations, however, the reward is quite fuzzy. How do you know if a complex task is complete? How do you know if a human would like a model’s response? This is where his work at DeepMind on open ended reward functions for general agents come in. “It just so happened that that building block that I was focused on outside of language models was one of the core building blocks for training them,” Misha explains.</p>



<p>Misha and Ioannis had achieved their goal of becoming, in Misha’s words, “the best craftsmen of training language models.” They understood these systems inside and out, and yet they didn’t feel the trajectory was moving fast enough towards their burning research question: how to build superintelligent systems capable of acting autonomously?</p>
 



Reflection co-founders Ioannis Antonoglou and Misha Laskin 



 
 Snapping the puzzle pieces together with Reflection 



<p>LLMs have succeeded at achieving a very wide range of capabilities, but their competence is shallow. They have, as Misha puts it, solved the breadth problem but not the depth problem. “It became very clear that these two streams of research are the two building blocks for building a superintelligence,” he says. “You get generality from the language models and you get capability from reinforcement learning.” And indeed, Ioannis adds, “all the necessary components to build a superintelligent agent that can have an impact in the real world are there.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>When they left DeepMind to form Reflection in March of 2024, their strategy was at odds with where most of the industry was heading. A year later, every major lab is working on reasoning models that augment LLMs with RL, but this wasn’t an obvious direction at the time. Similarly, they had decided to train their own models, a seemingly prohibitively expensive move for a small startup, but it’s clear now that you can radically improve the economics of model training through smart engineering.</p>



<p>“It’s one thing to have the algorithms,” says Ioannis, “but it’s equally important—or even more important—to build them in a way that’s scalable and uses the compute in the best way possible. And we’ve actually seen the power of engineering with DeepSeek, they’ve managed to get such good performance with such a small budget by doing the engineering really well.”</p>



<p>Scaling is crucial to the Reflection approach, but specifically it’s about scaling data and compute in post-training, which allows the agent to get better and better at specific tasks. As Ioannis learned when working on AlphaGo, you have to “really push hard on the systems,” to get superhuman results. But, he admits, “there is a bit of a leap of faith involved, now you have the scaling laws, but until you actually put the investment in and really see that they hold as you go up the orders of magnitude of compute, then you can never be sure, right?”</p>



<p>The scaling laws for pre-trained LLMs are beginning to asymptote, but with RL in post-training the curve is just beginning to climb. Unlike the training data for LLMs, which may be running out, the data for RL training is largely created by the RL agent itself in its interactions with its environment. “It gets some things right, it gets some things wrong,” Ioannis explains. “Things that it gets right it should just do more of and things that it gets wrong it should do less of. So this is like learning from its mistakes. And this really simple mechanism, if scaled correctly, gives rise to superintelligent behavior.”</p>



<p>Misha puts a finer point on this, “the fundamental thing about reinforcement learning—it is the most scalable form of AI. There’s basically no ceiling that we know of.”</p>



<p>The thing about LLMs is that not all tasks are equal for them. They are spikey just like humans, primarily because of differences in the quality and quantity of their training data. Misha explains that the model’s intelligence isn’t evenly distributed across all of human knowledge, but is “a kind of jagged intelligence.” He predicts that the first generally superintelligent systems will be good at some things and not at others.</p>



<p>It turns out that the thing LLMs are spikiest on is also the thing that they are currently used for the most in a work context: coding. “The areas where models are already starting to work well, they’re going to get amplified,” say Misha, “and that’s going to be the first place where we see superintelligent behavior.”</p>



 Superintelligence, the product 



<p>“A lot of AI teams think that the model is the product,” says Misha. “From talking to customers, the way we think about what we’re building, it’s really not a model, it’s a system. So it’s a model coupled to a product that solves real problems for our customer.”</p>



<p>The opportunity that the Reflection founders see is to create genuinely autonomous coding agents that can accurately complete end-to-end tasks that currently an engineer would do. “And if there’s one thing that customers care about above all else in autonomous coding,” Misha reports, “it’s reliability.”</p>



<p>Misha uses Waymo as an analogy for what this might look like in practice. “Part of the product,” he explains, “is the geofencing. It’s not just a car, it’s determining the boundary and its area of excellence.” Instead of claiming at the outset to be capable of any task—as most current coding agents do—the Reflection approach is to partition off the software equivalent of a large metro area and make strong guarantees for safety and reliability within that geography.</p>



<p>The bright side of this limitation is that it enables a more intuitive interface for users. “The most frictionless interface is like the one that you communicate with humans,” says Misha. “The example is you give it an engineering task, and it comes back to you with an implementation that is better than the one that you would have imagined. That’s what we think superintelligence looks like.”</p>



<p>The founders believe that solving autonomous coding is a “root-node” problem that will unlock more general superintelligence. “We think that autonomous coding is AGI complete. So if you show that you have a super intelligent software developer, then that’s all it takes, that’s an AGI,” says Ioannis. “Then it’s a matter of just taking the same algorithm and applying it to different verticals. But you have the recipe for how to get superintelligent systems. All the things that you need for intelligence are there in this particular problem.”</p>



 Why code, why now? 



<p>There are many kinds of intelligence, not just those required to write code. But code seems to be the most available surface area to push machine intelligence. “We think that the intelligence is going to evolve faster than the software,” predicts Misha. “The reason to work on software engineering today is because it’s the one category that is already ready for this. That entire category has been built for it to be machine friendly.”</p>



<p>Automating coding with autonomous agents will have a profound effect on software itself. “In software the form factor that we have as humans, the UIs we are used to using on a computer, are not necessarily the UIs that are going to be optimal for AIs,” says Misha. The GUI, the graphical user interface, evolved because humans have innate priors based on having eyes and hands. But for LLMs, their priors are the language on the internet. “But when it comes to interacting with a computer, the language that you interact with the computer with is code. So to a language model, code is as intuitive as three dimensional object manipulation is for humans,” continues Misha. “Code is ergonomic for language models.”</p>



<p>The implications of these changes will take time to unfold. In the process, companies that produce software will create AI-friendly UIs that enable human interactions with software products to be faster if not instantaneous. Misha foresees that “it might be that pieces of the GUI get eaten and under the hood it’s just a language model doing some work via code.” Instead of a ten click human workflow, the LLM might just write a single line of code that encapsulates the entire task.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Reflection team has a pragmatic definition of superintelligence as a thing that creates value by doing work on computers. “We think that a coding agent is actually going to be the way that a language model does work on any piece of software in the future,” says Misha. “So if you solve this problem, you’ve solved superintelligence on a computer for any piece of software that has an AI friendly interface.” Eventually, Sequoia partner Stephanie Zhan imagines that this will lead to “a future where we all become directors of superintelligent agents that conduct knowledge work on our behalf.”</p>



<p>Getting there will involve not just training models, but building the machine-friendly interfaces—from browsers and code editors to abstract representations of task categories—that literally set the stage for superintelligence. Autonomous agents will work best, the founders believe, when they have custom-designed environments (think DeepMind’s Atari environment or the OpenAI Gym) in which they can hone their particular craft. When it comes to code, the required environments and tools are fairly easy to imagine, but other cognitive categories may require greater leaps.</p>



<p>AI at its current stage is like the early steam engines before the discovery of thermodynamics: Lack of theory didn’t stop inventors from producing new engines. “I think deeply understanding why a model works from a theoretical sense will certainly be a very useful thing,” says Misha. “Whenever a thing has been deeply understood theoretically, at least in physics, it spurred a new era of empirical innovations because scientists knew where to search. But you don’t need to wait for that to build reliable systems today.”<br>Richard Feynman was an early hero of Misha’s, inspiring him to study physics. In his lecture on the conservation of energy, Feynman said, “It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowledge of what energy is.” The same is true of AI today, and the study of intelligence. During a Noble Prize <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkb4qEuxoJc">interview</a> in Stockholm, DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis summed up where we are in the quest for superintelligence: “I think the science of AI is about trying to explore and understand what intelligence is, and the best expression of understanding something is actually trying to build it.”</p>

<p>A recent case involving a former intern at the UK’s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) has once again confirmed the persistent threat of data leaks, even within organizations entrusted with the most sensitive information.</p><p>Hassan Arshad, the intern, pleaded guilty to smuggling top-secret data out of a protected computer. He transferred the information to his smartphone and then uploaded it to a hard drive connected to his personal computer.</p><p>The incident, which occurred in August 2022 and led to Arshad’s arrest a month later, compromised a “tool” used by GCHQ and revealed the names of agency employees. The British government classified the leaked data as “top secret,” indicating that its compromise could lead to loss of life or directly threaten national security.</p><p>This breach at GCHQ, an agency responsible for signals intelligence and cybersecurity, highlights a critical reality: even the most sophisticated security protocols are vulnerable to insider&nbsp;threats.</p><p>According to CISA, insider threats are risks originating from within an organization, often from employees who have authorized access to sensitive data. These threats can be malicious, as in Arshad’s case, or unintentional, stemming from negligence or human&nbsp;error.</p><p>The GCHQ incident exemplifies several key vulnerabilities:</p>  Insufficient Access Controls: The intern’s ability to access and transfer top-secret information suggests a potential failure in implementing the principle of least privilege, a fundamental data security best practice. Users should only have access to the data necessary for their specific&nbsp;role.  Device Security: The transfer of data to a personal smartphone and hard drive circumvents the secure environment intended for top-secret information. The use of personal devices without proper security measures significantly increases the risk of data breaches.  Insider Threat Mitigation: Despite GCHQ’s advanced security measures, the case demonstrates the difficulty in preventing determined individuals from exploiting their authorized access. Effective insider threat mitigation requires a multi-layered approach, including thorough background checks, continuous monitoring of user activity, and robust security awareness training for all personnel.  <p>PIVX.

<p>Today marks a bittersweet milestone for the Zcash Foundation as we bid farewell to Jack Gavigan (aka <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/u/dodger/summary">Dodger</a>), our Executive Director, who stepped down after four years of dedicated service. Jack’s tenure has been nothing short of transformative, and his leadership has left an indelible mark on the Zcash ecosystem.</p>



<p>Jack began his career working with startups during the dot-com boom of the late ‘90s. He subsequently spent over a decade working in financial technology with major institutions like Morgan Stanley, where he also spent a year as a trader.</p>



<p>Prior to his role at the Foundation, Jack served as COO and Head of Regulatory Relations at the <a href="https://electriccoin.co/">Electric Coin Company (ECC)</a>, where he helped launch Zcash and played a pivotal role in fostering its growth. His work at ECC included <a href="https://z.cash/jack-gavigan-on-jp-morgan-and-disintermediation/">collaborating with JP Morgan on integrating privacy-preserving technology into their Quorum blockchain platform</a>, showcasing his ability to bridge traditional finance and cutting-edge cryptographic solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jack also worked extensively with regulators and policymakers to educate them on cryptocurrencies and privacy-preserving technologies. His efforts were instrumental in helping Zcash gain regulatory acceptance, such as its <a href="https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-is-now-the-worlds-first-licensed-zcash-exchange">listing on Gemini Exchange after approval from the New York Department of Financial Services</a>. Furthermore, he contributed to shaping global cryptocurrency regulations through his participation in meetings with organizations like FATF, <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/the-fatf-recommendations/">advocating for balanced approaches that support innovation while addressing compliance concerns</a>.</p>



<p>Jack joined the Zcash Foundation in early 2021, bringing with him this wealth of experience in traditional finance coupled with a deep understanding of Zcash’s mission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the Zcash Foundation, Jack’s leadership drove several major milestones, most notably spearheading the development of <a href="https://zfnd.org/zebra/">Zebra</a>, which is a Rust-based implementation of the Zcash protocol. Zebra provides a robust alternative to zcashd and lays a solid foundation for future innovations in privacy-preserving technology. Under his guidance, the Foundation also supported initiatives like <a href="https://zfnd.org/frost/">FROST</a> (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures), which enhances cryptographic usability for wallets and signing groups.</p>



<p>Jack’s strategic vision extended beyond technical advancements. He championed community engagement through the annual <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcon/">Zcon</a> conferences, coordinated by the Zcash Foundation, and sought advisory input by running <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP)</a> polls, to ensure that community voices shaped critical decisions. His efforts led to the adoption of <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1015">ZIP 1015</a>, which decentralized ecosystem funding by transitioning grants administration to the Cayman Islands-based <a href="https://www.financialprivacyfoundation.org/">Financial Privacy Foundation (FPF)</a>.</p>



<p>On behalf of the Zcash Foundation and the broader ecosystem, we extend our heartfelt gratitude to Jack for his years of service. Thank you for your unwavering commitment to advancing financial privacy. Your legacy will inspire us as we continue building.</p>

<p>April 2, 2025 — Starting today, Brave users can conduct shielded Zcash transactions in the browser-native Brave Wallet with the updated desktop release (v1.77). This integration is part of the ongoing partnership with Zcash/ECC and Filecoin Foundation <a>announced at Mainnet 2023</a>, which now allows the privacy-preserving Zcash native currency (ZEC) to be bought, sent, and received directly within Brave Wallet.</p>
<p>Shielded transactions use zero-knowledge proofs to hide the sender, receiver, and amount of a transaction from the public blockchain. Adding shielded transactions with Zcash to Brave Wallet gives users a way to send and store crypto privately. The integration introduces Brave Wallet users to a privacy-preserving technology that they can access alongside existing supported networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.</p>
<p>Android and iOS availability are coming in the next several months.</p>

 Extending Brave Wallet privacy with Zcash 
<p>The Brave browser drastically improves privacy and security for anything people do online. With features like its core <a>Shields</a> ad-and-tracker blocker, a built-in <a>VPN</a>, and no-login AI chat agent <a>Leo</a>, the Brave browser can help everyone stay safer while they browse. Brave Search—available in Brave and any other browser—offers fast, accurate search results served from an independent index of the Web, all without profiling its users. The integrated Brave Wallet extends this focus to Web3 or the Internet of Value as a secure, multi-chain crypto wallet built natively in the browser.</p>
<p>Well known cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are public in nature, and there’s a cap on how private users can be with the recording of transactions in public ledgers. Zcash aims to solve this problem.</p>
<p>Zcash is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that forked and adapted an early version of the Bitcoin codebase. It offers both transparent transactions and shielded transactions, which use zero-knowledge proofs to ensure privacy. Transactions in Zcash can be controlled by either a transparent address (t-addr) or a shielded address (z-addr), allowing users to choose between public and private transactions.</p>
<p>By bringing Zcash and Brave Wallet together, Brave can now help users stay secure and anonymous while they browse, while they search and—now—when they transact.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to launch the integration of Zcash’s shielded transactions in our Brave Wallet, giving our users the ability to conduct privacy-preserving transactions directly from the browser,” said James Mudgett, VP of Web3 at Brave. “Brave’s privacy-by-default approach puts users in charge of their data, and enabling our users to buy, send, and store crypto privately with shielded Zcash is a natural extension of our privacy offering.”</p>
<p>“Financial privacy is fundamental to human freedom. With Brave’s commitment to privacy-first Web browsing and Zcash’s best-in-class shielded transactions, this integration marks a major step forward for user sovereignty,” said Josh Swihart, CEO of ECC. “By bringing Zcash (ZEC) into Brave Wallet, we are making it easier for people to access and use digital cash without compromising their privacy—an important win for financial autonomy and, ultimately, for humanity as a whole.”</p>

 Transacting with Zcash in Brave Wallet 
<p>To get started with shielded Zcash transactions, Brave Wallet users can simply click  in the Brave browser, and follow the steps below:</p>
 
 Click Send in the sidebar menu.

<p>Ethereum’s transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake created a unique set of conditions (i.e. lack of protocol-level delegation, 32 ETH requirement, long exit queues, etc.) that led to Lido’s liquid staking model to gain huge traction, significantly eclipsing other LSD providers on native PoS chains. stETH added on-demand liquidity, bypassing withdrawal windows, while also increasing DeFi utilization and increasing yields. Moreover, by allowing users to stake any amount of ETH in pools, it removed the requirement for 32 ETH increments, ultimately improving decentralisation through long tail distribution of individual stakers. Lido V3 introduces modular stVaults which enable staking customization. This allows professional actors, such as institutional stakers, to have granular control over validators, MEV and other parameters, diversifying their investment strategies.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Hasu’s background  Discovering Lido  Liquid staking and the early days of Lido  Why liquid staking gained traction on Ethereum  The evolution of Lido  Initial decentralisation concerns and the importance of dual governance  Restaking  Lido V3 and vaults  Institutional staking &amp; ETFs  Ethereum’s ‘crisis’ and its values  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/hasufl">Hasu on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/LidoFinance">Lido on X</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>The Panther Protocol Foundation is taking an important step toward achieving its mission of private DeFi with the launch of its Limited Mainnet Beta on Polygon. The mainnet beta is Panther’s bounded testing environment, running on the Polygon mainnet Network. It is designed to operate under real-world conditions and serves as a sandboxed blockchain environment where features are tested and validated before being deployed into production.</p><p>Eurobit, a licensed Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) will serve as the Zone Manager for the Beta’s Zone. Zone Managers are responsible for managing specific Zones—logically partitioned groups of assets and users—within the network, ensuring transactions comply with regulatory requirements. The beta test will operate with a single Zone.</p> Incentives for Participants <p>Panther has structured an attractive rewards program to encourage active participation in the beta:</p>  Total Rewards: A total of 4 million $ZKP tokens has been allocated for incentives the beta test, with an additional 1 million $ZKP being allocated to to subsidize network costs like gas fees, and bundler services  Transaction-Based Rewards: Rewards will be distributed in proportion to transaction and mining activity along with other incentives, encouraging participants to actively engage in testing the network. For further information refer to our <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/changelog/overview-1/canary?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">documentation</a>.   Testing Period and Withdrawals <p>The beta will operate for a limited period of 2–3 months, followed by a 1–2 week grace period for participants to withdraw their assets and rewards.</p> Cutting-Edge Privacy and Compliance Features <p>Participants will have the opportunity to test Panther’s privacy and compliance features, including:</p>  Compliance Provider: PureFi will manage KYC and KYT processes, including wallet screening, to maintain a secure and compliant environment.  Allowlisted Tokens: Participants will have access to up to 10 supported tokens on the Polygon network, including ZKP, POL, LINK, GRT, UNI, QUICK, and AAVE, enabling diverse and realistic testing scenarios.  Transaction Limits: To maintain a controlled testing environment and to reduce the chance of loss of funds, daily transaction caps are implemented, ensuring the beta operates as a secure and well-sandboxed space for experimentation.  Zone Manager: Eurobit will manage the Beta’s sole Zone, ensuring&nbsp; smooth operations and the integrity of all testing activities.   Testing zSwap and Community Mining <p>The beta test includes testing Panther’s zSwap feature, integrated with Uniswap V3 and QuickSwap on Polygon. Additionally, the test will leverage community-run miners, ensuring decentralization and fostering active engagement.</p> Join our Limited Mainnet Beta <p>To join our Limited Mainnet Beta, refer to our <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/mainnet-beta-canary?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Mainnet Beta documentation</a> and click on the IPFS link on the Entrypoint.

<p>While DeFi’s ultimate goal is to provide an alternative for TradFi, blockchain gaming caters to retail masses, onboarding millions of users to crypto through incentives and fun gameplay. The greatest success story in Web3 gaming thus far has been, without a doubt, Axie Infinity. Apart from creating an engaged community whose early adopters also experienced rags-to-riches stories, it kickstarted an entire movement around play-to-earn gaming. Many have tried copying it, yet most of them failed. Axie Infinity managed to design a sustainable economy that combined NFTs and fungible tokens. The result was the first gamified crypto mining event, at scale. In order to accommodate such a massive demand, in a time when L2 rollups were still in R&amp;D, Sky Mavis founded Ronin, a gaming-oriented Ethereum sidechain. The community that formed around Axie Infinity created a tremendous network effect, solidifying Ronin’s PMF as a gaming powerhouse. Before long, many up-and-coming titles migrated to Ronin, and the growth effects in all their key metrics (i.e. DAUs, transactions, revenue, etc.) further fuelled the flywheel.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Jeff’s background  Cryptokitties  Joining Axie Infinity and how it evolved  Monetizing Axie’s economy  The recipe for successful blockchain games  Building Ronin, the gaming L1  On-chain vs. off-chain game elements  Community building  Ronin’s economy &amp; composability  Most suitable gaming genre for Web3  AI x gaming  Crypto gaming investments  Ronin’s current state and future roadmap  Axie’s upcoming MMO  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/Jihoz_Axie">Jeff Zirlin on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/axieinfinity">Axie Infinity on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/ronin_network">Ronin on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/SkyMavisHQ">Sky Mavis on X</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

  Partnering with Mercury:
The Business Banking Platform of the Future  <p>Immad, Jason, Max and their team serve ambitious companies, with an ambitious goal of their own: to reimagine what banking can be.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/sonya-huang/">Sonya Huang</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/isaiah-boone/">Isaiah Boone</a>	 



Published March 26, 2025
  



Mercury co-founders Max Tagher, Jason Zhang and Immad Akhund.




 
<p>The bank account is the nucleus of business finance, where critical workflows begin and end. It is the first financial relationship a founder sets up, it is in the flow of funds, and it is the core “system of record” for a company’s money. Yet as personal banking has transitioned online, business banking has been left behind, especially for many startups and small businesses. There are tens of millions of these companies in the U.S. alone—consumer-like in scale, but with far more complex needs. The slow, often paper-based processes of incumbent banks simply can’t keep up.</p>



<p>Thankfully, <a href="https://mercury.com/">Mercury</a> is a breath of fresh air: a simple, even joyful, product that integrates seamlessly into all of a company’s financial processes and brings the best of modern banking services to ambitious founders and business owners. Startup natives themselves, co-founders Immad Akhund, Jason Zhang and Max Tagher saw firsthand how difficult it was for Silicon Valley companies to access institutional banking services, so they launched Mercury in 2019 with the goal to make it easier.</p>



<p>Six years later, Immad, Jason and Max have built the product they would’ve wanted back then. Happy customers tell us they’ve been delighted to open an account in less time than it would have taken to get just one email returned from a traditional bank, and they say Mercury has become a trusted partner as they build and scale their businesses. That trust has empowered the team to expand into other financial services as they continue to reimagine banking.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Mercury is also moving from Silicon Valley to Main Street, as the types of customers the platform serves expand in kind—both with the launch of the <a href="https://mercury.com/personal-banking">Mercury Personal</a> waitlist, and as the company’s reputation for quality spreads across industries. Last year alone, Mercury handled more than $150 billion worth of transactions; today, it serves more than 200,000 businesses.</p>



<p>We at Sequoia are proud to lead Mercury’s Series C and join their board as the team sets its sights even higher: on a comprehensive suite of commercial and personal banking services. Mercury’s vision for the future has already clearly resonated with its customers, and we believe the innovative spirit and operational excellence that brought them to this moment can drive their growth for years and decades to come.</p>



<p>Mercury is a financial technology company, not a bank. Business banking services provided through Choice Financial Group, Column N.A., and Evolve Bank &amp; Trust; Members FDIC. Personal banking services provided through Choice Financial Group; Member FDIC.</p>

<p>Brave presents the Rewards 3.0 Partner Program, expanding BAT utility while giving Web3 brands premium visibility. Launch partners include Bandit’s Badchain, CHOMP, Decentraland, GuanoCoin, Karate Combat, Pudgy Pop, and SOL Incinerator.</p>
<p>Brave Rewards 3.0 is the next evolution of Brave’s unique in-browser rewards program, allowing users to support content creators and earn <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">Basic Attention Tokens</a> (BAT) for viewing privacy-respecting ads. Rolling out in phases over 2025, Rewards 3.0 introduces a new Offer Wall experience, more earning opportunities, self-custody payout options, and exclusive benefits from partners for <a>Brave Rewards</a> users and BAT holders.</p>
<p>Learn more about Brave Rewards 3.0 in <a>BAT Roadmap 3.0: The On-chain Era</a>.</p>
<p>The Brave Rewards 3.0 Partner Program will be a key part of the Rewards 3.0 rollout, ensuring users can continue earning BAT with their attention while unlocking even more ways to earn, spend, and interact with BAT in the broader Web3 ecosystem.</p>
<p>The program offers unique opportunities that only Brave—and its 82 million monthly active users—can provide. Partners will gain high visibility exposure to new audiences, along with valuable insights into messaging and incentives that resonate most with loyal Rewards users. By integrating BAT utility into their platforms and activations, participating partners will drive engagement and adoption across e-commerce, gaming, digital content, DeFi, and beyond.</p>
<p>For Brave Rewards users, this means direct access to real-world benefits like discounts, premium goods or services, and Web3 experiences—all directly through the browser.</p>

<p>Karate Combat-sponsored Brave New Tab Takeover</p>
<p>Partners gain visibility across and beyond Brave’s ecosystem:</p>

 Brave Ads exposure through the New Tab Takeover (NTT), Notification, and Newsfeed ad units, all part of the privacy-preserving Brave Ads platform 
 Program promotions through updates, social promotions, and community activations 
 

 The Partner Program will grow BAT and Brave 
<p>The Brave Rewards 3.0 Partner Program enhances BAT’s utility while advancing Brave’s mission to build a privacy-first Web that empowers users. Partners contribute to BAT’s ecosystem by paying for the program in BAT, and integrating new secondary BAT utilities, which will ultimately drive adoption across Web3.</p>
<p>Brave Rewards and BAT were first made available to users in 2017. Rewards 3.0 builds on that foundation by bringing added value to Web3 within Brave’s expanding user base and in the broader multichain attention economy.</p>
<p>Rewards 3.0 also leverages BAT’s growing adoption:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Over 99% of the 1.5B total BAT supply is already in circulation 
 BAT ranks as the 14th most distributed token by on-chain holders on Ethereum 
 1.5M+ verified creators accept BAT contributions 
 600+ advertiser campaigns have leveraged Brave Ads, cementing BAT’s role in a thriving, user-first ad economy 
 
<blockquote>
<p>“In a space that’s become tired with hype cycle after hype cycle and fly-by-night engagement farming, we’re aiming to do something different with the Brave Rewards 3.0 Partner Program. We’ve created a program for product teams that provides a mix of exposure, duration, and addressable lead users needed to experiment and find early market fit in Brave. We welcome partners to the program that want to grow with the Brave Rewards ecosystem, and that share our interest in bringing useful products, value, and Web3 adoption to millions of new users.”</p>
<p>— Luke Mulks, VP Business Operations at Brave</p>
</blockquote>

 The first Brave Rewards 3.0 Partner Program members 
<p>Over the next six months, a new group of partners will be announced and added to the program each month. Partners in the program will be adding and updating offers throughout the duration of the program. To kick off the program, Brave welcomes our first group of partners:</p>

 Bandit’s Badchain 
<p><a href="https://earn.badchain.org/">Bandit’s Badchain</a> is a satirical blockchain by Bandit Network, designed to poke fun at the hype-driven world of Web3. Embracing the hilariously terrible, it turns epic fails into an art form—because sometimes, being bad is the whole point.</p>
<p><a href="https://bandit.network/">Bandit Network</a> is a leader in white-labeled quest solutions that drive engagement through interactive experiences. In addition to powering quests for Rewards users, Bandit will be featuring Brave as a B2B channel partner to grow the Rewards Partner Program.</p>

 CHOMP 
<p><a href="https://app.chomp.games/application">CHOMP</a> is a subjective oracle wrapped in a gamified quiz experience. It harnesses crowd wisdom to determine the best answer, using research-backed algorithms that analyze user responses. Players share opinions, predict how others will answer, and earn rewards.</p>
<p>As part of the program, CHOMP will feature a weekly BAT or Brave-themed deck, exploring core values like privacy, attention, and community. Brave Rewards users can put their instincts to the test, ‘CHOMP the deck,’ and compete for BAT rewards.</p>

 Decentraland 
<p><a href="https://decentraland.org/">Decentraland</a> is a social virtual world. From community-built landscapes to immersive events, Decentraland offers a vibrant open-source playground where anyone can dive into a world of endless creativity, exploration, and connection.</p>
<p>Decentraland will collaborate with the BAT Community on activations and engagements within Decentraland, exclusive rewards, and bringing both communities together through joint community calls and X Spaces.&nbsp;</p>

 GuanoCoin 
<p>Created by a group of dedicated fans and developers from the BAT Community, <a href="https://www.guanocoin.com/">GuanoCoin</a> ($GUANO) is a memecoin designed to help grow BAT’s ecosystem on Solana. The team recently launched the GuanoCoin Cave, where BAT holders can lock their BAT to earn GUANO over time—now holding over 160,000 BAT. Through the program, GuanoCoin will offer incentives and quests to help Rewards users maximize their on-chain rewards.</p>

 Karate Combat 
<p><a href="https://karate.com/">Karate Combat</a> is the world’s premier full-contact striking league, blending live-action martial arts with immersive CGI environments powered by the Unreal Engine. Broadcast in over 100 countries, it delivers high-energy combat sports with a futuristic edge.</p>
<p>Karate Combat’s involvement builds on an ongoing media partnership with Brave, with plans to use the program to experiment with activations involving BAT and Karate token utility, and new ways to bring both communities together.</p>

 Pudgy Pop 
<p><a href="https://www.pudgypop.com/">Pudgy Pop</a> is a tile-matching game set in the adorable Pudgy Penguins universe. With strategic challenges, charming characters, and a community-driven spirit, it offers a fresh twist on a classic puzzle experience.</p>

Designed to keep portfolios clean, it turns burning junk into a rewarding experience.</p>
<p>The program provides a great opportunity for Brave Rewards users to learn and utilize SOL Incinerator to burn unwanted tokens for BAT for added value.</p>

  Wiz and Google: Securing the Cloud  <p>Congratulations to Assaf and the team.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/doug-leone/">Doug Leone</a>	 



Published March 18, 2025
  



 
<p>Before we partnered with Wiz in February 2020, our history with Assaf Rappaport and his co-founders Yinon Costica, Roy Reznik and Ami Luttwak already went back almost a decade.</p>



<p>We learned in 2013 that a team of alumni from Israel’s elite 8200 cybersecurity unit were starting a company together. We look for outliers at Sequoia—a founder coming out of 8200 was noteworthy, but a whole team was very special. They weren’t looking for financing. But after our Tel Aviv-based partner Gili Raanan secured a meeting, we convinced them to partner with Sequoia and we led the first financing for Adallom. (I later learned that Assaf thought I was Don Valentine when we first met, which may be why he agreed to the meeting.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>After selling Adallom to Microsoft and leading Microsoft’s Cloud Security Group for five years, the co-founders left to once again start something new. We were thrilled to hear they wanted Sequoia and Gili (who by then had his own firm, Cyberstarts) to be their first partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They didn’t know exactly what the something new would be, but they now had a proven track record and the ambition to build an enduring company. Before they even had a product, we led their initial financing round alongside Cyberstarts in early 2020 and I joined the board.</p>



<p>The team quickly hit on the insight that cloud security needed a simpler, agentless architecture for an increasingly complex digital world. Once the vision for Wiz became clear, they <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/wiz-spotlight-with-a-little-help-from-their-friends/">accelerated like no company I’ve ever seen</a>: My partner Bogomil Balkansky, who also works with Wiz, says that in the early days the team strategically leveraged their Israeli time zone, working 9-5 on the product and then working late into the night on sales calls to the U.S. and Europe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we helped recruit team members, we were consistently impressed with the caliber of talent joining Wiz and their ability to move quickly. Wiz set a record, reaching $100 million in annual recurring revenue in just 18 months, faster than any software company in history, and quickly became a leader in cloud security.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/wiz-joining-google">Today’s milestone</a> marks the start of an exciting new chapter. Wiz and Google Cloud share a vision to improve security by making it easier and faster for organizations of all types and sizes to protect themselves, end-to-end, across all major clouds. This will help spur the adoption of multicloud cybersecurity.</p>



<p>The future is bright for Wiz inside of Google Cloud. Just as we believed Google would change the world when we first partnered with the company in 1999, we believe Wiz is transforming cloud security.</p>



<p>At Sequoia, we partner with founders who want to make a dent in the universe. We couldn’t be prouder of Assaf and the team in reaching this milestone. It’s been an honor to be your partner for over a decade. Thank you for letting us be a part of your journey.</p>

  Partnering with Kela: Modern Defense for Israel and Western Allies  <p>Four veterans of elite intelligence units, including the former General Manager of Palantir Israel, are building an innovative new defense prime, starting with border protection. Their vision is to leverage Israel’s unique cadre of “technowarriors” to help defend the Western world order.</p>

Team Kela and Team Sequoia, together in Tel Aviv.



 
<p>Israel is unusual in the West: It still has a draft. At the end of high school, instead of applying to colleges, students make bids to join elite units in the military. From the paratroopers to the combat divisions to the elite intelligence group Unit 8200, competition to get the best assignments is fierce.</p>



<p>Israel’s startup ecosystem has thrived by leveraging this talent to build tremendous businesses: post-draft, the country’s “technowarriors” staff many of its most successful tech companies. Veterans of 8200 and other units founded Sequoia portfolio companies Wiz, Island, Cyera, Eon and Decart, among others—and today, about <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2022-01-18/ty-article/half-of-global-cybersecurity-investment-has-been-in-israel-pm-bennett-says/0000017f-e3f8-d38f-a57f-e7fa23050000">half</a> of global cybersecurity investment goes into Israeli companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.kelasys.com/">Kela’s</a> mission is to redeploy this technowarrior talent back into the defense sector. The vision is two-fold: in the short term, to upgrade Israel’s internal defense capabilities. The company’s initial focus is border protection, an urgent priority post-October 7th. In the long term, the ambition is to convert Israel into a defense tech hub for Western militaries—a source of strategic advantage for NATO and the U.S. as they seek to deter their adversaries.</p>



<p>As conflicts become more tech-native—we have seen previews of this in Ukraine—the Israeli skillset is becoming increasingly important for the Pentagon and for NATO countries. Cyberwarfare, AI, autonomous systems, jamming and counter-jamming techniques, and GPS-denied navigation are just a few of the ways modern defense is becoming technologically sophisticated. Historically, a nation’s industrial might determined its military power. If technology begins to play a co-equal role, then Israel should evolve an even more critical role in defending the Western alliance: as a major exporter of advanced defense technology.</p>



<p>Kela’s founders share a deep expertise in military intelligence. Alon Dror graduated from Israel’s highly selective <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talpiot_program">Talpiot program</a>, which accepts only 25 to 60 cadets per year. After Talpiot, he served as a Tank Platoon Commander and in MAFAT, Israel’s R&amp;D directorate, where he won the Israel Defense Prize. Hamutal Meridor served in Unit 8200 before entering the private sector, where she was General Manager for Palantir’s Israel business. Alon and Hamutal share highly complementary skillsets: Alon is a mission-oriented R&amp;D leader and Hamutal is a business-oriented strategist. Both see Kela as their life’s work.</p>



<p>We at Sequoia had independently formed a thesis around Israeli defense tech, and were primed on this idea when we re-connected with Alon and Hamutal, both of whom we had pre-existing relationships with, during a trip to Israel in April 2024. We were so invigorated by the team’s plans that we extended a breakfast meeting into a full-day conversation. We also traveled to Jerusalem to meet Jason Manne, the company’s third co-founder and an algorithms team leader (Major) in an elite combat-focused R&amp;D unit. Jason was accurately described to us as “the guy you come to when you need something built in two days that usually takes two months.” We were privileged to lead Kela’s $10M seed round shortly thereafter.</p>



<p>The final dominos fell into place over the summer: Omer Bar-Ilan, a technical genius known for his work on Israel’s Iron Dome, joined as Kela’s fourth co-founder. We also partnered with Lux Capital’s Brandon Reeves and Josh Wolfe, who led the company’s Series A and brought on a fantastic angel coalition. The former deputy commander of Unit 8200 was an early advisor to Kela, and numerous retired generals helped to hone the vision and value proposition.</p>



<p>Since its founding, the Kela team has been relentlessly focused on product R&amp;D. Kela’s product is an open architecture platform to integrate sensor data for defense. The company aims to leverage existing commercially available and military-grade technology. It does this by 1) militarizing existing commercial technology (e.g., drones), 2) integrating disparate military technology systems (e.g., specialized sensors), 3) delivering these capabilities to personnel through a single, easy-to-use command center interface and 4) embedding advanced intelligence and AI.</p>



<p>Seven months into building, Kela’s product is now live in the field with multiple active projects. The team’s speed has been a critical differentiator, allowing Kela to achieve in days what legacy companies might require weeks, months, or even years to accomplish. This has earned it early plaudits from both generals and soldiers, who value Kela’s deep understanding of their mission, the company’s technological rigor, and the team’s quick, seamless execution.</p>



<p>With strong demand in Israel and early market pull from American and NATO customers, Kela is now scaling up. The company has recruited 20 elite individuals, each of whom is standalone brilliant, and who collectively have become a force to be reckoned with. We are excited to announce our new venture to the world. Calling on all technowarriors—come <a href="https://kelasys.com/#positions">join</a> us!</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol-establishes-swiss-foundation/">The newly established Panther Protocol Foundation, based in Switzerland</a>, will launch a Limited Mainnet Beta before the end of the month on Polygon Network. Closely resembling Panther’s intended mainnet setup, the beta test will operate as a fully self-contained environment using real assets. The beta will serve as a final phase of testing, ensuring functionality and collecting valuable feedback leading up to Panther’s full mainnet launch. This will be the foundation’s first action taken as owner of the Panther codebase.&nbsp;</p> Why a Limited Mainnet Beta? <p>Panther’s beta will be a controlled, self-contained production environment in which features are tested with a limited group of users before full deployment. Unlike traditional testnets, the beta test will use real assets. This will allow the Foundation to fine-tune functionality using actual user interactions and real-world conditions, creating a seamless experience when Panther’s full mainnet launches.</p> Zone Manager <p>Panther Protocol’s Shielded Pool will be divided into Zones, each managed by a <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/ecosystem/ecosystem-operators/zone-manager?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Zone Manager</a>, a licensed operator who will oversee user access and compliance. For the beta test, Eurobit, a Spanish crypto exchange and licensed Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP), will be the Zone Manager. Separately, the Panther Protocol Foundation had previously <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/12/09/2993959/0/en/Panther-Protocol-and-Eurobit-Partner-to-Pioneer-Compliant-and-Confidential-DeFi.html?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">announced</a> that it would work with Eurobit to support its application to become a Zone Manager for Panther’s mainnet.</p> Preparations underway <p>The <a href="https://github.com/pantherfoundation/trusted-setup-ceremony?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">trusted setup ceremony</a> required for the Limited Mainnet Beta has been successfully completed. The process involved having members from the tech team, Panther Foundation, Purefi (compliance partner), Eurobit and the Panther community contributing sequentially, each adding cryptographic randomness to generate the final parameters securely. This ensures the integrity and security of Panther Protocol's Zero-Knowledge circuits ahead of the beta.</p> What’s Next? <p>In the coming days, Panther will release more details about the exact timing of the Beta network, including how users can participate, potential rewards, the sign-up process, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Stay informed by following Panther on<a href="https://twitter.com/PantherProtocol?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> </a><a href="http://x.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">X</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/invite/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord </a>and <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a>. </p>
