  AI Ascent 2025  <p>Sequoia convened builders and researchers in AI for another packed day of conversations, talks and demos.</p>   
	By Team Sequoia	 



Published May 8, 2025
  



 
<p>On May 2, we hosted our third AI Ascent event in San Francisco, bringing together more than 100 leading founders and researchers in AI to engage with what partner Pat Grady calls, the “tremendous sucking sound in the market” for AI, and his advice to “go at maximum velocity, all of the time.” Partner Sonya Huang talked about the improved retention rate of generative AI applications and pronounced that coding had reached “screaming product-market fit.” And partner Konstantine Buhler looked ahead to how the agent economy will transform how we work, and laid out the technologies we need to get there.</p>



<p>Over the course of the day we talked with AI leaders including Sam Altman of OpenAI, Jensen Huang and Jim Fan of Nvidia, Jeff Dean of Google, Mike Krieger of Anthropic, Bret Taylor of Sierra and many more. The talks ranged from new business models for AI agents, the race to build data centers, the power of vertical applications and the importance of open source.</p>



<p>Below is a selection of videos from the event (some sessions were off the record).</p>

<p>The PIVX story began in 2016, and since then, it’s been a tale of continuous evolution. From a fundamental shift in its consensus mechanism to ongoing improvements in its privacy technology, PIVX has continued to build. But what does the future hold for this leading privacy&nbsp;coin?</p><p>Let’s dive&nbsp;in…</p> PIVX’s Core&nbsp;Tenets <p>Before peering into the future, it’s essential to understand the foundational principles that guide PIVX’s long-term vision. Top on the list is the project’s commitment to privacy. Many proponents of the project would agree that privacy is not merely a feature for PIVX; it is a fundamental right and a core tenet. The long-term vision centres around continuously enhancing and innovating privacy-preserving technologies to empower users with control over their financial data.</p><p>Another foundational principle is decentralization and community governance. PIVX has always championed decentralization, not just in its network architecture but also in its governance. The Masternode network plays a crucial role in decision-making and funding proposals, ensuring the community actively shapes the project’s future.</p><p>As a digital currency intended for real-world use, security and network stability are paramount. PIVX’s ongoing development roadmap prioritizes maintaining a robust and resilient network that users can trust for their transactions and holdings. And while privacy and security are critical, PIVX recognizes the importance of user-friendliness. One of its goals is to make privacy accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical expertise, through intuitive interfaces and seamless integrations.</p> The BHAG <p>There have been <a href="https://forum.pivx.org/threads/its-time-pivians-lets-define-our-bhag-big-hairy-audacious-goal.2737/">discussions</a> around defining a Big Hairy Audacious Goal (BHAG) for PIVX since the beginning of 2025. Weeks of vibrant deliberation across social platforms culminated in a compellingly ambitious BHAG: “Developing circular economies powered by PIVX.” To a great deal, the new mission aligns with the mission of PIVX Labs, which is to “Build a parallel economy, reachable anywhere in the&nbsp;world.”</p><p>This points to the possibility of prioritizing efforts that champion a PIVX-powered economy. While this is ambiguous in both interpretation and implementation, I expect to see more exchange listings and integrations with local businesses.</p> Ambassador Program <p>Speaking of local businesses, one key item on the roadmap is the Ambassador Program, which is still being refined to ensure its effectiveness and sustainability. The initiative is envisioned as a crucial catalyst for grassroots adoption.</p><p>By empowering passionate community members to become local evangelists and facilitators, the Ambassador Program aims to foster organic growth and real-world use cases for PIVX at a foundational level. This boots-on-the-ground approach will be instrumental in building local circular economies where PIVX can truly&nbsp;thrive.</p> PIVX Labs <p>Labs in the powerhouse behind a handful of PIVX products, including PIVX Rewards, PIVCards, and the MyPIVXWallet (MPW). As an integral part of the project, its current roadmap is hinged on four pillars — wallet (banking), cards (spending), rewards (earning), and messaging (communication).</p><p>The first pillar focuses on developing a comprehensive wallet, extending its functionality beyond basic transactions to encompass a range of banking-like features, aiming to be a central hub for users’ financial activities.</p><p>Complementing this is the second pillar: cards for spending, which seeks to integrate user-friendly card solutions, making it seamless for individuals to utilize their PIVX for everyday purchases.</p><p>The third pillar centers on rewards for earning, envisioning the creation of various mechanisms and platforms that empower users to accumulate PIVX through active participation and contributions within the ecosystem.</p><p>Finally, the fourth pillar emphasizes messaging for secure communication, aiming to integrate private and protected communication capabilities directly within the PIVX environment.</p><p>PIVX.

Plus, why ICPs matter even more in the AI era, and how a well-executed ICP shows up across the business when it's working.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Resources:&nbsp;</p><p>Read more on sales and go-to-market on our <a href="https://a16z.com/category/growth/sales-and-go-to-market/">Growth Content Compendium</a></p><p>Find Joe on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/morrisseyjoe/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/morrisseyjoe/</a></p><p>Find Mark on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mregan178/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/mregan178/</a></p><p>Find Michael on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-king-62258/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-king-62258/</a></p><p>Find Emma on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmajanaskie/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmajanaskie/</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stay Updated:&nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you think: <a href="https://ratethispodcast.com/a16z">https://ratethispodcast.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find a16z on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16z">https://twitter.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find a16z on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Subscribe on your favorite podcast app: <a href="https://a16z.simplecast.com/">https://a16z.simplecast.com/</a></p><p>Follow our host: <a href="https://twitter.com/stephsmithio">https://twitter.com/stephsmithio</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund. a16z and its affiliates may maintain investments in the companies discussed.

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v2.3.0">Zebra 2.3.0</a>.</p>



<p>This release includes a number of improvements to regtest mode, by adding methods to reconsider and invalidate blocks, as well as fixing a bug that was preventing some transparent transactions from being served by Zebra in regtest mode. Additionally, this release restores Zebra’s ability to mine blocks on testnet and regtest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have also made several improvements to the set of RPC methods supported by Zebra to cover the required validator node use cases once zcashd is deprecated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, the release includes the following breaking changes:&nbsp;</p>



 
 The RPC endpoint is no longer enabled by default in Docker. Users who require it must follow <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/docker.html#rpc">these instructions</a>. 



 We no longer publish Docker images tagged with the <code>sha-</code> or <code>v</code> prefixes. 



 The <code>getblocktemplate-rpcs</code> Cargo feature has been removed, and the functionality behind that flag is now available by default. 
 



<p></p>



<p>You can see a full copy of the included changes in the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v2.3.0">v2.3.0 Release Notes</a> on GitHub.</p>

  Partnering with FastAPI Labs: Simplified App Deployment   <p>Sebastián is removing roadblocks for app developers—and transforming the software development process. </p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bogomil-balkansky/">Bogomil Balkansky</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/lauren-reeder/">Lauren Reeder</a>	 



Published May 5, 2025
  



FASTAPI LABS FOUNDER SEBASTIÁN RAMÍREZ.



 
<p>We at Sequoia knew Sebastián Ramírez well long before we became the lead investor in his company, <a href="https://fastapilabs.com/">FastAPI Labs</a>. In 2023 he was the inaugural recipient of our <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/open-source-fellowship-applications/">Open Source Fellowship</a>.</p>



<p>We started the fellowship because we recognized that open source is the lifeblood of software, and that open source contributors around the world make commercial software better and more reliable. We wanted our first fellowship recipient to be someone who already had a huge impact on the open source ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sebastián perfectly fit that bill! He is the creator of <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a>, the wildly popular open-source Python framework used everywhere from Fortune Global 500 corporations such as BMW, American Express and Roche, to academia, to nonprofits such as NASA’s Space Telescope Science Institute and the Red Cross. At the start of the fellowship, Sebastián was overflowing with ideas to improve on what he’d built—and we are proud to have supported his work in the years since.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting a company came up several times in our many conversations with him. In a sense, Sebastián has been an entrepreneur his entire life, <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/sebastian-ramirez-spotlight/">having taken the road less traveled many times before</a>. And he has plenty of the grit and perseverance a founder needs. Building a new business today may be a fad for many engineering and business graduates, but Sebastián was intentional about what his company would do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FastAPI the open-source framework was born from Sebastián’s vision for solving a complicated problem—building an API in Python. FastAPI Labs the company was born from his frustration with how difficult it is to deploy an app. It turns out that the software development lifecycle is an exercise of moving the cheese: you remove one bottleneck, only to discover the next. And Sebastián has never been someone to shy away from removing bottlenecks or solving gnarly problems. That’s why he and his team are building <a href="https://fastapicloud.com/">FastAPI Cloud</a>: a service that enables developers to seamlessly deploy apps to the cloud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given our long relationship with and belief in Sebastián, it’s only natural that we’re leading the seed round in FastAPI Labs, and we are excited to continue to support him and his team.</p>

<p>The European Parliament has given its nod to a ban on anonymous cryptocurrencies within the EU, setting a target implementation date of 2027. The new Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR), supposedly driven by the imperative to clamp down on money laundering and the financing of terrorism, will likely clamp down on privacy coins such as Monero, ZCash, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>The new <a href="https://x.com/EuCInitiative/status/1915012789602836794">regulations</a>, part of a wider legislative push against illicit financial activities, will effectively prohibit the issuance and trading of cryptocurrencies that do not permit the identification of their users. Specifically, credit institutions, financial institutions, and crypto asset service providers (CASPs) will face a prohibition on maintaining anonymous accounts and handling cryptocurrencies that enhance&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Proponents of the ban argue that the inherent anonymity of these tokens presents a considerable threat to financial security, rendering them attractive instruments for illicit actors. By outlawing their availability within the EU, lawmakers intend to cultivate a more regulated and traceable environment for digital assets, aligning them more closely with established financial systems concerning anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) protocols.</p><p>However, this move has ignited significant controversy within the cryptocurrency community. Critics voice concerns that the ban encroaches upon the fundamental principles of privacy and decentralization that underpin many cryptocurrencies. They argue that anonymous tokens serve legitimate purposes, providing financial privacy for individuals in various contexts, and that a sweeping prohibition could stifle technological advancement and push users towards less regulated ecosystems outside the EU’s jurisdiction.</p><p>Furthermore, questions have been raised regarding the practicalities of enforcing such a ban and its potential ramifications for the broader crypto market. Implementing a complete prohibition on anonymous tokens could prove technically complex, given the decentralized and borderless nature of many cryptocurrencies. There are also uncertainties about how exchanges and other crypto service providers operating within the EU will effectively identify and delist such tokens by the 2027 deadline.</p><p>But according to Vyara Savova, senior policy lead at the European Crypto Initiative (EUCI), “the regulations (the AMLR, AMLD, and AMLAR) are final, and what remains is the ‘fine print’ — aka the interpretation of some of the requirements through the so-called implementing and delegated acts.”</p><p>This decision by the European Parliament underscores a growing global trend of heightened regulatory scrutiny over the cryptocurrency market. While jurisdictions worldwide grapple with the optimal approach to managing the risks and opportunities associated with digital assets, the EU’s decision to ban anonymous tokens signals a clear inclination toward prioritizing traceability.</p><p>PIVX.

<p>This is the 34th post in an <a>ongoing series</a> describing new privacy features in Brave. This post describes work done by Vadym Struts (Senior Software Engineer) and Kleant Zogu (Mobile Product Designer) and was written by Shivan Kaul Sahib (VP, Privacy and Security).</p>
<p>Brave for Android 1.78 introduces a new Shields option called Block Elements, which lets you tap any on-page annoyance and hide it.</p>



    


    



<p>Most websites are crowded with visual clutter, largely due to third-party advertising. This problem is even worse on mobile devices, where limited screen real estate makes every banner feel even more intrusive, especially on news or recipe websites. Brave already protects you from many of these annoyances by automatically stripping away third-party ads and trackers, cookie consent notices (<a>read more</a> about how we’re automatically detecting cookie consent notices) and those “Open in app” prompts. This ensures a safe and pleasant browsing experience the moment you download Brave.</p>
<p>Now, Brave for Android takes this annoyance blocking a step further by allowing you to manually hide any remaining page clutter. This could be a sidebar of “Trending” clickbait, a promo banner you can’t close, or anything else that gets in the way of focusing on the content you care about.</p>
<p>The Block Elements feature already exists on desktop, but we’ve revamped the experience there to improve its usability and better align with Android.</p>

 How to block elements 

 Android 
<p>To block unwanted page elements on Brave Android:</p>
 
 Tap the Shields icon in the address bar. 
 Tap Advanced controls. 
 Tap Block element. 
 Tap the page element you want to block. 
 Press the Block Elements button. 
 
<p>The unwanted page element will now be hidden.</p>
<p>


    


    



      
      
    



    


    



      
      
    </p>

 Desktop 
<p>To block elements on Desktop:</p>
 
 Right-click on the page you’re viewing. 
 Select Block elements. 
 Select the element you want to block. 
 Press the Block Elements button. 
 



    


    



      
      
    

 Clear all blocked elements 
<p>On both Android and desktop, you can easily undo your changes and bring back blocked elements for a website:</p>
 
 Open Shields. 
 Click or tap Clear all blocked elements. 
 
<p>Note: This action will only clear rules for the website you’re currently viewing. Also note that the Clear all blocked elements option will only appear at the bottom of the Shields panel if you have any blocked elements on the page.</p>



    


    



      
      
    
<p>Clear all blocked elements on Android</p>



    


    



      
      
    
<p>Clear all blocked elements on desktop</p>

 Customizing blocking rules 
<p>Under the hood, the Block Elements feature works by adding custom, cosmetic filter rules for individual sites. To see all of your per-site custom rules, you can press Manage filters while selecting elements to block. Alternatively, you can navigate to brave://settings/shields/filters on both Android and desktop.</p>
<p>On desktop, you can also find other elements at the same DOM level by moving the slider. This can be useful to block multiple related elements or narrow down the block. Click Show rules to see the changing cosmetic rules.</p>



    


    



<p>Selecting multiple elements on wikipedia.org</p>

 User-friendly privacy features 
<p>Similar to the <a>Shred feature</a> on iOS, we designed Block Elements on Android to be a usable and fun feature that gives you more control over your browsing experience. However, note that blocking elements on a page might cause the website to break, especially if the website changes over time. If a page suddenly looks odd (for example, the page is blank or has unusable buttons) tap Clear all blocked elements to undo your changes for that page.</p>

 PIVX Weekly Pulse (Apr 25th, 2025 — May. 1st,&nbsp;2025) <p>Don’t miss a beat with PIVX! Our weekly highlights keep you updated on crucial market trends and everything happening within the vibrant PIVX community.</p> Market Pulse   Masternode Count: The number of active masternodes now sits at 2,111, an increase of 7 over the last week, signalling a healthy and ongoing commitment to the PIVX&nbsp;network.    Price Check: Riding the positive crypto market wave, PIVX is showing impressive price action! Over the past week, the Daily USD Value traded between $0.14 and $0.2, resulting in a strong weekly average of $0.1552. This positive momentum appears to be bolstered by strong community sentiment, with excitement building around potential new exchange listings and the upcoming Ambassador Program.

   On April 17, 2025 we opened a Dev Fund Poll of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP) to determine which of the funding proposals have the most support, or if the Dev Fund should end and 100% of the block rewards should go to miners.

<p>On April 17, 2025 we opened a <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/d55e9c6a-1b8a-11f0-8188-0ebcee0014ca/view">Dev Fund Poll</a> of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP) to determine which of the funding proposals have the most support, or if the Dev Fund should end and 100% of the block rewards should go to miners. Additionally the poll surveyed community members about prioritizing an extension of the Dev Fund and implementation of a new funding model, even if it requires postponing NU7.&nbsp;</p>



<p>128 ZCAP voters participated in this poll, representing 64% of the total number of members. The results appear below.</p>



 



<p></p>



<p>Q1: Which of the following funding proposals do you support? You can select more than one proposal.</p>



 
 Community and Coinholder Funding Model (C&amp;C) (84 votes/32.3%) 



 Community-Governed Funding Model (41votes/15.8%) 



 Pure Coinholder Funding Model (28 votes/10.8%) 



 Pure ZCAP Funding Model (39 votes/15.0%) 



 Zcash Governance Bloc (zBloc) (44 votes/16.9%) 



 The Dev Fund should end and 100% of the block reward should go to miners. (24 votes/9.2%) 
 



<p></p>



<p>Note: This question allowed for multiple selections, therefore the percentages above represent the total number of votes for each option, based on a total of 260 selections made across all options.&nbsp;</p>


 
 


 



 



<p></p>



<p>Q2: Do you support prioritizing the extension of the Dev Fund and the implementation of a new funding model, even if it requires postponing NU7?</p>



 
 Yes (66 votes/51.6%) 



 No (43 votes/33.6%) 



 Abstain (19 votes/14.8%) 
 



 


 
 


 



 



<p></p>



<p>Based on these results we can conclude that the <a href="https://zips.z.cash/draft-ecc-community-and-coinholder">Community and Coinholder Funding Model (C&amp;C)</a> has the greatest level of support and that an extension of the Dev Fund and implementation of a new funding model is ZCAP’s recommended path forward. The outcomes of this poll will be considered along with the ZAC and coin holder polls to determine if there is community consensus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We would like to express our gratitude to everyone who contributed to this process. Thank you to those who drafted proposals, engaged in discussions and debates on the Zcash community forum, across social media, and during community calls. Additionally, we appreciate those who organized alternative community polls and are grateful to everyone who took the time to vote.</p>

<p>During Q1 2025, Least Authority (in their role as the Zcash Ecosystem Security Lead) undertook an audit of the FROST Demo code, including the <code>frost-client</code> command line tool and <code>frostd</code> server components. We expect that the FROST server, <code>frostd</code>, will be used by wallets to help participants and coordinators communicate with each other and that the FROST client, in addition to being a working command line tool, will help wallets to integrate FROST as an example of how to interact with the server.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Panther Protocol has completed a major milestone as it approaches its mainnet launch, having been successfully audited by blockchain security firm <a href="https://veridise.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Veridise</a>. The audit of the protocol confirms that Panther’s smart contracts and privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as the protocol’s Zero-Knowledge (ZK) circuits, meet Veridise's high-security standards.&nbsp;</p> Why This Matters <p>The security of Panther's smart contracts and privacy-enhancing technology is critical to instilling trust and adoption of its confidential transaction infrastructure by both users and market operators. The Veridise audit confirms that Panther’s smart contracts and cryptographic implementations function as intended.</p><p>Beyond security, the audit verifies that Panther’s privacy-preserving architecture is implemented correctly and operates as designed, including the protocol’s compliance mechanisms, logic-related functions of the protocol, and protocol-wide vectors. Veridise also assessed Panther Protocol’s cryptographic primitives. In total, Verdise's assessment of Panther Protocol V1 was conducted over 171 in-person days.&nbsp;</p> What This Means for Panther Users <p>For users, this means greater confidence in Panther’s infrastructure. With the audit complete, Panther’s privacy-preserving technology has been independently validated, improving the security and reliability of transactions. Web3 users can utilize Panther Protocol’s solutions, knowing that the system has undergone rigorous scrutiny and improvements where needed.</p><p>For full transparency, the final audit report is available <a href="https://github.com/pantherfoundation/audits/blob/main/Veridise%20Panther%20Protocol%20250425.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a>.</p> What’s Next? <p>Panther’s Canary Network was recently launched on Polygon. This live, production-like environment uses real assets to fine-tune functionality before mainnet launch. The Canary Network features a single Zone operated by Eurobit, a Spanish crypto exchange, providing a preview of Panther’s privacy-preserving infrastructure.</p><p>The Canary network will continue to operate for 2-3 months.

  Partnering with Nuvo: The Future of B2B Commerce  <p>The number of businesses and the volume of trade in the global economy are exploding—yet much of it remains offline and disconnected. Sid, Rameez and their team at Nuvo are building the modern B2B commerce network to accelerate how businesses connect, build trust and coordinate trade at scale.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bryan-schreier/">Bryan Schreier</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/josephine-chen/">Josephine Chen</a>	 



Published April 30, 2025
  



TEAM NUVO.



 
<p>A coffee roaster in Minnesota is gaining customers across the country. But when a new restaurant places an order, the roaster doesn’t get paid right away. Instead, they begin a slow process of onboarding the restaurant, extending trade credit with payment due in 30 days or more, and navigating a maze of paperwork, references and risk checks. Multiply that across dozens of new customers, and growth starts to feel like strain. More risk. More complexity. Less time to focus on the business itself.</p>



<p>This is how the $5 trillion trade credit market operates: manually and offline.</p>



<p>Trade credit is the most common form of capital allocation across the global goods economy, yet the infrastructure behind it remains fragmented and outdated. While consumer lending is built on centralized bureaus and machine learning models, businesses still rely on instinct, emails and spreadsheets to decide who they can trust. There is no shared system for verifying partners or coordinating trade at scale. The result is slower growth, greater risk and untapped opportunity across the industries that power the world.</p>



<p>Opportunities are everywhere, but the people who recognize them are rare—and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sidmalladi/">Sid Malladi</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rameez-remsudeen/">Rameez Remsudeen</a> are one in a trillion. Sid and Rameez co-founded <a href="https://nuvo.com/">Nuvo</a> with a goal to solve trade credit, and a vision to build a connective layer for how businesses establish trust, form relationships and grow faster together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Nuvo, businesses create a verified profile that shares critical trust signals with potential partners—licenses, creditworthiness, banking information and trade history—all in one place. That same coffee roaster can now validate new customers, connect with better suppliers, negotiate stronger terms and scale their trade relationships without chasing paperwork or waiting weeks for approvals. Every relationship becomes easier to start, faster to scale and stronger over time.</p>



<p>And as more companies join Nuvo, they bring their buyers and sellers with them. Each connection strengthens the network, making it more powerful and valuable for every participant. It is a dynamic we have seen before in iconic companies like PayPal, Block&nbsp; and Stripe, where early adoption created lasting flywheels that reshaped entire industries. We believe Nuvo is on a similar path, building the trusted infrastructure that B2B commerce has needed for decades.</p>



<p>Sid and Rameez have approached this problem with the depth, speed and precision that we believe defines enduring companies. They have spent time inside the industries Nuvo serves, from lumber to logistics to fresh produce, understanding how trade relationships are built and where they break. They listen carefully, intentionally evolve the company as it scales, and move quickly. When we discussed a strategy shift to accelerate go-to-market, for example, it was fully executed within two weeks. That discipline and agility are already showing in results. Thousands of businesses are now joining Nuvo every month.</p>



<p>We are proud to partner with Nuvo on this journey by leading their Series A, which will help them <a href="http://nuvo.com/jobs">grow their team</a> and expand their suite of products. They are tackling an invisible but critical part of the global economy and building the infrastructure that will allow millions of businesses to trade with more trust, more intelligence and fewer barriers.</p>

<p>You’ve probably heard the saying — “if it’s free, then you are the product.” For decades, tech giants have harvested and profited from your data. But have you ever stopped to consider how exactly this&nbsp;happens?</p><p>What are the intricate processes that turn your online activities into billions of dollars? The answer lies in surveillance capitalism, a powerful economic force that thrives on the constant monitoring and monetization of your digital life. Join me as I simplify the complexities of this system, revealing how your data is being leveraged and, more importantly, offering practical steps you can take to understand and potentially limit its&nbsp;reach.</p> What is Surveillance Capitalism? <p>Surveillance capitalism, a term coined by Harvard Business School professor, Shoshana Zuboff, is the monetization of data captured through monitoring a person’s online activities and behaviours. It thrives on the relentless extraction of user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Every click, every search query, every location ping, every purchase, and every message — these digital breadcrumbs are meticulously collected and analysed. Sadly, this isn’t simply about providing better services; it’s about creating a comprehensive and predictive model of your behaviour, your desires, and your future&nbsp;actions.</p><p>To better understand how surveillance capitalism works, think about some seemingly innocuous interactions you have online daily. Your interactions on social media — posts, likes, shares, and comments — paint a detailed picture of your interests, relationships, and opinions. Even the time you spend looking at a particular post is valuable&nbsp;data.</p><p>Your search history reveals your immediate needs, your curiosities, your health concerns, and your purchasing intentions. The mobile applications you use collect data such as your location, contact lists, call logs, and app usage patterns. These provide a constant stream of information about your movements, social circle, and daily routines. And if you are a fan of smart devices, things like voice assistants, smart home devices, and wearable technology collect audio recordings, environmental data, and physiological information.</p><p>When you visit websites, your online activity is tracked through HTTP cookies, small text files stored on your device by your web browser. These cookies record a wide range of data, including your browsing history (pages visited, time spent on each page), preferences (language settings, display choices), and interactions with websites (clicks, form submissions, purchases).</p><p>This data collection often happens in the background, without explicit consent or a full understanding of its implications. While companies may argue that this data is anonymized or aggregated, sophisticated techniques can often re-identify individuals from seemingly anonymous datasets.</p> The Monetization Engine: Turning Data into&nbsp;Profit <p>The raw data itself is valuable, but its true power lies in its transformation into predictions. Surveillance capitalists invest heavily in sophisticated algorithms and artificial intelligence to analyse these vast datasets and identify patterns, correlations, and causal relationships. This analysis allows them to create detailed “behavioural profiles” of individuals and&nbsp;groups.</p><p>These profiles are then used in a multitude of ways to generate profit. Targeted advertising is perhaps the most visible manifestation of surveillance capitalism. By understanding your interests and preferences, companies can serve you highly personalized advertisements, increasing the likelihood of clicks and conversions. Does it not surprise you that you get bombarded with sneaker ads right after you search for one&nbsp;online?</p><p>There is also the issue of predictive analytics where businesses use these behavioural profiles to anticipate future trends, consumer demand, and market shifts. This allows them to optimize their products, pricing, and marketing strategies. Furthermore, data brokers and other companies aggregate and sell these behavioural insights to a wide range of organizations, including marketing firms, financial institutions, and even political campaigns.</p><p>Beyond simply predicting behaviour, surveillance capitalism aims to influence and direct it. By subtly nudging users with personalized content and recommendations, platforms can shape their decisions and actions. This raises ethical concerns about manipulation and autonomy.</p> The Asymmetry of Power: A Society Under Observation <p>Surveillance capitalism creates a significant power imbalance. Individuals are largely unaware of the extent and nature of the data being collected, how it’s being analyzed, and the ways in which it’s being used against them or to influence their choices. The opaque algorithms that drive these processes further exacerbate this asymmetry.</p><p>The <a href="https://medium.com/pivx/the-erosion-of-digital-privacy-what-you-need-to-know-in-2025-9dc9bf6dd6d6">expectation of privacy</a> diminishes as our digital footprint expands and becomes increasingly scrutinized. Knowing that our online activities are being tracked and analysed can lead to <a href="https://medium.com/pivx/china-intensifies-surveillance-arrests-tibetans-for-phone-and-internet-use-89bfa18a134d">self-censorship</a> and a reluctance to express dissenting opinions or explore unconventional ideas.</p><p>Meanwhile, the ability to predict and influence behaviour raises concerns about the potential for manipulation at scale, both commercially and politically. When our choices are subtly guided and our desires are anticipated, our sense of agency and self-determination can be undermined.</p> Taking Back Control: What You Can&nbsp;Do <p>While the challenges posed by surveillance capitalism are significant, individuals are not powerless. There are steps you can take to mitigate its impact on your life and contribute to a more privacy-respecting digital environment:</p> 1. Enhance Your Digital Literacy: <p>We all love free services and often search for free alternatives to some of our most used apps. However, you must recognize that “free” online services are often funded by the collection and monetization of your&nbsp;data.</p><p>I bet you don’t read privacy policies (I don’t too). But while often lengthy and complex, try to understand what data is being collected and how it’s being used. Look for clear and concise summaries. Keep up-to-date on data privacy news, regulations, and technological developments.</p> 2. Adjust Your Online&nbsp;Habits: <p>In an idealistic world, you wouldn’t have to worry about sharing your most precious moments with your online family and friends. But the world isn’t idealistic. So, think twice before posting personal information on social media or filling out unnecessary online&nbsp;forms.</p><p>Use browser extensions designed to block trackers and cookies. Consider alternatives to mainstream search engines that don’t track your searches.</p><p>For sensitive conversations, use messaging apps that offer end-to-end encryption. And of course, limit location tracking on your devices and only grant location permissions to apps when necessary.</p> 3. Leverage Privacy-Enhancing Technologies: <p>A VPN can encrypt your internet traffic and mask your IP address, making it harder to track your online activity. Some browsers like Brave offer built-in privacy features and block trackers by default. Finally, you can explore decentralized social media platforms and other online services that prioritize user privacy and data ownership.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

<p>More partners. More perks. More BAT utility.</p>
<p>Brave’s <a>Rewards 3.0 Partner Program</a> is off to a strong start. We launched the program last month to expand <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">Basic Attention Token (BAT)</a> utility across Web3, and give our partners premium exposure to Brave’s over 85 million monthly active users. This month, we introduce a new slate of partners pushing the boundaries of Web3 media, usability, and engagement. In addition to 6 new partners, April brings new <a>Brave Rewards</a> product updates and developments.</p>

 &nbsp;Brave Rewards 3.0 product updates 
 
 Rewards 3.0 now available on Android 
 Updated Rewards UI with a single-page view for easier navigation and viewing on desktop and Android 
 Added more brandable cards for Rewards partners

 Meet April’s featured partners 
<p>This month’s partners are transforming how people engage with Web3, from community-owned media and collaborative storytelling to digital identity, privacy tools, and movement-based rewards. Each brings something unique to the table for Brave Rewards users and BAT holders: From educational content and token-gated perks to fitness incentives and weekly community engagement, these projects are helping enhance BAT’s presence across culture, content, and everyday life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>New partner offers will roll out on the Brave Rewards Offer Wall, Notification Ads, Newsfeed, and New Tab Takeovers throughout the program, giving users more ways to explore, earn, and engage with BAT.</p>

 Coinage 
<p><a href="https://www.coinage.media/">Coinage</a> is the first community-owned crypto news outlet, delivering original reporting, sharp analysis, and a weekly video series that puts its members in the producer’s seat. Coinage introduces a Web3 media model where subscribers can join the Coinage DAO co-op to collaborate, own, and earn patronage dividends. Zack Guzman, founder of Trustless Media and Coinage, appears on <a>Episode 67 of The Brave Technologist</a>, where Zack discusses his journey from traditional media to Trustless Media, and the model he’s pioneering with Coinage.</p>
<p>As part of the program, Coinage is exploring ways to reward community engagement with BAT, including perks for sharing episode feedback, voting on future topics, and unlocking exclusive content.</p>

 H3 Entertainment 
<p><a href="https://x.com/h3entertain?lang=en">H3 Entertainment</a> is pioneering the next era of entertainment by empowering fans and filmmakers to collaborate in a transparent, decentralized media ecosystem. With a mission to democratize storytelling through Web3, H3 is reshaping how content is created and shared.</p>
<p>During the program, H3 will develop video campaigns around Brave and BAT, including high-impact introduction ads, Web3 explainers, and creative concept pieces to boost awareness and onboard new users.</p>

 STEPN 
<p><a href="https://www.stepn.com/">STEPN</a> is a move-to-earn lifestyle app from the team at FSL with over 5.7 million users. STEPN rewards users with tokens and NFTs for walking, jogging, or running outdoors. As a pioneer in Web3 fitness, STEPN transforms physical activity into digital rewards, promoting healthier habits while connecting physical activity to on-chain value. STEPN is among a growing cohort of products that show crossover potential for Web3 to add value to physical activities.</p>
<p>Through the Rewards 3.0 Partner Program, STEPN will integrate custom Brave and BAT in-game collectibles and BAT-powered prize pools to help users stay active and earn along the way.</p>

 Unfungible 
<p><a href="https://www.unfungible.xyz/">Unfungible</a> is a leading Web3 marketing agency dedicated to pioneering community building, having supported over 200 NFT projects and brands, driving more than $100 million in client revenue through innovative campaigns and Web3-native expertise. Together with Brave, they have co-hosted weekly X Spaces panels since May 2024, highlighting NFT and Web3 trends featuring guests from Forbes Web3, MemeFi, PublicAI, and many more.</p>
<p>These panels have generated 1.9 million impressions and reached over 150,000 listeners. As part of the Program, Unfungible will offer Brave Ads media credits to their top Web3 clients each month, enabling them to leverage Brave’s premium ad network and amplify their reach.</p>

 Unstoppable Domains 
<p><a href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/?ref=ac4f9d4dec334fc&amp;gad_source=1">Unstoppable Domains</a>&nbsp;is a leading provider of on-chain domain names, including .crypto, .nft, and .pudgy, giving users full ownership and control of their digital identity.</p>
<p>Since 2021, Brave and Unstoppable have partnered to bring native support in Brave for decentralized websites in the Brave browser, eliminating the need for extensions or custom settings.</p>
<p>Today, BAT can be used to purchase on-chain domains at Unstoppable, through the crypto option with Coinbase. On-chain domains can be used in the Brave Wallet to easily send and receive BAT and other cryptocurrencies. Through this program, we’re working together to unlock even more opportunities for our users.</p>

 Zcash Media 
<p><a href="https://z.cash/ecosystem/zcash-media/">Zcash Media</a> is an independent team of creators in the Zcash ecosystem that creates high-quality educational content focused on Zcash, privacy, and the future of money. Their work is produced by the award-winning team at 37 LAINES.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://x.com/jswihart">Josh Swihart</a>, CEO of <a href="https://electriccoin.co/">Electric Coin Company (ECC)</a>, joined Brave’s <a href="https://x.com/AttentionToken/status/1914702758990524483">weekly BAT Community Call</a> (Tuesdays at 2 PM Pacific / 5 PM Eastern on Brave Talk) to discuss Zcash’s <a>ongoing partnership</a> with Brave and Filecoin Foundation, and our recent rollout of <a>shielded Zcash support in the Brave Wallet</a>. The call drew over <a href="https://x.com/AttentionToken/status/1914778895217533309">1.3K live simulcast viewers</a>.</p>
<p>As part of the program, Zcash Media will work with Brave on new short-form content that underscores our shared mission to protect user privacy and expand support for shielded Zcash transactions in the browser. Privacy education is key, and Brave, Brave Rewards, and Zcash Media will collaborate to inform the public on the importance of privacy for the Web, search, and transactions.</p>

 Updates from March partners 
<p>The Rewards 3.0 Partner Program kicked off with strong momentum in March with 7 inaugural partners: Bandit’s Badchain, CHOMP, Decentraland, GuanoCoin, Karate Combat, Pudgy Pop, and SOL Incinerator. We launched Brave Ads campaigns, co-branded activations, and early BAT integrations that helped partners build visibility, boost engagement, and pilot new on-chain experiences.</p>
<p>To foster collaboration, we launched the Collab Lab: a dedicated space where Rewards 3.0 partners, BAT Ambassadors, and community leaders connect to co-create campaigns that drive mutual value and expand the BAT ecosystem.</p>
<p>Decentraland spotlighted its <a href="https://mvfw.org/">Metaverse Fashion Week</a> through a Brave New Tab Takeover, allowing millions of Brave users to discover the event (and earn BAT just for seeing the campaign with Rewards enabled). Decentraland’s Executive Director, Yemel Jardi, appears <a>on episode 68 of The Brave Technologist</a>, discussing the role of community in open virtual worlds, lessons learned in their journey to discover market fit, and more.</p>
<p>Karate Combat collaborated with the BAT Community to launch a series of limited digital collectibles on <a href="https://drip.haus/echo">Drip Haus</a>. Styled like retro fight night ticket stubs, the NFTs unlock access to a token-gated viewing party for <a href="https://karate.com/events/kc54">KC54</a>, streaming May 2nd via <a>Brave Talk</a>, with live commentary by BAT Ambassador and martial arts coach <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@cryptodojo">Crypto Dojo</a>. The Brave and BAT logos will continue to be featured in the Karate Combat arena for all eyes to see at KC54.</p>
<p>CHOMP joined our recent <a href="https://x.com/AttentionToken/status/1905330319965778096">BAT X Spaces panel</a> on Web3 gamification and design, and <a href="https://x.com/lukemulks/status/1894527747772616955">stopped by our weekly BAT Community Call</a>. During its Brave New Tab Takeover last month, CHOMP welcomed over 2000 new users in just 24 hours—some becoming power users. To date, CHOMP has released five BAT-powered interactive decks, each drawing hundreds of participants and showcasing BAT as a strong driver of engagement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, updates from GuanoCoin, SOL Incinerator, and Pudgy Pop are underway and will be shared in the next update.</p>

<p>Web3 builders and projects can join the Rewards 3.0 Partner Program to gain access to a highly engaged, privacy-conscious user base, and help shape the next wave of utility for BAT. <a href="https://blocksurvey.io/brave-rewards-30-partner-program-interest-form-3jNtl5c9Sb2om5LOneVd7Q?v=o">Get in touch to learn more</a>.</p>

<p>For most of computing history, intelligence flowed through a narrow channel: text in, text out. </p>



<p>If you could code or write, you had power. If you couldn’t, you were boxed out. Digital tools were built for verbal, logical thinkers. Everyone else—visual thinkers, spatial reasoners, musicians, creatives who think in movement or metaphor—had to translate their intelligence into text to be understood by machines.</p>



<p>That era is ending.</p>



<p>We’re entering a new phase of AI: one where models natively understand and generate across modalities—text, image, code, video, audio, voice—not as plugins, but as representations in a unified latent space. This isn’t just a technical upgrade. It’s a shift in the cognitive interface between humans and machines.</p>



<p>Multimodal AI is not just about making cooler images. It’s about unlocking intelligence that’s been latent, unexpressed, or trapped in the wrong modality. It’s about turning the act of thinking itself into a richer, more fluid medium.</p>



<p>This is AI’s synesthesia moment.</p>



 Multimodality: The new superpower&nbsp; 



<p>Multimodal models don’t literally “think” in pictures or sounds—they encode and generate meaning through a universal latent representation.</p>



<p>That’s the leap. Not a patchwork of plugins or stitched-together APIs, but a single system that learns and expresses concepts through a shared semantic embedding space, where a sentence, a sketch, a snippet of code, or a melody are all interconnected representations of meaning.</p>



<p>When Google announced Gemini, it described the model as “built from the ground up to be multimodal.” So was GPT-4o. These aren’t add-ons—they’re foundational systems each built on their own universal representations.</p>



<p>Why does that matter? Because it fundamentally changes how intelligence is represented inside the model. Instead of translating across separate sensory domains, multimodal models encode information into a shared latent space—enabling seamless transitions between forms of expression.</p>



<p>Under the hood, this unified approach enables a more expressive and controllable generation process. Consider the two dominant paradigms in image generation: diffusion and next-token prediction.</p>



<p>Diffusion starts with noise and gradually refines it—like a sculptor carving form from chaos. Next-token prediction works more sequentially, adding elements incrementally. While GPT-4o’s precise internal workings aren’t fully public, its image generation appears to integrate both approaches: creating a rough semantic outline autoregressively, then refining it through diffusion processes. The outputs aren’t “thought” in images or audio—they’re decoded from the latent space. This unified latent representation makes outputs better because generation happens all together, rather than across loosely coupled systems.</p>



<p>Previously, image generation meant rewriting prompts, piping them through DALL-E, and hoping for the best. With GPT-4o, prompting feels collaborative. You can speak in fragments or metaphors, and the model effortlessly decodes these into coherent results.</p>



<p>The same latent-space shift is happening with voice. Models like Sesame’s voice engine capture tone, emotion, pacing, and style—not because they “think” in sound, but because they decode nuanced semantic representations directly into expressive audio outputs. Voice becomes a fully expressive medium, with vast implications for storytelling, education and interaction.</p>
 







 
 Translating intelligence with AI synesthesia 



<p>Digital tools have long favored those who express themselves verbally. But intelligence isn’t limited to words. Some think visually, rhythmically or spatially.</p>



<p>Multimodal AI bridges these gaps. Visual thinkers no longer need paragraphs. Conceptual thinkers no longer need to wrestle with interfaces. Musicians and speakers no longer depend solely on editors or engineers. Intelligence can now fluidly express—and translate—across mediums via a shared latent space.</p>



<p>This is AI synesthesia: converting strengths in one cognitive domain into capabilities in another. If you’re adept at prose but not code, AI bridges the gap through semantic representations. If you’re a gifted designer but struggle to pitch verbally, AI transforms your sketches into narratives.</p>



<p>Scriabin, the Russian composer and mystic, experienced music as color. His neurological synesthesia enabled fluent transitions across sensory modalities. What was once rare neurological wiring is now becoming our shared digital capability, mediated through latent semantic representations.</p>



<p>Your intelligence is no longer siloed—it’s fluidly transferable.</p>
 







 
 Raising both floor and ceiling of human capability 



<p>The implications for work are profound. Multimodality raises both the floor and ceiling of human capability.</p>



<p>The floor rises as specialized skills become accessible. No design degree is needed to create beautiful visuals, nor coding expertise to automate workflows. AI fills the gaps—fast.</p>



<p>The ceiling rises, too. Specialists can explore across modalities. Data scientists can craft visuals without designers. Strategists can prototype without engineers. Composers can narrate stories. More time is spent at the forefront of their expertise rather than on technical minutiae.</p>



<p>This doesn’t make everyone an expert—it amplifies those who already are. Meanwhile, routine “middle skill” tasks—basic design, simple data analysis, boilerplate content—may automate or morph into new roles focused on prompt design and output supervision. Demand at the high end, for originality and domain-specific insight, may surge.</p>



<p>We’ve seen this before. Word processors didn’t end writing—they transformed who writes and how. Multimodal AI will similarly redefine every knowledge field.</p>
 







 
 Fluid intelligence 



<p>We’re just beginning to understand what it means to think through a unified latent space across modalities.</p>



<p>As multimodal AI becomes native to the tools we use every day, intelligence starts to feel less like a fixed trait and more like a transferable asset. We are now entering the <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-a-creative-new-world/">creative new world we predicted</a> two-and-a-half years ago: Visual thinkers can speak in paragraphs. Coders can sketch in pixels. Writers can prototype products. Musicians can narrate. The barriers between disciplines, roles and modes of thought begin to dissolve.</p>



<p>This isn’t just a UX improvement—it’s a new mental operating system.<br>Your strengths are no longer limited to the format you were trained in.<br>Your ideas are no longer trapped in the mode you happen to be best at.</p>



<p>In the synesthesia era, creativity becomes translation.<br>Expression becomes multidimensional.<br>And intelligence becomes fluid.</p>

The Verizon <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/?cmp=knc:ggl:ac:ent:ea:na:8888855284_ds_cid_71700000082347933_ds_agid_58700006959920338&amp;utm_term=verizon%20dbir&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=GGL_BND_Security_Exact&amp;utm_content=Enterprise&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gbraid=0AAAAABymyRFAo0sxykBuprNabTMLbLJtG&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwn6LABhBSEiwAsNJrjqqqBGm-SIgLQg47pn4b2982CXm7qFu4Aqu7bFp1YBAib87sPROBCBoCk_AQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR)</a> for 2025 paints a stark picture, revealing that ransomware was involved in a staggering 44% of all data breaches analyzed. This represents a 37% increase from the previous&nbsp;year.</p><p>The report, which examined over 22,000 security incidents, including 12,195 confirmed data breaches, highlights a disturbing trend: once threat actors gain access to a network, ransomware deployment is increasingly becoming the&nbsp;endgame.</p> A Double-Edged Sword: Decreasing Payments, Increasing Incidents <p>Interestingly, despite the surge in ransomware incidents, the median ransom payment saw a notable decrease, dropping to $115,000 in 2024 from $150,000 in 2023. This decline could be attributed to a growing resistance among victim organizations, with 64% choosing not to pay the ransom — a significant increase from 50% just two years&nbsp;prior.</p><p>However, this silver lining is overshadowed by the sheer volume of attacks. The fact that ransomware is involved in nearly half of all data breaches means that even with lower individual payments, the overall financial and operational impact on organizations remains substantial. The costs associated with recovery, downtime, reputational damage, and potential regulatory fines can far outweigh the ransom demand&nbsp;itself.</p> The Disproportionate Impact on Small and Medium-Sized Businesses (SMBs) <p>The Verizon DBIR also sheds light on a concerning disparity in how ransomware affects different sizes of organizations. While ransomware was a component in 39% of breaches affecting larger organizations, this figure skyrockets to a shocking 88% for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). This stark contrast suggests that SMBs, often lacking the robust security infrastructure and dedicated cybersecurity teams of larger enterprises, are disproportionately targeted and more susceptible to the devastating consequences of ransomware attacks.</p><p>Craig Robinson, Research Vice President for Security Services at IDC, aptly summarizes this, stating that organizations lacking proper IT and cybersecurity maturity — often SMBs — “are paying the price for their size with ransomware being present in 88% of breaches.”</p><p>PIVX.

  Cookiecrumbler automates cookie notice detection using LLMs, enhancing Brave's privacy features while minimizing website breakage through scalable, region-specific blocking and community collaboration.

<div class='item-content item-summary'>

<!-- todo: use sanitize or simplify or whitelist

<div class='wrap'>

<p>This is the 33rd post in an <a>ongoing series</a> describing new privacy features in Brave. This post describes work done by Anton Lazarev (Sr. Research Engineer) and Moritz Schafhuber (Staff DevOps Engineer), and was written by Shivan Kaul Sahib (VP, Privacy and Security).</p>
<p>We’re excited to announce two major updates in Brave’s ongoing work to improve cookie consent notice blocking. First, we’ve open sourced <a href="https://github.com/brave/cookiecrumbler/">Cookiecrumbler</a>, a tool that automatically detects cookie consent notices on websites by using open-source LLMs and even suggests fixes for them. Second, we’re now <a href="https://github.com/brave-experiments/cookiecrumbler-issues/issues">publishing GitHub issues</a> with the results of our Cookiecrumbler crawls across popular websites, inviting the broader adblocking community to help refine and triage these findings.</p>

 The challenge of blocking cookie consent notices without breaking websites 
<p>Brave blocks cookie consent notices by default. These banners are both annoying and harmful to user privacy (given how websites often implement them). Worse, as we mentioned in <a>our blog post</a> announcing cookie consent notice blocking, researchers have found that many consent systems still track people, <a href="https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Nataliia.Bielova/papers/Matt-etal-20-SP.pdf">even when users reject all cookies</a>. These notices are especially useless in Brave, since we already block third-party tracking scripts and pixels (which protects you, for instance, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7316539316560695297">when your health plan provider accidentally shares your data with Google Ads</a>).</p>
<p>Blocking cookie consent notices offers clear benefits on privacy and reducing annoyances, but it also carries risks. Overly broad or incorrect blocking can break essential website functionality, from checkout flows to layout problems. We’ve encountered many issues (broken scrolling, blank pages) when a cookie consent notice block is applied indiscriminately. To reduce their maintenance burden, adblock list maintainers tend to rely on as few rules as possible for the widest coverage. However, cookie consent notice implementations can vary significantly from one site to another, making Web-wide generic rules a frequent source of breakage. In response, we’ve spent the past few months cleaning up community-maintained <a href="https://github.com/easylist/easylist/tree/master/easylist_cookie">cookie consent notice blocking lists</a>, removing generic rules that repeatedly cause problems.&nbsp;</p>

 Enter Cookiecrumbler 
<p>Cookiecrumbler lets us scale site-specific cookie consent notice blocking across the Web. It uses open-source LLMs to automate detection, which lets us identify cookie consent notices across all sorts of site-specific variations, including non-English notices. We chose an LLM-based approach to automate the task of identifying notices for a few reasons, among them:</p>
 
 It’s easier to perform (as cookie consent notices tend to use similar text) 
 It’s repetitive (which helps with the sheer scale of the Web) 
 It’s low-risk (allowing human reviewers to remove false positives upon visual inspection) 
 It’s cheap, as every crawl costs on the order of cents (while we experimented with bigger and more expensive models, smaller models also offered great results after some tweaking) 
 
<p>This kind of LLM-based automation frees up human reviewers to do the more nuanced work of actually blocking the notice. As mentioned before, poorly applied blocking rules can break core site elements. That’s why we retained human review as part of the process: filter list maintainers and community members help confirm and tweak Cookiecrumbler suggestions before they go live. We’re also working on improving the quality of blocking rule suggestions offered by Cookiecrumbler.</p>
<p>Cookiecrumbler also supports different locations and languages. Cookie consent notices can look very different depending on a visitor’s geographic region or language settings. Cookiecrumbler has support for various geographical vantage points, so that it can see the website as a user in a particular region would see it.</p>



    


    



      
      
    
<p>Cookie notice in Thai</p>
<p>Cookiecrumbler runs completely on Brave’s backend, and uses publicly available lists of top websites for detection purposes. We’re exploring how we can build Cookiecrumbler into the browser to bring smart cookie notice detection closer to the user. But, like everything we do at Brave, this will only happen after a full privacy review so we ensure Cookiecrumbler works with user privacy and choice in mind.</p>

 How Cookiecrumbler works 

 Website list creation 
<p>First, Brave creates a custom version of the <a href="https://tranco-list.eu">Tranco list</a> that’s tailored to different regions (since cookie consent notices are often region-specific). A prioritized list of websites per region helps us focus on the most popular websites for users in multiple countries.</p>

 Automated crawling 
<p>Next, a crawling <a href="https://github.com/brave/cookiecrumbler-tools/blob/main/crawl.py">script</a> running on our CI servers takes these lists of websites and calls the Cookiecrumbler API for each website and region.</p>

 Cookiecrumbler 
<p>Once the API call is made, the Cookiecrumbler process starts:</p>
 
 The Cookiecrumbler API receives the request from the crawling script running in CI, and launches <a href="https://pptr.dev/">Puppeteer</a> (a headless browser) to load the website. We use proxies to load the website from the desired region. 
 We identify and gather candidate HTML elements from the page that might be cookie consent notices. 
 These elements get passed to the LLM, which identifies whether they’re cookie consent notices. It also suggests a fix, if applicable. 
 Cookiecrumbler sends this response back to the crawling script. 
 

 Publishing crawl results 
<p>After a crawl is done, we take the list of websites for which Cookiecrumbler identified a cookie notice (along with the region for that cookie notice), and publish this list to <a href="https://github.com/brave-experiments/cookiecrumbler-issues/issues">a new GitHub repository</a>.</p>



    


    



      
      
    

 Privacy without site breakage 
<p>Brave already offers robust and privacy-first cookie consent notice blocking by default. Cookiecrumbler extends that with an automated, large-scale process to detect new and changing banners. In combination with our work on removing brittle generic rules, we’re able to use Cookiecrumbler to ship a cookie consent notice blocking experience that doesn’t cause frequent website breakage.</p>
<p>We first unveiled Cookiecrumbler (under a different name) at the <a href="https://adfilteringdevsummit.com/">Ad Filtering Dev Summit</a> last year. Since then, we’ve made significant progress in lowering false positives, adding support for multiple languages, and ensuring coverage across multiple geographical vantage points. We’ve already seen the benefits of Cookiecrumbler, with fewer reports of notice blocking-related breakage and higher user retention and growth overall. By detecting and addressing potential breakage points proactively, we’re delivering on Brave’s commitment to a privacy-first and user-first Web.</p>

<p>You’ve likely seen the headlines: governments are pushing social media giants for backdoor access to our everyday apps. In our hyper-connected world, digital privacy is facing an unprecedented and complex decline. Hardly a day passes without news of another data&nbsp;breach.</p><p>What was once a fundamental right is rapidly becoming a fragile privilege, eroded by technological advancements, corporate greed for data, and government surveillance. Even our simplest online actions — clicks, likes, and shares — freely provide personal information, often obscuring the significant loss of our privacy, autonomy, and sense of&nbsp;self.</p> What is Digital&nbsp;Privacy? <p>Digital privacy, a key component of the larger idea of privacy, focuses on how sensitive data produced and moved across digital platforms should be properly handled and used. This data includes everything from your personal information to your chat history and online&nbsp;actions.</p><p>The foundation of digital privacy erosion lies in the ever-expanding net of data collection. In 2025, this goes far beyond the simple tracking of website visits. From AI-powered surveillance to the internet of things, and the shadowy world of data brokers, here are some key stats on the erosion of digital privacy in&nbsp;2025.</p>  IoT: The International Data Corporation (IDC) <a href="https://infohub.delltechnologies.com/en-us/l/edge-to-core-and-the-internet-of-things-2/internet-of-things-and-data-placement/">estimates</a> that 41.6 billion IoT devices will be online in 2025, generating 79.4 zettabytes (ZB) of data. From smart refrigerators that track our eating habits to connected cars that record our driving behaviour and even biometric data like driver fatigue, a vast interconnected network of sensors is constantly gathering data about our lives within our most intimate&nbsp;spaces.  Mobile Devices: It might surprise you, but the average mobile user has around 80 apps installed — many of which go unused. I just counted while writing this and found 88 on my own phone! What’s even more concerning is that, as of 2025, nearly 83% of iOS apps (that’s 1.55 million) reportedly <a href="https://42matters.com/daily-apple-privacy-stats-and-app-tracking-transparency">track</a> private user&nbsp;data.  AI Surveillance: As an action movie enthusiast, I was particularly struck by the recent G20 film’s depiction of AI-generated deepfakes. This feels especially relevant given that the global facial recognition market is projected to hit <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/facial-recognition-market-101061">$8.8 billion</a> in 2025, signaling its widespread adoption. Think about what that means: someone could potentially create realistic images and videos that falsely implicate you.  Cookie Tracking: Surprisingly, less than half of internet users (only 46%) understand what internet <a href="https://allaboutcookies.org/internet-cookies-survey">cookies</a> are. 40% of users accept cookies without knowing their purpose when visiting a website. On a more positive note, 76% of users know how to clear and disable cookies. In another report by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, over 70% of websites actively track users’ browsing habits, gathering data that ranges from search history to location.  GenAI Apps: Highlighting a potential area of vulnerability, Cisco’s <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/data-privacy-benchmark-study.html#~about-the-study">2025 Data Privacy Benchmark Study</a> indicates that 48% of organizations are currently inputting non-public company information into Generative AI apps. This practice, while potentially boosting efficiency, introduces considerable risks to proprietary and confidential data if not managed carefully.  Expert’s Confidence: A concerning lack of assurance plagues the privacy field: a mere 20% of <a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/privacy-governance-report/">privacy professionals</a> express total confidence in their organization’s adherence to privacy&nbsp;law.   The Weakening Walls of Data Protection <p>While regulations like GDPR and CCPA aimed to bolster digital privacy, their effectiveness in the face of increasingly sophisticated data collection practices is being tested. Corporations are constantly finding new ways to navigate or circumvent privacy regulations. This includes complex terms of service agreements that users often blindly accept, the use of dark patterns to manipulate consent, and the strategic location of data processing centres in jurisdictions with weaker privacy&nbsp;laws.</p><p>The global nature of the internet makes cross-border data transfers essential for many services. However, the lack of consistent international privacy standards and the complexities of legal frameworks make it challenging to ensure that personal data receives adequate protection when transferred across&nbsp;borders.</p><p>Lastly, the sheer scale and resources of tech giants create a significant power imbalance between individuals and corporations. Navigating complex privacy policies and exercising one’s rights under data protection laws can be a daunting and time-consuming task, often leading to user&nbsp;apathy.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights.

  Partnering with Listen Labs: Next-Level Customer Obsession  <p>Alfred, Florian and their team are on a mission to give every business deep, insightful research at scale—and fast. 
</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bryan-schreier/">Bryan Schreier</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/charlie-curnin/">Charlie Curnin</a>	 



Published April 23, 2025
  



Alfred and Florian.



 
<p>Imagine your company wanted to be as customer-obsessed as possible, and realities such as time and space were no object. What would you do? You’d talk to every customer you could. You’d talk to them until you understood exactly who they are and what they think of your product. You’d find a way to synthesize all these conversations into a canonical understanding of customer behavior. And you wouldn’t do all of this just once. You’d do it regularly—every time you change anything about your product or service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nothing like this has ever been possible before. But today, it is.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://listenlabs.ai/">Listen Labs</a> is a giant leap forward in customer obsession. Businesses use their AI-powered platform to conduct market research beyond the constraints of what humans can do. Where traditional methods like interviews and surveys made companies choose between quality and quantity, Listen is enabling companies to understand their customers at both great depth and great scale. We at Sequoia are proud to support their next-level customer research, and to lead both their seed and Series A rounds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re customers of Listen at Sequoia, and were frankly blown away by how well the product addresses what every company wants—to deeply understand their customers, so they can improve their products, build stronger brands and acquire customers more effectively. Listen automates every step of customer research, from crafting questions and recruiting participants to conducting interviews and analyzing responses. The platform can reach millions of participants in more than 200 countries and simultaneously hold thousands of empathetic, insightful conversations. And it only takes hours, instead of weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Listen gives businesses clear insights, automatically generating presentations on par with the output of a management consultant—together with video highlight reels of a company’s customers providing key points of feedback. Fortune 500 companies spend tens or even hundreds of millions per year on such work—and Listen can deliver superior project results faster and at a far lower cost.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Listen’s achievements are no surprise given the backgrounds of founders Alfred Wahlforss and Florian Juengermann and their team. Florian, previously a national champion in competitive programming in Germany, and Alfred, a repeat founder with extensive user interview experience, first came together at Harvard to found an AI avatar app. It went viral, gaining 20,000 users on its first day—and they built an early version of Listen to learn as much about those users as possible. Alfred and Florian are obsessed not just with understanding customers, but also with <a href="https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/listenlabs">recruiting</a> the highest-caliber talent. Among their first hires were several medalists of the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) and International Collegiate Programming Content (ICPC).&nbsp;</p>



<p>To date, Listen has conducted more than 300,000 interviews for customers like <a href="https://listenlabs.ai/case-studies/microsoft">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://listenlabs.ai/case-studies/canva">Canva</a> and <a href="https://listenlabs.ai/case-studies/chubbies">Chubbies</a>. It’s also spread organically through Sequoia, where we’ve used it for everything from research on industry trends to gathering customer feedback during due diligence.</p>



<p>We’re excited about Listen because it has the potential to change how companies build their products and services across industries—enabling businesses from software to CPG to VC to iterate on everything from product prototypes to brand and advertising far faster. Deeply understanding your customers is a competitive advantage, and we’re proud to be by their side.&nbsp;</p>

  The Always-On Economy: AI’s Real Impact in the Next 5-7 Years  <p>Before we get to full-blown AGI, hybrid agent/human systems will remove temporal friction from the economy and create new opportunities.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/konstantine-buhler/">Konstantine Buhler</a>	 



Published April 21, 2025
  



 
<p>While discussions about artificial intelligence often oscillate between immediate applications and far-future scenarios of artificial general intelligence (AGI), there’s a crucial middle ground that deserves our attention. In the next 5-7 years, AI will reshape and accelerate our economy by enabling “always-on” operations across numerous sectors. This transformation isn’t merely theoretical—it’s already happening in some industries, offering a preview of our near future.</p>



 The present: Islands of always-on 



<p>The future is indeed already here, just unevenly distributed. Several sectors have already achieved “always-on” status through AI:</p>



<p>Financial markets exemplify this transformation as early adopters of AI way before the LLM era. What once required physical traders shouting in pits during limited hours has evolved into a 24/7 digital marketplace. This was the result of thousands of brilliant quants creating predictive algorithms to determine when to buy or sell—collectively known now as electronic market makers (e.g. Citadel Securities). The result is a smooth, convenient experience for consumers with better prices. Modern consumers can now execute trades at midnight on a Friday—an impossibility just a few years ago.</p>



<p>Healthcare has seen similar evolution. Companies like Viz.ai have revolutionized stroke detection, providing expert-level analysis around the clock in 40% of U.S. hospitals. Before such innovations, if a patient came in at an off hour they wouldn’t be guaranteed the highest quality diagnostic treatment. Now, with AI imaging always on, a LVO (large vessel occlusion) stroke can be detected any day or time. This technology is particularly vital for rural facilities lacking 24/7 specialist coverage, demonstrating how AI can democratize access to expertise. AI-powered devices now constantly track vital signs, creating an “always-on” healthcare presence that was previously impossible. These systems continuously monitor patients’ conditions remotely, immediately alerting providers to concerning changes and enabling data-driven decisions based on real-time information rather than periodic check-ins. The technology extends from hospital settings to patients’ homes with companies like Commure, which offer devices that can perform sophisticated diagnostics (like blood cell counts) through simple procedures such as finger-pricks.</p>



<p>Physical security has been transformed by AI into systems of perpetual vigilance. Previously, only high-value facilities had human-monitored camera systems. Today, AI-powered surveillance systems like Verkada use continuous computer vision to monitor countless cameras simultaneously, triggering notifications only when necessary and providing advanced pattern recognition beyond human capabilities. Similarly in law enforcement, police departments now use always-on AI platforms like Peregrine that function as tireless analysts. These systems unify disconnected data across agencies into actionable intelligence, continuously identifying connections between cases and monitoring threats in real-time. This capability was demonstrated at Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans, where the technology provided constant threat monitoring.</p>



 The near future: Expanding always-on operations 



<p>The next half-decade will see this always-on capability extend to numerous other sectors:</p>



<p>The days of “high call volume” messages and limited business hours are numbered. AI will handle front-line support continuously, with human managers available for escalations. Small businesses will compete with large corporations in providing 24/7 customer care, using AI to filter and escalate only truly urgent matters.</p>



<p>Rather than waiting for general-purpose robots, specialized systems will enable 24/7 operations in specific domains. For instance, automated food preparation systems will allow restaurants to operate continuously, maintaining consistent quality regardless of time or staffing constraints. AI-powered systems will enable autonomous manufacturing as robots work alongside human operators to maintain continuous production cycles. This will transform manufacturing by optimizing production flow and improving overall efficiency while maintaining the critical human judgment and creativity that drives innovation. Cobot exemplifies this type of future, and is already live in production in logistics and manufacturing operations to redefine human-robot collaboration.</p>



<p>Medical professionals will benefit from AI-powered documentation systems that operate continuously. Consider emergency surgeons responding to 3 AM calls—AI will automatically document these urgent communications, allowing doctors to focus entirely on patient care and superior outcomes rather than administrative tasks. AI note-takers like Freed and Abridge are transforming healthcare by eliminating documentation burdens. And always-on information systems like OpenEvidence help doctors keep up with the latest treatments instantaneously.</p>



<p>ChatGPT already provides students with a 24/7 tutor (that can also do their homework!) and education is primed to become one of the largest use cases for generative AI as its reliability improves and schools figure out how to incorporate it into their curricula responsibly. Not only will AI agents adapt to students’ level of understanding and cognitive needs, but as workers retrain to keep up with the changing job market there will be an increased demand for after hours adult education service as well.</p>



<p>Companies like XBOW have pioneered always-on penetration testing for enterprises. AI is forecast to increase the surface area for cyberattacks as criminals get better at writing their own malicious agents, but 24/7 security will rise to stay ahead of the bad guys.</p>



<p>Always-on will also have an impact on recruiting. 24/7 HR agents will allow candidates with jobs and families to interview for positions at 10 pm or on weekends, allowing great candidates who previously couldn’t schedule interviews to apply.</p>



<p>Fleets of autonomous vehicles will become mainstays in many communities, fulfilling Uber’s original mission to “make transportation as reliable as running water.” Unlike other services with capacity fluctuations, autonomous fleets will maintain consistent availability regardless of time. Benefits include eliminated surge pricing, reliable service in underserved areas, more efficient fleet utilization and reduced total vehicle requirements.&nbsp;</p>



 The Broader Implications 



<p>This shift toward an always-on economy will have profound effects:</p>



 
 Economic efficiency: The elimination of traditional business hours will reduce economic friction and increase asset utilization. 



 Global competition: Time zones will become less relevant as AI enables continuous operation across borders. 



 Work patterns: Traditional 9-to-5 schedules will evolve as systems operate continuously, requiring new approaches to human oversight and intervention. 



 Resource distribution: Peak demand periods will flatten as pricing mechanisms encourage off-hours usage. 
 



 The Always On Workforce 



<p>The real transformation AI brings in the next 5-7 years isn’t about replacing human intelligence—it’s about removing temporal constraints from our economy. This shift toward continuous operation will create new opportunities while challenging traditional business models and work patterns. Organizations that adapt to this always-on paradigm will find themselves at a significant advantage in an increasingly fluid and accelerated economic landscape.</p>



<p>The key to success will not lie in completely automating human tasks, but in thoughtfully integrating AI systems to enable continuous operations while maintaining human oversight where it matters most. This hybrid approach will define the next phase of economic evolution, creating a more responsive and efficient economy that never sleeps.</p>

<p>Crypto OG, checking in! I mean, I have been active in this space since Bitcoin was $400 and I’ve lived through the ICO boom, the NFT craze, the metaverse hype, and the meme coin madness, you name it. One thing’s crystal clear though: a lot of these price swings are pure speculation, not actual adoption. It’s the classic “buy the rumour, sell the news” playbook.</p><p>In January 2024, CoinGecko released a <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/how-many-cryptocurrencies-failed#:~:text=How%20Many%20Crypto%20Coins%20Have,the%202020%20%2D%202021%20bull%20run.">report</a> suggesting that over 50% of the cryptocurrencies listed on its platform between 2014 and 2023 had died. Bull runs are notorious for a high rate of listings, with a failure rate of approximately 70%. But it gets even more interesting.</p><p>A casual check of CoinMarketCap’s <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/number-of-cryptocurrencies-tracked/">new listings</a> underscores the speculative nature of the current market. The platform recorded over 70,000 new cryptocurrencies within 24 hours, 560,000 in the past week, and roughly 1.7 million in the last month. And we both know that a considerable chunk of these projects are pump-and-dump coins riding the wave of&nbsp;hype.</p><p>Against this backdrop of fleeting trends and project failures, we can’t ignore the many cryptocurrencies that have stood the test of time, PIVX being one of&nbsp;such.</p><p>PIVX (Private Instant Verified Transaction) is a cryptocurrency that has been around since 2016, evolving from a DASH fork into a project focused on privacy, security, and community governance. Moving beyond the speculative frenzy that often dominates crypto markets, let’s explore the fundamental value proposition of&nbsp;PIVX.</p> Privacy Matters <p>At its heart, PIVX prioritizes user privacy. Unlike public blockchains where transaction details are transparent, PIVX implements several key technologies to enhance anonymity. Its core privacy feature is zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge), a powerful cryptographic tool allowing users to conduct transactions without revealing the sender, receiver, or amount. This commitment to “optional” transactional privacy positions PIVX as a valuable tool for individuals and entities seeking financial confidentiality in an increasingly surveilled digital landscape.</p> Instant and Verified Transactions <p>PIVX lives up to its name by offering near-instant transaction confirmations. The blockchain network currently has a theoretical maximum throughput of 173 transactions per second (tps). This allows for quick and reliable payments, making PIVX a potentially viable option for everyday transactions.</p><p>Furthermore, the network employs a robust Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which not only secures the blockchain but also offers energy efficiency compared to Proof-of-Work systems. The PoS model also incentivizes network participation through staking rewards, fostering a stronger and more decentralized network.</p> Decentralized Governance and Community Power <p>A significant aspect of PIVX’s fundamental value lies in its strong emphasis on decentralized governance. Through its masternode network, PIVX holders have the power to propose, vote on, and fund development and marketing initiatives. This community-driven governance model ensures that the project’s direction aligns with the interests of its stakeholders, fostering a sense of ownership and long-term commitment. This decentralized decision-making process is a double-edged sword that can lead to voter apathy and plutocracy or a more agile and responsive development compared to projects governed by a central&nbsp;entity.</p><p>PIVX has maintained this structure for nearly a decade, meaning it works for the ecosystem.</p> Real-World Use Cases and&nbsp;Adoption <p>While privacy-focused cryptocurrencies sometimes face scrutiny, the demand for private transactions is undeniable. PIVX has seen adoption in various niches where confidentiality is paramount, including online merchants, freelancers, and individuals seeking to protect their financial data. The fast transaction speeds and low fees enhance its practicality for real-world use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>As regulatory landscapes evolve and awareness of digital privacy grows, the utility of privacy-enhancing cryptocurrencies like PIVX is likely to increase.</p><p>In conclusion, while market speculation inevitably influences the price of any cryptocurrency, evaluating the fundamental value of PIVX requires looking beyond short-term price fluctuations. Its strong focus on privacy, fast and secure transactions, decentralized governance, and growing real-world utility contribute to a compelling fundamental value proposition.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/beyond-speculation-evaluating-the-fundamental-value-of-pivx-63ce870638c9">Beyond Speculation: Evaluating the Fundamental Value of PIVX</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In November 2025, the current Dev Fund established under ZIP 1015 will expire, and 100% of block rewards will be allocated to miners. If a new Dev Fund is not in place by the time ZIP 1015 expires in November 2025, 100% of block rewards will go to miners.</p>



<p>Today we opened a <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/d55e9c6a-1b8a-11f0-8188-0ebcee0014ca/view">ZCAP poll</a> intended to assess whether there is community consensus to create a new Dev Fund and corresponding funding model and, if so, which proposal is preferred. This poll is part of our ongoing commitment to ensuring that the Zcash community has a significant and meaningful role in shaping decisions concerning the future direction of Zcash.</p>



<p></p>



 ZCAP Poll Questions 



<p>In this poll we are asking the following questions, and provide the following response options.</p>



 



<p>Q1: Which of the following funding proposals do you support? You can select more than one proposal.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Community and Coinholder Funding Model (C&amp;C) 



 Community-Governed Funding Model 



 Pure Coinholder Funding Model 



 Pure ZCAP Funding Model 



 Zcash Governance Bloc (zBloc) 



 The Dev Fund should end and 100% of the block reward should go to miners.&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



<p>Below is a summary of the five proposals:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Community and Coinholder (C&amp;C) Funding Model (C&amp;C) : Allocates 8% of block rewards to ZCG and 12% to a Coinholder-Controlled Fund, active until the third halving in November 2028. It gives ZCG and coinholders distinct decision-making roles, with grants from the coinholder fund requiring 420,000 ZEC to be approved. For more information, see this <a href="https://zips.z.cash/draft-ecc-community-and-coinholder">link</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Community-Governed Funding Model: Allocates 8% to ZCG and 12% to a ZCAP-Controlled Fund managed by the Zcash Foundation. It prioritizes community consensus, with a 50% participation threshold for ZCAP voting, and secures funds in a multisig wallet. For more information, see this <a href="https://github.com/jackgavigan/zips/blob/patch-3/zips/draft-jackgavigan-community-governed-funding.md">link</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pure Coinholder Funding Model: Allocates 20% of block rewards to a Coinholder-Controlled Fund, active until the third halving. Grants require 420,000 ZEC for approval and are managed exclusively by coinholder voting. For more information, see this <a href="https://zips.z.cash/draft-pm-pure-coinholder-funding">link</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pure ZCAP Funding Model: Allocates 20% of block rewards to a ZCAP-Controlled Fund managed by the Zcash Foundation. All funding decisions are made by ZCAP, with a 50% participation threshold, and funds are held in a multisig wallet. For more information, see this <a href="https://github.com/jackgavigan/zips/blob/patch-4/zips/draft-jackgavigan-pure-zcap-funding.md">link</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zcash Governance Bloc (zBloc): Allocates 20% of block rewards to a Community Fund split into Large and Minor Grant pools. Governance is shared across constituencies like Coinholders, ECC, and ZF, each with adjustable voting power and thresholds. For more information, see this <a href="https://zips.z.cash/draft-ecc-zbloc">link</a>.</p>



 



<p>Q2: Do you support prioritizing the extension of the Dev Fund and the implementation of a new funding model, even if it requires postponing NU7?</p>



 
 Yes 



 No 



 Abstain 
 



 



<p></p>



<p>The results of ZCAP polls are advisory but serve as an important signal to ecosystem participants, funders, and developers. The poll will close at 12:00 am UTC on May 1, 2025 and results will be shared by May 5th.</p>



 We Support Community Consensus 



<p>While the Zcash Foundation Board recently voted unanimously to endorse <a href="https://zfnd.org/why-the-board-endorses-the-community-and-coinholder-funding-model-cc/">the Community and Coinholder Funding Model (C&amp;C)</a> ZIP proposal, we deeply respect the voice of the Zcash community and are fully committed to upholding its collective decision even if it diverges from our Board’s recommendation. The Foundation will support the community’s choice and take the necessary steps to help implement it.</p>



 Why ZCAP Matters 



<p>This poll is part of our ongoing efforts to provide the Zcash community with a meaningful voice in decisions about the future of Zcash. As always, the results of ZCAP polls are non-binding but serve as an important signal to ecosystem participants, funders, and developers.</p>



<p>The ZCAP process is a transparent, community-driven way to surface the views and priorities of long-term Zcash supporters. Though advisory in nature, these votes play a vital role in informing decisions across the ecosystem. Thank you for lending your voice.</p>



<p>As always, we welcome feedback from the Zcash Community. If you have comments or suggestions, please join the conversation on the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/moving-the-dev-fund-discussion-forward/47464">Zcash community forum</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pioneering Quantum-Secure Infrastructure, Privacy Tools, and Cross-Chain Innovation</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>April 2025 — The XX Network is proud to announce the release of its 2025 Roadmap, highlighting a series of key advancements aimed at accelerating the development of quantum-secure, privacy-respecting technologies for the decentralized web.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As we continue to expand our ecosystem and empower developers, users, and partners, the roadmap outlines new features, critical infrastructure upgrades, and global community initiatives.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Key Focus Areas Include:</p>
<p></p>
 <p></p>
 Haven Messenger &amp; Browser Extension:<br>Haven is being architected with a modular messaging SDK, full React integration, and a modernized web app experience. Developers will gain access to a documented, flexible toolkit (xxdk) and a UI layer (xxdk-react) powered by hooks, Wasm, and custom state management. This overhaul positions Haven for long-term multi-platform support and privacy-first messaging. Haven’s PWA will also see a new ID system which uses a browser extension app for a more secure and convenient user experience. 
<p></p>
 Doxxier &amp; OpenVoice:<br>Doxxier, a secure large file transfer solution integrated into the XX mixnet, which will power a future whistleblower dapp. 
<p></p>
 Quantum XX Wallet:<br>Incorporating WOTS+ cryptography for next-generation, quantum-resistant transactions. 
<p></p>
 xxDK Upgrades:<br>Expanded support for React, React Native, Rust, and C to streamline development across platforms. 
<p></p>
 Core infrastructure:<br>Xx Foundation continues to work on infrastructure efficiency for core infra servers while it also works towards our ultimate goal of full decentralization of xx network. 
<p></p>
 Ecosystem Partnerships:<br>Integration with Quip.Network, a cross-chain quantum vault and atomic swap protocol, and Superset.Finance, focused on deep liquidity across chains and quick crypto access. 
<p></p>
 Community &amp; Outreach:<br>The Privacy Podcast Series continues with high-profile guests, alongside an international presence at conferences including Token2049 Dubai, Scytale Lugano, EthDam, and W3PN Amsterdam. Also, Ant Soccer Game will launch its game and an integration of the xx coin into their game is forthcoming after launch. 
<p></p> 
<p></p>
<p>“The 2025 roadmap represents the next phase in our mission to deliver real privacy, decentralization, and quantum-ready infrastructure to users around the globe,” said Aaron Welwood – xx Foundation Co-director.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>The roadmap will evolve over the course of the year as milestones are met and new partnerships take shape.</p>

  Partnering with Finch: AI-Powered Justice  <p>Viraj, Ben, and their team are giving personal injury law firms the case staff of the future.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/alfred-lin/">Alfred Lin</a>	 



Published April 16, 2025
  



Team Finch.



 
<p>Movies and TV suggest the vast majority of legal work happens in the courtroom, where lawyers make grand speeches and shout “Objection!” But the reality is, law firms spend countless hours on mundane administrative work. At the typical personal injury firm, half of the team’s time goes to tasks such as conducting intake calls, drafting and formatting letters, and chasing down police and medical records—much of it happening before a case is even filed. At the same time, the paralegals who spearhead this work have become increasingly hard to find, with close to half of firms <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/association-legal-administrators-4058492/">expecting</a> 40% of their support staff to retire within five years.</p>



<p>It is a challenge making it ever more difficult for small, local practices to grow and compete with national firms, at a time when millions of Americans are already <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/making-justice-equal/">struggling</a> to access legal advice.</p>



<p>But now, those practices can arm themselves with the case staff of the future, thanks to co-founders Viraj Bindra and Ben Weems and their team at <a href="https://www.finchlegal.com/">Finch</a>. By combining elite paralegals with AI agents, the platform handles all of a personal injury firm’s pre-litigation work—not only generating documents, but also onboarding new cases, managing claims with insurance, coordinating with medical providers, and more. While Finch AI agents transcribe calls, request records, and open claims, its bilingual paralegals work directly with clients. It integrates natively into a firm’s case management system, email, and messaging systems with best-in-class, SOC 2 compliant security.</p>



<p>Just as delivery marketplaces once transformed the restaurant industry, AI automation is disrupting the world of law. It’s no surprise that Viraj and Ben both cut their teeth building marketplaces with our friends at DoorDash. A uniquely talented product thinker, Viraj became the company’s fastest-promoted PM, scaling Pickup, Grocery, Convenience, and International into billion-dollar businesses. Ben, meanwhile, went on to demonstrate his technical and operational prowess at two other Sequoia portfolio companies, Google and Catch. Together, they are an incredibly productive duo, and they share a genuine fascination with helping law firms level up—and helping more people get legal representation.</p>



<p>Happily, that is precisely what they’ve done since the launch of Finch’s successful beta. Partner firms report that it has cut their case staff time and costs by as much as two-thirds—and enabled them to grow as much as 40% month over month, dramatically expanding their caseloads. As Viraj, Ben, and their team expand to a public launch and announce this round of seed funding led by Sequoia, we are excited to be by their side—and to watch as more personal injury firms free themselves of administrative burdens, achieve their true potential, and widen access to justice.</p>

									<p>As we approach critical decisions about the future of Zcash governance and funding, the Zcash Foundation Board has unanimously agreed to endorse the <a href="https://zips.z.cash/draft-ecc-community-and-coinholder">Community and Coinholder Funding Model</a> (C&amp;C) ZIP proposal. This model represents a balanced, forward-looking approach that prioritizes decentralization, cooperation, and sustainability. Here’s why we believe it is the best path forward for Zcash.</p>
<p></p>
 Giving Coinholders a Voice 
<p>One of the most compelling aspects of this proposal is its focus on empowering coinholders with a meaningful voice in funding decisions. By allocating 12% of block rewards to a Coinholder-Controlled Fund, this model ensures that those who actively hold and support ZEC can directly influence how resources are distributed. This mechanism not only ensures decentralized decision-making but also strengthens accountability, aligning funding priorities with the interests of those invested in Zcash’s success.</p>
<p></p>
 Recognizing ZCG’s Success 
<p>Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) has been a remarkable advocate for ecosystem growth, particularly in supporting smaller-scale projects that bring tangible benefits to the ecosystem. From light wallets to educational platforms, ZCG has consistently funded initiatives that enhance usability and adoption. This proposal builds on their success by continuing to allocate 8% of block rewards to ZCG, ensuring that community-driven innovation remains a cornerstone of Zcash development.</p>
<p></p>
 Fostering Cooperation Between Core Groups 
<p>A recurring theme in Forum discussions has been the need for better collaboration among key organizations like ECC, ZF, and Shielded Labs. The C&amp;C model encourages cooperation by clearly defining roles and responsibilities while maintaining decentralized control over funds. By endorsing this ZIP proposal, we aim to further unify efforts across these groups, creating a more cohesive roadmap for Zcash’s future.</p>
<p></p>
 Promoting Positive Community Development 
<p>At its core, the C&amp;C proposal is about deliberately empowering the community and not consolidating power within large organizations. It provides mechanisms for transparent grant applications, community feedback, and coinholder voting, all designed to ensure that funding decisions reflect what’s best for Zcash as a public good. This approach minimizes risks while maximizing opportunities for growth and innovation.</p>
<p></p>
 Why This Model is the Least Risky 
<p>With the expiration of ZIP 1015 looming in November 2025, inaction would pose significant risks to Zcash’s development continuity. The proposed funding streams mitigate these risks by ensuring resources remain available for essential projects without introducing unnecessary complexity or centralization. Additionally, safeguards like multisig-controlled funds reduce vulnerabilities to theft or loss.</p>
<p></p>
 Looking Ahead 
<p>Endorsing this model is not just about solving immediate funding challenges, instead it’s about setting Zcash on a sustainable trajectory for years to come. By giving coinholders a voice, supporting proven programs like ZCG, and fostering collaboration among ecosystem partners, we believe this ZIP proposal offers the best chance to ensure Zcash continues to be a decentralized, community-driven protocol.</p>
<p>While we support the C&amp;C funding model, we deeply value the voice of the community and are fully-committed to honoring the collective decision made by the Zcash community, even if it differs from our recommendation. We invite you to share your thoughts and feedback as we move forward together.</p>

  AI 50: AI Agents Move Beyond Chat  <p>The 2025 edition of the AI 50 list shows how companies are using agents and reasoning models to take on real enterprise workflows.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/konstantine-buhler/">Konstantine Buhler</a>	 



Published April 10, 2025
  



 
<p>Artificial intelligence is entering a new phase in 2025. After years of AI tools mostly answering questions or generating content on command, this year’s innovations are about AI actually getting work done. The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/lists/ai50/?sh=14d96301290f">2025 Forbes AI 50 list</a> illustrates this pivotal shift, as startups on it signal a move from AI that merely responds to prompts to one that solves problems and completes entire workflows. For all the buzz around big AI model makers like OpenAI, Anthropic or xAI, the biggest changes to the story in 2025 are in these application-layer tools that use AI to produce real business results.</p>
 







 
 From chatbots to completing workflows 



<p>Historically, AI assistants could chat or provide information, but humans still had to act on the output. In 2025, that’s changing. For example, legal AI startup Harvey is showing that its software can do more than just answer legal questions—it can handle entire legal workflows, from document review to predictive analysis of cases. Its platform can draft documents, suggest revisions and even help automate negotiations, case management and client contact—suites of tasks that normally require a team of junior lawyers. This achievement earned Harvey a spot on the Forbes AI 50 list​, and it exemplifies AI evolving from a helpful tool to a hands-on problem solver.&nbsp;</p>



 Enterprise tools leading the way 



<p>Many of the standout AI 50 companies are enterprise tools that do on-the-job work. Sierra and Cursor, the only product of startup Anysphere, are emblematic of this new generation of business AI. Sierra automates customer service while vastly improving the experience, opening the way for companies to offer help to their customers at all hours. Cursor, meanwhile, has taken the software developer community by storm. Its technology allows anyone to not only autocomplete lines of code (à la GitHub CoPilot), but also generate entire features and applications simply by asking for it in plain English.&nbsp;</p>



 Robotics on the rise 



<p>Although we’re not yet at a point where companies are deploying robots en masse, startups focused on robotics have made meaningful strides in the past year as they integrate models built using transformers (the “t” in ChatGPT) with hardware. Robotics featured prominently in Nvidia’s keynote at its recent developer conference, with Jensen Huang claiming, “<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-keynote-at-gtc-2025-ai-news-live-updates/#:~:text=Physical%20AI%20for%20industrial%20and,Cosmos%20platforms%20leading%20the%20way.">physical AI for industrial and robotics is a $50 trillion opportunity</a>.” Figure AI recently announced its BotQ high-volume manufacturing facility capable of producing 12,000 of its humanoid robots a year along with its new generalist Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model, Helix. Another AI 50 company, Skild AI, is taking a different approach, focusing on developing a universal robotics foundation model, Skild Brain, that can be integrated into a wide variety of robots, rather than building its own. Skild is also planning to sell services to the robotics industry that use Skild Brain.</p>



 Consumers on the cusp of AI productivity 



<p>So far, everyday consumers have mainly encountered advanced AI via chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Anthropic’s Claude (and newcomers like Grok). Hundreds of millions have tried talking to these AI tools, but we’ve yet to see a truly mainstream app where AI completes everyday tasks for people. That is likely to change in 2026. With the technology maturing—and people realizing how AI can save them time and money at work—expect a wave of consumer-facing AI products that handle whole tasks on their users’ behalf. For example, Anthropic recently launched Claude Code, making software writing accessible to consumers. These new capabilities raise the prospect that AIs able to manage your schedule, book travel or organize your files end-to-end are on the horizon.&nbsp;</p>



 2025 as Turning Point, 2026 for Wider Adoption 



<p>This year is a turning point: AI graduated from an answer engine to an <a href="https://x.com/dharmesh/status/1790602530822426730">action engine</a> in the workplace. The 2025 AI 50 companies proved that AI can be trusted with meaningful workloads and deliver real results, setting the stage for broader adoption. As we head into 2026, expect the enterprise gains to start spilling into everyday life. Challenges like accuracy and security remain, but the momentum is undeniable. In 2025, AI gets real work done.</p>

<p>“I have never been congratulated so much for winning one game,” said a smiling Lee Sedol, at the packed press conference amid enthusiastic applause and camera flashes. The great 9-dan Go player had just defeated DeepMind’s AlphaGo in game four with an unexpected wedge move that his adversary critically underestimated. Two days later, AlphaGo would prevail, winning four of the tournament’s five games. It wasn’t Lee’s move 78 that captured the world’s imagination, but AlphaGo’s move 37 two games earlier. Move 37 was so unconventional that Lee and much of the audience thought it was a mistake before realizing how “beautiful” it was. It had a <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/03/two-moves-alphago-lee-sedol-redefined-future/">1-in-10,000</a> likelihood of being played by a human and was a landmark demonstration of AI’s ability to be superhumanly creative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the tense final minutes of game five, the AlphaGo team crammed into the VIP suite at the Seoul Four Seasons Hotel that had become its command center. The team lead, David Silver, was flanked on one side by DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis and on the other by Ioannis Antonoglou, the research engineer who accelerated the neural networks that made AlphaGo tick. The moment when Lee finally resigned marked the end of a two year journey that pushed the science of reinforcement learning (RL) to new heights, and the team reveled in the accomplishment.</p>



<p>For Ioannis, it was a vindication of what had seemed a risky career move, joining the AI startup in London in 2012 as employee #25 and researcher #6. “It was the only place in the world where people were seriously considering building AGI,” he recalls now, and he was amazed at what RL had achieved in such a short time. He wasn’t the only one who was amazed. In Chicago, a freshly minted PhD in quantum physics named Misha Laskin read the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16961">AlphaGo paper</a> and abruptly changed the course of his life. Here was something as beautiful as theoretical physics but with real world impact. Misha realized, “this was a real glimpse into what it will be like to live among superintelligence.”</p>



 AlphaGo and beyond 



<p>Ioannis’s first collaborator at DeepMind was Vlad Mnih, the researcher credited with building the first deep reinforcement learning agent, DQN (Deep Q Network). He asked Ioannis to write a clean implementation of DQN as a library that DeepMind could use to advance deep reinforcement learning research. “Ioannis’s attention to detail and intellectual rigour stood out right away,” says Vlad, “he would always ask why we were going with particular design choices, why we weren’t incorporating things like LSTMs sooner, etc.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>A year later, when David Silver started working on AlphaGo, DQN had demonstrated how to use deep reinforcement learning in game playing. AlphaGo built on this foundation with many sophisticated innovations including using Monte Carlo Tree Search, a powerful search algorithm that allowed it to explore possible future moves by simulating game outcomes. AlphaGo also featured a dual network architecture with a policy network to predict the next move and a value network to evaluate board positions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This was a monster of a system by contemporary standards and Silver knew that maximizing throughput and minimizing latency was mission critical to train the system and then deploy it for realtime game play. He tapped Ioannis to write kernels on GPUs that could speed up the neural networks they were training. DeepMind was acquired by Google in 2014 and Ioannis quickly moved on to implementing the system on Google’s first TPUs (tensor processing units). These first chips were extremely temperamental and hard to work with but Ioannis figured out how to tame them. “If I couldn’t get it to work,” Ioannis says now, “then we wouldn’t be able to achieve the things that we achieved with AlphaGo.”</p>



<p>After the triumphant victory in Seoul, Ioannis continued to work on expanding the capabilities of these game-playing agents with a small core team. “One of the first papers that we wrote was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270">AlphaGo Zero</a>,” he remembers. “We showed that you can actually get the same performance—actually much better performance than AlphaGo—starting from completely random behavior all the way to superintelligent behavior.” This tabla rasa approach combined with self-play was important to demonstrate that RL can scale to solve new problems.</p>



<p>Then the team built <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01815">AlphaZero</a>, which added superhuman-level play of chess and shoji starting from random play, with no domain knowledge except the game rules. The zero in this case also meant that the algorithm can learn to play any zero sum board game. Three years later they introduced <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08265">MuZero</a>, which added Atari games to its arsenal while no longer supplying game rules—just raw pixels. Using reinforcement learning on problems without access to a perfect simulator of the world, as you have in Go or chess, was a longstanding challenge that MuZero solved. “You can actually have a system that both learns the world dynamics,” says Ioannis, “and uses this learned model of the world to actually plan into the future.”</p>

<p>Although Misha was captivated by DeepMind’s research, it took him a while to find his way there. He caught the entrepreneurial bug and went through Y Combinator with an AI startup, but the frontier of AI research kept calling—he dove into a postdoc in Pieter Abbeel’s lab at Berkeley to hone his AI research chops. Like a good reinforcement learning agent, he maximized learning from this environment of other brilliant researchers. Entering as a former physicist had a side benefit: “Because I didn’t know anything, I had this kind of clean slate. And I think that enabled me to try some pretty simple things that other people thought were too obvious to try.” He adds that, “It was surprising to me how doing the simple thing correctly was hard. And oftentimes when people try something simple and it didn’t work, it’s because they didn’t try it hard enough.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the course of the next two-and-a-half years, Misha followed the interests he developed through self study, improving RL methods in the DeepMind Control Suite and Atari Games environments along with the OpenAI Gym. Specifically, he worked on <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2020/file/e615c82aba461681ade82da2da38004a-Paper.pdf">data augmentation</a> strategies and extracting high-level features from raw pixels (<a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/laskin20a/laskin20a.pdf">CURL</a>). The most cited paper he co-authored at Berkeley was <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2021/file/7f489f642a0ddb10272b5c31057f0663-Paper.pdf">Decision Transformer</a>, which reframed RL as a sequence modeling problem, leveraging the simplicity and scalability of the Transformer architecture.</p>



<p>In 2021, Misha interviewed with Vlad, who was starting a new general agents team for DeepMind in Toronto. “I was immediately struck by Misha’s enthusiasm and belief in the power of reinforcement learning and unsupervised approaches, so it was really exciting when he decided to join the team,” recalls Vlad. “Misha was very productive from the start. He got up to speed with Google infrastructure and started producing research results in a matter of weeks, the same amount of time it took him to find all the good coffee shops in Toronto.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vlad also appreciated the clean slate Misha brought with him from his academic research, “he liked to start on new problems with very simple approaches. It’s easy to overcomplicate things in research, but Misha seemed to have a knack for finding the simplest approach that will work on a problem.”</p>



<p>Vlad and Misha would go on to collaborate on a paper titled, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.14215">In-context reinforcement learning with algorithm distillation</a> after working together on a DeepMind hackathon project. “Misha and I decided to train a Transformer to mimic a reinforcement learning algorithm to see if it would exhibit self-improvement on tasks it wasn’t trained on,” says Vlad. “We had a lot of fun pair programming and getting the first prototype to work. This was an early example of in-context self-improvement, which has become a very active area of research in the LLM literature. We got really excited when we discovered that the Transformer learned a much more efficient RL algorithm than the one it was trained to mimic.”</p>



<p>Both Ioannis and Misha were pushing hard on how to make deep RL agents more capable and general through increased scale and algorithmic improvements. But on November 30, 2022, AI history took an abrupt turn. “Everything changed when ChatGPT came out,” Ioannis remembers. “I think that was a big moment for everyone in the industry to see that these systems are so powerful and they can be a starting point for something that’s even more intelligent.”</p>



 The Race to Gemini 



<p>ChatGPT’s success exposed that the value of deep reinforcement learning had been hiding in plain sight: Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) was a crucial part of its training, aligning the model’s outputs with human preferences and values. Like the Transformer itself, OpenAI didn’t invent deep RL, but was the first to deploy it at this scale.</p>



<p>ChatGPT’s ramp to 100 million users in two months sent shockwaves through the tech industry—but particularly at Google. Not only had OpenAI capitalized on the Transformer architecture, they had added an RL step in post-training to make a runaway consumer product. At the beginning of 2023, Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai called a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/20/technology/google-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence.html">code red</a>,” and enlisted the help of founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to help the company catch up to OpenAI. A few months later, the Google Brain team was merged with DeepMind to become Google DeepMind under the leadership of Demis Hassabis.</p>



<p>The code red brought the AlphaGo lineage of research to an end for Ioannis, who was tapped to lead the RLHF effort for Google’s new large language model (LLM) Gemini. Misha was looking to join the Gemini team as well and Ioannis asked him to lead on reward models. Over the next two years they worked together to launch Gemini 1 and 1.5. Misha was initially intimidated by Ioannis, but soon came to see his colleague in a new light. “What was interesting about the RLHF team that he led was that he was extremely people oriented and worked very hard on ensuring that the people were self-motivated. He would deeply understand what drove them and would figure out the direction to steer them to ensure that what they were doing was impactful for Gemini. I think that’s a superpower that he has as a leader.”</p>



<p>By December of 2023, Google had <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/#introducing-gemini">announced Gemini</a> and when v1.0 was released in February of 2024 it was comparable or better on most benchmarks to OpenAI’s GPT-4. This was a huge accomplishment but the team didn’t let up. A couple of months later it announced <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-next-generation-model-february-2024/#gemini-15">Gemini 1.5</a>, three months before OpenAI released its next major upgrade, GPT-4o. Gemini 1.5 improved compute efficiency through a Mixture of Experts architecture, added multimodal capabilities and a million token context window.</p>



<p>For Misha, the sudden prominence of LLMs was a revelation. “We were trying to solve the general agents problem, but we were looking at it completely the wrong way,” he says. “Because we thought that generality wasn’t solved.” For all their limitations and confabulations, LLMs are the most general systems ever invented. “They’re not very reliable,” Misha explains. “They can’t do any work for you autonomously. You can’t ask them to do something in the way that you would ask a coworker, but they’ll answer almost any question that you have.”</p>



<p>Combining that broad intelligence with the ability to take specific actions reliably was still an unsolved problem. “In AlphaGo, the reward is clear. You win the game or you lose. And in these systems where it’s clear, reinforcement learning works like magic,” says Misha. In most real life situations, however, the reward is quite fuzzy. How do you know if a complex task is complete? How do you know if a human would like a model’s response? This is where his work at DeepMind on open ended reward functions for general agents come in. “It just so happened that that building block that I was focused on outside of language models was one of the core building blocks for training them,” Misha explains.</p>



<p>Misha and Ioannis had achieved their goal of becoming, in Misha’s words, “the best craftsmen of training language models.” They understood these systems inside and out, and yet they didn’t feel the trajectory was moving fast enough towards their burning research question: how to build superintelligent systems capable of acting autonomously?</p>
 



Reflection co-founders Ioannis Antonoglou and Misha Laskin 



 
 Snapping the puzzle pieces together with Reflection 



<p>LLMs have succeeded at achieving a very wide range of capabilities, but their competence is shallow. They have, as Misha puts it, solved the breadth problem but not the depth problem. “It became very clear that these two streams of research are the two building blocks for building a superintelligence,” he says. “You get generality from the language models and you get capability from reinforcement learning.” And indeed, Ioannis adds, “all the necessary components to build a superintelligent agent that can have an impact in the real world are there.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>When they left DeepMind to form Reflection in March of 2024, their strategy was at odds with where most of the industry was heading. A year later, every major lab is working on reasoning models that augment LLMs with RL, but this wasn’t an obvious direction at the time. Similarly, they had decided to train their own models, a seemingly prohibitively expensive move for a small startup, but it’s clear now that you can radically improve the economics of model training through smart engineering.</p>



<p>“It’s one thing to have the algorithms,” says Ioannis, “but it’s equally important—or even more important—to build them in a way that’s scalable and uses the compute in the best way possible. And we’ve actually seen the power of engineering with DeepSeek, they’ve managed to get such good performance with such a small budget by doing the engineering really well.”</p>



<p>Scaling is crucial to the Reflection approach, but specifically it’s about scaling data and compute in post-training, which allows the agent to get better and better at specific tasks. As Ioannis learned when working on AlphaGo, you have to “really push hard on the systems,” to get superhuman results. But, he admits, “there is a bit of a leap of faith involved, now you have the scaling laws, but until you actually put the investment in and really see that they hold as you go up the orders of magnitude of compute, then you can never be sure, right?”</p>



<p>The scaling laws for pre-trained LLMs are beginning to asymptote, but with RL in post-training the curve is just beginning to climb. Unlike the training data for LLMs, which may be running out, the data for RL training is largely created by the RL agent itself in its interactions with its environment. “It gets some things right, it gets some things wrong,” Ioannis explains. “Things that it gets right it should just do more of and things that it gets wrong it should do less of. So this is like learning from its mistakes. And this really simple mechanism, if scaled correctly, gives rise to superintelligent behavior.”</p>



<p>Misha puts a finer point on this, “the fundamental thing about reinforcement learning—it is the most scalable form of AI. There’s basically no ceiling that we know of.”</p>



<p>The thing about LLMs is that not all tasks are equal for them. They are spikey just like humans, primarily because of differences in the quality and quantity of their training data. Misha explains that the model’s intelligence isn’t evenly distributed across all of human knowledge, but is “a kind of jagged intelligence.” He predicts that the first generally superintelligent systems will be good at some things and not at others.</p>



<p>It turns out that the thing LLMs are spikiest on is also the thing that they are currently used for the most in a work context: coding. “The areas where models are already starting to work well, they’re going to get amplified,” say Misha, “and that’s going to be the first place where we see superintelligent behavior.”</p>



 Superintelligence, the product 



<p>“A lot of AI teams think that the model is the product,” says Misha. “From talking to customers, the way we think about what we’re building, it’s really not a model, it’s a system. So it’s a model coupled to a product that solves real problems for our customer.”</p>



<p>The opportunity that the Reflection founders see is to create genuinely autonomous coding agents that can accurately complete end-to-end tasks that currently an engineer would do. “And if there’s one thing that customers care about above all else in autonomous coding,” Misha reports, “it’s reliability.”</p>



<p>Misha uses Waymo as an analogy for what this might look like in practice. “Part of the product,” he explains, “is the geofencing. It’s not just a car, it’s determining the boundary and its area of excellence.” Instead of claiming at the outset to be capable of any task—as most current coding agents do—the Reflection approach is to partition off the software equivalent of a large metro area and make strong guarantees for safety and reliability within that geography.</p>



<p>The bright side of this limitation is that it enables a more intuitive interface for users. “The most frictionless interface is like the one that you communicate with humans,” says Misha. “The example is you give it an engineering task, and it comes back to you with an implementation that is better than the one that you would have imagined. That’s what we think superintelligence looks like.”</p>



<p>The founders believe that solving autonomous coding is a “root-node” problem that will unlock more general superintelligence. “We think that autonomous coding is AGI complete. So if you show that you have a super intelligent software developer, then that’s all it takes, that’s an AGI,” says Ioannis. “Then it’s a matter of just taking the same algorithm and applying it to different verticals. But you have the recipe for how to get superintelligent systems. All the things that you need for intelligence are there in this particular problem.”</p>



 Why code, why now? 



<p>There are many kinds of intelligence, not just those required to write code. But code seems to be the most available surface area to push machine intelligence. “We think that the intelligence is going to evolve faster than the software,” predicts Misha. “The reason to work on software engineering today is because it’s the one category that is already ready for this. That entire category has been built for it to be machine friendly.”</p>



<p>Automating coding with autonomous agents will have a profound effect on software itself. “In software the form factor that we have as humans, the UIs we are used to using on a computer, are not necessarily the UIs that are going to be optimal for AIs,” says Misha. The GUI, the graphical user interface, evolved because humans have innate priors based on having eyes and hands. But for LLMs, their priors are the language on the internet. “But when it comes to interacting with a computer, the language that you interact with the computer with is code. So to a language model, code is as intuitive as three dimensional object manipulation is for humans,” continues Misha. “Code is ergonomic for language models.”</p>



<p>The implications of these changes will take time to unfold. In the process, companies that produce software will create AI-friendly UIs that enable human interactions with software products to be faster if not instantaneous. Misha foresees that “it might be that pieces of the GUI get eaten and under the hood it’s just a language model doing some work via code.” Instead of a ten click human workflow, the LLM might just write a single line of code that encapsulates the entire task.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Reflection team has a pragmatic definition of superintelligence as a thing that creates value by doing work on computers. “We think that a coding agent is actually going to be the way that a language model does work on any piece of software in the future,” says Misha. “So if you solve this problem, you’ve solved superintelligence on a computer for any piece of software that has an AI friendly interface.” Eventually, Sequoia partner Stephanie Zhan imagines that this will lead to “a future where we all become directors of superintelligent agents that conduct knowledge work on our behalf.”</p>



<p>Getting there will involve not just training models, but building the machine-friendly interfaces—from browsers and code editors to abstract representations of task categories—that literally set the stage for superintelligence. Autonomous agents will work best, the founders believe, when they have custom-designed environments (think DeepMind’s Atari environment or the OpenAI Gym) in which they can hone their particular craft. When it comes to code, the required environments and tools are fairly easy to imagine, but other cognitive categories may require greater leaps.</p>



<p>AI at its current stage is like the early steam engines before the discovery of thermodynamics: Lack of theory didn’t stop inventors from producing new engines. “I think deeply understanding why a model works from a theoretical sense will certainly be a very useful thing,” says Misha. “Whenever a thing has been deeply understood theoretically, at least in physics, it spurred a new era of empirical innovations because scientists knew where to search. But you don’t need to wait for that to build reliable systems today.”<br>Richard Feynman was an early hero of Misha’s, inspiring him to study physics. In his lecture on the conservation of energy, Feynman said, “It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowledge of what energy is.” The same is true of AI today, and the study of intelligence. During a Noble Prize <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkb4qEuxoJc">interview</a> in Stockholm, DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis summed up where we are in the quest for superintelligence: “I think the science of AI is about trying to explore and understand what intelligence is, and the best expression of understanding something is actually trying to build it.”</p>
