<p>In this episode of the <a href="https://a16z.com/podcasts/ai-a16z/">AI + a16z</a> podcast, a16z partners Guido Appenzeller and Matt Bornstein discuss the state of the generative AI market, about 18 months after it really kicked into high gear with the release of ChatGPT — everything from the emergence of powerful open source LLMs to the excitement around AI-generated music.</p>
<p>If there’s one major lesson to learn, it’s that although we’ve made some very impressive technological strides and companies are generating meaningful revenue, this is still a a very fluid space. As Matt puts it during the discussion:</p>
<p>“For nearly all AI applications and most model providers, growth is kind of a sawtooth pattern, meaning when there’s a big new amazing thing announced, you see very fast growth. And when it’s been a while since the last release, growth kind of can flatten off. And you can imagine retention can be all over the place, too . . .</p>
<p>“I think every time we’re in a flat period, people start to think, ‘Oh, it’s mature now,&nbsp; the gold rush is over. What happens next?’ But then a new spike almost always comes, or at least has over the last 18 months or so. So a lot of this depends on your time horizon, and I think we’re still in this period of like … if you think growth has slowed, wait a month and see it change.”</p>
<p>They also touch on the question of training data, and whether licensing proprietary data represents a real moat. Guido doesn’t think so:</p>
<p>“If I license a book, that maybe gives me a fraction of a million tokens, and we want to train on 50 trillion tokens. So in order to really make a difference, I would have to find trillions of proprietary tokens. And it’s just, practically speaking, infeasible.</p>
<p>“Since the Renaissance, this idea had been that knowledge is publicly accessible and will be shared. And I think that’s still reverberating here where, at the end of the day, because this knowledge is probably available on the internet, everybody trains on the same data set.”</p>

<p>The massive success of the recently approved spot Bitcoin ETF showed tremendous interest from large institutional players. Even despite negative takes in public appearances, behind the curtain, more and more ‘smart money’ accumulate $BTC, either directly or through ETF shares. The same is to be expected for Ethereum, yet uncertainty still looms due to its proof-of-stake consensus model and, ultimately, staking yield. While crypto natives quickly embraced both ETH staking as well as liquid staking, institutions could not justify the higher risk profile and lack of regulatory compliance. Alluvial and Liquid Collective seek to change this and provide ultrasound infrastructure for enterprise-grade security in liquid staking.&nbsp;</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Mara’s background  ETH 2.0 and the current staking landscape  Liquid Collective  ETH ETF and staking concerns  The risks of adjusting staking emissions  Restaking and new opportunities  Institutional staking and risk optimization  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/maraschmiedt">Mara Schmiedt on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://x.com/alluvialfinance">Alluvial on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://x.com/liquid_col">Liquid Collective on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>This content first appeared in the May 2024 Fintech newsletter. If you’d like more commentary and analysis about news and trends from the a16z Fintech team, you can subscribe <a href="https://info.a16z.com/Subscription-Center.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>It didn’t take much to convince Varun Krishna, the Chief Executive Officer of Rocket Companies and Chief Executive Officer of Rocket Mortgage, to join the retail mortgage giant last year. The role provided the Intuit veteran with an opportunity to test out transformative new fintech strategies, think through regulatory and cultural challenges, and guide a large company through the most ground-breaking of new platform shifts: generative AI.&nbsp;</p>
<p>a16z General Partner <a href="https://a16z.com/author/alex-rampell/">Alex Rampell</a>, who joined Rocket’s Board of Directors as an independent director earlier this year, recently spoke to Krishna at <a href="https://twitter.com/arampell/status/1775984352339632519">a16z’s Connect/Fintech event</a> about how he’s approaching his newest role, how Rocket thinks about the intersection of AI and fintech, and the future of real estate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s an edited excerpt from their conversation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alex Rampell: In startup land, we often talk about the concept of 0-to-1 and building a product from scratch. Rocket is a multi-billion dollar company, which is probably more akin to 1-to-a-billion, or 1-to-infinity. Given the size of the company, how do you start thinking about growth, especially in light of the revolutionary change being brought on by generative AI?</p>
<p>Varun Krishna: The starting point for me was really founded in learning from companies that understand 0-to-1 and 1-to-100. These are two different things, and they require two different types of teams and people. In the 0-to-1 world, you need more entrepreneurial types who have seen failure, have endurance, and understand product-market fit. In the 1-to-100 or 1-to-a-million world, you’re looking for people who understand growth, have a leadership mindset, and understand analytics. Using product as an example, because that’s in my DNA, your 0-to-1 product manager is obsessed with customer experimentation so they can figure out product-market fit, whereas your 1-to-100 product manager knows how to write query language and is looking at analytics every day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the AI world, that’s exacerbated, because you have to understand a different level of technology, a different scale, a different pace. There’s a big, big learning curve. So, you have to figure out how to inject your company with talent that can infect the rest of the populace — you have to figure out how to drive transformation in a bigger way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alex Rampell: Gen AI models are known to hallucinate results, which is fine when you’re writing song lyrics, but is disastrous for a regulatory-heavy industry like fintech. You can’t have a Rocket chatbot tell a customer they can get a 1% 30-year mortgage, just because the customer threatened the bot, for example. How do you think about the integration of AI into fintech companies and products?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Varun Krishna: The bar for accuracy in fintech is extremely high, and unlike with open-ended generative AI, in fintech, when users ask a question, they want a specific answer. I think fintech companies must think about how to put guardrails around the prompt or origination thesis, so that users can get a more specific answer. Additionally, as we’re experimenting, we have a higher threshold of accuracy. We also have a high threshold on risk, brand, security, reliability – all those things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What’s also tricky is figuring out how you experiment at scale. I think the practice of perfecting early adopter programs, where you can <a href="https://a16z.com/a-framework-for-finding-a-design-partner/">work with power users</a> who are more tolerant of things going wrong, is really hard to do in fintech. But it’s incredibly necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alex Rampell: The National Association of Realtors recently settled a lawsuit that could eliminate the traditional agent’s 5-6% commission and effectively change the way real estate agents are paid. This will obviously have a big impact for Rocket and the real estate industry at large. What’s your take on this change?</p>
<p>Varun Krishna: This is big news. When you look at the mortgage industry as a whole, it’s a massive $1.5 trillion total addressable market with the vast majority of that being purchase transactions. If you take that and say, “Hey, 6% of that is what the realtors command,” that’s a $90 billion market that is on the brink of disruption. So, we’re excited about that, because fundamentally, our thesis is around value creation for the consumer, and this ultimately passes more value to them. Whether you’re the buyer or the seller, you’re either saving more money or you’re making more money, and the commoditization of knowledge plays out. Then, when you add AI on top of it, to provide personalization and simplification, and add transparency to things like fee structures, appraisals, remodeling fees… I could go on and on. It’s going to be a better world for consumers.</p>

<p>Imagine a group of small islands dotted around an area of an ocean. Each island has a small settlement of people, going about their business and living as best they know how. But there’s a problem. One island has wood but little food. They can build rudimentary huts but can scarcely eat. Their closest island has plenty of food but no wood, so they lack shelter. A third island has wood and food but no hay for their animals. Another island is brimming with hay but little coal to light fires. However, the island with the wood does have coal reserves. Then, one day, someone has an idea. Why not build bridges connecting all the islands so all the islanders can share resources? Soon, wood, food, coal, and hay are moving across the islands, and islanders’ business grows tenfold.</p>



<p>Now, imagine each of those islands is a blockchain. Each blockchain hosts a set of tokenised assets, which had remained confined to their blockchain. Why not build bridges across the blockchains so that assets can be easily shared and traded, similar to what the islanders did?</p>



<p></p>



 Cross-chain bridges: a simple solution to a big problem 







<p>In computing environments, some terms can be obscure and non-descript. That is not the case here. A cross-chain bridge does exactly what it says. It is a mechanism that enables the transfer of assets back and forth between two or more chains. Those assets can be tokens, cryptocurrencies, or any other tokenised assets hosted on the chains.</p>



<p>You might be wondering what sort of wizardry this is. Furthermore, you might question how it is possible to move assets between two chains whose protocols, rules, etc. might be completely different. These are valid questions, and here’s the answer. The bridge acts as a neutral zone (a no man’s land of sorts) where the switch occurs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An example: two blockchain games, one hosted on an Ethereum chain, the second hosted on WAX. Ethereum uses a proof-of-work consensus protocol, while WAX uses a proof-of-stake one, each with its own set of rules. And each of these games has some cool in-game assets, maps, etc. Each game world features a thriving game economy and has something that the other gaming environment lacks (remember the islanders?) Why not connect the two chains with a bridge and enable asset swapping, so that both gaming worlds (and their in-game economies) expand and grow?</p>



<p></p>



 Exponential growth for GameFi and DeFi environments 



<p>Blockchain has yielded much disruption and innovation throughout its relatively short lifespan, and the <a href="https://zaisan.io/alien-worlds-cross-chain-bridge/">future</a> looks just as innovative and bright.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For some time, this technology has been associated with decentralised finance (DeFi). That is the provision of financial instruments without reliance on centralised intermediaries, such as banks, credit unions, or brokerages. The marriage between blockchain and DeFi has been a successful one,  fostering a new era of financial inclusivity and autonomy.<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1237821/defi-market-size-value-crypto-locked-usd/"> </a><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1237821/defi-market-size-value-crypto-locked-usd/">According to Statista</a><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1237821/defi-market-size-value-crypto-locked-usd/">,</a> there are currently billions held in DeFi environments, showcasing its widespread acceptance and potential for further growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in more recent times, blockchain has spread its area of influence to gaming in the form of game finance (GameFi), combining cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other tokenised assets to create a gaming environment where players can play, trade, and earn.  This development provides players with true ownership of their in-game items and the ability to earn real-world value through gameplay.</p>



<p>The mechanics underlying GameFi are relatively simple. <a href="https://zaisan.io/nft-games-tokenising-game-digital-assets/">In-game assets are distributed in NFT form</a>, which guarantees ownership. This is key, as it enables the players to trade these assets as they see fit, sell them to other players, etc. And this is where cross-chain bridges come in. These two-way paths enable these assets to be moved from one chain to another, thus not only safeguarding the liquidity but also enhancing it by facilitating a wider marketplace. By doing this, the player pool grows exponentially, as players can participate in multiple gaming environments without being restricted by the boundaries of a single blockchain.</p>



<p>The same applies to DeFi environments, albeit without the gaming part. Users of different blockchains can have their assets exchanged on the bridge so they can be used on another blockchain. This is sometimes called ‘cross-chain swap.’ It is crucial for building a more interconnected and fluid blockchain ecosystem, where assets can freely move across different platforms, enhancing the user experience and broadening the scope of possibilities.</p>



<p></p>



 Cross-chain bridging with Zaisan 



<p>The benefits of multi-chain bridging are clear. The islanders knew it, and now you know too. Scalability, portability, and a massively expanded user or player pool are just the tip of the iceberg. These advancements signify a shift towards a more integrated, versatile, and user-centric blockchain ecosystem. </p>



<p>As blockchain technology continues to evolve, it promises to unlock even more innovative applications and opportunities, potentially transforming industries beyond finance and gaming, such as supply chain management, healthcare, and beyond. The journey of blockchain from a novel digital ledger to a bedrock of digital innovation illustrates its immense potential and the myriad of possibilities it holds for the future.</p>



<p>Zaisan is a multi-discipline blockchain services provider, including<a href="https://zaisan.io/solutions/bridge"> cross-chain bridging hosting</a>. Among many other features, Zaisan offers the possibility of swapping tokens between Binance Smart Chain (BSC), WAX, and Ethereum.</p>

        Replicate founders Ben Firshman and Andreas Jansson are bringing open-source AI models to the developer community—and sparking imagination on how to use them.         
Published May 14, 2024


 
	By Ananya Menon	 


 
			 
			Ananya Menon			is a journalist and screenwriter based in Los Angeles.		 
	 
  



 
<p>In August 2022, Ben Firshman woke with a splitting headache. He stumbled through his San Francisco apartment wracked by achiness and chills and grabbed a COVID test. That’s when he noticed something strange on his computer screen. It was a massive spike in traffic to the site he and fellow software engineer Andreas Jansson had launched in 2021, called Replicate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Replicate is a platform that hosts open-source machine learning models that anyone can run in the cloud with a single line of code. While the company had a small subset of dedicated users since its founding, it had struggled to gain meaningful traction—until now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sitting at his computer, waiting for the results of his COVID test, Firshman studied the uptick in visitors. Stable Diffusion, the most advanced text-to-image model to date, had just been released. Thousands of developers wanted to use it, but most were not AI experts able to navigate the complexity and cost of running the model on their own. And so they were turning to Replicate, which had packaged, optimized and deployed Stable Diffusion, making the model available for anyone—AI expert or not—to use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Terrified that the onslaught of API calls would crash the site, Firshman phoned Jansson. They agreed they needed to work fast to ensure Replicate could handle the surge of developers coming to the platform to build and collaborate on AI-based tools and products. This was why Firshman and Jansson had started Replicate in the first place: to make machine learning accessible to software engineers.</p>



<p>Just then, Firshman’s timer went off. He checked his test: positive. He wouldn’t be leaving the house, but he would be working day and night to capitalize on this moment. Firshman ordered some Paxlovid and dove in.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>In the 1950s, if you wanted to use a computer you most likely needed a Ph.D. in electrical engineering—that’s how complicated they were. But over time, software was introduced that made using computers easy, no matter a person’s background or experience level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the greater part of the 2000s and 2010s, machine learning’s useability was akin to mid-century computers, despite its growing ubiquity. Machine learning models were bulky, complex, on-prem systems, inaccessible to most engineers. To run them required expertise in the field and resources only available to larger institutions that could afford expensive servers and GPUs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jansson, who had been a machine learning engineer at Spotify prior to founding Replicate, understood firsthand the barriers developers faced in using AI models. “I could read all about new developments in AI, but there were no tools readily available to actually apply any of it,” Jansson says. When he encountered an issue at Spotify, he would delve into relevant research, which would be in the form of scientific papers—not usable code. “Experts would write software, turn it into prose for the sake of academia, and then engineers like Andreas would have to turn their research back into software in order to use it,” Firshman says. “The whole process was bananas.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I could read all about new developments in AI, but there were no tools readily available to actually apply any of it.”</p>
Andreas Jansson</blockquote>



<p>Once the prose had been translated back into code, there came another issue: deployment. There was no guarantee that the software would run properly when it was transferred between computer systems. Researchers and engineers would have to work together for weeks to ensure other engineers could run the models on their own computers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jansson and Firshman didn’t understand why AI models couldn’t just be distributed as software ready for production. This question connected directly to the work Firshman was doing at the time at Docker. Docker allows developers to package their code into containers (think shipping containers), which ensures that software runs the way it is supposed to on any computer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Firshman and Jansson wanted to build such a container, but for AI. “If only we could define a standard box for machine learning models, then researchers could put their models inside it,” said Firshman. “They could be shared with other people. They could be deployed to production. They could run anywhere, and always keep on running.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October 2019, Firshman and Jansson began working on Replicate. As Firshman explains, “The heart of Replicate is taking all of these incredible new advances in AI and making them accessible to software engineers who don’t understand those things, but know how to build great products.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Replicate would be a platform where machine learning researchers could host and share AI models, and where engineers of all backgrounds could use those models to build applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Firshman and Jansson believed in Replicate’s potential, they knew they were taking a calculated risk. “Generative AI is everywhere now, but back then, it was not a term at all,” says Stephanie Zhan, a partner at Sequoia. “Ben and Andreas’ bet was that there would be a flourishing open-source model ecosystem, and they could become an important enabler of it by providing the easiest-to-use tools and infrastructure for developers to use these models.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To confirm Replicate’s viability, Firshman and Jansson spent weeks talking with machine learning experts and software developers, assessing their needs and experiences and comparing them with their own. Open-source machine learning was a nascent field and Replicate was a gamble on its future. Ultimately, Firshman and Jansson determined it was a gamble they were ready to take.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Firshman and Jansson first met in London in 2012 while working as developers for a music platform called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210926084455/https://www.thisismyjam.com/">This Is My Jam</a>. On a team of just four people, Firshman and Jansson quickly formed a friendship, bonding over favorite bands and a shared attitude towards their work. “In a field where it’s easy to be cynical, we both had a childish enthusiasm for programming,” Jansson says. “We were both excited about building things.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Firshman’s interest in building came from his father, who he describes as a “nerd who was always tinkering with things.” Firshman’s mother was a classical guitar teacher, and during the hours she was with students, Firshman and his father would build and take apart anything they could get their hands on, from model airplanes to the family’s car. Firshman recalled being five years old and attempting to turn a landline into a wireless phone using a soldering iron. His father encouraged him to explore how the world worked, and Firshman seized every opportunity to do so.</p>



<p>As a teenager, Firshman applied his curiosity to software. He became involved with an online developer community who attached cell phones and cameras to weather balloons and sent them to the edge of space, where the cameras would take pictures and the phones would text their location. Firshman helped write the code for these explorations, collaborating and learning from other engineers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, deep in the forest outside Habo, Sweden, twelve-year-old Jansson was also learning to code. Armed with only a book about BASIC and an old Amiga 500, he began to recreate the games his friends had on their more advanced computers, like Brick Breaker. He was proud when he finally got the physics of the bouncing ball to work properly, and soon started building games of his own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When he was 15, Jansson left home to pursue his other passion, music, enrolling at a high school in Rättvik specializing in Swedish folk music. Following graduation he completed his military service, worked a stint as a forklift driver, and then moved to England to study sound engineering and, later, computer science.&nbsp; “Maybe there’s a way to combine music and engineering,” Jansson thought. He was right. Soon after graduating, Jansson started working at This Is My Jam and met Firshman.</p>



<p>In 2014, the two friends parted ways. Jansson accepted a job as a software engineer at Spotify and moved to New York. Firshman began working at Docker, but over time began to question his purpose. “I felt like I always stumbled into the next opportunity,” Firshman says. “I really wanted to figure out what I wanted to do with my life and what was important to me.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2017, Firshman quit his job and decided to travel. He cycled across India and drove a van through China. He ate homemade pasta for breakfast at a stranger’s house in Italy. Eventually, he made his way to Greece, where he met up with his old friend, Jansson, on a small island called Naxos.</p>



<p>One afternoon, sitting by a pool, Firshman watched as Jansson struggled to read a research paper about AI on his phone. The paper, only available as a PDF, wasn’t designed to be read on a smartphone, so Jansson had to zoom in on every sentence. Firshman understood his exasperation. In the early days of their friendship, they’d talked about how the internet had originally been designed to share academic work. But decades after the internet’s founding, so much scientific research remained needlessly difficult to consume, like these mobile-unfriendly PDFs. Lifting his legs out of the water, Firshman proposed they work together to find a solution. Over the next few days, Firshman and Jansson built a program that converted research papers to web pages. Using the program, papers could be scaled appropriately to phone screens, and the hyperlinks, which previously would have to be copied and pasted into a new browser, were clickable. Now anyone anywhere, and on any platform, could easily read and digest a paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although Firshman didn’t know it at the time, he’d found what was important to him: he had a passion for making the inaccessible accessible, and he loved working with his friend. Whatever project came next, he wanted it to involve Jansson.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Back in his apartment in the summer of 2022, the positive COVID test beside him, Firshman realized that for Replicate to handle the incoming surge of traffic, he, Jansson and their two other employees didn’t just need to patch the site, “we needed to rewrite our entire infrastructure,” he says. “It wasn’t working like we needed it to. It wasn’t up to par.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Firshman recalls the next few days as “24/7, all hands on deck.” One of their users informed them that an application built using Replicate was going to be featured on Japanese national television. “The show’s airdate was our deadline,” Firshman says. “And we managed to meet it. We rebuilt the whole Replicate infrastructure in a couple of weeks.”&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The show’s airdate was our deadline, and we managed to meet it. We rebuilt the whole Replicate infrastructure in a couple of weeks.”</p>

<p>Their work paid off. Following the launch of Stable Diffusion, software engineers and AI enthusiasts across industries flocked to Replicate to create new products. One popular app allowed users to upload pictures of their homes, describe an interior decorating style, and watch as the program generated images of their homes in that style. Another converted blurry, old photos into crisp, high-definition images. More than growing Replicate’s user base, Stable Diffusion’s release brought attention and legitimacy to the idea of open-source AI models. And it underscored the value of Replicate, a platform where they could live and be deployed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In July 2023, Meta and Microsoft released Llama 2, a large language model whose addition to Replicate’s library resulted in the platform’s biggest week of growth to date. For Replicate, this represented yet another vote of confidence—this time from two of the world’s most significant tech companies—in open-source AI models.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If Replicate’s initial challenge was getting people to buy into open-source AI models and believe they could be easy to use, today its biggest challenge is competitors crowding into the space. “Developers care about cost, performance, and the developer experience of running these models,” Zhan says. “The ecosystem of models is flourishing and ever-evolving, so pushing the envelope on these dimensions is a continuous journey.”</p>



<p>Cost and performance aside, according to Zhan, what sets Replicate apart from the host of other AI inference platforms is empathy. “They understand what developers actually want,” Zhan says. “They didn’t just build something that works, they built something that is delightful—a few lines of code to run any model in the cloud directly via their API.” Replicate’s website features a neon background gradation and large, stylized image tiles for each model in its library. Detailed instructions, replete with colorful visual aids, guide users through how to run, customize and deploy models. It’s a platform that front to back inspires the imagination.</p>



 



<p>Scaling a startup is almost impossibly complex, but similar to how AI models learn, Firshman and Jansson have gotten better at it over time. “At first, we tackled every responsibility together,” Jansson says. They soon realized this was a quick path to burning out and decided to delineate duties. Firshman focuses more on products and the business side of the platform, while Jansson keeps up with developments in machine learning. A decade into their friendship, the two maintain the highest admiration for each other. Jansson says he got an MBA by osmosis just by working with Firshman, who understands business and people “in a magical way.” Firshman describes Jansson as a “ridiculous, multi-talented person.” They’re certain that at the core of what makes Replicate successful are their friendship, respect and shared ethos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although Firshman lives in San Francisco and Jansson in rural Sweden, they make it a point to spend time together. Firshman visits Jansson about four times a year, and the two take walks through the forest, discussing the future of Replicate and AI in general. They continue to share the youthful passion about software they had when they first met, and they still can’t help but build together. When Jansson was getting married in July 2022, he constructed a dance floor in the woods near his home for Swedish folk dancing. A week before the wedding, he realized it needed a roof. Firshman, who had flown out early, spent days with Jansson building the roof for the dance floor. The last plank went in at dawn, hours before Jansson’s wedding. That night, the two celebrated with friends and family, dancing beneath their creation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As former developers and product managers, we’ve lived the grueling dance between designers and developers, where questions such as “Is this design technically feasible?” and “Can you add another screen for this step?” take place in every meeting. All too often, this aspiring creative exchange resulted in a Jira-filled, time-consuming process comprised of iterations, compromises, and, ultimately, a disconnect between the designer’s vision and the developer’s execution.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wifeframe-Mockup-Final-Product.png"></a></p>
<p>In the last decade, however, advances in browser and frontend technologies have improved the process by leaps and bounds. Design teams adopted design systems and moved from local, single-player design tools to browser-based ones like Figma. Engineering teams have a wide swath of choices for frontend frameworks and libraries, such as Next.js, Flutter, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind. This all establishes a common ground where both the visual and the functional requirements can be met.</p>
<p>Today, more mature code-generation technology, coupled with advanced image models, has dramatically shortened the journey from a mere idea to a fully operational application. This improvement in efficiency opens a new era of possibilities, inviting generative AI into the heart of the creative process. In this article, we’d like to explore the fast-moving AI interface-design landscape and venture into some exciting possibilities that these technologies will unlock.</p>
  An example: AI-Tamago 
<p>We were coding up a side project called <a href="https://github.com/ykhli/AI-tamago">AI-Tamago</a> recently, and used generative tools like <a href="https://v0.dev/">Vercel v0</a> extensively to design the UI.</p>
<p>The stages looked like what you see below. In each iteration, we added more details to describe what we wanted to see, sometimes reverting back to a different direction, while leveraging the LLM to surface good ideas we hadn’t thought of.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Leveraging-V0-to-design-AI-Tamago-1.png"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Leveraging-V0-to-design-AI-Tamago-2.png"></a></p>
<p>This whole process took about 30 minutes end to end. It’s much easier to go through these multi-step iterations between design and implementation when the designer and developer are a single person, which is the case for AI-Tamago. When collaborating with a team of designers and developers, the iteration process requires increased coordination and repeated revisions, consequently leading to a more complex and involved workflow.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ideal-Iteration-Process.png"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Iteration-Process-in-Reality.png"></a></p>
<p>We spend a lot of time and energy filling in the gaps between what’s on the screen and what’s implemented in code. The problem is exacerbated when the app has complex states and edge cases, because it’s a huge undertaking for a designer to enumerate all the possibilities through screenshots. As a result, most of the issues are only caught during QA and testing, and require backtracking several stages to fix.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But because generative AI technology is uniquely fit for quick prototyping and code completion, we believe it can bridge a lot of the gaps in this iteration process.&nbsp;</p>
  The landscape of AI-powered interface creation 
<p>Today’s generative AI technologies unlock two major improvements. One is that LLMs act as a design sounding board. With each prompt resulting in a handful of mockups, the focus shifts from filling a blank canvas to inspiring creativity. For a designer, the process of fleshing out design becomes less about pixel manipulation and more about ideating. They can spend their mental energy on the usability and compositional part of design instead of having to make sure details align.</p>
<p>At the same time, the path from design to functional app has dramatically shortened, which enables rapid prototyping. Many tools here allow for quick creation of UI elements, from static assets to interactive components. There are now noticeably more “design engineers” — those who work at the cross-section of code and design, and can use working prototypes to communicate much more effectively the tradeoffs between design and implementation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the influence of these two trends, we’re seeing a spate of tools emerge that revamp the design-to-implementation workflow.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AI-powered-UX-design.png"></a></p>
<p>The approaches we have seen can be categorized into three main functions:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Solving for the design process 
 Solving for design-to-code translation 
 Solving for code generation 
 
<p>Let’s dive in!</p>
 Solving for the design process&nbsp; 
<p>The design process in itself is complex and non-linear, which is why giving designers better tools to do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">breadth-first-search</a> and eliminate the need for pixel-perfect adjustments is very valuable.<br>
<br>
Oftentimes, senior designers already have a few concepts in their brains upon hearing about the product features to be designed, and the rest of the work is aligning with other stakeholders on what the design would roughly look like, before producing a pixel-perfect mock-up. Some designers who are proficient in coding skip the need to produce a mock-up altogether and instead design in code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A “co-pilot for design” (like the example shown below using <a href="http://www.usegalileo.ai/">Galileo</a>) makes this idea-to-mockup process more collaborative and interactive: Instead of drawing abstract ideas on a blank canvas, a designer could create new designs based on a rough idea and visualize it in a way that helps to explore the “unknown-unknown.”</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/User-Management-2.png"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/User-Management-1.png"></a></p>
 Solving for design-to-code translation 
<p>This is arguably the most friction-ridden stage — it’s almost like translating from one language to another. Design and engineering speak different languages, and something always gets lost in translation. However, generative AI models, through their training or fine-tuning on diverse datasets, have developed an intricate understanding of programming languages, design principles, and UX guidelines. Coupled with their capacity to apply UI templates and frameworks like Tailwind, LLMs can now generate functional, aesthetically pleasing UI elements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This capability is not just translating design concepts into code; it’s also doing it with an awareness of the latest trends, applying best practices, and leveraging existing frameworks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a developer, you may be wondering how deep this “translation” goes: Does it replicate only the style, but not the substance? What about the interactions that can’t quite be conveyed using static assets? If I design a login page, does the code generation know that I want to use a service like <a href="https://clerk.com/">Clerk</a>, or components from<a href="https://react.email/"> React Email</a>? <br>
<br>
Today, most solutions are centered around replicating the visual style. Although, as more component-as-service companies mature, or coding agents like <a href="https://www.cognition-labs.com/introducing-devin">Devin</a> proliferate, it will be possible to directly integrate with well-defined functionalities and React libraries, further completing the cycle of design to functional apps. Especially if the problem is well-scoped or includes common UI elements, we may see fine-tuned models directly addressing the functionalities of these workflows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use cases like authentication, user management, sending emails, notification, documentation, and display charts are common across most business applications. Thanks to vertically integrated components like Clerk, Mintlify, Knock, React Email (Resend), and Tremor, LLMs could leverage these ready-to-use components and generate UIs deeply integrated with the backend systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Solving-for-Design-to-Code.png"></a></p>
 Solving for code generation 
<p>Design mock-ups and their implementations are never 1:1, which is why static mock-ups can only represent a limited set of information about what the eventual design should look like. When an engineer implements this design, they need to fill in the blanks on the feasibility and interaction dynamics, as well as aesthetics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why many teams who want to move fast choose to treat code as the source-of-truths when designing new UIs: These teams translate design concepts into functional prototypes right from the start, transforming design problems into coding problems. This approach is especially beneficial for interaction-heavy products, or for projects that need fast iteration and testing. While this approach can never be as systematized, detail-oriented, or polished, it is uniquely fit for fast-moving startups or developer tools. By skipping certain design steps, LLMs can pull in relevant parts of an app with pre-existing component systems, making iterations on the final product much faster.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The market is still in its early days for solving the outlined problems, and it’s yet to be seen whether code generation with design scaffolding will be the answer; but we’re able to see products like V0, MagicPatterns, RapidPages, and others taking the first principled attempt at solving this problem.&nbsp;</p>
  Envisioning the future: dynamic and adaptive UI through generative AI 
<p>Beyond cool technology and efficiency gains for developers and designers, there also are some exciting advances in new software interfaces leveraging dynamic UI generation.&nbsp;</p>
 State-based dynamic UI 
<p>For example, existing interfaces are often direct reflections of the business logic. Although there is user-based A/B testing, the tests are hardcoded and require a lot of human intervention to set up and monitor. The ability of LLMs to reason and use tools is changing this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We often hear the question: “What’s the right interface to interact with an LLM?” But the flipside of this question is more interesting in the realm of UI/UX design: “What data do we need to give to LLMs so they become the most helpful in deciding which existing interfaces to serve?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Vercel’s AI SDK, for instance, the component surfaced in the chat is a choice made by the LLM on application state. If the user needs to change a flight, it will respond with the right component for selecting new flights.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Flight-UI.png"></a></p>
<p>Another example is<a href="https://docs.coframe.ai/docs/"> Coframe’s implementation of dynamic-image and text-variant serving</a>. The smallest atomic elements in a web app are texts and images, and LLMs and image models are great at creating variations for both. In this flow, an LLM determines when to serve a variant (either generated text or image) based on the live data it has access to, and as a result helps optimize website performance.&nbsp;</p>
 <a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Multimodal-Starter-Kit.png"></a><p>Using <a href="https://coframe.ai/">Coframe</a> to dynamically update the tagline for the <a href="https://github.com/tigrisdata-community/multi-modal-starter-kit">multi-modal starter kit</a>.</p> 
<p>Both examples above are the UI version of “<a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling">function calling</a>”: UI components are essentially functions, and are giving LLMs a visual state space to explore and reason about. This is the first step in formalizing what dynamic UI could look like in the near future and sets the stage for more customization on the component level later on: from the smallest unit of text/images, to fully adapting an interface based on user persona, state, device, and environment constraints.</p>
 Fully adaptive software interfaces 
<p>However, today’s dynamically served UI still requires hardcoded component state in order to ensure accuracy and aesthetics. Adaptive UI is on the other end of the spectrum, generating an interface that’s fully adapted to users’ needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/From-static-UI-to-adaptive-UI.png"></a></p>
<p>Anyone who’s touched Salesforce or Netsuite, for example, is familiar with the endless tabs and fields. And they’re crowding the screen more as the workflow becomes more complex. It’s not an exaggeration to say most enterprise software is a reflection of the underlying database schema, and each read and write requires its own screen asset.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Endless-Tabs.png"></a></p>
<p>In a world where the UI is adaptive to the user’s intention, interfaces could become just-in-time composition of components through a simple prompt, or inferred from prior actions, rather than navigating through nested menus and fields. An example like below, in a context aware CRM, where the user prompts “input an opportunity for a lead”, the UI could pre-select answers and redact unnecessary fields to make the workflow more streamlined.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Sales-CRM.png"></a></p>
<p>The impact of such adaptive UI would be profound to all stages of a customer journey. For new users, it shortens the lengthy onboarding and training process, leading to instant aha moments and value recognition. For power users, it streamlines the multiple screens and dozens of clicks to complete a multi-step workflow. What’s even more interesting as a thought exercise is the impact to the browser automation industry: As the fixed bounding boxes go away, the workflow will need to be driven by the semantic meanings behind each component instead of simple DOM-level controls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To take it a step further, for certain apps where the API and data model are fixed, the user interface can largely be inferred instead of designed. This is most common for internal applications, where most operations are CRUD into an existing database, and where the primary goals of the interface are to control and validate data types, as well as to control access. Existing no-code apps such as Airtable or Smartsheet are turning data tables into CRUD apps that have implemented this with a pure rule-based approach, but AI advances are certainly taking application development to the next level.&nbsp;</p>
  The road ahead 
<p>The application of generative UI in day-to-day software is still in its infancy stage. However, we have seen enough examples put out by Vercel, Galileo, Coframe, and others to know the future is near. What makes this wave of generative UI so exciting is not only the behavior change we have seen among engineers and designers, but also the technologies that enable these changes and create future possibilities:&nbsp;</p>
 
 One capability that excites us the most is the advancement in multi-modal models: We now know that the models are capable of aligning what they see visually into languages (including code, which is a formal language), and this mirrors what human design engineers do. They have an idea of what to design in their brain, and then flesh out the detailed implementations using code. We believe that the models trained on multi-modal data will play a more central role in deciding from what to generate, how to edit, and to what to serve.&nbsp; 
 While coding up AI-tamago, one interesting problem to solve was teaching an LLM to generate frames of ASCII animations — this led us to find research like <a href="https://wordasimage.github.io/Word-As-Image-Page/">Word-as-Images</a> that explored the generation of words as image illustrations directly in vector format. In this case, they employed a text-to-image diffusion model (VLM) to offer visual feedback that may be overlooked by LLMs. This line of work could be applied to UI generation, too, given that one could find a balance point between well-scoped diffusion-based generation and a formal frontend programming language.&nbsp; 
 Lastly, aesthetically pleasing code generation is one of the rare problems that naturally has tons of structured and high-quality data to pull from. There are great examples like Tailwind, Chakra UI, and other framework-specific, well-made templates on the internet, and the generated result could potentially provide the abstraction for the framework-specific code. The future could look like model-based generations with structured code underneath, much like today’s frontend frameworks abstract away the lower-level APIs.&nbsp;

<p>This article explores the critical role of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and other advanced privacy tools in safeguarding user privacy within the burgeoning Web3 landscape, addressing the inherent transparency of blockchain technology and introducing next-generation solutions for scalable, privacy-focused blockchain applications.&nbsp;</p><p>Although blockchain’s benefits are undeniable, the decentralized and immutable nature of open blockchain’s record-keeping creates unique privacy challenges. Blockchain's transparency means that transactions are permanently recorded and viewable by anyone. While this promotes trust and accountability, it also poses significant risks to personal privacy if identities can be linked to public addresses and can expose trading strategies for professional investors and other successful traders. Additionally, integrating decentralized applications (dApps) with these technologies further complicates the privacy landscape, as user interactions on one platform can be traced across multiple platforms and transactions.</p><p>To address these privacy challenges, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) emerge as a potent solution, allowing transaction validation without compromising private data. ZKPs, such as<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zk-snarks-vs-zk-starks-differences-in-zero-knowledge-technologies/"> zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs</a>, are cryptographic methods that allow the validation of transactions without revealing any underlying data, playing a crucial role in maintaining privacy on the blockchain.</p><p>Beyond enhancing privacy, ZKP technology can be instrumental in DeFi contexts, where it ensures that financial transactions remain confidential yet verifiable, believed to be the key to fostering trust and participation in open financial ecosystems. The technology can make transactions more private, ensuring that while the integrity and rules of the transaction are publicly verifiable, the specifics of the amounts and the parties involved in the transaction remain private.</p><p>Relative to non-succinct privacy-preserving proofs, zk-SNARKs can make for more scalable projects compared with, for example, non-succint alternatives such as zk-STARKs. By enabling transaction validation without disclosing or processing extensive data on the blockchain, zk-SNARK technology can be implemented in ways that lessen the network burden. Ultimately the result is a more efficient blockchain, potentially increasing transaction throughput and enhancing overall performance.</p> Other privacy-preserving technologies <p>While ZKPs are pivotal, a broad array of privacy-preserving technologies, including Homomorphic Encryption and Secure Multi-Party Computation that are available for Web3 developers:</p>  ​​Homomorphic encryption: Enables computations on encrypted data, ensuring data privacy even during processing.  Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC): Allows multiple parties to jointly compute a function while keeping their inputs private.  Decentralized identifiers (DIDs): DIDs allow individuals to control and verify their identity independently of a central authority, enhancing privacy and control over personal identity data.  Blockchain sharding: Although its primary function is to help scale networks, by dividing the entire blockchain into smaller partitions known as shards, privacy is enhanced by limiting the data each node can access.  Differential privacy: Integrating differential privacy techniques into blockchain applications can add noise to aggregated data, making it difficult to identify individual users while maintaining the utility of the data.  Confidential smart contracts: Leveraging cryptographic techniques to execute smart contracts confidentially ensures that the data within these contracts is not exposed to other network participants.   Tools for enhancing privacy in Web3 <p>The development of these foundational technologies paves the way for practical, user-facing privacy tools in Web3, ranging from enhanced wallets to comprehensive on-chain and off-chain solutions. Some of these tools include:</p>  Privacy-enhancing wallets: These wallets integrate features like stealth addresses and ring signatures to conceal user identities.  On-chain privacy protocols: On-chain privacy protocols like the one Panther Protocol is developing will use zk-SNARK and other privacy technologies to conduct private transactions on public blockchains while preserving privacy.  Off-chain privacy solutions: Off-chain solutions like the Lightning Network for Bitcoin or Raiden Network for Ethereum help scale transactions off the main chain while improving privacy by reducing the on-chain footprint.  Data protection tools: Tools like NuCypher use proxy re-encryption and SMPC to secure shared data among multiple participants without exposing the raw data to external parties.   Conclusion <p>Web3 aims to revolutionize online interactions by emphasizing privacy and control over personal data, while still maintaining the inherent benefits that transparent blockchain technology brings. As this technology advances, it’s critical to develop tools that uphold privacy without compromising transparency. This balancing act involves both innovative technological solutions and stringent regulatory measures, ensuring Web3 can offer transparent yet secure digital environments.</p> For more information about privacy-preserving technologies <p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/a-deep-dive-into-secure-multi-party-computation-mpc/">A Deep Dive Into Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)</a></p><p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/threshold-cryptography-an-overview/">Threshold Cryptography, MPC, and MultiSigs: A Complete Overview</a></p><p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bulletproofs-in-crypto-an-introduction-to-a-non-interactive-zk-proof/">Bulletproofs In Crypto – An introduction to a Non-Interactive ZKP</a></p><p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zk-snarks-vs-zk-starks-differences-in-zero-knowledge-technologies/">zk-SNARKs vs zk-STARKs: Comparing Zero-knowledge Proofs</a></p><p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-a-zero-knowledge-proof-example-explaining-zkps/">What is a zero-knowledge proof?

  Here’s a math puzzle: A good salesperson can sell 50 widgets a year, earns $100,000 a year, and will not take a pay cut.

<p>Here’s a math puzzle:</p>
<p>A good salesperson can sell 50 widgets a year, earns $100,000 a year, and will not take a pay cut.</p>
<p>A company has an amazing new widget that needs to be sold (people will not find it on their own/aren’t looking for it).</p>
<p>Prospective customers of this company’s new widget will happily pay $500/year, but not a dollar more.</p>
<p>How will this company do?</p>
<p>To quote Mean Girls: “The limit does not exist!” Or, more accurately, the company cannot exist. A $20 product can work with a product-led growth strategy (think Dropbox, OpenAI, Midjourney, etc). A $1M product can work with an outside sales strategy (think Workday, ServiceNow, Databricks, etc). A $500 sales-led product normally cannot exist. Maybe it should exist, but it’s truly the “dead zone” of products. You can’t charge enough to support your sales team, much less the other fixed costs of the business.</p>
<p>There’s a whole category of AI tools that are fast-growing and everyone is rightfully excited about. AI music generation, website creation, support, and more…not to mention the vertical categories of AI lawyers, AI nurses, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But there’s likely a whole category of non-AI companies and products that can FINALLY exist because of the productivity gains of AI.</p>
<p>AI will help sell your widget.</p>
<p>AI will provide 24/7 support for your widget.</p>
<p>AI will help <a href="https://a16z.com/7-ways-ai-native-companies-can-improve-retention/">retain people</a> for your widget.</p>
<p>In venture capital, we always ask ourselves “why now?” If this is such a great idea, why didn’t it exist 5 or 10 years ago? The “why now” for something like Uber was the smartphone, the “why now” for something like Workday was acceptance of the Cloud, the “why now” for something like Adobe was the proliferation of the GUI PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Business models that were previously tried but didn’t work because of high support costs, sales costs, etc…might have found a “why now” in the dramatically new cost structure of AI tools.</p>
<p>There’s no question that AI will save incumbents money — <a href="https://a16z.com/financial-opportunity-of-ai/">along the lines of the Known Knowns here</a>. But AI will likely spawn more classic software companies and marketplaces where AI isn’t the primary “offering,” but rather allows for a sustainable business to exist at a price point that consumers are willing to pay.</p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of Zebra v1.7.0. With this release we have added a number of usability improvements, bug fixes and new features.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zebra now supports Regtest without proof-of-work validation. In order to support regtest network mode in Zebra, we have started to include some functionality to enable the creation of new networks with a configurable set of parameters.</p>



<p>We made changes that will allow Zebra nodes behind firewalls contribute to the P2P network by using the external address to communicate with peers. We have additionally made updates to ensure that zebra can build and run on Windows as a <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/target-tier-policies.html#tier-2-platform-policy">Tier 2 supported platform</a>.</p>



<p>This release fixes a bug with the <code>z_get_treestate</code> RPC method which could potentially return data from different blocks and we have fixed a panic when the elasticsearch feature is enabled without a backing elasticsearch server.</p>



<p>Finally, we adjusted the Zebra release interval from 2 weeks to approximately 6 weeks, to match Rust stable release cadence.</p>

<p>The initial scaling roadmap for Ethereum featured execution layer sharding. However, the rapid advancements of layer 2 scaling solutions in general, and zero knowledge proofs in particular, caused a restructuring of the original plan. The reason was that rollups would have required less changes made to Ethereum’s base layer, hence lower risks. On the other hand, Near Protocol was designed from the ground up as a sharded system, capable of withstanding billions of transactions simultaneously, without sacrificing decentralisation or security.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Illia’s &amp; Alex’s backgrounds  Sharding and blockchain scalability  Challenges of building a sharded blockchain  Near namespace  Shard security &amp; validator sampling  Stateless validation and data availability  State witnesses and chunk producers  Block production  Shards vs. Rollups  How Near could further improve  Leaderless chunk production  Chain abstraction  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ilblackdragon">Illia Polosukhin on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/alexskidanov">Alex Skidanov on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/NEARProtocol">Near Protocol on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

We are starting with a smaller number of alpha users to smooth out operations before inviting more users as things progress.

Eventually all users will be able to pay for NymVPN in Bitcoin, NYM, and even normal credit cards will be rolled&nbsp;out.</p> Platform availability <p>NymVPN alpha is currently compatible with <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/download/linux">Linux</a>, <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/download/macos">macOS</a>, <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/download/android">Android</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/download/windows">Windows</a>.</p><p>iOS capabilities will be available in coming&nbsp;weeks.</p> Alpha features <p>Alpha users can test out the key privacy features of NymVPN. These will be improved upon and supplemented by more robust add-ons in the full launch. Alpha features&nbsp;include:</p>  2-hop dVPN mode, which in coming days will be powered by WireGuard, for fast and robust everyday privacy, ideal for browsing, streaming, and data&nbsp;sharing  Noise generating 5-hop mixnet mode for advanced privacy, best for messaging and&nbsp;payments  Currently 750+ nodes and gateways in over 25 countries, and many more to come, all operated by the decentralized community of Nym operators  <p>Users can get assistance in using alpha at Nym’s new <a href="https://support.nymvpn.com">help&nbsp;center</a>.</p> What to expect from NymVPN’s full&nbsp;launch <p>The full launch of NymVPN is projected for late summer to fall 2024. NymVPN will be a paid version with a robust set of additional features:</p>  Security features like a killswitch to prevent data&nbsp;leaks  A more robust and pressure-tested mainnet&nbsp;network  A variety of payment options, including debit cards and crypto (including NYM)  Unlinkability of user payments with their online activity thanks to&nbsp;zk-nyms  Split tunneling configurations   What’s next <p>NymVPN is the first mass-market product for normal people to be built upon the <a href="https://nymtech.net/about/mixnet">Nym mixnet</a>. This has been possible through the community involvement which makes up the network. Rather than relying on the servers of private companies, Nym mixnet owes a lot to the passionate advocates who function as its node operators, alpha testers, and coming beta&nbsp;users.</p><p>In the meantime, even if you’re not able to be part of the alpha test for whatever reason, help us spread the word about&nbsp;Nym.</p><p>Keep an eye on Nym socials for more news related to the full launch this year, and the Nym blogs for information on the benefits of choosing a noise-generating mixnet over standard&nbsp;VPN.</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#general:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nymvpn-alpha-private-testing-has-begun-6bdb6f130eb5">NymVPN alpha private testing has begun</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Partnering with Apex Security: The AI-Empowered Future, Secured  <p>Matan, Tomer and their team are helping AI dreams come true—by preventing security teams’ worst nightmares.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bogomil-balkansky/">Bogomil Balkansky</a>	 



Published May 2, 2024
  



Apex Security co-founders Tomer Avni and Matan Derman in the Sequoia London Office.



 
<p>As the old saying goes, in the midst of every crisis is an opportunity. But in technology, the reverse is often true, as well: every opportunity also creates a crisis. AI is undoubtedly a generational opportunity—a force multiplier for productivity that has quickly become essential for teams to compete, with ChatGPT already in use by at least <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openais-altman-pitches-chatgpt-enterprise-large-firms-including-some-microsoft-2024-04-12/#:~:text=They%20noted%20the%20consumer%20version,92%25%20of%20Fortune%20500%20companies.">92% of the Fortune 500</a>. But AI is also a force multiplier for malicious actors, creating new vectors, and lowering the barrier, for mounting attacks. While the rest of us dream about what AI will enable for the future of our work, security teams are growing increasingly concerned about evolving—and ever-more sophisticated—threats.</p>



<p>When the age of generative AI services began in late 2022, the initial worry—no surprise, considering security professionals’ long-standing dedication to data loss prevention (DLP)—was that sensitive corporate data would leak. In many cases, existing DLP tools proved up to the task. But the focus quickly shifted from the inputs of third-party gen AI tools to their outputs. How, for example, do you ensure that the code generated by your copilot, and then woven into your corporate fabric, does not bring with it compromised open-source dependencies or other vulnerabilities? And beyond these “known unknowns” of gen AI security, there are many unknown unknowns—security risks we’ve yet to imagine.</p>



<p><a href="https://apexhq.ai/">Apex Security</a> was founded to address those concerns. By providing real-time detection, investigation and response to the cyberattacks that target AI platforms, Apex helps teams resolve the tension between leveraging transformative AI innovations and ensuring robust protection against risks. We get to use our favorite AI tools and models, and security teams get peace of mind.</p>



<p>Co-founders Matan Derman and Tomer Avni are the perfect team for the job. Matan graduated from Stanford GSB and the prestigious leadership training program of the Israeli Defense Forces, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talpiot_program">Talpiot</a>, where alumni also include founders of Sequoia companies Wiz, Cyera, Oasis Security and Zafran.&nbsp; Tomer hails from Harvard Business School and MIT. The two met while working at the elite IDF intelligence unit 8200.</p>



<p>Now, Matan and Tomer are putting what they learned through that work, and through dozens of conversations with security executives, into Apex Security. The platform gives security teams full visibility into their organizations’ AI activity, allows them to set and enforce policies around that usage, and monitors both the inputs and outputs of gen AI services, detecting and responding to attacks. It’s become a crucial security layer for AI applications and LLMs used by customers including Fortune 500 companies.</p>



Tomer, Bogomil and Matan at Arc.



<p>It has been a pleasure to get to know Matan and Tomer over the past year as we welcomed them to <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/arc/">Arc</a>, Sequoia’s immersion for pre-seed and seed-stage founders, and as they built on Apex Security’s early success. We are proud to lead their seed round and to support them as they continue to grow their product and their team, empowering the companies of the future to swiftly and securely embrace the power of AI.</p>

<p>1-Please tell us a little bit about yourself.</p><p>Am not shy or modest, but honestly feel anything related to blockchain, decentralization and DAOs is not about an individual, least of all me. But can best be described as literally one of the dinosaurs of the ecosystem. Have an interest in almost anything I don’t understand which is probably how I got into blockchain! Apart from new technology I love (random order) travelling, company of friends and family, food, something to wash the food down with, art, politics, economy, society and sports. A moment of happiness is when coming home after a trip crashing on the couch with a cheese sandwich.</p><p>2- When and why did you get into cryptocurrency?</p><p>This is a bit of a fluid answer I have noticed, and can change depending on setting. Guess we all like to think we were part of the “smart few” who joined early. Reminds me a bit of when people speak about epic events and stuff: 10 million people claim to have attended Woodstock, yet only 10,000 actually did…. So, there’s that! Anyway, my interested started when Bitcoin tipped $ 100 and thought, well there must be something in it. The actually journey of reading up on blockchain, decentralization and thinking of the wider implications started in 2015. Think the ICO boom of 2017 made me first question and challenge the crypto community and started to make me the decentralization and privacy advocate I am&nbsp;today.</p><p>3- Why the interest in&nbsp;DAOs?</p><p>For me blockchain has always been much, much more than a technology. I always see it as a social fabric, a new way on organizing and managing cooperation. That cooperation I see in a wide context: between organizations, people, computers and a mixture thereof. In a way you could say that after launching the blockchain, the chain will look after itself. People not so much as history shows us regularly. To me the DAO is the core of that cooperation, there where the social aspect of the project comes alive. Perhaps better said as there where community demand meets community supply. And that social aspect can be anything really: cooperation, participation, engagement, involvement in any shape or form YOU choose, be it active, passive, one-off, continuous. That this is possible I find extraordinary, and something that is really missed in today’s society. Say you are really passionate about a specific topic. To express that you need to get involved in an NGO, special interest group, political movement etc. That is a massive hurdle, and assuming you can take that hurdle it is questionable if you can actually voice your thoughts and provide input. And, literally, at what cost? That is where the DAO distinguishes itself, as it provides a vehicle that is permissionless in many, many ways. My passion is to ensure we keep this part of blockchain not only alive but also make sure we develop it into something that meets and suits demand of the ecosystem now and in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>4- Hans, could you share some insights into how PIVX has embraced the DAO model and how it has impacted the project’s governance and decision-making processes?</p><p>To me the crux of a project is how and when decentralization is embraced. Very important to me is that it is not an afterthought, but has been put centre stage from inception. That is something we see in Bitcoin — still a great standard — but luckily also in many other projects, PIVX included. Personally I also believe an important component of a true DAO is to not try to invent the wheel all over again, and to not make it depending on specific people. That is also something PIVX has embraced, and by doing so set a new standard in the ecosystem. An important part of a DAO is governance and specifically its decision making process. That is a bit of an Achilles heel for many projects. Who can vote, who can table an idea, where comes the funding from? In PIVX everyone can develop a proposal, and that is being voted on by the masternode holders. That is in my view still an issue, as I would love to lower that barrier and be able to include an even wider community to decision making. The “1 Coin 1 Vote” system which PIVX uses a variance of is flawed in that sense, but also seems to be what we have for the moment. To me the low key approach and the wide accessibility of the DAO is what keeps me involved.</p><p>5 — What are some notable features or characteristics of PIVX as a DAO that sets it apart from other cryptocurrency projects?</p><p>The route PIVX has chosen — community designed governance — is very close to my heart, and again industry leading. PIVX was very lucky to have really smart people making really smart decision when created. In case you are wondering, no, that wasn’t me: I wish! Community designed governance (CDG) is a decentralized form of governance, where decisions that affect the blockchain and the community are made in a decentralized way. That means anyone can make a proposal, express their thoughts, check the validity and necessity of a proposal making everyone a stakeholder if you choose to be one. But although we sometimes thing governance equals decision making, CDG is much more than decision making. It is a way in where values, beliefs and thoughts come together. Perhaps it can be described as that what gives a face to PIVX. In the simplest terms to me the most notable feature it is Proof of Community.</p><p>6- How has PIVX leveraged the DAO structure to foster community involvement and ownership?</p><p>The already mentioned community aspect of governance combined with the funding structure of PIVX creates an environment that allows wide participation. That is a crucial condition for any project I would say, and often overlooked. Compare this to the corporate world where a company says the customer is key but there is no way to contact them if I want. The infrastructure, the environment needs to be okay first and foremost. PIVX has done that from the onset. Another important component is collectivism: we are all in this because we value decentralization, privacy and feel an alternative tool is needed to facilitate transactions. That collectiveness is a strength for PIVX and is also reflected in the DAO. How else can you have a project operating so successfully by community that is geographically dispersed, often doesn’t each other’s real names, or has ever met each other in person for so many years? That is Proof of Community in&nbsp;actions.</p><p>7 -Given your respective interests and expertise in blockchain, decentralization, and governance, what initially sparked your interest in DAOs and why do you believe they hold significant importance in the evolution of the crypto industry and&nbsp;beyond?</p><p>The DAO isn’t only the face of the project it is also the heart and soul of it. And the DAO needs to be treated as your body: use it or lose it! That sounds like a cheap one-liner, but that is far from my intention. The Proof of Community aspect is something I value, cherish and want to protect and preserve. That combined with my strong personal belief that blockchain is much more than technology alone made me and keeps me involved. I believe that today’s world and society — perhaps better said our way of cooperation, including the current state of democracy — needs a new, fresh approach. Going back to basic way of cooperating, just you and I, peer to peer, making and living by decentralization, only organizing there where it makes sense, is probably something we could use. The good old coop for instance has addressed and successfully resolved many societal issues in the past like housing, financial inclusion and independence and labor issues. It is in that sense also good to realize decentralization isn’t a new and revolutionary movement but is a useful and proven concept combined with technology. That is exciting, and I want to be part of&nbsp;that.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/pivx-perspectives-spotlight-shines-on-hans-koning-dao-specialist-and-pivx-advisor-aa1650ff170b">PIVX Perspectives Spotlight Shines on Hans Koning, DAO Specialist and PIVX advisor.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Alexandria Unveiled — Shade&nbsp;v2.1 <a href="https://app.shadeprotocol.io/">https://app.shadeprotocol.io/</a><p>Greetings community,</p><p>At Shade Protocol we build Unstoppable Finance — a world of DeFi that is globally accessible, censorship resistant, privacy-preserving, and easy to use. We believe that privacy is the key to unlocking the full value of a decentralized future. Without privacy, we fail to achieve what DeFi is fully capable&nbsp;of.</p><blockquote>Your Money.</blockquote><blockquote>Your Data.</blockquote><blockquote>Your Decisions.</blockquote><p>Shade Protocol has existed for 2+ years — collectively achieving over $350M+ of trading volume on ShadeSwap, 40M+ TVL (at peak), with thousand of daily smart contract interactions.</p><p>As referenced in <a href="https://medium.com/@shadeprotocoldevs/the-preamble-road-to-easy-private-defi-b5852fd4e3a2">The Preamble — Road to Easy Private DeFi</a> we have set our eyes on making Shade Protocol the easiest to use private DeFi in all of Web3. Additionally, after much user feedback we have decided to begin bundling multiple features and utilities into single upgrades, empowering upgrade packages to be more meaningful and easier to explain to&nbsp;users.</p> The Upgrade <blockquote>ALEXANDRIA Upgrade will be released June 18th, 2024 at 8:00 pm. GMT&nbsp;+0</blockquote> 1. Analytics Tab - (TVL, Volume, # of trades, fees accrued, PoL, etc.)<br>2. Prices Tab - (historical candlestick charts / line charts / etc.)<br>3. dSHD - (private liquid staking for SHD)<br>4. Silk Analytics V2 - (SILK peg performance, basket performance, etc.)<br>5. New pools - (dSHD/USDC, dSHD/SHD, etc.)<br>6. New SILK collaterals <br>7. Shade Spartan NFTs <p>The next upgrade after Alexandria will be released September 18th, 2024. The name of the next upgrade bundle has yet to be revealed, nor has its features.</p> Analytics Overhaul Early stages of Silk Analytics V2<p>Across the Shade Protocol suite there are countless pieces of protocol data forming a story that has been previously untold. Information such as Silk collateral backing, peg performance data, protocol wide TVL, volume, # of trades, historical staking APY, etc. The Alexandria Upgrade represents a massive leap forward in visual storytelling — representing half a year of infrastructure overhaul empowering in app story telling that will provide the information and data users need to make informed decisions.</p><p>One of the key principles that drive Shade Protocol design decisions is a simple modicum: “…don’t make the user leave the&nbsp;app…”</p><p>As we investigated where users are spending their time to make decisions, we realized that block explorers and Coingecko are the two destinations where many users camp out. With the release of the Shade Protocol transaction history, one of these problem was solved (block explorer).</p><p>This left us with the need to create an in-app Coingecko esque experience:</p>Early stage implementation…imagine mainnet / June&nbsp;18th<p>You can expect with the release of Alexandria to have the ability to seamlessly scroll through price charts &amp; price tables similar to Coingecko — empowering you to make decisions on the fly without needing to open another&nbsp;tab.</p><p>One could even imagine what an overhauled ShadeSwap experience could like in the future with these new features intertwined.</p> dSHD — Private $SHD Liquid&nbsp;Staking <p>One of the key decisions users have had to choose while interacting with Shade Protocol is between the choice to stake or become a liquidity provider with their SHD tokens. With the launch of dSHD, users will be able to enjoy yield from both liquidity providing &amp; from staking — unlocking new DeFi strategies and flexibility previously impossible.</p><p>dSHD represents the first ever LST for a natively private token; yet another first for Shade Protocol. You can expect major pools to be spun up such&nbsp;as:</p>  dSHD /&nbsp;SHD  dSHD/ USDC.noble  <p>Additionally, Shade Protocol is looking to integrate dSHD into a variety of other DeFi protocols throughout the Cosmos — setting up SHD to become the apex private omnichain asset.</p> Ancient Greek&nbsp;Theme <p>The parallels between Greek society, the historical city of Alexandria, and the ethos of Shade Protocol are intriguing and rich with significance. Just as ancient Greece was a hub for innovation, philosophy, and intellectual exchange, Alexandria stood as a beacon of knowledge, blending cultures and fostering groundbreaking advancements in various fields. Similarly, Shade Protocol embodies a commitment to innovation and progress within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, mirroring the spirit of exploration and discovery that defined ancient Alexandria.</p><p>The city of Alexandria served as a melting pot for ideas and culture. Similarly, Shade Protocol embraces the free market of ideas — aiming to build a global ecosystem where financial autonomy is not just a possibility, but a reality for all. Through its upcoming Alexandria bundle release and beyond, Shade Protocol continues to forge a path towards a more equitable and decentralized future, echoing the legacy of the great civilizations that came before&nbsp;it.</p> Shade Spartan “300” NFT&nbsp;Launch Example NFT<p>The launch of the legendary 300 Spartans is set for May 2024 on Stashh — the whitelist (for a randomized chance to be part of the mint) has begun to be developed.</p><p>Curious on how to join the whitelist? Keep your eyes peeled for the following:</p>  Free badge&nbsp;mints  Social media&nbsp;tasks  Telegram &amp; discord active user account selection  <p>Are you an active community member? Your work shall be noticed,&nbsp;Spartan.</p><blockquote>We believe in protecting “Your Money. Your Data. Your Decisions.”</blockquote><blockquote>Those who hold Shade Spartans are participants in the fight against centralization, censorship, and digital encroachment.</blockquote><blockquote>We are the tip of the spear.<br>We are the protectors of privacy.<br>We are Spartans.</blockquote><blockquote>Don’t give them an&nbsp;inch.</blockquote><p><a href="https://stashh.io/collection/shade-spartans/badges?show_templates=true">Stashh - Where Creators and Collectors Connect</a></p> Syracuse 0.1 — “The Floating&nbsp;City” <p>In addition to regularly scheduled bundle upgrades, Shade Protocol will now be releasing monthly Syracuse upgrades starting with 0.1— these are quality of life changes to the Shade Protocol app, smart contracts, &amp; infrastructure that are outside of the scope of official upgrade&nbsp;bundles.</p><p>The first Syracuse release (0.1) is set for June 2nd,&nbsp;2024.</p> Conclusion <p>In conclusion, the unveiling of Alexandria and the upcoming launch of Shade Spartan NFTs mark significant milestones in Shade Protocol’s journey towards revolutionizing decentralized finance. Inspired by the legacy of ancient Alexandria and the valor of the Spartans, Shade Protocol stands as a beacon of innovation and financial autonomy in the decentralized landscape.</p><p>With its commitment to privacy, ease of use, and continuous improvement through Syracuse upgrades, Shade Protocol is not only shaping the future of DeFi but also empowering individuals to reclaim control over their finances and data. As the community eagerly anticipates the release of Alexandria and beyond, Shade Protocol remains dedicated to its mission of building an unstoppable, decentralized financial ecosystem for&nbsp;all.</p><p>Website: <a href="http://app.shadeprotocol.io">app.shadeprotocol.io</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/Shade_Protocol">https://twitter.com/Shade_Protocol</a></p>

<p>In today’s episode, Matt Prewitt engages in a thought-provoking dialogue with Tahir Amin, the Co-Founder and CEO of the Initiative for Medicines, Access, and Knowledge (I-MAK). Together, they delve into the history of the patent and trademark systems – flaws and all, especially within the pharmaceutical realm. Tahir, drawing from his experience as a former intellectual property lawyer turned reform advocate, sheds light on how these systems have been manipulated by large corporations to prolong monopolies rather than foster invention. He proposes substantial reforms to address these systemic issues, advocating for a fundamental restructuring of the patent system. This insightful conversation highlights the complexities and challenges within the patent system and the quest for a more just and equitable approach to intellectual property.</p><p>Links &amp; References:&nbsp;</p><p>References:</p>  <a href="https://www.i-mak.org/">I-MAK</a>  <a href="https://www.wto.org/">World Trade Organization (WTO)</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests">"Battle of Seattle" | 1999 Seattle WTO protests</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_patent_law">History of patent law - Wikipedia</a>  <a href="https://lawliberty.org/forum/why-intellectual-property-rights-a-lockean-justification/">Why Intellectual Property Rights?

        <p>This quick guide is meant to help you go over the simple steps to vote on ZenIPs.</p> FAQ <p>1. How much voting power do I have?</p><p>Your voting power is a sum of the following criteria:</p>  $ZEN in your EON wallet.  $ZEN in your linked mainchain wallet.  The total amount of $ZEN that was delegated to forger nodes from your EON Wallet.  <p>Please note that Horizen uses Snapshot for voting. This means that your voting power will be a total of the items above at a specific block height on EON. If token values change after that specified block height it will not be included in your voting power.&nbsp;</p><p>2. How do I link my mainchain wallet to my EON address?&nbsp;</p><p>Being that many users prefer to keep their $ZEN on Horizen’s mainchain we’ve made it possible to vote on proposals while keeping $ZEN on the mainchain. Please use the following guide to link your mainchain and EON addresses: <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address">https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>3. Do I have to do anything if I stake $ZEN to a forger node to vote on proposals?</p><p>No. As long as you are using the same wallet which was used to delegate stake, your voting power will include all $ZEN that is staked to forger nodes.</p> How do I vote on ZenIPs using my staked $ZEN? <p>Voting is done on Snapshot using Horizen EON.&nbsp;</p>    Go to the Horizen Foundation Snapshot page: <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth</a>  Make sure to join the Horizen Foundation as a member on Snapshot.&nbsp;    Connect your wallet.  Choose a proposal you would like to vote on.  Read through the proposal and look at the possible voting options.&nbsp;  Select a choice, you will be asked to sign a message with your wallet to vote on the proposal (this does not incur any gas fees).    <p>We look forward to the continuous participation of our community and stay tuned as many exciting things are on the Horizen!</p>

<p>As businesses and organisations continue growing and expanding, prioritising environmental sustainability is becoming increasingly important. One way to do this is by implementing blockchain technology into your business. Let’s dive deeper!</p>



<p></p>



 Why Your Business Should Adopt Blockchain for Environmental Sustainability 



<p>Blockchain is a decentralised digital ledger. Blockchain technology allows for the secure recording and verification of transactions without a central authority. This technology can potentially revolutionise how businesses operate, namely by making them more environmentally friendly. By using blockchain to support eco-friendly practices and renewable energy, your business can play a key role in creating a more sustainable future. Outside of the obvious benefits for the environment, it can also <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/02/10/why-corporate-strategies-should-be-focused-on-sustainability/?sh=604551947e9f">help propel your business forward in different ways.</a></p>



<p></p>



 How Blockchain Can Help Your Business Go Green 



<p>Multiple ways exist in which blockchain technology can help your <a href="https://zaisan.io/ebooks/using-blockchain-for-sustainability/">business go green</a>. Summarised below are some of the main ways in which blockchain technology can make an impact:</p>



 
 Tracking and verifying environmentally responsible practices 



 Facilitating the exchange of renewable energy 



 Blockchain-powered waste management systems 



 Creating and managing carbon credits 
 



 Using Blockchain To Track and Verify Environmentally Responsible Practices 



<p>One way that blockchain can help is by enabling the tracking and verification of environmentally responsible practices. For example, by using blockchain technology, a supply chain can track the origin and journey of products, ensuring that they are produced using sustainable methods.</p>



<p>This level of transparency can help consumers make more informed choices about the products they purchase. Moreover, it encourages businesses to adopt eco-friendly practices to maintain their reputation. Additionally, the use of blockchain can help businesses detect and prevent fraud, such as the sale of counterfeit or environmentally damaging products.</p>



<p>In this way, blockchain can help promote environmental responsibility and sustainability within the business community. By enabling more transparent and accountable business practices, blockchain technology can support the development of a more sustainable and environmentally friendly economy.</p>



 Facilitating the Exchange of Renewable Energy Using Blockchain 



<p>Blockchain can also be used to facilitate the exchange of renewable energy. It ensures renewable energy can be tracked, traded, and sold securely and transparently. This can help create a more efficient and reliable renewable energy market, as well as enable individuals and businesses easy access and use renewable energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, the use of smart contracts on the blockchain can automate the process of buying and selling renewable energy. This makes it even more convenient and efficient. Overall, the use of blockchain in the renewable energy industry can greatly accelerate the transition to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly energy system that is less reliant on fossil fuels.</p>



 Using Blockchain To Create and Manage Carbon Credits 



<p>Another way in which blockchain technology can help businesses become more environmentally friendly is by enabling the creation and management of carbon credits. Carbon credits are a way for businesses to offset their carbon emissions by supporting renewable energy projects or other initiatives that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>



Source:<a href="https://www.shell.com/business-customers/trading-and-supply/trading/shell-energy-europe/clean-energy-solutions/voluntary-carbon-credits.html"> Shell </a>



<p>Through blockchain, businesses can create and trade carbon credits transparently and securely. This allows for the efficient and cost-effective management of carbon emissions. It provides businesses with a way to offset their environmental impact. Furthermore, blockchain can help ensure the integrity and verifiability of carbon credits, making it easier for businesses to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability.</p>



<p>Overall, the use of blockchain for carbon credit management can support the transition to a low-carbon economy. Therefore, it can help businesses reduce/offset their environmental impact.</p>



 Blockchain-Powered Waste Management Systems 



<p>In addition to the previous benefits, blockchain technology can also help improve supply chain efficiency, reducing waste and enabling more transparent and accountable business practices through creating decentralised waste management systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a decentralised waste management system, blockchain can be implemented to track and verify the disposal of waste materials. This can help to ensure that waste is disposed of sustainably and responsibly, reducing the environmental impact of waste. Additionally, one can use blockchain technology to incentivise sustainable waste disposal practices, such as recycling and composting. For example, businesses and individuals could be rewarded with tokens or other digital assets for properly disposing of waste.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the use of blockchain can help to improve the efficiency of waste management systems. By securely and transparently tracking waste materials, blockchain can help to reduce waste and prevent fraud, such as the illegal dumping of waste materials. Thus, aiding in making waste management systems more cost-effective and sustainable.</p>







<p></p>



 Blockchains Do Not Have To Consume Tons of Energy 



<p>But what about the energy consumption of blockchains in general? It is true that many blockchain protocols, such as the one used by the Bitcoin network, rely on energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanisms. This means that validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain requires a large amount of computing power. However, it is important to note that not all blockchain protocols operate this way.</p>



<p>There are also blockchain protocols that use different kinds of consensus mechanisms, such as the delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which is much more energy efficient. In a delegated proof-of-stake system, the token holders are constantly voting on “delegates”. The delegates who have the most votes at any certain point in time run the blockchain and validate transactions.</p>



<p>As a result, delegated proof-of-stake systems are much more energy-efficient and scalable than proof-of-work systems. They do not require a large amount of computing power to validate transactions. This makes them a more <a href="https://zaisan.io/solutions/europechain">environmentally friendly and viable option for businesses and organisations</a> that want to use public or private blockchains and require high scalability.</p>



<p></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Implementing blockchain technology into your enterprise may require significant investment and resources. However, the long-term benefits of environmental sustainability and improved efficiency are well worth the effort. By utilising blockchain to support eco-friendly practices and renewable energy, your enterprise can play a key role in creating a more sustainable future.</p>

The Optimism Collective is a group of companies, communities and citizens united by Optimism and committed to building a more open internet by scaling Ethereum’s technology and values. On the tech side, the OP Stack codebase provides an open source, MIT Licensed standard for scaling Ethereum.</p><p>Optimism’s values are driven in part by Retro Funding, an innovative approach to supporting the development of public goods with profits generated by the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Optimism aims to dramatically increase Ethereum’s throughput via L2 scaling, all while maintaining Ethereum’s commitment to security and decentralization. Optimistic roll-ups operate under the assumption that transactions are valid by default, avoiding the need for immediate validity proofs to be computed and committed to the chain. This approach ensures scalability by deferring validation until a transaction is challenged or disputed, offering an efficient solution for processing Ethereum transactions.</p> What does this partnership mean for&nbsp;you? <p>To explore the many privacy-enhancing projects of both Optimism and Nym, and what they can do together, we will be hosting an AMA session on 9 May 2024. You’ll have the opportunity to engage directly with the minds behind the platforms. This is your chance to ask questions, gain insights, and learn more about the exciting developments shaping the future of blockchain technology and online&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>But that’s not all. As a token of our appreciation for the support and enthusiasm of the members of the Optimism ecosystem, users will be granted early access to NymVPN. This cutting-edge VPN offers unparalleled privacy protection, ensuring your online activities remain secure and anonymous.</p> Why NymVPN? <p>NymVPN represents the next generation of privacy tools, designed to empower individuals with control over their digital footprint. Whether you’re browsing the web, accessing sensitive on-chain information, or communicating with others online, NymVPN helps ensure your data remains private and protected.</p><p>With features like a decentralized and zero-knowledge infrastructure, multi-hop default routing, and a robust 5-hop mixnet mode for extra sensitive activities, NymVPN is setting a higher standard for online privacy. In an increasingly connected world where everyone’s user data and privacy are threatened, this could not come at a more urgent time. And now, through our partnership with Optimism Foundation, their users now have the opportunity to experience the future of privacy firsthand.</p> Join us in shaping the future of&nbsp;privacy <p>We invite you to join us on this exciting journey as we explore new frontiers in privacy and security. Be sure to mark your calendars for the upcoming AMA session on 9 May 2024 and stay tuned for more details on how to get early access to&nbsp;NymVPN.</p><p>Together, we’re redefining the way the world views privacy, one partnership at a time.

<p>Long regarded as an impending black swan, Tether has successfully weathered out the contagion and bank runs caused by Luna’s collapse in the depths of the 2022-2023 bearmarket. Since then, a large portion of Tether’s reserves has been shifted to treasury bills, which are the closest dollar proxy, positioning Tether among the top 20 holders of T-bills, worldwide. However, navigating the Tether FUD was not the first rodeo for Paolo Ardoino, as he has also previously led Bitfinex, which successfully recovered after a $72M hack, back in 2016. The worldwide adoption of USDT, especially in emerging markets and developing economies, serves as a testament to Tether’s commitment to create a product with tangible real-life applications.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Paolo’s background  How Bitfinex succeeded  DEX vs. CEX UX  Entrepreneurship and company culture  Founding Tether and its use cases  Expanding Tether’s cross-chain support  Tether’s reserves and long-term vision  Stablecoin wars: BUSD &amp; USDC  Decentralized stablecoins and bank runs  The potential of diversifying physical backing  Holepunch &amp; Keet - the P2P renaissance  Incentivising P2P interactions  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/paoloardoino">Paolo Ardoino on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/tether_to">Tether on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/bitfinex">Bitfinex on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/holepunch_to">Holepunch on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/keet_io">Keet on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>Please tell us a little bit about yourself.</p><p>I’m Cryptosi, from the UK, been in Crypto since 2012 mostly interested in DAOs, Privacy and NFTs. Away from Crypto I’m a huge Arsenal FC fan and enjoy spending endless hours playing video&nbsp;games.</p><p>When and why did you get into cryptocurrency?</p><p>Got into crypto currency in 2012, came across it while delving into different apps on linux and the power of open source software I was looking into the most popular open source projects and I found Bitcoin as one of them, marrying the power of decentralisation with the importance of money was a no brainer and I was immediately hooked.</p><p>Why the interest in&nbsp;DAOs?</p><p>My interest in DAOs formed after the split of PIVX from Dash, I was sure Dash had come to the right decision by prioritising regulatory fears over privacy, but I was frustrated that none of the coin holders were polled infact there still is not any proper ways to poll stakeholders within a network, I’m fascinated by the concepts and opportunities around finding concensus in private and decentralised networks and applications.</p><p>CryptoSi could you share some insights into how PIVX has embraced the DAO model and how it has impacted the project’s governance and decision-making processes?</p><p>PIVX is unique in that its one of the few DAOs in the industry which is truly DAO led, especially now that there is not 1 recognized CORE team. The DAO is self sufficient and has been funding it’s own development for years. There have been some amazing progressions within the DAO itself such as the alliances protocol which remains the only Decentralised partnerships protocol in the world. There is still plenty of work to be done improving the voting model, factors such as one coin one vote and masternode only voting need to be addressed.</p><p>What are some notable features or characteristics of PIVX as a DAO that sets it apart from other cryptocurrency projects?</p><p>The main notable characteristic is the community, as the coin is so well aged the community all have plenty of experience working within a DAO, this means that drama around proposals is thinning out and people are finding ways to identify their common interests and overcome their differences, this is also allowing people who wouldnt usually be found in cutting edge tech startups to thrive, regardless of nationality, age or political leaning, everyone is seemingly gettin a fair crack of the whip within&nbsp;pivx.</p><p>How has PIVX leveraged the DAO structure to foster community involvement and ownership?</p><p>PIVX uses the DAO structure to incentivise engagement from various corners of the globe by funding marketing initiatives and tutorials by people from all over the world, in the past PIVX had a huge translations team and ambassador program which was very successful in fostering grass roots engagement and getting people to bring PIVX into their local communities, this is super evident within the Latam and portuguese communities.</p><p>Given your respective interests and expertise in blockchain, decentralization, and governance, what initially sparked your interest in DAOs and why do you believe they hold significant importance in the evolution of the crypto industry and&nbsp;beyond?</p><p>DAOs are the best way to harness the collective experience and intelligence of the community or the crowd, but also and possibly more importantly they allow a clean and open way to identify stars and mavericks and promote them to powerful positions within the organisation regardless of their so-called ‘experience’, ‘professionalism’ and sometimes purely on their&nbsp;merit.</p><p>Many thanks to Cryptosi for sitting down with leacymck for this interview.</p><p>To learn more about Cryptosi, an awesome former member of PIVX, founder of Bidify.org and co-founder of Smartreach1, please find him on Twitter at Crypto_SI</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/pivx-perspectives-spotlight-shines-on-cryptosi-dao-specialist-da11bffa3188">PIVX Perspectives Spotlight Shines on Cryptosi, DAO Specialist.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p><p>Improvement proposals are made to enhance an existing process, address a challenge, or create a new product or service. Their only goal is improvement. At Horizen we call them ZenIPs or EONIPs, depending on the blockchain to which they pertain. Since September 2023, they are voted on by the community</p>



 From improvement proposals to DAOs 



<p>Improvement proposals can be submitted by anyone in the community: team members, users, or community participants.</p>



<p>Improvement proposals have been part of Horizen’s governance since the project’s inception, but with the launch of Horizen DAO in 2023, public voting on ZenIPs afforded greater community participation in the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This ZenIP process embodies to the spirit of decentralized governance – anyone in the community can submit a proposal, and proposals require sufficient support from the community to be adopted.</p>



<p>However, it is incumbent upon community members to ensure that they have understand the improvement proposal process to wield this power responsibly. This article aims to help everyone understand that process.</p>



 Take part in Horizen 



<p>You have many ways to be included in the Horizen ecosystem. By deploying on <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/">EON</a>, deploying on <a href="https://www.horizen.io/zendoo/">Zendoo</a>, marking PRs on <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial">Github</a>, hosting a <a href="https://www.horizen.io/supernodes/">Super Node</a>, hosting or delegating a <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/staking/run_a_forger_node/">Forger Node</a>, etc.</p>



<p>You can also submit proposals, and vote on proposals already submitted. First, let’s see what you need to do to make a proposal.</p>



<p>The whole process is exhaustively published on <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance">Horizen’s docs website</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2 kinds of proposals can be made:</p>



 
 Technical ZenIP/EONIP 



 Non-techinal ZenIP/EONIP 
 



<p>Technical proposals cover changes involving core technology or the governance of the Horizen DAO, and as such have higher thresholds for submitting proposals and achieving a vote quorum. Non-technical proposals cover everything else, such as grants or making agreements with third-party service providers.</p>



<p>The Horizen Foundation and its partners, such as Horizen Labs, can help build and scope the proposals but don’t need to develop the ideas themselves. If you are proposing a technical ZenIP, make sure you can develop the idea or have it developed after scoping the work.<br>Since <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42401-updating-proposal-and-quorum-thresholds/440?u=manon">ZenIP 42401</a> passed in March 2024, the threshold and quorum are determined as the following:</p>



TypeThreshold (to post)Quorum (vote to pass)ExamplesTechnical100,000 ZEN&nbsp;<br>(previously 200,000)5%<br>(previously 10%)Removal of privacy, mainchain and sidechains improvementsNon-technical25,000 ZEN<br>(previously 100,000)3%<br>(previously 5%)Website branding, next meetups location, grant program



<p></p>



 What are the different phases from the idea to its implementation? 



<p></p>







<p>Phase 1: Proposal Idea and Research</p>



<p>Broadly speaking, the idea stage is intended to introduce an idea for a potential improvement proposal and gauge community sentiment. The idea stage is made of the first three phases of the ZenIP process.</p>



<p>In the first phase, a community member who has an idea for an improvement proposal should research it and verify whether the concept or similar proposals have previously been explored or suggested.</p>



<p>This phase places the onus entirely on the proposer(s). It is strongly advised to support the proposal with relevant sources whenever possible thoroughly.</p>



<p>Phase 2: Idea Modification</p>



<p>Once a proposer has confirmed that the idea has not been proposed and has completed sufficient research, they publish an idea on <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/c/governance/zenip-discussion/6">Discourse</a>. We recommend using the <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip_template.md">ZenIP/EONIP template</a> for this phase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phase 3: Community Feedback</p>



<p>Once an idea is posted on Discourse, the community provides feedback.&nbsp; This phase lasts a minimum of 7 days to ensure sufficient input from other community members. It is important to note that a ZenIP idea is just that – an idea – until put forth as a formal ZenIP.</p>



<p>Phase 4: Proposal Draft Creation</p>



<p>Following the <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip_template.md">template</a>, the idea must be posted on Github or under the <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/c/governance/8">“governance” section on Discourse</a>. In this phase the use of the template is mandatory. The proposal is on the DRAFT status.</p>



<p>Phase 5: Draft Review and Moderator Feedback</p>



<p>The person or people making the proposal have 30 days to answer any moderator’s questions, if any. This delay can be shortened by the moderators.</p>



<p>Phase 6: Administrative Review</p>



<p>The <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-dao-voting-is-open-and-announces-inaugural-special-council-members/">Special Council</a> reviews the proposal, with a maximum of 3 revisions. The DAO Special Council can ask for more clarifications or additional information.</p>



<p>Phase 7: Voting</p>



<p>The vote takes place on <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot</a>, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) voting platform. You’ll need to follow up on the <a href="https://01470710.evm-documentation.pages.dev/governance/overview/constitution">threshold requirements</a> to post the proposal. The status is moved to PROPOSED.</p>



<p>Phase 8: Cooldown Period</p>



<p>A final 30 days phase commences. The proposal undergoes another review to confirm compliance with the Foundation’s Governing Documents and relevant laws.</p>



<p>Phase 9: Implementation</p>



<p>The idea becomes real. If the technical ZenIP/EONIP includes codes implemented on Github, the PR is merged. If the proposal is budget-related, the necessary funds are transferred. Status is either IMPLEMENTED or FINAL if the idea is also activated on the network.</p>



<p>Foundation moderators or DAO members must remain informed and involved throughout.</p>



<p>It’s possible to delegate voting power on Snapshot, when you publish the ZenIP IDEA or DRAFT, you can create a second topic to ask for delegated funds to post the proposal.</p>



 ZenIP naming convention 



<p>The revised ZenIP numbering conventions will use a format starting with “424” followed by two unique, sequential digits. Once the number 42499 is reached, the numbering will continue starting from 42500 onwards. This system ensures a cohesive and orderly sequence for all ZenIPs, maintaining a straightforward approach to their identification and categorization.</p>



<p>For the previous ZenIPs, editors used the following conventions when numbering ZenIPs:</p>



 
 All ZenIP numbers are prefixed with a 42 and followed by three digits. E.g. his very first ZenIP has the number 42000. 



 If a ZenIP directly corresponds to a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) or ZIP (Zcash Improvement Proposal), the same number is used, but without the prefix “42”. 



 Process and Informational ZenIPs will be assigned a number in the range 42000 to 42199. 



 Consensus ZenIPs will be assigned a number in the range 42200 to 42399. 



 Standard Track ZenIPs will be assigned a number in the range 42400 to 42599. 



 ZenIPs that should or will be deployed together will be numbered consecutively (wherever possible), and in a coherent reading order. 
 



<p>These conventions are subject to change by a majority decision of the Editors.</p>



 Express yourself through the vote 



<p>Your vote will be weighted regarding the tokens you hold on the Horizen mainchain (the historic one) and/or the Horizen EON chain (the EVM chain).</p>



<p>The vote happens on Snapshot and is done through MetaMask and therefore via the Horizen EON network.</p>



<p>Before going through the tutorial, we assume that the Horizen EON network is well configured on your MetaMask wallet. If not, <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/connect/connect_your_wallet/">please follow this guide</a>.</p>



<p>If you already linked your address for a previous vote, then it’s very simple.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We still advise you to verify if your mainchain address is well-linked on the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Horizen Governance app</a>.</p>



<p>If your address is not linked, <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-improvement-proposals-how-to-vote-tutorial/">follow the tutorial here</a>.</p>



<p>When linked, just head to <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot on the Horizen governance page</a>, and vote for the proposal when it’s published and available.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.castelion.com/">Castelion</a> is a defense manufacturing company building the systems America and its partners need to keep liberal democracies safe and deter future wars. The company’s first product is a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) for the US Department of Defense. Traditional defense primes such as Lockheed &amp; Raytheon have failed to develop an HGV despite receiving billions of dollars per year in funding for the last 20 years. Meanwhile, China &amp; Russia have developed fully operational HGVs, emboldening them to expand their borders militarily.</p><blockquote>“To counter this growing threat, and to support democracy for generations to come, America’s defense industry needs new technologies, new manufacturing approaches, and new ideas to stay unequivocally ahead. That’s why we founded Castelion — a new kind of defense manufacturing company.”</blockquote><p>The Castelion team comes from SpaceX, where they made substantial contributions, including leading the development of Starlink &amp; Starshield, and billions of dollars in sales to governments.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>Incumbent defense primes will be unable to attract the necessary talent to iterate fast enough to keep up with adversary nations on hypersonic glide vehicles. The SpaceX approach provides the best odds of liberal democracies catching up technologically while also providing venture-scale returns. If Castelion is successful at delivering a cost-effective HGV, they have the potential to apply its development methodology and team to more US Department of Defense capabilities and become a large standalone defense&nbsp;prime.</p><p>We are excited to be backing the Castelion team on their mission to build essential hypersonic deterrence systems to keep democracies safe.

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>As this week wraps up, we’re excited to share our latest news. This week’s update covers the latest updates regarding our ecosystem and testnet development.</p> Ecosystem updates  Alpha Protection Through Privacy: A Web3 privacy primitive for DeFi <p>Did you miss Panther Co-Founder and CEO Oliver Gale’s presentation at last week’s ETHDam conference? Don’t worry, we have you covered. Read our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/alpha-protection-through-privacy-a-web3-privacy-primitive-for-defi/">latest blog</a> for a recap.&nbsp;</p> Panther’s CTO, Anish Mohammed, on Proof of Podcast <p>This week, our Co-Founder and CTO, Anish Mohammed, joined Hake from the <a href="https://twitter.com/ProofOf_Podcast/status/1780734964742390235?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Proof of Podcast </a>to discuss tokenomics design and cryptography.</p> Panther’s CEO, Oliver Gale, at ETH Dam <p>Our Co-Founder and CEO, Oliver Gale, was on the stage at Crypto Canal’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP6LxjQxdIo&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">ETHDam</a> on April 13 to share his insights on alpha protection through privacy for DeFi users.</p> Product updates.  Testnet re-deployment on Ethereum Sepolia <p>As the Mumbai testnet has ceased operations, Panther will deploy the testnet to Ethereum Sepolia network next week. We will publish more details on how to test and receive test rewards on Sepolia in our docs next week.&nbsp;</p> Stage 6 developments <p>Stage 6 of the testnet dApp includes fee management and basic disclosures. Development for Stage 6 is complete and currently under testing. The team plans to release Stage 6 for community testing later this month.&nbsp;</p> Stage 7 development <p>Stage 7 of the testnet dApp includes DeFi swaps, advanced disclosures, other supported assets, and canary deployment (use of real tokens). The team is working on Stage 7 parallel to Stage 6 and Enhancement Stage 2. We are working on UI/UX development and integration with different DeFi tools, including Uniswap, and expects to release Stage 7 for community testing in the first week of May.</p>  About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in Shielded Pools; zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs; and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s Zero-Knowledge primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

<p>Did you miss Panther co-founder and CEO Oliver Gale’s presentation at last week’s ETHDam conference? Don’t worry, we have you covered.&nbsp;</p><p>The session, “Alpha Protection Through Privacy: A Web3 privacy primitive for DeFi,” explored the $2.6T problem of open blockchain privacy and Panther Protocol’s solution. A recap of the presentation follows.&nbsp;</p> Pseudonymity: A $2.6 trillion problem <p>Open ledgers are supposed to be a good thing. They help to ensure that users can’t commit fraud, prevent duplicate transactions, and more. All of these things are true and important, but until now, they have come at the expense of another basic human need: privacy. On pseudonymous blockchains, if a third party can link a wallet address to a user, they can follow, measure, and use the complete transaction history associated with that wallet address. Every transaction.&nbsp;</p><p>This is wrong. Although we recognize blockchain technology’s enormous benefits, financial privacy should be a fundamental human right.&nbsp;</p><p>And it’s a huge problem. Of the approximately $2.6 trillion invested in crypto, all but a relatively tiny amount is on public blockchains.&nbsp;</p> Your Data is YOUR Data <p>The problem with pseudonymous blockchains goes beyond third parties monitoring your spending habits: your data is valuable– and it should be YOUR data. Europe’s <a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> reflects a broader shift in how we perceive ownership of information. Just as it set a benchmark for consumer privacy and control, DeFi users should have ownership of their data both as a personal matter and because there is value in your data.&nbsp;</p><p>This is especially true for high-volume traders and institutions, who risk having others copy their trades, their “alpha,” and their strategy.&nbsp;</p> The “solution” created a new problem. <p>The reaction to this problem to date has been the creation of privacy protocols, which sever the link between wallet and on-chain public ledger, using a variety of technologies. Unfortunately, this causes a new problem: compliance hurdles. Tornado Cash is a prototypical example of how severing the link between the public chain and wallet alone is not a viable solution to privacy. Tornado Cash has been accused of facilitating money laundering and sanctioned by the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">U.S. Treasury</a>, among actions from other regulators. If DeFi is going to welcome a new era of mainstream adoption, it is clear that privacy protocols also need to enable compliance. In fact, regulators, including the U.S. Treasury have specifically <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/DeFi-Risk-Full-Review.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">called this out as a market need</a>.&nbsp;</p> Market requirements for any solution <p>Greenfield Capital’s <a href="https://greenfield.xyz/2023/11/22/reviving-transaction-privacy/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Report on Reviving Transaction Privacy: Approaches To Combat Compliance And Usage Challenges</a> covers this exact issue. In the report, they recognize the enormous potential of removing a major obstacle to mainstream DeFi adoption by enabling compliance and privacy simultaneously. They state that any such solution would need to keep bad actors from abusing the system, especially through KYC, and that it would need to navigate regulatory ambiguity, given that regulatory requirements may vary from one jurisdiction to another, giving the Travel Rule as an example. The Travel Rule is a regulatory mandate by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental organization formed by the G7 to combat money laundering and terrorism financing, which requires cryptocurrency exchanges and other virtual asset service providers to share specific transaction details of the parties involved in transfers​.</p><p>Greenfield also points out that success for any protocol hinges on:&nbsp;</p>  Providing sufficient value relative to any fees associated with its use (keeping gas relatively low).  Ensuring there is a large enough anonymity set to keep transactions private.  Integration with existing DeFi protocols: Users are unlikely to use protocols that don’t enable use across the most popular tokens and chains.&nbsp;   Enter Panther Protocol <p>Panther Protocol will add a privacy layer to blockchain transactions and DeFi applications. Using advanced cryptographic techniques, including zkSNARKs, the protocol will provide users with the ability to preserve their privacy while also enabling them to disclose data to whoever they choose. Flagship features include:&nbsp;</p>  Preservation of privacy: Panther’s <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Shielded Pool</a> technology will help to preserve your privacy by separating your transactions from the public ledger, safeguarding your identity.&nbsp;  Control over your data: Enable KYC validations without exposing your personal details. Our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-a-zero-knowledge-proof-example-explaining-zkps/">Zero-Knowledge proof</a>-based technology will let you choose exactly who can see your identity and transaction history.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Panther’s DeFi adapters will facilitate seamless integration with existing DeFi protocols, ensuring privacy without sacrificing functionality and allowing users to engage with DeFi platforms while keeping their transactions private.  Decentralized Identity: Your zAccount will act as a decentralized ID that helps safeguard your personal details, allowing you to make crypto transactions while protecting your identity.  Modular and expandable: Zones will offer customization for asset lists, user lists, transaction limits, and DeFi application access.  <p>For more detailed information about Panther Protocol, please click <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-panther-protocol-and-why-it-exists-a3fd4470de55/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p> Competitive Landscape <p>Greenfield identifies 11 elements that can enable the solution to the issue of privacy in blockchain. Panther’s model includes all of these, with the exception of compliance committees, which is by design and not necessary for Panther’s privacy preservation and compliance enablement.&nbsp;</p><p>Panther is also one of only two projects in Greenfield’s report that includes KYC in its model, which is a requirement in nearly every major jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p> How to get involved <p>If you are interested in helping Panther usher in a new era of DeFi adoption where your right to privacy is respected, we would love you to join us:&nbsp;</p>  Have coding skills?

Thematic Tease<p>Greetings community,</p><p>On May 1st, we will begin to reveal an internal initiative, story, and brand that outlines the future of Shade Protocol. The first two years of Shade Protocol was sharply focused on building the key building blocks for unstoppable finance — a world of decentralized money and products that help people reclaim their autonomy &amp; digital sovereignty.</p><p>The road has been&nbsp;arduous.</p><p>In early 2024 we collectively had a chance to take a deep breathe and reflect. We considered what has been built, how it was built, and why it was built. We’ve built the following primitives:</p>  SILK (unstoppable private stablecoin tracking a basket of currencies &amp; commodities)  ShadeSwap (DEX that protects your&nbsp;privacy)  ShadeLend (private collateralized positions)  Bridge (onboard &amp; wrap public assets into private&nbsp;assets)  Staking (passively earn real yield for securing Shade Protocol)  Bonds (protocol treasury management tool)  Transaction History (examine your private transactions)  <p>A deep analysis left us dissatisfied. This is an absurd amount of product; what is stopping growth? What is disabling our ability to onboard millions into true unstoppable finance?</p><a href="https://www.iflscience.com/how-a-helmet-and-a-bulletriddled-plane-perfectly-demonstrates-survivor-bias-60930">https://www.iflscience.com/how-a-helmet-and-a-bulletriddled-plane-perfectly-demonstrates-survivor-bias-60930</a><p>Enter survivorship bias.</p><p>You see, we started noticing a trend — thousands of new users were interacting or checking on Shade Protocol for the first time that never came&nbsp;back.</p><p>It was troubling.</p><p>The brand penetration of Shade Protocol is consistently generating new users, which considering our size is somewhat remarkable. However, when users actually landed on the product suite and tried to start using it we began to uncover a common&nbsp;trend:</p><blockquote>Shade Protocol is too hard to&nbsp;use.</blockquote><p>The core contributors began to talk to users. Hop on calls. We gathered the harshest feedback from the fiercest critics. It gave us the realization that if we continue down the path of building more and more complexity into the product suite, it will go unused. The beautiful, innovative pieces of the DeFi puzzle that have set the stage so well would slowly be wiped off the table of the Free&nbsp;Market.</p><p>Utility without simplicity is unused&nbsp;utility.</p><p>At it’s worst, complex utility is a repellent.</p><p>Naturally, the current users are okay with the user experience. If they weren’t, they wouldn’t be here continuing to use the app. This consumer survivorship bias has perhaps blinded us to the truth of the quality of what we have&nbsp;built.</p><p>Await our next blog post on May 1st, where we reveal the next stage of Shade Protocol’s evolution — a quest for simplicity that will redefine unstoppable finance, expanding its reach in ways yet&nbsp;unseen.</p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/Shade_Protocol">https://twitter.com/Shade_Protocol</a></p><p>Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/ShadeProtocol">https://t.me/ShadeProtocol</a></p>

This will be an important indicator of the future success of the decentralized blockchain and currency.</p><p>The genesis of Bitcoin is historically and technically entwined with that of mixnets. Leading up to the halving, Nym has officially joined the 65-member-strong Liquid Federation to signal support for Bitcoin and its growing layer-2 ecosystem.</p> Joining the Liquid Federation <p>Nym is now a part of 15 globally distributed functionary operators for the Liquid Network, one of Bitcoin’s first and most popular sidechains. Liquid functionaries are specialized and tamper-proof HSM servers that operate the core infrastructure of Liquid, facilitating thousands of transactions daily. These functionaries essentially propose and sign blocks, manage the two-way Bitcoin peg, and secure the bitcoin held by the network in the federation’s multi-sig wallet in a globally distributed and decentralized way. Nym is running the functionary on dedicated infrastructure in Switzerland.</p><p>The goal is to deepen the support for Bitcoin’s layer-2 protocols, which will help scale Bitcoin to meet global demand. This is the first step in a more comprehensive partnership between Nym, the Liquid Federation, and Liquid’s technical provider, Blockstream.</p><p>Dr. Adam Back, CEO and co-founder of Blockstream, had this to say about Nym’s initiative: “I am pleased to announce Nym as a new functionary within the Liquid Federation. Liquid’s Confidential Transactions, which rely on homomorphic encryption, are designed to keep transaction details confidential while protecting the network’s integrity and security. Nym’s decision to become a Liquid functionary underscores our shared commitment to enhancing privacy within the Bitcoin L2 ecosystem.”</p><p>The next step will be an integration of Liquid on the Nym mixnet, extending Liquid’s default confidentiality to also protect the patterns of transactions in transit. This will enable strong network level privacy to a growing number of Bitcoin users who are using layer-2 protocols to stack sats, save on fees, and improve&nbsp;privacy.</p> A short history of Bitcoin and&nbsp;mixnets <p>Mixnets and Bitcoin have an intertwined and shared history that goes back to the 1990s. It was while running a cypherpunk mixnet-based anonymous email re-mailer that Adam Back noticed a big problem: people were using the mixnet to send anonymous spam, clogging up the network and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdwOXWmAs8Y">“causing a nuisance.”</a> Rather than using a whitelist, which would require identifying users (which no cypherpunk would want), Adam Back coded up the research of <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~naor/PAPERS/pvp.ps">Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor on proof-of-work</a> to prevent the sending of spam e-mail through the mixnet by way of the cost of hashing. This led to the development of an early version of the scheme, called <a href="http://www.hashcash.org/">Hashcash</a>, which would eventually become the consensus protocol of Bitcoin. The entire blockchain industry was thus&nbsp;sparked.</p><p>With the advent of Bitcoin, one half of the cypherpunk dream was being realized: digital cash. The second half, however, is still being built: mixnets for full network privacy. Combined, the two technologies can finally secure the fundamental rights of freedom and privacy on the internet.</p><p>As a decentralized and incentivized overlay network, Nym mixnet is striving to protect the anonymity and privacy of all of its users by integrating with any wallet or app. Like Bitcoin’s blockchain, moreover, this is made possible by the work of its community. While Bitcoin’s ledgers are authenticated through miners who receive <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/depin-and-nym-a-decentralized-physical-infrastructure-network-for-privacy-e41db833816c">block rewards for their work</a>, the Nym mixnet relies on a global network of unlinkable node operators to route, mix, and anonymize user traffic. Online anonymity is less a service than it is a collective project.</p><p>“The very idea of Nym came to me in 2017,” Harry Halpin, Nym CEO and founder, recounts. “When I asked Adam Back how we could make Bitcoin better, and Adam told me that while Bitcoin was more-or-less perfect, the idea of using spare computing power for privacy hadn’t been explored. At that moment, I thought that mixing packets could work like mining Bitcoin. Years of coding later, I’m thrilled to see Nym work even closer with Liquid and Blockstream.”</p>Harry Halpin, CEO of Nym with Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream in front of a statue of Edward Snowden, Julian Assange and Chelsea&nbsp;Manning.

He is now also the creators of Runes, a second protocol, working to bring fungible tokens to Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p> <p>Bitcoin is changing and Casey appears to be one of main reasons for the change. Soon he’ll be unveiling a new protocol standard for Bitcoin - called Runes, which wants to be a bitcoin-native version of fungible tokens, on the Bitcoin L1 - which is going to be the topic of the show today.</p> <p>------ 📣 PERMISSIONLESS III | BUY TICKETS NOW&nbsp; Bankless Citizens get 30% off: <a href="https://www.bankless.com/tools/perks">https://www.bankless.com/tools/perks</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Use BANKLESS10 for 10% off: <a href="https://bankless.cc/PermissionlessIII">https://bankless.cc/PermissionlessIII</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>🐙KRAKEN | MOST-TRUSTED CRYPTO EXCHANGE <a href="https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2">https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; ⁠&nbsp;</p> <p>🔗CELO | CEL2 COMING SOON <a href="https://bankless.cc/Celo">https://bankless.cc/Celo</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🔐 SAFE | ATTEND SAFE{CON} <a href="https://bankless.cc/SafeCon">https://bankless.cc/SafeCon</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM ⁠<a href="https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a> &nbsp;</p> <p>🛞MANTLE | MODULAR LAYER 2 NETWORK <a href="https://bankless.cc/Mantle">https://bankless.cc/Mantle</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🗣️TOKU | CRYPTO EMPLOYMENT SOLUTION <a href="https://bankless.cc/toku">https://bankless.cc/toku</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ TIMESTAMPS</p> <p>0:00 Intro 5:00 The Guy Who Changed Bitcoin 10:21 Why Casey’s Building 16:45 Ordinals Cultural Shift 22:43 Runes 31:40 The Ord Standard&nbsp; 45:27 Bitcoin Blocks &amp; Blockspace Limit 57:47 Bitcoin Innovation Implications&nbsp; 1:02:41 Rune Parameters 1:11:20 The First Runes (Uncommon Goods)&nbsp; 1:14:34 Timeline on Runes &amp; Trading Ecosystem 1:17:12 The Future of Runes/Ordinals 1:19:48 The Bitcoin Renaissance&nbsp; 1:21:34 Winning Over Bitcoin Maximalists 1:23:45 Casey’s Podcast &nbsp; &nbsp; 1:24:58 Runes Team 1:26:37 Closing &amp; Disclaimers&nbsp; &nbsp; ------ RESOURCES</p> <p>Casey’s 1st Bankless Episode&nbsp; <a href="https://youtu.be/ktL77zEWcEc">https://youtu.be/ktL77zEWcEc</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Casey’s Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/rodarmor">https://twitter.com/rodarmor</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Casey’s Hellmoney Podcast&nbsp; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCflejnUswWof6yEMk9dRzOA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCflejnUswWof6yEMk9dRzOA</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ Not financial or tax advice.

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of Zebra version 1.6.1. This release adds an OpenAPI specification for Zebra’s RPC methods and improves the startup and shutdown logs with information about Zebra’s storage usage and other useful database information, such as column family sizes in a human readable format.</p>



<p>With this release we have made some improvements to the getblock RPC method in response to user feedback as well as taking the opportunity to improve its performance. We have also fixed a bug that caused hangs in the zebra-scan service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This release also includes some of the necessary changes to enable regtest network mode in zebra although this is still a work in progress. Our thanks go out to Zingo Labs for their contributions to this feature.</p>



<p>We have also updated our CI to use the official lightwalletd image, instead of the fork that we were using previously.</p>

Stake is delegated to new, high performing Nym nodes in key&nbsp;regions.  When staking rewards are redeemed, these go directly to the <a href="https://mixnet.explorers.guru/account/n1j25nq67nt836s4qxp440cjlsptdy69uumfwz76">Squad Wealth&nbsp;Fund</a>.  Each quarter, Nym Squad League missions are announced.  At the end of the quarter, community members submit proofs of missions completed which are rewarded from the Squad Wealth&nbsp;Fund.  Nym nodes in the delegation program are regularly assessed for performance, stake saturation, and uptime. Completed (fully saturated) and underperforming nodes are removed on a rolling basis, and the program is refilled with queued high quality Nym&nbsp;nodes.  <p>The first round of official delegations of more than 30 mil tokens were made in January. Rewards have just been redeemed to reward the Nymja and Shinobi missions which were completed in the first&nbsp;quarter.</p><p>Read on to learn about the Nym Squad Wealth Fund and how it has supported ecosystem growth so&nbsp;far!</p> Why a ‘Squad Wealth&nbsp;Fund’? <p>“​​SQUADS HAVE EXISTED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS as vital forms of social and economic organization. Thanks to group chats and a wave of private online social platforms, squads are reemerging today as a potent cultural force that rejects a strictly individualist market philosophy.” — <a href="https://otherinter.net/research/squad-wealth/">Sam Hart, Toby Shorin, Laura&nbsp;Lotti</a></p><p>“Squad wealth” is a term introduced by the <a href="https://otherinter.net/research/squad-wealth/">Other Internet</a> to describe informal groups of friends collaborating and sharing resources. Through group chats and multi-sigs, friendship can be formed across borders and strengthened through token economic tooling. “Squads” are what we call the bonds of friendships that ensure resilience in the face of global problems, conflicts, and crises. And in the case of Nym, community squads contribute to fixing a problem at the heart of the internet: enabling private, secure communication for everyone.</p><p>The Nym Squad League and Wealth Fund have been launched as vehicles to ensure close collaboration and mutual support between the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/depin-and-nym-a-decentralized-physical-infrastructure-network-for-privacy-e41db833816c">Nym core team and community</a>. It provides a framework for the core team to communicate the most urgent and important missions needed for progressing the project further along the roadmap towards global privacy. And it gives the community clear guidelines and rewards for their time and contribution.</p><p>The Nym Squad Wealth fund soft-launched in January 2024 with a “Season 0” of Nym Squad League. The league focused on improving the coverage of the Nym network and getting the rails up and running for the&nbsp;fund.</p><p>Community members set up gateways, nodes, and even built a CRM to run the delegations program more efficiently. Squads also held meet-ups across the world and did talks about Nym and the upcoming NymVPN&nbsp;app.</p> Fund overview <p>The Nym core team delegated 30,250,000 NYM tokens to 121 community-run independent mix nodes, staking 250,000 NYM on each node as part of the Nym Delegations Program. During season 0 of the Squad league, the Nym Squad Wealth Fund accumulated 475,256 NYM in staking rewards. These funds are now part of the community treasury and are being distributed to Nym Squad League participants across various&nbsp;seasons.</p>  The Squad Wealth Fund wallet can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://mixnet.explorers.guru/account/n1rnxpdpx3kldygsklfft0gech7fhfcux4zst5lw">here</a>.  <p>Nodes were selected based on their operators’ contribution and involvement within the ecosystem and, importantly, their node parameters, location, and performance. By delegating NYM tokens with independent operators, the reputation of the nodes are enhanced, advancing the network toward a more robust and decentralized ecosystem. A transparency dashboard of the delegation program will be released to the community shortly.</p>Season 0 distribution of Squad Wealth Fund&nbsp;tokens. What next? <p>Nym Squad League Season 1 is about to start, and with it, a new round of official delegations for new Nym nodes. Over the course of the next three months, the new round of delegations program will replenish the Squad Wealth Fund with rewards. These will be used to reward community members for running Nym meet-ups, creating content, building tooling, testing the NymVPN, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>If you run a Nym gateway, you might be eligible for official delegations to give you a leg up in getting into the active set and beginning to earn rewards. The requirements for the new delegations program, along with the missions for Season 1, will be announced shortly.

<p>Answer with AI is the only large real-time answer engine that puts privacy first and does not rely on Big Tech search engines</p>
<p>Today, Brave is announcing a major update to Brave Search and to how users find answers online. The new Brave Search answer engine synthesizes information from multiple sources into a single, intelligible answer to almost any query—a significant step forward from Brave’s <a>AI Summarizer released in 2023</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brave Search Answer with AI is unique in several respects:</p>
 
 It is the first privacy-preserving answer engine available at scale, serving the almost 10 billion queries a year that Brave Search currently receives, making it, overnight, one of the largest AI solutions on the market.&nbsp; 
 It produces near instant answers (with sources cited) with sources alongside traditional search results. 
 The answers result from the only independent search index at scale outside of Big Tech, as the largest real-time answer engines rely on the Google or Bing search engines, directly or indirectly.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Brave Search’s Answer with AI feature is available for free to all users across platforms, on both desktop and mobile. No matter which browser users choose, it can be accessed on the Web at <a href="https://search.brave.com">search.brave.com</a>. The answer engine also supports multiple languages besides English. Brave Search’s 27 million queries a day makes it the fastest growing search engine since Bing.&nbsp;</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Clicking the Answer with AI button</p>

 The need for answer engines 
<p>Web-scale search engines have undergone many iterations: directory listings, ten blue links, query-dependent snippets, knowledge graphs and featured snippets. The Brave Search Answer with AI feature evolves this paradigm. An answer engine is a system that tries to answer a question, rather than point to websites about the question. Thanks to the proliferation and quality of <a>large language models</a> (LLMs), search-integrated answer engines are now a possibility at scale. In fact, several companies that operate search engines have released similar systems (including Bing Copilot and Google Gemini). Other answer engines rely on API access to existing search solutions to serve at least some portion of their real-time results.</p>
<p><a>Brave Search released an AI tool for synthesized results</a> known as the Summarizer in March 2023 to help users better navigate search results. With today’s release, we’re taking a big step forward in delivering a next-level search experience, whether an answer or links of page results.</p>
<p>“With the new Brave Search and its integration of Answer with AI, users get the best of both worlds: one place to get generative answers as well as up-to-date links, providing instant and highly relevant results,” said Josep M. Pujol, Chief of Search at Brave. “Brave Search is uniquely positioned in this landscape, with the only independent search index besides Bing and Google. Unlike many search companies that are forced to rely on results from third parties, or others that solely offer answer engines, Brave now combines its index with AI to redefine the search experience and raise the bar on immediate pertinence in results, while preserving users’ privacy.”</p>

 What the Brave Search answer engine can do&nbsp; 
<p>The secret ingredient of an answer engine is not the LLM that powers it, but the combination of a model with up-to-date, reliable data. Such data can help supply the context from which the model derives the answers it presents to the user. Or, to put it another way: an effective answer engine requires both a model and access to a search engine. With API access to a search engine, even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43ZCeBTcsS8">individual contributors</a> can generate a reasonable answer engine.</p>
<p>This is why Brave Search—with its index of 20 billion pages, curated and cleansed of the SEO spam and junk content that plagues other indexes—is uniquely positioned to provide such a powerful answer engine. It has the data needed to generate an accurate and timely answer, and the context.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Answers enriched with text and other media</p>
<p>With the new answer engine, Brave Search aims to provide not just answers, but an integrated system to satisfy the multiple intents a user might have, and to do so at scale (currently Brave Search serves more than 27 million queries per day). Loosely speaking, these intents fall into one of a handful of categories:</p>
 
 Navigational: Queries for specific sites, such as “Facebook” or “Twitter.” 
 Informational: Question-based queries, or those seeking information, which generally fall into two subcategories:
 
 Specific lookups: These are often served by rich user interfaces built around structured realtime information (e.g. currency conversion rates, weather, or sports results) or custom widgets with non-real time based, deterministic data (e.g. unit conversion or time and timezone conversions). 
 Question-like queries: Queries such as “How do I find north when hiking?” 
 
 
 Commercial: Queries with the intent of finding or researching products and services. 
 Transactional: Queries with the intent of completing an action (e.g. buying a product). 
 
<p>Given relevant context, most existing answer engines do well at informational, question-like queries. However, they tend not to perform as well on other kinds of queries. With this latest release, Brave Search will default to an answer engine experience for likely informational, question-like queries.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Answers for informational queries</p>
<p>For all other categories, users can trigger the answer engine on demand by simply clicking Answer with AI. This offers a best-in-class experience of both options: an answer engine that’s both predictive and optional.</p>
<p>Brave Search’s generative answers are not just text. The deep integration between the index and model makes it possible for us to combine online, contextual, named entities enrichments (a process that adds more context to a person, place, or thing) as the answer is generated. This means that answers combine generative text with other media types, including informational cards and images.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Answer with AI results</p>
<p>The Brave Search answer engine can even combine data from the index and geo local results to provide rich information on points of interest. To date, the Brave Search index has more than 1 billion location-based schemas, from which we can extract more than 100 million businesses and other points of interest. These listings—larger than any public dataset—mean the answer engine can provide rich, instant results for points of interest all over the world.</p>

 How to try Brave Search’s Answer with AI feature 
<p>Brave Search can be accessed by anyone on the Web at <a href="https://search.brave.com">search.brave.com</a>, and is also the default search engine in the Brave browser for multiple countries. Answer with AI is available for all Brave Search users for searches in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish (the answer engine functionality is available in other languages as well, but some answers may appear in English). It’s available on all platforms, on desktop and mobile.</p>
<p>If Brave Search is already your default search engine, simply start a search in the address bar of your browser. For question-like queries, the answer engine should produce an answer by default, which will appear at the top of the search results page. Users also have the option to request answers on-demand by clicking / tapping the Answer with AI icon that appears beside the search bar on any search results page.</p>


    
    

    


    



<p>The Brave Search answer engine is free to all users, and we hope to keep it this way, as we believe this is a natural evolution of search engines. In the future, we may also add a paid option, with premium experiences such as the ability to have an open ended chat, possibly in conjunction with <a>the premium options offered by Brave Leo</a>, the AI assistant in the Brave browser.</p>

 The impact of answer engines on the Web 
<p>There is a clear demand from users for convenient methods of consuming content, and AI-augmented answers are a key example. On the other hand, delivering on this demand can contribute to the erosion of the incentives for publishers to put out content on the Web, ultimately changing its very nature.</p>
<p>This challenge is not unique to Brave Search, but present across most AI-powered answer engines and chatbots, premium or open. Brave, as both a browser and search engine, is aware of these challenges. Consequently, we will be monitoring and quantifying the impact of AI-generated content on site visits, and eventually will address the disruptions that could be caused by the drop in traffic. We hope others are working on this as well.</p>

<p>Blockchain technology has many different use cases. Some are more suitable for public blockchains, and others are more suitable for private blockchains. The difference between public and private blockchains can be confusing, leaving many people wondering which of the two is most suitable for their situation.&nbsp;In this article, we will explain the main differences between public and private blockchains, and when you should use which one.</p>



<p></p>



 What is a public blockchain? 



<p>Let’s start with the definition of a public blockchain. A public blockchain is a <a href="https://zaisan.io/solutions/europechain">permissionless blockchain</a> that allows anyone to join and participate in blockchain activities. This means anyone can contribute to the blockchain and can access the data on it.</p>



<p>In addition, public blockchains are decentralised, ensuring no single entity has control over the blockchain. This decentralisation also ensures that transactions on the (public) blockchain are verified by all nodes and are immutable once they’re on the blockchain.</p>



<p></p>



 Differences between public and private blockchains 







<p></p>



<p>While the above features sound nice, private blockchains might seem very similar at first glance. What are the differences and benefits of both types of blockchains?</p>



<p>The main difference between public and private blockchains lies in who can write and read data from that blockchain. On public blockchains, everyone can write data to and read data from the blockchain. On private blockchains though, a permissions system is in place, which determines who can perform certain actions, including reading and writing data.</p>



<p>Another important difference is the ownership of the blockchain. Generally speaking, public blockchains are decentralised and do not have an owner. Private blockchains, however, are generally owned by a single entity. This makes public blockchains more resistant to censorship than private blockchains.</p>



<p>Anonymity is another key difference between the two. Due to the permissionless nature of public blockchains, participating entities are anonymous. This can be both a benefit and a downside, depending on the use case.</p>



<p>Other differences are speed and scalability. Public blockchains tend to be slower and less scalable, due to their decentralised nature, while private blockchains are generally much faster and more scalable, as they don’t have to worry about decentralisation.</p>



<p></p>



 Picking the right blockchain 



<p>Now that you understand the differences between public blockchains and private blockchains, you should consider <a href="https://zaisan.io/services/web3-consultancy">which blockchain is most suitable for your solution</a>.</p>



<p>If your solution requires censorship resistance and the added security of decentralisation, a public blockchain is the best fit. However, if the need for high scalability, fast transactions, and a permission system take priority, a private blockchain is likely more suited.</p>



 Which public blockchain should I use? 



<p>While picking the right kind of blockchain to suit your situation best can be quite challenging, picking the right public blockchain can be even more challenging. There’s a wide variety of available public blockchains, each of them designed to serve a specific use case and/or industry. So, which one should you use?</p>



<p>A lot of people assume Bitcoin or Ethereum are the best public blockchains, and in a sense, they are. They are the first of their kind and are very resistant to censorship due to the high number of participants. However, these blockchains have relatively low transaction speeds and suffer from scalability issues, due to outdated consensus mechanisms used.</p>



<p>Modern-day, public blockchains use newer, faster, and more scalable consensus mechanisms that safeguard the benefits of public blockchains while tackling the transaction speed and scalability issues generally associated with public blockchains.</p>



<p>One of these public blockchains is the <a href="https://zaisan.io/solutions/europechain">Europechain by Zaisan, an enterprise blockchain</a> created by a group of system integrators and technology providers from around the European Union. This public blockchain uses the latest software to ensure fast transaction speeds and enterprise-level scalability. In addition, the blockchain offers solutions that ensure compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), making blockchain legal issues a problem of the past.</p>



<p></p>



 Key takeaways 



 
 A public blockchain is a permissionless blockchain that allows anyone to join and participate in blockchain activities. 



 Public blockchains are decentralised, which means that no single entity has control over the blockchain. 



 Private blockchains feature a permissions system that determines who can perform certain actions, including reading and writing data. 



 Private blockchains tend to be owned by a single entity, which makes public blockchains more censorship-resistant. 



 Public blockchains are better suited for solutions that require censorship resistance, added security, and decentralisation 



 Private blockchains are better suited for solutions that require high scalability, fast transactions, and a permission system. 



 Zaisan offers a <a href="https://zaisan.io/solutions/europechain">public, GDPR-compliant blockchain</a> built with the latest technology to offer fast transaction speeds and enterprise-level scalability.

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>As this week wraps up, we’re excited to share our latest news with you. This week’s update covers the latest updates regarding our ecosystem and testnet development.</p> Ecosystem updates  Testnet Stage 5 is now live with enhanced gas management and improved transaction processing <p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage-5-is-now-live-with-enhanced-gas-management-and-improved-transaction-processing/">Stage 5</a> of our testnet is live. Stage 5 includes using a third party Relayer service (a.k.a Bundler) and supports gasless transactions via an Account Abstraction Paymaster contract.&nbsp;</p> Panther’s CTO, Anish Mohammed, on Proof of Podcast <p>Last week, our Co-Founder Anish Mohammed joined Hake from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUoziPJ55j8&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Proof of Podcast </a>to discuss tokenomics design and cryptography.</p> Panther’s CEO, Oliver Gale, at ETH Dam <p>Our Co-Founder and CTO, Oliver Gale, will take the stage at Crypto Canal’s ETHDam on April 13 to share his insights on alpha protection through privacy for DeFi users.</p> Panther Protocol testnet and rewards update <p>Current testnet users: 3000+</p><p>Total rewards distributed: 700,000+ $ZKP</p><p>Our testnet rewards pot is 2 million $ZKP — have you signed up for our testnet yet to earn your share? Grab the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">latest link from Panther’s docs</a> to join our testnet and receive your $ZKP rewards.</p> Product updates.  Stage 6 developments <p>Stage 6 of the testnet dApp includes fee management and basic disclosures. Development for Stage 6 is complete and currently under testing. The team plans to release Stage 6 later this month.&nbsp;</p> Completion of the first round of audit&nbsp; <p>Panther recently completed Veridise’s first round of audits for circuits and smart contracts. The team is working on Enhancement Stage 2 to incorporate feedback from Veridise’s recent audits and other dApp improvements. We expect to release updates made to the dApp together with Stage 6 for community testing. </p> Mumbai Network Shutdown <p>As Polygon transitions to a new test network in response to the deprecation of the Ethereum Goerli test network (the underlying L1 for Mumbai), Mumbai has ceased operations. This development was somewhat unexpected, as we anticipated that Mumbai would remain operational until full network support for Amoy was established.</p><p>In the interim, we want our testers to know that their $ZKP rewards are SAFE and that the $ZKP rewards accumulated from Stage 1 testing up to the present are secure. You will receive these rewards as planned.</p><p>Next Steps: The Panther team is actively exploring alternatives to continue our testing processes effectively. Stay tuned for further updates on our<a href="https://discord.com/channels/801604563115180063/801637790290804766?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Discord</a> and<a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Telegram</a> groups, and thank you for your continued support and understanding.</p> Stage 7 development <p>Stage 7 of the testnet dApp includes DeFi swaps, advanced disclosures, other supported assets, and canary deployment (use of real tokens). The team is working on Stage 7 in parallel with Stage 6 and Enhancement Stage 2. We are currently working on UI/UX development and expect to release Stage 7 for community testing in the first week of May.</p>  About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in Shielded Pools; zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs; and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s Zero-Knowledge primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

<p>Backing open-ended breakthrough research is at the core of BlueYard’s investing philosophy, whether it’s nuclear fusion, programmable stem cells or novel crypto-compute infrastructure. Hackers and researchers remain the essential backbone of the crypto industry. We are proud to have supported the work of research-focused companies like <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a>, <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a>, <a href="https://www.flashbots.net/">Flashbots</a>, <a href="https://www.privy.io/">Privy</a>, <a href="https://www.ingonyama.com/">Ingonyama</a>, <a href="https://www.tromero.ai/">Tromero</a> and more in solving critical crypto compute and infrastructure challenges, including those that could be key to unlocking adoption and enabling groundbreaking novel use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>This brings us to our core thesis underpinning our crypto investing strategy:</p><p>In the history of technology, economics and organizations — never has there been a technology and incentive system that can autonomously coordinate machines (compute, storage, etc), algorithms, data and capital at such an incredible scale, so quickly — all while providing independent, robust and trustless infrastructure for economic activity and data. Although still early in its development, crypto might be the ultimate solution to the collective action problem. Also, if one believes in a future where the autonomous coordination between compute, data and capital will play an increasing role, crypto networks could be the “under the hood” operating system for large economic networks.</p><p>Due to crypto’s inherent properties (ability to cut out gatekeepers, separation of state and money, internet native assets with open access) — crypto’s potential will unfold both through novel applications and decentralized infrastructure.</p><p>We are excited to be expanding the BlueYard team with a dedicated Crypto Associate position. This is designed to be a two-year role based in the US (ideally New York, but we’re flexible with the right candidate), supporting the team in backing entrepreneurs that are decentralizing markets and empowering humanity using crypto. At the core of BlueYard is the belief that venture capital is a product for entrepreneurs (and networks / protocols…), and if you are inspired by working with an intellectually curious, small and value-driven team, we want to hear from&nbsp;you.</p><p>The Associate role includes:</p>  Identifying technologies and trends that will positively impact economies and societies and represent attractive early stage venture investment opportunities in&nbsp;crypto  Carrying out market, company and protocol due diligence on investment opportunities  Working with our portfolio companies and networks / protocols to support&nbsp;them  Helping with our community management and&nbsp;events  Supporting with fund reporting and&nbsp;analyses  <p>Here’s what we’d like you to bring to the&nbsp;table:</p>  A strong understanding of and passion for all things&nbsp;crypto  Self-(fire)starter — be able to run on your own, identify opportunities and prioritize without much&nbsp;guidance  The ability to clearly articulate thoughts and opinions about markets, companies and networks / protocols, both in written and spoken&nbsp;form  Strong interpersonal skills — happy to work extensively within the team and with entrepreneurs  Ability to carry out market and financial analyses  Native (or close to) English language skills both written and&nbsp;oral  The willingness to roll up your&nbsp;sleeves  <p>There is no ideal background for this role and a formal degree is not required. We however think that the role will be most suitable for folks with a few years of work experience and with a track record of working in&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>If you are interested in the position please send the following to team@blueyard.com:</p>  Your CV  If applicable, a collection of links that best characterize your online&nbsp;presence

  AI 50: Companies of the Future  <p>The 2024 edition of the AI 50 shows how Gen AI is starting to transform enterprise productivity.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/konstantine-buhler/">Konstantine Buhler</a>	 



Published April 11, 2024
  



 
<p>Last year generative AI moved from the background to the foreground of the AI 50 list. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/lists/ai50/?sh=14d96301290f">This year</a> it is front and center as we see the beginnings of major AI productivity gains for both enterprise customers and consumers. Although the majority of 2023’s AI venture funding in the U.S. went to infrastructure—<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c6b47d24-b435-4f41-b197-2d826cce9532">60%</a> to the biggest large language model (LLM) providers—application companies continue to dominate the AI 50 list.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, we are beginning to see what AI-infused companies will look like. Today, many are integrating AI into their processes as a way to accelerate KPIs. We’re seeing large companies benefit from integrating AI into their products. Workflow automation platform ServiceNow is achieving <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/blogs/2024/generative-ai-use-cases.html">case avoidance rates of nearly 20%</a> with their AI-powered Now Assist. Palo Alto Networks has reduced the cost of processing expenses with AI. Hubspot has scaled customer support with AI. And Swedish fintech Klarna recently announced over <a href="https://www.klarna.com/international/press/klarna-ai-assistant-handles-two-thirds-of-customer-service-chats-in-its-first-month/">$40 million in run-rate savings</a> by building AI into their customer support. Thousands of companies are now integrating AI into their workflows to see increased growth and decrease costs. AI 50 companies are enabling these rapid improvements.</p>



<p>Tomorrow, we expect to see UX and UI reimagined around the capabilities of AI. Replicating existing functions better and cheaper, will be followed by evolving entirely new user interfaces to deliver valuable new experiences.</p>
 







 
 What’s new this year? 



<p>The big movements in this year’s AI 50 list highlight how generative AI is increasing enterprise and industry productivity. The category of enterprise general productivity doubled this year, going from four companies to eight as they broadened&nbsp; their offerings to meet customers’ growing demands. Writer, previously in our enterprise marketing category, fleshed out their product lines to apply across all corporate departments. Notion, new to the list, integrated an AI assistant across their productivity platform, and added new capabilities like calendering.</p>



<p>Five productivity apps, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, DeepL, Notion and Tome are now catering to customers at the consumer, prosumer and enterprise levels. Image editor Photoroom, video generation app Pika and game-builder Rosebud show that the lines are blurring between consumer and prosumer for creative software. Overall, companies in that category also doubled, going from three to six.</p>



<p>There are fewer industry vertical categories this year, but a new industrial sector emerged. Figure in robotics, Tractian in industrial maintenance and Waabi in self-driving are beginning to show how the integration of AI software with hardware will transform work in the physical world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2023 was a strong year for infrastructure overall, and includes some formidable new entrants like Mistral, a major contender in foundation models. In the cloud data platform category, Pinecone and Weaviate demonstrated the importance of vector databases. Meanwhile, Databricks, through its acquisition of MosaicML last year, has also moved to join Anyscale, Baseten, Replicate and Together in the inference provider category. And LangChain has established itself in a category of its own as an all-purpose application development framework for working with LLMs.</p>



 Companies of the future 



<p>Previous waves of tech innovation—networking, the internet and mobile—have largely been communication revolutions. AI promises to be something different—a productivity revolution, more akin to the personal computer, which shaped the future of business and industry.</p>



<p>As more AIs are developed, they will begin to work together as networks of AIs. In the past year, we have seen generative AI extend beyond simple text or code generation to agentic interaction. Just as the rise of the PC and then the smartphone drove demand for internet bandwidth to transmit data, the evolution of AI agents will drive demand for new infrastructure to support ever more powerful computation and crosstalk.</p>



<p>We are entering a world where, as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says, “every pixel will be generated.” In this generative future, company building itself could become the work of AI agents; And someday entire companies might work like neural networks.</p>







<p>What we are seeing in the application landscape now are the first iterations of the tools that will be used by the next generation of companies. We can probably expect these companies to be smaller, but the ease of company generation means there will be far more of them. Company formation will become faster and more fluid, with new ownership and management structures. Someday, there may be large companies operated by a single AI engineer.</p>



<p>Most companies of the near future will not be one-person companies, but they will have different needs and different pain points than the companies of today. They’ll require enterprise products that can solve challenges in knowledge management and content generation, in trust, safety and authentication. The amount of software these companies will run will expand and change, with code generation and software agents enabling more customization and fast-cycle iteration.</p>



<p>To win the hearts and minds of the businesses of the future, founders will need to answer some critical questions. What kinds of products will these companies make? What kinds of infrastructure and applications will they need? How will the workforce change? How will patterns of distribution and value capture change? What share of their total addressable market will be composed of people vs autonomous AI agents?</p>



 What’s Next 



<p>Productivity revolutions like the AI revolution drive costs down. Technological progress this century has radically driven down the cost of hardware, but the costs of services delivered by humans, from healthcare to education, have skyrocketed. AI has the potential to reduce costs in such crucial areas making them more accessible and affordable. These changes need to be made responsibly to mitigate job loss and drive job creation. AI will enable us to do much more with less, but we will need both government and private efforts to retrain and empower everyone.</p>







<p>AI is positioned to change the cost structure and increase productivity in some of the most crucial areas in our society. It has the potential to lead to better education, healthier populations and more productive people by abstracting away mundane work and allowing us to focus our attention on more important issues and better tools for the future. It can free up more people to tackle more problems to create a better society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 2024 AI 50 captures this broadening scope of AI. The list has applications that are more general than ever, and we expect it to expand in both depth and breadth in the coming years. 2024 is really just the beginning.</p>

In order to obscure client traffic, a VPN reroutes user data through their own server, replacing user IP addresses with the VPN’s own. Herein lies the problem: metadata logs of user traffic are likely stored on these targettable servers. As long as our data is centralized, it is at risk of data breaches, cyber attacks, and government surveillance, all of which could reveal the histories of what we do&nbsp;online.</p><p>A mixnet, short for “mix network,” will probably be a new word for most VPN users. But it addresses this crucial risk by providing an alternative routing architecture under the hood of a VPN service. Instead of routing user traffic through a central server, encrypted user data is instead mixed up with other traffic as it is sent through multiple successive servers, or nodes, before arriving at its final destination. With a mixnet, not only is there no single point of failure for revealing metadata, but traffic analysis is also remarkably stunted.</p><p>Research into mixnet technology has actually been going on since the 1970s, beginning with the academic work of David Chaum. But it has only been recently implemented in practice and commercially. With the rise of AI powered surveillance, and the systematic analysis of our metadata and online patterns, a VPN built on mixnet technology couldn’t be more&nbsp;urgent.</p><p>Thankfully, the new <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">NymVPN</a> is the first commercially available VPN to run on such a mixnet. Before breaking down NymVPN’s novel privacy features, we will work through the problem that metadata leakage poses for privacy and how a mixnet works to resolve&nbsp;it.</p> Metadata: The VPN privacy&nbsp;leak <p>VPNs are digital privacy tools, but most cannot actually guarantee that what we do online will stay private. Part of the problem is architectural: they simply route your traffic through their servers, but provide no protection for the patterns of your communication. Since online communication is usually encrypted twice — once by the HTTPS web service and once again between our device and the VPN server — what exactly would be revealed? Metadata: the glaring problem at the forefront of the online privacy struggles.</p><p>So what exactly is <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/data-privacy-day-special-a-primer-on-metadata-7246a7394f1f">metadata</a>? It literally just means data about the data. This could include timestamps (when you connected to something online), frequency (how often a connection is made), duration (length of the connection), and message sizes (how much data was transmitted). Without the content of what you did or said online being itself visible, this might all seem like an irrelevant set of quantitative details. Unfortunately, the opposite is true: it might actually <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaJ4PfebyW8">reveal more about you</a> than even the content&nbsp;would.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLLsGzLJRaI">Metadata</a> can be assembled and used in traffic analysis to trace a message from point A to B, learning who is speaking to who, where transactions are being sent, which websites are being visited, or what article is read. Your IP address is itself a piece of metadata, identifying your device, geolocation, ISP, etc. When all of this information is taken together, it can be used to predict people’s habits, political preferences, social relations, purchasing behaviors, and other intimate details of their private lives and states of&nbsp;mind.</p><p>Moreover, metadata does not have legal protections in the way <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/internet-telecoms/data-protection-online-privacy/index_en.htm">personal data can</a>. Anyone with the technological know-how and the right tools can digitally fingerprint users to harvest or spy on metadata. It is therefore wide open to cyber attackers, governments, data brokers, corporations, and online services to harvest and exploit. Many ostensibly “free” VPN services come with a hidden cost: without client revenue and dedication, they are simply means for VPN companies to collect user data to sell wholesale to data&nbsp;brokers.</p><p>Yet even with more reliable VPN services offering user privacy commitments, their physical infrastructures and potential logging practices leave all our metadata vulnerable to breach. This may mask your activity from your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or your IP address from a website, but it does not prevent one successful security failure of the VPN database from putting it in the hands of someone looking to retrace all your digital&nbsp;steps.</p><p>Tools like traditional VPNs, proxies, and encrypted messaging services all help for user privacy. But even the strongest existing privacy technologies like <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> cannot address the problem of metadata leakage and tracking.</p> Mixnets <p>Over the last few years, <a href="https://nymtech.net/">Nym’s</a> team of top privacy academics, researchers, and cryptographers (from MIT, UCL, KU Leuven, and EPFL) have worked tirelessly to solve this major problem in online privacy. In a way, it is a problem that stems from the core protocols of the internet itself: they are expose patterns of communication.</p><p>As we will see, Nym mixnet, and the upcoming NymVPN running on it, provides a number of breakthrough privacy protections for users. But first, let’s see how mixnets work and where the idea came&nbsp;from.</p> How does a mixnet&nbsp;work? <p>There is an old saying: “there are more ways to arrange a deck of cards than there are atoms on Earth.” A mix network takes advantage of this principle by shuffling communication packets just like a deck of cards. Rather than sending traffic from point A to point B, a message is split into identically looking encrypted packets before being sent through a successive series of servers called “mix nodes.” To make things even more complicated, dummy data-packets can even be introduced into the network to further obscure what’s happening across the whole network (what’s called “cover traffic”).</p><p>A mixnet architecture makes traffic analysis a nearly impossible task. Moreover, as we will see with the Nym VPN in practice, it solves the problem of metadata leaking from core internet protocols.</p> The history of mixed&nbsp;networks <p>Academics and researchers have long tried to fix the metadata privacy problem. In the 1970s, pioneering cryptographer David Chaum, with great foresight, first conceptualized a “<a href="https://chaum.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/chaum-mix.pdf">mixed network</a>” to protect the patterns of data in transit. Chaum proposed a decentralized network of relays designed to hide metadata in internet communications so that they could not be linked to&nbsp;users.</p><p>Traditional mixnets, as Chaum imagined them, arranged servers (or nodes) in a “fixed cascade,” where every data packet is routed sequentially in batches (see visual&nbsp;below).</p><p>Every packet is layer-encrypted — similar to Tor’s “onion-encryption” — using public-key cryptography. The encrypted packet is relayed across several hops of nodes that mix the packet. Each node shuffles the order of the packets (mixing), and removes a layer of encryption to get instructions for where to send it next. This delinks the sender from receiver as each hop can only see the next hop, not the original source nor destination. This also prevents any observers watching the network from tracing the data packets by what the order of their binary code — the 1s and 0s that comprise all pieces of data — look&nbsp;like.</p><p>There have been attempts to build this design, however they have fallen short for a number of reasons. The primary issue is that the model scales poorly. Each client and mix node must perform public key cryptography, which is time consuming. Latency becomes a real&nbsp;problem.</p><p>Over the years, grassroots groups, internet researchers, and academics have attempted to create working mixnets. Some of them did work, albeit with limitations. However, it is not until NymVPN that a working, battle-tested mixnet can deliver both anonymity and scale simultaneously.</p><p>More importantly, the so-called “anonymity set” has been limited to the amount of data packets in a single “batch” of data being mixed. But what is an anonymity set, and how has it been improved?</p> Anonymity set explained <p>An anonymity set essentially means safety in numbers. Imagine you are being followed and you want to try and lose your pursuer. If it is just you out in the open, you can be easily spotted. Though by moving into a large crowd of people, it gets much harder to identify and follow you. This is the principle of an anonymity set: the more data in a network, the harder it is to deanonymize each individual piece of data. You get “lost in the crowd” so to&nbsp;speak.</p><p>One major difficulty with creating a working mixnet is preserving anonymity while also allowing for scale. Chaumian mix networks use a single cascade and “batch-and-reorder” technique, where the total amount of data in the batch is the maximum size of the anonymity set. This limits the size of “the crowd,” so to speak, to a smaller top threshold. The Nym mixnet VPN, however, uses a stratified topology. This provides a much larger anonymity set because the network is designed for scale. Let’s visually compare the stratified model to other mixnet&nbsp;designs:</p><p><a href="https://messari.io/report/understanding-nym">Credit: Messari/Understanding Nym&nbsp;report</a></p> NymVPN mixnet in&nbsp;practice <p>The Nym mixnet is the only market-ready technology that solves metadata leakage, and it will soon be available at the touch of a button via NymVPN. The Nym mixnet ensures that not only your content is protected, but also your metadata and patterns of communication. This is something that no other existing VPN providers or privacy technologies can provide. Here’s how it&nbsp;works.</p> Encryption <p>The NymVPN mixnet mode encrypts user traffic with a multi-layered and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_routing">onion-like encryption</a> called <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/sphinx-tl-dr-the-data-packet-that-can-anonymize-bitcoin-and-the-internet-18d152c6e4dc">Sphinx</a>. Sphinx has been designed specifically for multi-hop routing, with all essential routing information contained within the packet itself, thus eliminating the need for other computations. This is a crucial feature compared with the original mixnet design which required each node to add its own encryption, producing latency in the transmission. With Nym mixnet, packet handling occurs within hundreds of nanoseconds, so there’s minimal latency overhead and efficient network performance.</p> Multi-hop routing <p>With the mixnet VPN mode, user traffic is routed through 5 hops: an entry gateway, three mix nodes, and an exit gateway. As your identically sized Sphinx packets travel over the 5 hops, they are mixed in with fake, indistinguishable cover traffic to further confuse any observers of the network. The inner three nodes in the 5-hop path perform advanced packet shuffling to ensure that they cannot be correlated back to the user based on&nbsp;timing.</p><p>The Nym stratified topology has three layers of nodes for the mix node hops. When a packet is routed, one mix node is picked at random from each layer. As the demand for the network scales, the layers can simply scale horizontally, making sure there is always an optimum anonymity set for any level of usage. The beauty of this system is that the network is designed to scale both up and down. If usage is small, the layers will have less nodes and add dummy traffic so the anonymity set remains strong. If demand increases, more nodes are activated. This inter-linking design allows the mixnet to scale horizontally, meaning network capacity can always be increased by adding more&nbsp;servers.</p> Nym privacy&nbsp;features   Encrypts data with novel multi-layer <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/sphinx-tl-dr-the-data-packet-that-can-anonymize-bitcoin-and-the-internet-18d152c6e4dc">Sphinx</a> encryption  Protects your data and metadata in&nbsp;transit  Is a decentralized network, offering unlinkability  Is powered by an incentivized network and designed to&nbsp;scale  Has cover traffic ensuring a large anonymity set for robust&nbsp;privacy  Provides unparalleled protection for high-privacy use cases like sending and receiving sensitive emails, messaging, and crypto transactions   NymVPN: Bringing mixnets to&nbsp;life <p>After years of research, the Nym team has created an effective mixnet that is not only scalable, but where anonymity actually improves as the mixnet scales. Building a battle-tested, working mixnet with a completely decentralized architecture is an incredible feat. Mixnets offer a vision of a future decentralized internet where people have real control over how their data and metadata is used and managed without falling victim to spying and surveillance.</p><p>As we’ve seen, mixnets are prone to latency issues, delaying data transmission. It is also clear to us that not all online traffic has the same privacy priority for users. To this end, NymVPN has been designed to allow users to have the best of both worlds: fast speed and privacy and strong privacy for when you most need it. NymVPN thus offers two modes in one&nbsp;app:</p>  A 2-hop decentralized VPN mode using the WireGuard protocol, offering best-in-class security and speed for daily internet usage like web browsing, gaming, and streaming.  A 5-hop mixnet mode for delivering the best possible privacy for the most sensitive use cases like sending and receiving emails, secure messaging, and crypto transactions.  <p>Learn more about how to custom configure your VPN, including NymVPN, with <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/blog/split-tunneling-with-a-vpn">split tunneling</a> to further optimize your speed and security&nbsp;needs.</p><p>NymVPN offers unprecedented access to the Nym mixnet for the very first time.

 What are Brave Talk and Brave Leo? 
<p>Brave Talk—first launched in May 2020, and built on 8x8’s Jitsi Open Source video conferencing software—is our privacy-focused video conferencing feature built directly into the Brave browser. With Brave Talk, any Brave user can start a virtual meeting, livestream, hangout, or any other collaborative session. And anyone—even if they’re not using Brave—can join a Talk call.</p>
<p>Brave Talk offers video/audio conferencing, screen sharing, chat, and more, with no extra apps or extensions required—it’s built right into the Brave browser, and offers Brave-level privacy. With Brave Talk, what you say or type in the service is not logged or saved (except to enable call recordings and transcriptions); who you talk to, when, and how, stays private to you. Talk is free for up to 4 participants, with no limit on the number or length of calls. It’s also available as a Premium offering for larger groups, with call recordings and expanded moderation tools.</p>
<p>Leo is Brave’s private AI assistant available right in the browser. Leo can create real-time summaries of webpages or videos; answer questions about content, or generate new content; translate pages, analyze them, rewrite them, and more.</p>
<p>Leo combines this easy access to AI with the privacy focus of Brave. Chats with Leo are private and secure. Leo doesn’t record chats, or use them for model training, and no account or login is required to use Leo. With cutting-edge technology and privacy, Brave Leo pushes the boundaries of AI chatbot services. Leo is free for all Brave users, and also includes a Premium offering with higher rate limits.</p>
<p>The Leo integration is available for all Brave Talk Premium users and their meeting attendees on the Brave browser.</p>

 What does Brave Talk with Leo do? 
<p>Brave Talk can already provide call transcripts to moderators of Premium calls. With Leo integrated into Brave Talk, those transcripts suddenly become dynamic.</p>
<p>Whether you’re discussing project updates, brainstorming ideas, or conducting interviews, Leo can follow along with the conversation and make it easier for you to reference important points. Leo can use Brave Talk call transcripts to:</p>
 
 Summarize them into useful meeting notes 
 Highlight key topics, decisions, and action items 
 Find quotes, and consider follow-up questions 
 Quickly catch up if you’re late or step away 
 
<p>With these logistical tasks handled, participants can stay focused, productive, and fully present during meetings. No more scrambling to capture details or struggling to recall important points with real-time note-taking, and no more disagreement about the content of a meeting.</p>
<p>“With Leo, meetings are now much more efficient. Teams can focus on the conversations instead of getting bogged down in note taking,” said Brian Bondy, CTO and co-founder of Brave. “Brave is committed to pairing AI with user privacy, and this applies to AI assistance in video conferencing as well. We’re excited to bring frictionless AI productivity to Brave Talk, and thrilled to continue our work with 8x8 to bring an exceptional conferencing experience to the millions of Brave users worldwide.”</p>
<p>“As technology providers, we are constantly looking for ways to innovate and provide our users with the tools and solutions they need to be more productive and efficient in their roles”, said&nbsp; Emil Ivov, VP of Product for Video Platform and Services at 8x8.&nbsp; “We’re excited to continue our partnership with Brave to couple industry-leading private video conferencing technology with a first-of-its-kind integration of private AI into calls, creating an enhanced employee and customer experience.”</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    

 Privacy and security 
<p>Unlike other AI meeting assistants, Brave Talk with Leo doesn’t share your data with anyone. Brave and 8x8 will store call recordings and transcripts for up to 24 hours to allow time for call moderators to download them. What you say or type in the service is otherwise never logged or saved. Who you talk to, when, and how, is private to you. Furthermore, when call recordings are initiated, users are made aware of this by a voice announcement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brave Talk users can enable multiple layers of encryption on calls, which can prevent eavesdroppers from listening in. Brave Talk is powered by the <a href="https://jaas.8x8.vc/#/">Jitsi as a Service</a> open-source video meeting platform from 8x8, a leading integrated cloud contact center and unified communications platform provider (NASDAQ: EGHT). 8x8 uses WebRTC open-source technology, enabling developers to embed HD video directly into the browser.</p>
<p>As for Leo’s privacy protections, Leo hides IP addresses using a reverse proxy, so requests cannot be linked to a user. Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers or used for model training. No personal data is retained by Brave-hosted AI models (though if you select the Anthropic model, Leo queries will be processed by Anthropic for a period of 30 days, then deleted). No login or account is required for access, and Leo Premium subscriptions are unlinkable to the user.</p>

 Get started with Brave Talk + Leo 
<p>The Leo integration is available for all Brave Talk Premium users and their meeting attendees on the Brave browser.</p>
<p>To start a Brave Talk call, Brave browser users can open a new tab and click the  icon, or visit talk.brave.com. Once the call link is created, it can be shared with anyone, even if they’re not using Brave.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Brave Talk with Leo is available to Premium subscribers. To get a Premium subscription ($7/month), users can visit account.brave.com to get started. Once a Premium call is started, the meeting creator with the Premium subscription can visit Settings and turn on Record transcription (A red icon will appear at the top of the screen for all participants, indicating the call is being recorded.)</p>
<p>The call moderator will have access to the audio or video recording, or the transcription, for 24 hours after the call ends. The moderator can share the transcription with the meeting attendees. Those attending a Premium call from the Brave browser can click  in the Brave Sidebar to ask Leo to summarize key points both during and after the meeting. Don’t see the sidebar? Visit Settings » Appearance, and toggle on Show Sidebar button. Afterwards, click the icon that appears in the address bar to use Leo in the Sidebar.</p>
<p>Note that Leo in Brave Talk calls are subject to Leo’s standard rate limits.</p>

  The Arc Product-Market Fit Framework  <p></p>   
	By Team Sequoia	 
  



 
<p>Finding product-market fit is the central quest of every early-stage startup. As we have seen over years of partnering with companies before they reached PMF, there are many ways of thinking about and approaching this quest. We walk founders through the following framework during <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/arc/">Arc</a>, our company-building immersion for pre-seed and seed stage companies. Rather than diagnosing whether you have product-market fit, this framework outlines three distinct archetypes of PMF which help you understand your product’s place in the market and determine how your company operates.</p>



 3 Archetypes of Product-Market Fit 



<p>Ultimately, product-market fit is about your product’s place in the world. There are different aspects to how your product fits into the world that you could hone in on—competitive landscape, the technical merits of your product, etc. We think the best way is to start by focusing on how the customer relates to the problem your product solves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are different kinds of problems, and different ways customers relate to them. We see three basic archetypes, each with its own distinct customer-product relationship dynamics.</p>







 Hair on Fire 



<p>You solve a problem that’s a clear, urgent need for customers. The demand is obvious. Because of this, your category is likely crowded with competitors vying for market share. Your customers are actively wrestling with the problem, and likely comparing existing products to solve it. To succeed in such a dynamic, you must rise above the noise. The only way to do so is by delivering the best-in-class solution. And best-in-class products stand out because they are different, not merely better. You can’t just be faster or cheaper—you need a truly differentiated customer experience to have a durable advantage.</p>







 Hard Fact 



<p>You take a pain point universally accepted as a hard fact of life, and see that it’s merely a hard problem that your product solves for the customer. Your customers have resigned themselves to just living with the problem. They’re not urgently engaged with trying to solve it. The status quo is just how it is, and change doesn’t seem like an option. You upend how things are done with an unexpected approach: Facts can’t be changed—but problems can be solved. The challenge to overcome is force of habit. Customers will have to change their current behaviors, and inertia is powerful. You need an approach that’s novel enough, for a problem that matters enough, to be worth making a change.</p>







 Future Vision 



<p>You enable a new reality through visionary innovation. It sounds like science fiction to customers, either because the concept is familiar but sounds impossible (like abundant cheap energy from nuclear fusion) or because no one ever imagined it (like the iPhone). Customers are not only not trying to solve the problem, they are either oblivious to it or predisposed to think it’s a pipe dream. Either way, the obstacle is disbelief: Customers must believe that your product represents a whole new paradigm—often with its own ecosystem. (The iPhone wasn’t just a device; its App Store was a new way of interfacing with the internet. Tesla isn’t just a car; it’s a network of cameras and self-driving software that’s a new driving experience.) Customers must find the paradigm and its possibilities irresistible. As we’ll discuss below, this path is often long, and finding the right route with the right commercial opportunities along the way is usually critical.</p>
 







 
 How to Operate in Each Path&nbsp; 



<p>Once you understand these archetypes, you can self-identify which path your company is on. Many founders we encounter in Arc assume they’re supposed to be in the Hair on Fire path. They have absorbed the adage to listen to what customers need. That’s good advice. But it often comes as a revelation that Hard Fact or Future Vision dynamics are viable options for finding PMF.</p>



<p>Hopefully you’re already working on a problem you have a unique advantage in solving. Your path, however, will be defined by how your customer relates to this problem (and how they feel about your solution). You can find success on any path—but each brings a distinct set of operating priorities that are essential to understand.</p>



 Path 1 – Hair on Fire 



<p>The Hair on Fire path requires both a great product and a great go-to-market effort—in quick succession. This combination of solution, selling and speed is the key to overcoming the competition.&nbsp;</p>
 



<a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/04/Hair-on-fire-desktop.png"></a>



 
 Hair on Fire – Case Studies 



<p>Along with product velocity, one hallmark of companies that break through to find success in the Hair on Fire path is the ability to aggressively out-maneuver the competition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assaf Rappaport and his Wiz co-founders had previously founded Adallom together. For their new company, they were intrigued by the problem of cloud infrastructure security—but it was already a crowded space with incumbents like Palo Alto Networks and startups like Orca Security offering products on the market. However, when they interviewed CISOs, the topic kept surfacing at the top of everyone’s wish list. There was evident demand in a large market—but it took some digging to find the opportunity for differentiation. Most cloud security products relied on agents, a piece of software that needs to be installed in every server in order to monitor it. Wiz conceived an “agentless” solution that not only reduced friction and headaches, but surfaced vulnerabilities more effectively. Even better, once connected it could surface those vulnerabilities in the course of a 15-minute customer demo. Assaf and his team found their advantage, and floored the accelerator, aggressively out-maneuvering the competition: engineers built the product during their workday Israel time, and worked double-duty as sales reps at night—daytime in the U.S. They went from $0 to $2.8M in a single quarter and reached $100M in ARR in 18 months, setting a new record for the fastest-growing software company, ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Parker Conrad founded Rippling, he was entering a large Hair on Fire market. Every company needs HR software, and this urgency was reflected in the steep competition: there were already at least half a dozen incumbents fighting for market share. In fact one of them was Parker’s own previous company Zenefits. Why bother? Because his deep expertise meant he knew what needed to be done differently: While other providers stitched together disparate datasets to offer a single platform for HR and benefits, Rippling’s approach was to build a unified database. This foundation layer for employee data could then “ripple” out to any aspect of the employee experience, from benefits to expenses to device management. Their technical advantage created a different experience for HR, finance and IT administrators, which allowed Rippling to stand out and quickly grow market share in a field of incumbents. And their strategy of bundling the widest set of employee experiences gave it pricing power even in a Hair on Fire dynamic where price leverage can be challenging for new entrants.</p>



 Path 2 – Hard Fact 



<p>The Hard Fact path entails getting customers to re-evaluate and change the way they approach a current process. This requires first educating the market, and then capturing the opportunity.</p>
 



<a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/04/Hard-Fact.png"></a>



 
 Hard Fact – Case Studies 



<p>Your novel approach may replace an existing market (like Salesforce moving CRM to the cloud) or it may create a new market (like Uber reimagining the taxi experience as a rideshare marketplace). Either way, you will likely face less competition on the Hard Fact path because the difficulty of changing the status quo has discouraged other founders from taking on the problem. To succeed, Uber had to not only convince legions of everyday people to drive strangers around, but also engage with taxi unions, local regulations and labor laws. Others’ natural aversion to such difficulty means you’ll likely get more of a greenfield opportunity.</p>



<p>When Block (then Square) first launched, the hard fact they were addressing was widely known and acknowledged: “cash only.” For many small businesses or at any farmers’ market, there was no way to accept credit cards. Consumers would trudge off to find ATMs and merchants would often miss out on sales. Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey’s unique insight was that smartphones, which were just becoming ubiquitous, could be effectively turned into mobile credit card terminals. Square realized that this supposed hard fact of life was actually a hard problem that it could solve. But finding success meant getting the world to see it no longer had to live with this pain point, and to trust Square’s solution enough to adopt their new way. In order to activate this epiphany and win over early adopters who would evangelize the product, Square made an early decision to give its hardware and software away for free to merchants and figure out a business model later. Eventually, Square became a new standard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2006, marketing mainly consisted of advertising, mailers and telemarketing. This put small businesses at a disadvantage, as these were all high-cost channels. Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah realized there was a new way: small companies could leverage the properties of the fast-maturing internet—blogs, social media, SEO, email newsletters—to reach audiences at a fraction of the cost of traditional channels. HubSpot’s suite of content, SEO and email management tools solved this problem for customers. But in order for customers to believe in their approach and begin adopting their product, HubSpot needed to crystalize the new way in customers’ minds—to make them aware that the old way was broken and could be replaced with something better. They did this by coining a term for their new way—“inbound marketing”— and even wrote a book about it. They were so effective at educating the market that the idea caught on and started a marketing revolution in the small business world, propelling HubSpot to product-market fit and beyond.</p>



 Path 3 – Future Vision 



<p>The Future Vision path has the most ways to fail and the fewest to succeed, but potentially the largest payoff. Taking this path requires endurance and the ability to attract and retain top talent for the long haul.</p>
 



<a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/04/Future-Vision.png"></a>



 
 Future Vision – Case Studies 



<p>Philosopher Søren Kierkegaard said, “Life can only be understood by looking backward, but it must be lived looking forward.” Future Vision founders like Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, who took a tortuous 30-year path to reach the company’s founding ambition, can probably relate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nvidia’s initial vision was to uplevel what PCs are capable of with a 3D graphics chip that would transform the experience of using a computer. When Nvidia released its first chip, it was so ahead of its time that no one knew what to do with it. It took six years and three product lines to find product-market fit in an industry where the GPU enabled irresistible new possibilities: video games. While Nvidia’s original ambition wasn’t limited to the video game industry, it became synonymous with gaming innovation, with its GPUs powering both PCs and Xboxes. Were it not for that very productive pit stop—which propelled Nvidia to profitability and IPO—the company never would have survived long enough to power today’s AI revolution. In fact, they were teetering on bankruptcy before finding PMF in gaming. Thirty years from its founding, Nvidia is enabling a new computing paradigm as GPUs transform everything from data centers to cloud computing.</p>



<p>Future Vision products that fail to find PMF are often described as being “too early.” For instance, 11 years after Google Glass launched, augmented reality still hasn’t gone mainstream. This is precisely why finding pit stops with commercial traction along the way is so critical. Assuming your vision is correct and you can find a viable path, time is on your side with the Future Vision archetype: You can amass an insurmountable headstart while the world comes around to your paradigm. But finding the right pit stops can be difficult. You must act with imperfect information—“live looking forward,” as Kierkegaard said—and the pitfalls are always more obvious in hindsight. Oftentimes finding the right path means embracing unexpected turns, both with the technology you produce and the market you serve.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>OpenAI is one of the most interesting Future Vision stories of our time. Its vision is to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI)—long considered a pipe dream in technology circles—and to do so for the benefit of humanity. To achieve this, they started as a non-profit, since the founders thought the profit motive of a company would undermine their mission of human benefit. A few years into the journey, however, they realized that the cost of compute needed to innovate their large language models outstripped the fundraising capacity of even the best-connected non-profit. Their path required a turn into the for-profit sector. Adopting a more traditional startup structure brought funding as well as expectations for product launches—hence ChatGPT. It instantly found product-market fit in the iPhone paradigm of “I couldn’t imagine wanting it until I saw it.” Consumer demand for generative AI was nascent in 2022. In 2023, OpenAI generated $<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-annualized-revenue-tops-16-billion-information-2023-12-30/">1.6B</a>. While ChatGPT achieved the fastest adoption of any consumer technology product ever, for OpenAI it’s the pit stop they need on the way toward their real ambition.</p>



 Putting it All Together 



<p>Using the framework of these three paths—and keeping in mind that one isn’t better than the others—you can reflect on your own product’s place in the world. What path are you on? How do customers relate to the problem you’re solving? Are you thinking about the right category dynamics? What are your operating priorities? Do you need to optimize for velocity and scale, land an epiphany with early adopters, or strategize the pit stops in your journey?</p>
 



<a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/04/Diagnostic-Desktop.png"></a>



 
 The Quest Continues&nbsp; 



<p>Practice is always messier than theory, and as you apply this thinking in the real world there are several important nuances to keep in mind:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Product-market relationship dynamics are fluid. Over time, many companies end up moving from one path to another as they introduce new products or as customer attitudes change about an existing product and underlying problem. Some companies straddle two paths at once. The point of this framework is not to irrevocably set your path in stone; it would be a mistake to identify yourself too narrowly with any one of them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apple, for instance, started as a Future Vision. The company’s initial memo to Sequoia in 1978 acknowledged that there was zero demand for household computers. “Apple management,” it stated, “believes that most potential customers of 1980 do not today have the slightest interest in purchasing a home computer.” As they captured imaginations and grew in popularity in the ’80s, however, the category of personal computers was no longer a Future Vision. By 1998, with the launch of iMac, Apple addressed a Hard Fact: computers, while increasingly ubiquitous, were impersonal. The iPhone instantly found PMF as a Future Vision when Steve Jobs unveiled it in 2007. The smartphone category then quickly shifted to Hair on Fire dynamics and a flood of new smartphones entered the market. Apple managed to retain its dominance by defining the category, being right and continuing to innovate. Today, Apple is introducing yet another Future Vision with Apple Vision Pro. The device leverages the 10X advancements in sensors developed for the iPhone: the fruits of one product’s PMF journey can create seeds for the next. Will Apple Vision Pro enable entirely new experiences we can’t yet imagine, and fall squarely in the Hair on Fire path a few years from now? Time will tell.</p>
 



<a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/04/Legacy.png"></a>



 
<p>Legendary companies string together multiple product lines that evolve through one path of product-market fit to another. While one product may plateau, the next product starts rising.</p>



<p>You can use this framework to orient yourself regardless of where you are in this cycle. PMF may seem like a destination you’re trying to reach—but keeping and expanding on it once you arrive is an ongoing quest that will last as long as your company does.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

The third test is planned for 12 UTC today (Tuesday 9th of April), and will take place live during the weekly Operator AMA&nbsp;call.</p><p>These performance tests are preparing this global, decentralized community of operators for what is to come: the launch of the first commercial application to run on the Nym network,&nbsp;<a href="https://nymvpn.com/">NymVPN</a>.</p><p>The aim of today’s test is&nbsp;to:</p>  Push substantial traffic through the mixnet, pinpointing and logging any inconsistent error messages and their&nbsp;origins.  Engage the operator community for better ipv6 support after seeing previous tests often fail in this&nbsp;area.  Reach out to individual operators on specific actions, focusing on gateways that aren’t handling traffic properly.  <p>Before we begin today’s test, this blogpost summarises some ofthe initial learnings from the first two performance tests, which were focused on fine-tuning the testing methodology, monitoring and communication with operators.</p>  Are you a Nym node operator? Join the operator <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#operators:nymtech.chat">Matrix&nbsp;channel</a>   The Nym&nbsp;network <p>Nym network is a decentralized <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">infrastructure by independent operators</a>, running one of the world’s most advanced privacy overlay networks: a <a href="https://nymtech.net/about/mixnet">mixnet</a>. These independent operators provide routing and mixing services for any internet traffic, effectively making patterns of communication across the entire internet untraceable. Nym operators are coordinated and rewarded via a token economic system, incentivising the provision of excellent privacy services to applications and end&nbsp;users.</p><p><a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/blog/decentralized-vpns">Decentralized networks can offer unique privacy properties</a>. But they also come with their own set of challenges–such as ensuring consistency of service across nodes. The Fast &amp; Furious performance tests are geared towards solving these challenges so that the network supplies a high quality of service for any application to run on&nbsp;it.</p> Why run performance tests? <p>Guaranteeing strong reliability, high speed and throughput across a global, decentralized network of independent operators is a challenge. And assessing the performance of such a privacy network when it is explicitly designed to prevent any centralized monitoring of traffic adds additional challenges! But this is the aim with the Fast &amp; Furious performance tests: to solve these, one step at a time, in partnership with the Nym operator community.</p> Lab tests are not&nbsp;enough <p>Nym Core dev team runs regular lab tests for benchmarking and to gain insights into how the Nym network might perform. The sandbox environment provides a place for the team to for example test improvements to binaries and for the Nym ecosystem to do their own tests, integrations, tooling and more. This has given some initial estimate of the number of clients that can be sustained per core for each node. However, the real world is complex and full of unexpected issues.</p><p>The real world number of clients per core that a real world Nym node can sustain is not clear. And it is not clear how many clients per node in 2-hop VPN mode. Why? Cloud providers are not always up front when it comes to bandwidth. There might be CPU limits and Gb/s limitations by VPS providers and data center performance varies. In fact, it is unclear exactly which metrics are the most important for improving overall network performance!</p><p>This has to be tested, improved and modeled in order to understand just how many simultaneous users the Nym network can sustain while providing high performance. The aim of the Fast &amp; Furious tests is therefore for both core team and the operator community to gain important insights, including:</p>  How many mixnet clients requesting large amounts of IP traffic from hosts all over the Internet the current set of Nym gateways can&nbsp;handle;  How much sustained IP traffic a subset of mainnet nodes (entry gateways, mix nodes and exit gateways) can&nbsp;sustain;  Improvements to the mix node and gateway binaries to improve the throughput on&nbsp;mainnet;  Measurements to inform required/ optimal machine&nbsp;specs;  Test and improve the quality operations of Nym&nbsp;nodes;  For operators to discover any unexpected rate limiting and throttling by VPS providers;  For operators to learn how to monitor their nodes in a distributed fashion.   What have we learned so&nbsp;far? <p>First of all, we have learned that the Nym operator community is responsive, engaged and are becoming experts and organically mentoring new joiners. In other words, a real community.</p><p>A lot of new operators have joined recently via the delegations and service grants programs, facilitated by community squads. These programs are enabling good communication and coordination with the core team. So far <a href="https://nymtech.net/events/fast-and-furious">340 nodes </a>(212 mix nodes, 128 gateways) are registered for the performance test sessions. One of the main aims of the performance tests is to check how the new Internet Packet Routing for exit gateways are performing. As soon as the team began pushing load through the network, there were quick reactions to learnings. 75% of nodes are now operating with IPR enabled and operators are setting up their own monitoring.</p><p>To enable insights for the performance tests, operators are running a modified binary with an endpoint that monitors packets received, sent and dropped. This endpoint allows operators to easily connect their own<a href="https://nymtech.net/operators/testing/templates.html"> monitoring system</a>. This led to an important learning for most of the community on the importance of <a href="https://nymtech.net/operators/testing/explorenym-scripts.html">decentralized performance monitoring</a>. Here is&nbsp;why…</p> Decentralized networks need decentralized measurements <p>Among the Nym node operator community are seasoned and highly professional Web3 infrastructure operators like <a href="https://nodes.guru/">Nodes Guru</a> and <a href="https://blockfend.com/">Blockfend</a> as well as activists running nodes for social good. This community has built some of the most relied upon and widely used essential tooling for operators and stakers: <a href="https://mixnet.explorers.guru/">Nodes Guru explorer</a>, <a href="https://dashboard.notrustverify.ch/d/CW3L7dVVk/nym-mixnet?orgId=1">No Trust Verify dashboard</a> and the <a href="https://explorenym.net/">Explore Nym</a> rewards calculator. And most recently, for the test, one of the most active ‘Shinobi’ in the community, pawnflake, wrote up a script to help monitor node performance. This led to a broader discussion on important differences between performance monitoring for centralized and decentralized privacy&nbsp;systems.</p><p>The Nym performance test seeks to understand how the Nym network and binaries can be improved. For this reason, the test entails tracing packets received, sent and dropped node-by-node using Prometheus and&nbsp;Grafana.</p><p>This test set-up works well if each node does their own independent monitoring. However, a problem arises if the monitoring is centralized. If nodes track their packets via one single service this will effectively reveal full paths of all packet routing in one place. At that point, decentralization loses its properties as someone would then have the full overview of network communication and be able to learn all kinds of information about who is speaking to who and about&nbsp;what.</p><p>Instead, in true decentralized fashion, it is essential for operators to run their own local monitoring and metrics and simply report back results for further analysis. Pawnflake’s script has therefore been incorporated into guidance for independent node monitoring rather than offered as a central&nbsp;service.</p>  Visit our guides to<a href="https://nymtech.net/operators/testing/templates.html"> setup metrics template</a> and learn how to operate them in self-custodial way   How can we know whether nodes are malicious? <p>Now, you might wonder, what would stop nodes from simply running centralized monitoring of paths now that the new binaries have made this possible for the&nbsp;tests?</p><p>Firstly, for a malicious actor to be able to aggregate all the paths, they would have to convince most operators to provide their data. And after the tests are over they would need to convince operators to run a modified version of the software to be able to log paths. This is socially quite difficult to achieve given the quantity, geographical spread and diversity of Nym node operators. And technically, this will become even more difficult as Nym advisors are currently working on secure enclaves to verify cryptographically that a node is running an unmodified version of the software.</p><p>To formalize the no logs policy further, Nym Core team is preparing new operator Terms &amp; Conditions. This will outline the operator’s legal responsibilities in terms of the software, the Nym network, users and&nbsp;company.</p><p>Finally, it is in a node operator’s best interest to not attempt at collective aggregate metrics and hold unnecessary information as that effectively sets them up as a target for legal action and potential subpoena.</p><p>Overall, this is a <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/blog/decentralized-vpns">major improvement over centralized relay networks like VPNs</a>, who have a full overview of all user&nbsp;traffic.</p> What happens&nbsp;next? <p>The first two tests have enabled operators and the team to learn how best to do a performance test on a live, decentralized mixnet. Something that has never been done before! Nodes have now upgraded to new binaries, decentralized monitoring is set up and the Nym Q/A team have all systems set up. The aim is to understand packets per second, bytes per sec and begin to get a picture of which metrics affect overall performance the&nbsp;most.</p><p>The Nym Q/A team has had 50–100 clients all over the world pushing load through the network, sending and fetching content images, video all over the world. Now the question remains, who will break first? Nym Q/A team or the Nym operators? 😎</p><p>The third test is about to begin!

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>First and foremost, thank you to the community of over 2500 testnet users who have been testing and sharing valuable feedback. Your continued support and patience are critically important to our mission.</p><p>Testnet Stage 4 is now complete, and it provided us with valuable insights, resulting in several updates to our codebase.</p><p>We are excited to announce that Stage 5 of our testnet is live. Stage 5 includes using a third party Bundler service (a.k.a Relayer) and supports gasless transactions via an Account Abstraction Paymaster contract.&nbsp;</p><p>As we get closer to our upcoming mainnet launch, the team has been working on product improvements. In March, we released Enhancement Stage - 1, and the team has been working on more upgrades in parallel with Stage 5 and Stage 6 testnet development. Here’s an overview of the enhancements made:</p><p>Panther gas management: Users can now easily transfer funds between zAssets and their Panther Gas account. This feature is accessible by clicking the Panther Gas icon located in the top right corner of the screen (header).</p><p>UTXO consolidation for deposit: Consolidates a user’s balance into a single UTXO during deposit transactions, allowing users to use their entire balance in a single transaction, eliminating the need for additional Multi-Asset Shielded Pool (MASP) transactions to consolidate smaller UTXOs.<br>Detailed error messages: Provides users with informative error messages, improving the communication of transaction issues.<br>Real-time Data Synchronization: Updates to balances and vouchers are now visible in real-time, so you can make informed decisions quickly and, have greater transparency. <br>Faster wallet engine startup: Reduced startup time by optimizing the cold start phase.<br>Improved cold start times for wallets: The Create Block function is now incorporated into Panther Protocol, and cold start times are reduced.<br>Transactions continue even if you close your tab: Allows transactions to continue in the background, even if the user navigates away, improving transaction continuity.</p> Getting started with Stage 5&nbsp; <p>To start testing Stage 5, visit <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a> for the updated dApp test link and follow the steps.</p> Enhanced gas management <p>Panther has upgraded how you manage your gas costs by integrating with Etherspot’s Skandha ERC4337 Bundler service. With the integration, users will now be able to choose whether to turn this Bundler service on or off before every transaction.<br><br>When left on, the transaction will be sent through the new Bundler service and network gas cost will be deducted from user’s $ZKP balance within its Panther Gas Account.&nbsp; When off, the transaction will go directly from the user’s EOA and the network gas fee will be paid from your connected wallet (metamask) in the native gas token.</p> Improved transaction processing <p>You may already be familiar with zMiner (formerly Oshiya/Miner), which efficiently processes batches of UTXOs, updating the Zero-Knowledge proof within a Merkle tree. This batch processing, on our Bus Tree, is cost-effective but introduces a delay. For those needing quicker processing times, we’ve introduced the Taxi Tree option, now live on the Mumbai testnet, enabling faster processing times akin to a taxi's speed.</p><p>In our updated user interface, you select between Regular Processing (Bus) and Fast Processing (Taxi) options. Also, in Stage 6, you'll have the ability to compare the network costs for both options, empowering you to make informed decisions based on speed and cost efficiency.</p><p>In addition, we have developed an exchange contract to facilitate the payment of Bundlers in native tokens. This contract enables the conversion of $ZKP to $Matic via Uniswap V3 on the Polygon network, streamlining transactions and enhancing our ecosystem’s functionality.</p> UTXO selection update <p>Due to the implementation of two processing modes for newly created UTXOs, there may be a brief period during which some UTXOs are not immediately available for use in subsequent transactions. This temporary limitation—lasting only a few minutes—persists until the Bus Queue or Miner processes the next queue. Specifically:</p>  UTXOs generated by two distinct FAST transactions cannot be spent together.  UTXOs originating from a FAST transaction and a REGULAR transaction cannot be combined.  <p>We want to make sure that you know that these restrictions are temporary, only affecting the period shortly after the creation of a UTXO through a FAST transaction. The limitations are related to the timing of using a UTXO generated by a FAST transaction with other available UTXOs. Importantly, these constraints do not mean that the FAST transaction did not work, and only have a temporary impact on using the output for subsequent transactions.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: In this Stage, the fee component has not been fully integrated yet. Therefore, during testing, it is expected that transactions will be processed via Bundlers, and users will also be able to execute FAST transactions. The implementation of fee deduction and accurate fee calculations are forthcoming and will be introduced in Stage 6.</p>  About Panther Protocol <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. The Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in shielded pools, zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs, and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s ZK primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

This would prevent a ‘race to the bottom’, whereby nodes competing for stake would lower their profit margin and costs to near 0 in an effort to attract stake. The proposal envisioned that a minimum profit margin would promote a healthy dynamic for operators, ensuring a minimum acceptable income for everyone.</p><p>This blogpost gives an update on the current state of this proposal and outlines a process for arriving at a decision. In short, there is currently a suggested minimum profit margin in the Nym wallet interface of 4% and maximum at 80%, as well as a minimum operator cost of 40NYM and max of 2000NYM. These are ‘nudges’ rather than dictates and can be bypassed in the CLI. As of yet no changes have been made on-chain.</p> What happened? <p>Following the community proposal in the early summer last year, a <a href="https://t.me/nymchan_help_chat/64986">sentiment check</a> was taken at the time with a majority of participants in favour. The proposal went to the core team for further discussion, but was not established as a priority at the time as there was little actual operational costs and network load and no clear evidence that a race to the bottom was occurring.</p><p>In the late summer a new behaviour was discovered: operators were setting very low profit margins and operator costs to attract stake and then radically increasing their operator costs shortly after. This led to renewed discussions by the core team leading to a proposal to set a minimum profit margin at 7% and a maximum operator costs at 2000&nbsp;NYM.</p><p>This change was implemented on the wallet interface only, with on-chain changes to follow. With the latest release, min PM was lowered to 4% min and 80% max, and operator costs at min 40 NYM and max 2000&nbsp;NYM.</p><p>This is a limitation on the wallet front end only and can be changed manually via the&nbsp;CLI.</p> What now? <p>The wallet interface changes are nudging operators to set a healthy PM and reasonable OC. This change was set to be implemented on-chain also to ensure equal rules for all, but has since been met with some disagreement among community members. This calls for a deeper discussion and potentially a vote if consensus cannot be reached on the&nbsp;change.</p><p>In the meantime, the change to the front end has the effect of potentially creating an uneven playing field for new operators: new joiners will be encouraged to set the min PM and max OC while older node operators can continue with their existing settings.</p><p>Countering this potentially unfair advantage, Nym Core team are running an official delegations program for high quality operators, giving them a leg up on stake. This has the effect of levelling out the playing field for honest, high quality operators.</p> What next? <p>Taking all these factors into consideration, there is no urgent need to make on-chain changes to profit margin and operator costs. Further discussions on min PM and max OC are encouraged in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#operators:nymtech.chat">Node Operator channel</a> and during the regular operator AMAs (next one on next Tuesday 9th of&nbsp;April).</p><p>Nym core will also be hosting a larger Nym node operator Town Hall towards the end of April to present the Nym Gateway reward scheme following Smoosh and projections for the&nbsp;NymVPN.</p> Resources   <a href="https://nymtech.net/operators">Nym Operator&nbsp;Guide</a>  <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#operators:nymtech.chat">Nym operator channel (Element)</a>   Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#general:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/the-question-of-minimum-profit-margin-for-nym-nodes-142275840da7">The question of minimum profit margin for Nym nodes</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2023, New York City was shrouded in smoke. Staring out the window of my office in the Financial District, I could barely see the East River. I dreaded going outside. The haze, which partially obscured not-so-distant Brooklyn from view, came from a series of devastating Canadian wildfires <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-wildfire-july-18-1.6909596">unlike</a> anything on record, with air quality indexes in NYC reaching 800% above what is considered “safe.” It was also very hot—here, and in so many other cities around the world. A relatively recent phenomenon, the effects of human-induced climate change are staring us in the face. Meanwhile, most experts agree that all of this, and so much <a href="https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/climate-change-fueling-migration-do-climate-migrants-have-legal-protections">more</a>, is only going to get worse.</p>



<p>I’m fascinated by the idea of “climate awakenings”—the moment when the climate crisis goes from an abstract notion to a real and present danger for a person. Why does it occur for some people as children after hearing a story about deforestation of the Amazon, while for others it takes a Category 3 hurricane barrelling toward their doorstep to finally acknowledge it might be real?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Motivating climate awakenings is what Taylor Francis, Avi Itskovich and Christian Anderson hope to do with Watershed, the company they co-founded. “The world needs to decarbonize between 5 to 10% per year,” says Francis. “We wanted to build something that could be a really big contributor to that.” Rather than targeting individuals, Watershed aims to awaken companies, inspiring them to minimize their carbon footprint and transition to clean power sources.</p>



<p>For Francis, 31, the aha moment came via a former Vice President the summer before eighth grade. He remembers seeing Al Gore’s “An Inconvenient Truth” in the theater with his mother and being “pretty shaken.” With no real summer plans to speak of, and with newfound existential dread, Francis took it upon himself to cold-email Al Gore’s office to see how he could lend a hand in saving the planet. To his surprise, he got a response just a few days later: an invitation to Nashville for the following month to attend the Climate Reality Project, a mini-climate advocacy bootcamp.</p>



<p>Over the course of three harrowing days, climate experts walked Francis and a couple hundred activists (all then-13-year-old Francis’s elders by at least 15 years, and one of whom, John Doerr, would later join the board of Watershed) through every slide of the “An Inconvenient Truth” PowerPoint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Francis walked away inspired, but also overwhelmed by the enormity of the challenge ahead. Determined to do something, he started giving hyper-localized, high school-friendly versions of the “Inconvenient Truth” talks in schools and libraries and community centers around the Bay Area. “I talked about the California droughts and wildfires, and I had little handouts to bring home to their parents that said things like ‘switch lightbulbs, buy a Prius, vote,’” he remembers, “and I think kids went home and yelled at their parents in a pretty big way.”</p>



<p>He kept at it in college, studying public policy and nursing a dream of working on climate legislation. But after graduating from Princeton in 2014 (and helping to convince Al Gore to be his “<a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2014/02/14/al-gore-selected-2014-class-day-speaker">Class Day” speaker</a>), that passion was hard to maintain in the face of the government’s seeming apathy on the issue, especially after the <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/anatomy-of-a-senate-climate-bill-death/">Cap and Trade Bill</a> had died in Congress that year. “It was a bit of a ‘what’s next?’ moment for climate policy,” he says—and realizing he didn’t yet know the answer, Francis decided to pivot careers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If I can’t work on climate policy,” he remembers thinking, “I might as well work in an amazing company and learn as much as I can about how to build a company of my own. And that kind of led me back to the Bay Area, into Stripe.”&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Itskovich, 31, never saw “An Inconvenient Truth” as a teen—his attentions in middle school were elsewhere. “My family kind of hopped around a lot,” Itskovich remembers. “I was born in the former USSR, when I was two I moved to Israel and then when I was about 10 I moved to Canada. I think we were preoccupied with, like, other things than climate.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of those things was academic excellence; when Itskovich brought home a 97% on a middle school report card, he was admonished by his dad, who had been schooled in the Soviet system where “anything less than a perfect score meant you weren’t great,” remembers Itskovich. As a high schooler, Itskovich steered this work ethic toward software engineering. After finishing his school’s computer science curriculum, he built an entirely new internal grading system for the school from scratch. By then, CS didn’t feel forced; it felt more like a calling—not just because of what it enabled Itskovich to do, but because of what it enabled others to do. “The power of being able to program is not like, ‘cool, I created the thing,’” says Itskovich. “It’s watching someone else use it, and in ways you might not even have expected.”</p>



<p>After graduating from the University of Waterloo with a degree in computer science and four tech internships in San Francisco under his belt, Itskovich knew he wanted to be at the center of the world’s greatest coding ecosystem, building tools that could empower millions. He returned to the Bay, where he’d landed an engineering gig at Stripe. There, he would meet a couple of key friends who would pull him away from his computer and into the outdoors—and in the process, help him find his life’s next major calling.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>For Anderson, 32, more than either of his co-founders, his climate awakening was something of a foregone conclusion—his father is an environmental policy lawyer who largely worked from home. “He always gave me a solid glimpse into the work he was doing,” remembers Anderson. A passion for climate action felt inevitable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At 10, Anderson made his first foray into early climate tech: He made a website. By then a consummate lover of backpacking and forests, Anderson couldn’t stand the idea of losing the world’s largest one. “It’s the kind of thing that’s so visual when you’re a kid, right?” says Anderson. “Imagine these forests in the Amazon getting chopped to death.” With his dad’s help, he built a web page titled “Foundation for our Future” to educate about conservation and accept donations to protect the Amazon rainforest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was only in high school that the concept of man-made climate change really clicked for Anderson. He remembers learning about it in his classes and feeling moved intellectually. He switched to vegetarianism and became a stickler for recycling, but felt mostly powerless otherwise. Like Francis, he says he couldn’t “connect with it as a problem that I could solve the way you might solve local environmental issues. I saw it as too huge a problem to affect.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>So instead, he followed other, more “accessible” passions, earning dual undergraduate degrees in physics and math at Harvard before being accepted into a physics PhD program at MIT for quantum informatics. But before fully “veering into a deep science direction” and committing to another six or seven years in Boston, Anderson decided he needed a gap year on the other side of the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What he found in the Bay Area’s tech scene reawakened a years-dormant urgency in Anderson. “There were a lot of people in San Francisco working to try to make the world better in an immediate way,” says Anderson. In this crucial juncture, as he was considering the impact he wanted to make in his life and work, that immediacy resonated. “For me it was, do we try to make the world better in a somewhat long-running roundabout way through science or, you know, could I try to build something with my own two hands that makes the world better?” says Anderson.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anderson decided to delay his PhD, and within weeks he had secured an engineering role at a promising young payments startup.</p>

<p>Once their lives converged at Stripe, so did most of the trio’s weekends. Anderson had started organizing small backpacking and camping trips for fellow Stripe outdoors enthusiasts, and while there weren’t many takers, in Itskovich and Francis he found kindred spirits, who were equally intense about outdoor activities. The three would calculate exactly how much outdoor time they could compress into the window between signing off on Friday and logging back in on Monday morning. They would go backcountry skiing in Tahoe, belaying up Mount Diablo and sprint-hiking a Lost Coast route in a day when it was meant to be done in two. “We bonded over this outdoor stuff where it’s all about pushing yourself, taking a risk, taking a challenge, kind of trusting somebody else,” says Anderson. “When something goes wrong and it becomes an adventure—that’s when that bond truly forms,” adds Itskovich with a laugh.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their weekends away also reawakened something that Francis and Anderson, for one reason or another, had placed on the back burner: climate urgency. Back in the office, much like their backpacking intensity, their collective interest in climate-focused work compounded as they worked together. In 2019, Christian started pitching in with Stripe’s early climate efforts, wrangling funds from the company to buy carbon offsets. Eventually, Francis and Itskovich joined him, encouraging other corporations to do the same.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By 2018, their dedication to climate action would be put to the test. In October of that year, an intergovernmental panel on climate change published a report that became known colloquially as the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/">1.5 degree report</a>. Its main claim was that if humanity can limit global warming to just 1.5 degrees Celcius, we can avoid many of the more extreme, damaging impacts of climate change. But that doing so would require “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anderson read the report while visiting a friend on a wooded island off the coast of Vancouver, Canada. Surrounded by water and trees, he remembers thinking, “They did such a good job in that report, balancing the message of, ‘We are not past the point of no return, but the window for action really is closing.’” Just a few months later, Francis and Itskovich felt the same sentiment at an event hosted by the nonprofit Protect Our Winters (POW). One of the speakers presented the reality of climate change in stark terms: “We are the first generation to see the effects of climate change and the last generation to have an impact on it,” Itskovich remembers hearing. “It’s the kind of sentence that gets lodged in your brain and drives urgency. It means oh, maybe I shouldn’t wait five or 10 years to work on climate change. Maybe the time is now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike so many people who hear the alarm bells but find ways to quiet them and carry on with business as usual, the ringing remained deafening for the trio. They started mulling over, first individually, then collectively, what they could do—and how they could do it, fast. Francis and Itskovich left Stripe shortly thereafter, in mid-2019, to focus on climate action full-time, with the understanding that Anderson would join them soon. A few months later, after finalizing his work with Stripe’s climate initiative and handing off his teams, he did.</p>
 



Avi Itskovich, Christian Anderson and Taylor Francis



 
<p>In late fall 2019, the three ex-Stripes gathered around a whiteboard in Anderson’s apartment near Buena Vista Park. They knew only two things for certain: They wanted to work together on something, and that something would be climate-related. What exactly it would be, well, that’s where the whiteboard came in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the next two weeks, they workshopped a different idea every day, sketching out the pros and cons of each on the board. The ideas drew upon each of their respective areas of expertise, and ranged from altering public consciousness (starting a climate-focused media company), to tracking personal emissions (like Strava, but counting carbon instead of kilometers), to structural changes (political advocacy to mobilize bipartisan support for climate legislation), to more consumer-oriented fare (a slickly branded site that enabled consumers to buy clean power with the click of a button).&nbsp;</p>



<p>They evaluated each idea on its ability to remove or reduce 500 million tons of CO2 every year (“We thought it would be pretty awesome to build something that could be driving 10 to 20% of global decarbonization, which needs to be 5 gigatons of CO2 per year,” says Francis), and their ability to make an impact without relying on external societal or technological changes. At the end of two weeks, they concluded that changing hearts and minds wasn’t enough, that creating low-carbon materials like cement and concrete was just one piece of the puzzle (albeit an essential one), and that a consumer focus couldn’t scale. What they needed was to harness the enormous scale of corporate spending and direct it toward renewable energy—a mass corporate climate awakening.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We thought it would be pretty awesome to build something that could be driving 10 to 20% of global decarbonization.”</p>
Taylor Francis</blockquote>



<p>“We wanted to enable companies to take the geyser of money that they currently point at dirty technologies and redirect as much of that as possible toward the clean stuff,” says Francis. “If we could pull that off, we could enable not just one low-carbon cement company, but dozens of low-carbon cement companies and also low-carbon agriculture companies and low-carbon transportation companies and more demand for all the sustainable aviation fuel innovators. We could be this kind of leverage point.” As a bonus, it would give corporations a productive means of responding to any pressure they might face from investors, regulators and customers to take action on climate change.</p>



<p>In Anderson’s living room, the co-founders drafted the first slide of the deck they’d use for sales calls and pitches to investors, putting their value prop in plain terms: They would enable companies to measure their carbon footprint, meaningfully reduce it and report on their progress to employees, customers and investors. “The first slide of the sales deck that we made in 2019 is the same first slide of the sales deck today,” says Francis.</p>



<p>They added a title slide for their still-nameless company. It read: “Powering Carbon Reductions for _____.” Now, in order to catalyze the change they were hoping to accomplish, they just needed to fill in that blank a few thousand times over.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Two days before Christmas 2019, Francis hopped on a flight for an unexpected trip down to Los Angeles. The founders had received an early holiday gift: an email from Sweetgreen’s then head of supply chain and sustainability—a customer they’d been courting for weeks—saying he was free for a last-minute meeting. With Anderson and Itskovich away with their respective families for the holidays, Francis went to take the team’s first major meeting on his own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Francis walked into Sweetgreen’s Culver City office with their pitch deck and an early version of the Watershed platform that Itskovich and Anderson had built in the previous months (they’d settled on their name a month earlier for its dual ecological and idiomatic significance). The product wasn’t pretty—regarding its design, an early advisor had noted, “Whenever I’m in your product, I want to not be in your product.”—but it was functional, and showed how their dashboard could help companies measure and interpret their various sources of carbon emissions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Francis walked through the pitch deck, highlighting the existential nature of their mission and reinforcing their belief in the crucial role companies can play in reducing global carbon emissions. An hour later, he drove home, pleased with the presentation, but unsure how Sweetgreen would respond. “We were so early on doing enterprise sales, I had no idea how it went,” he remembers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within a matter of weeks, Sweetgreen got back to Francis: the restaurant brand had been moved by their vision and was eager to act. And thanks to Watershed’s platform, they could do so in a way that didn’t compromise profits, something instrumental to Watershed’s pitch. They’d officially landed their first major customer. “The key thing here is we’re not pitching ‘climate action at the expense of the corporation.’ We’re helping the corporation put climate into its core and treat it like a business priority,” says Itskovich.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The key thing here is we’re not pitching ‘climate action at the expense of the corporation.’ We’re helping the corporation put climate into its core and treat it like a business priority.”</p>
Avi Itskovich</blockquote>



<p>Over the following months, the founders onboarded Sweetgreen onto a considerably more beautiful (and functional) version of their platform, plugging in the restaurant chain’s food suppliers, farmers and transportation teams in order to understand where they could use the most carbon-friendly adjustments. All the data pointed to two key areas for carbon emission reduction: “Chicken and cheese,” says Itskovich. “You gotta solve your chicken and cheese emissions.”</p>



<p>With that in mind, Watershed helped Sweetgreen develop methodologies for engaging their poultry and dairy suppliers in ways that would increase awareness of their carbon emissions, and foster best practices for reducing them. First, they asked suppliers to fill out a survey. “The key question on the survey that you had to answer was, do you have a methane digester for your manure? For cheese creameries, it’s all about what you do with the manure,” says Francis. Using survey results, Watershed then offered recommendations for Sweetgreen’s suppliers to lower their carbon footprint, and encouraged Sweetgreen to seek out new suppliers if their original ones were unwilling to change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using insights from Watershed’s platform, Sweetgreen has changed its menu to reflect more carbon-conscious ingredients and deploy clean power in every store. With Watershed’s help, the restaurant chain is aiming for complete carbon neutrality by 2027. “The partnership with Sweetgreen has paved the way for what is possible for sustainability in a food system and supply chain like theirs,” says Francis.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Anderson hung up the phone, exhausted. It was early 2020, and in the wake of their Sweetgreen success, Watershed had managed to secure partnerships with Airbnb, Segment, Square and Shopify, all of whom were eager to make climate-friendly changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team got to work on Watershed Marketplace, a hub where customers could access vetted carbon credits, nascent carbon removal technologies, and, in theory, clean energy sources. But the latter was proving difficult to secure. “I legitimately called every major clean power developer in the United States to try to find one who would be willing to do business with a small tech startup,” says Anderson. This was a not-so-short list of 14 or so companies, who without fail would make their opinion of Watershed known. “We were small fries!” remembers Anderson. “It’s this big, expensive, really physically complex industry. They would get some tech startup on the phone that’s like, ‘Hey, we’re building the customer base, we think we could move a lot of your product!’ They were like, ‘Right, okay, sure man.’”</p>



<p>After upwards of 15 calls with a DC-based solar energy company called Sol Systems, Anderson finally got the response he was looking for. Convinced by Watershed’s mission and growing roster of customers, “They said ‘yes,’” remembers Anderson. “Sol Systems was our first Marketplace partner. This was the moment the Watershed Marketplace really got off the ground.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Marketplace established, the co-founders realized it was time to graduate out of Anderson’s living room. In mid-2020, they hired their first two employees and raised a Series A. Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins co-led the round, which also included backing from their former bosses at Stripe, the Collison brothers. “They were amazing mentors to us, so it meant a lot to have their investment—actual and symbolic—in the company,” says Francis.</p>



<p>They moved into a SoMa office space with an airy courtyard (“That was still mega COVID time, so we would do masked outdoor meetings,” says Francis). As the company grew, the trio enjoyed the same jolt of wonder with each new customer that Itskovich had first felt building his school’s grading system—of seeing their creation used in ways they’d never imagined. Like Sweetgreen, some companies used Watershed’s platform to make their supply chain more carbon-friendly. Others, like DoorDash, focused on the vehicles being used to deliver food, increasing the amount of bikes and EVs, while Shopify used Watershed to hone their logistics. For software companies, it was all about changing their data center usage, finding ways to be more carbon-efficient in their use of cloud computing and storage. “Every software company’s supply chain eventually gets very physical,” says Anderson. “What I think people probably don’t know is how much concrete is going into building a data center for, you know, an hour of a Netflix video. Every company is built on the physical world—there’s no company that escapes it.”</p>



<p>Each partnership felt like meaningful, incremental progress toward their monumental goal (i.e., saving the planet). More customers and more data also helped them refine their product, allowing them to work with customers to identify which climate-friendly changes could be made immediately and easily, and which would be the most impactful. “For example,” says Itskovich, “in the food space, the packaging pales in comparison to the food inside the packaging. There’s a big difference between the thing that sounds good and the thing that matters.”</p>



<p>With their business taking off, they realized that their joint professional history had some drawbacks. “One of our weaknesses as a founding team was all coming from the same company,” says Anderson. “And we did a big push to get outside of that, to recognize our blind spots and make a big effort in the first year of the company to build relationships with founders and executives from very different companies and industries.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of those blind spots was hiring. “We had to play catch-up in terms of growing the team. There was a bit of scrambling, kind of misjudging the market time,” says Anderson. For founders schooled in Stripe’s comparatively deliberate growth strategy, rapid expansion posed a challenge. Like their mentors, the founders wanted to personally meet and vet each potential new hire. But gradually, necessity and the advice of their advisors pushed them to delegate hiring responsibilities to other trusted people on their team. “For Watershed, this climate tech market arrived like a tidal wave,” says Sequoia partner Shaun Maguire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, all three admit that even in their most optimistic projections, they were blown away by that tidal wave. “I think we were very wrong in 2019—we thought it was gonna be five to 10 years before the climate imperative broadened out from these early adopters,” says Anderson. But the reality is that the industry was hungry for what they were offering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They attribute this hunger to a broader, collective climate awakening. Not only the kind that’s reflected in accelerating legislation and subsidies and technological progress, but, perhaps more important, the kind I saw outside my window earlier this summer, the kind that’s apparent in wildfire smoke and canceled flights and record-breaking heat and rising tides and shrinking biodiversity. The kind of existential awakening that’s increasingly become difficult to deny, on a personal or a professional level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Francis believes that this awakening has triggered a fundamental corporate shift, “from a mindset around environmentalism as conservation, to solving climate change as an economic, industrial, technological, capitalistic endeavor,” he says. “We have to build a ton of stuff. And the thing that has changed is that clean technologies are a lot cheaper today than they were 10 years ago.” It helps that today, as Maguire puts it, “Certain green technologies have already gotten so good. They’re already better and cheaper.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Certain green technologies have already gotten so good. They’re already better and cheaper.”</p>
Shaun Maguire</blockquote>



<p>This is why a large part of Watershed’s mission is to make it impossible for corporations to participate in climate denial on economic grounds. “I think the fundamental thing that enables Watershed is that even the most ruthless business can prioritize climate right now,” says Anderson. “We can surface the data so they can cut 20 to 40% of carbon today, and then there’ll be another 20 to 40% available by the time you’re done because of technological progress.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sangwon Suh, Watershed’s head scientist and former <a href="https://www.unep.org/">UNEP</a> member, sees businesses as playing an instrumental role in combating climate change. “So many changes are induced by the private sector,” says Suh. “If we can harness the power of the private sector—a sector that’s quick, efficient and not subject to congressional consensus—I think that there is a reason to be hopeful and optimistic about solving this climate change problem.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anderson sees this corporate climate awakening as fundamentally social, feeding off of communication. “I think the x variable that we failed to factor in was that there would be this feedback loop of, as more companies get in, and you get more proof points, it’s easier for the next company to get in.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of these shifts in mindsets, technologies and climate mean that much more of the world is now attuned to the reality of climate change. “At least in the business world, we’re past the climate denialism phase,” says Anderson. But as all three founders experienced at one point or another, more understanding can also mean more dread. “Climate doomerism is the feeling that there’s nothing [we can] do. Or the only thing that we can do is some sort of complete systemic change that eradicates existing businesses altogether. This is one of these other challenges—getting really clear data to businesses on the short-term action that you could actually do that will actually move the numbers this year,” says Anderson. “I think if we can just keep getting that message successfully out there, it’ll succeed.”</p>



 



<p>Now that more corporations are awakened to the challenge, the real work can begin. “We have a long way to go, but already more than 527 million tons of CO2 are managed by companies that use Watershed,” says Francis. “So we’ve gotta scale that number up.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>While most people would find the task daunting, Watershed’s founders see more reasons for optimism than ever, in part because of their front-row seat to all of the talent and ingenuity being devoted to averting the climate crisis. “Cement and steel are great examples of industry sectors where historically there has been no low-carbon alternative,” says Anderson. “And we are just now at the threshold of having commercially viable low-carbon options for both.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carbon removal technologies are also making strides. Suh is particularly excited about “biological approaches like growing biomass and turning that into more permanent storage for carbon, or using carbon to produce more permanent polymers that do not degrade over time.” he says. There’s also the development of “direct air capture,” a solution that works by capturing carbon from the air, heating it up to the point of saturation, then storing it all in rock form where it can’t leak back into the atmosphere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Every week at our all-hands, we have this thing called climate corner,” says Itskovich. In recent meetings, the team has learned about which materials in the apparel industry are most emissive (animal-based products like wool), about ways to create lower-carbon cement (reducing the amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement_clinker">clinker</a>) and about pathways to net-zero emissions from aviation (replacing fossil jet fuel with biofuels or synthetic fuels).&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it’s this idea, this regular, communal exposure to climate science, more than anything else the founders have told me, that feels like an answer to my question of why their climate awakenings occurred earlier than most. Crucially, it also reveals an answer of sorts to how we can ensure that others have similar awakenings before it’s too late. For Watershed’s founders, it took seeing the impacts of climate change, but it also took engaging in a meaningful climate dialogue with people they trusted. It’s what Watershed is doing internally, and it’s a conversation they’re continuing to foster in the private sector around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re doing a rafting trip with our executive team in Montana in late September,” Francis shares as we wrap up our conversation, a reminder of the foundational joy that fuels all their urgency and long hours and coding and selling and problem-solving. “It would be the first time we’ve done an outdoors trip with a broader group within the company—but I think it could be very successful,” adds Anderson with a smile. That “could” seems to imply that the trio hasn’t completely ruled out sprint-hiking from the agenda.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recently, Brave announced the first step of our goal to bring Leo—our privacy-preserving AI assistant in the browser—to Brave mobile with our <a>Android release</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, Brave is happy to announce the completion of this goal, with the release of Leo for iOS. iPhone and iPad users who update to version 1.63 can ask Leo questions, summarize pages and PDFs, translate pages, create content, and more from the browser address bar.</p>
<p>Leo enables natural conversations on a wide range of topics. With AI built right in the browser and several large language models (LLMs) to choose from, Leo makes it easy to interact with AI in a seamless, familiar way.</p>
<p>For the second half of our mobile launch, we’ve added in a special feature available only on iOS. With voice-to-text capability, iOS users can speak their input and have it converted to text without needing to type. This streamlines the interaction and makes conveying information to the AI assistant even easier. Couple this with document integrations and <a>new models like Mixtral</a>, and Leo for iOS becomes a powerful, mobile AI assistant you can take with you wherever you go.</p>

 What can Leo do? 
<p>Leo can handle any number of tasks, both in the context of the webpages you’re viewing and completely separate from this context. Among other things, Leo can:</p>
 
 Create real-time summaries of webpages and PDFs 
 Answer questions about content 
 Get instant answers for queries 
 Generate new long-form written content such as reports, articles, or social media 
 Translate pages, analyze, or rewrite them 
 Write and suggest software code for multiple languages&nbsp; 
 
<p>In addition to these great core use cases, we integrated Leo in the Brave browser app especially with mobile users in mind, including:</p>
 
 Voice-to-text: Use your iOS device’s voice-to-text functionality to speak prompts directly to Leo, converting your spoken words into written text without typing. 
 Docs and PDF summaries: Leo can summarize different types of content files—including PDFs—making it much easier to consume dense content on a small screen. 
 Google Docs integration: You can use Leo to power your mobile productivity with the Google Docs and Google Sheets integration. Brainstorm and assist on writing, create quick summaries, translate, and more. 
 
<p>With Leo on iOS, you can maximize productivity as you move between home, office, and anywhere else you go. All with the same privacy and security guarantees of the Brave browser. With Brave Leo, there’s no login or signup required—you just open your browser and chat.</p>

 Mixtral as the default LLM brings higher quality answers 
<p>Brave Leo gives access to several high-quality large-language models (LLMs), ensuring better, more relevant answers to even niche questions, and fewer of the hallucinations that plague other AI experiences.</p>
<p>Out of the box, Leo includes access to Mixtral 8x7B, Claude Instant, and Llama 2 13B. Mixtral—the default LLM—can interact in multiple languages including English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mixtral 8x7B has quickly gained popularity and usage among the developer community since its December, 2023 release. Mixtral 8x7B currently outperforms ChatGPT 3.5, Claude Instant, Llama 2, and many others, according to the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard">LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard</a>. Mixtral also shows improvements in reducing hallucinations and biases, <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/">according to the BBQ benchmark</a>.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, <a>we recently set Mixtral 8x7B as the default LLM</a> for Leo on desktop, and we’ve seen great feedback. And while Mixtral is the default LLM for iOS as well, users have the option to select from other LLMs, or to upgrade to Leo Premium for higher rate limits.</p>

 Leo Premium&nbsp; 
<p>The Brave Leo experience is free to all users. For those who’d like access to higher rate limits, however, Leo is also available as a Premium experience. Users can subscribe to Leo Premium for <a href="https://account.brave.com/?intent=checkout&amp;product=leo">$14.99/month</a>, and one subscription covers up to 5 different devices across iOS, Android, Linux, macOS, and Windows.</p>

 Smart AI, still private by default 
<p>As with all of Brave’s other features, privacy remains paramount for Brave Leo. Chats with Leo are private and secure. Leo doesn’t record chats, or use them for model training, and no account or login is required to use Leo. These specific privacy protections in Leo include:</p>
 
 Reverse proxy: All requests are proxied through an anonymization server so the request and user cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address. 
 Responses discarded: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded after they’re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers that can be linked to you (such as <a>IP address</a>), and no personal data is retained by Brave-hosted AI models. If you select a model from Anthropic and submit Leo queries, that data will be processed by Anthropic for a period of 30 days, then deleted. See more in our <a>Privacy Policy</a>. 
 No login or account required for access for the free version: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo. 
 Unlinkable subscription: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you use to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience. 
 

 What’s next for Leo, and how to get started 
<p>Brave Leo for iOS is now available to all Brave iOS users who’ve updated to version 1.63. Note that it will be rolled out in phases over the next few days, so users should check back soon if they’re not seeing it today.</p>
<p>Ready to try Brave Leo? It’s easy: Simply open the browser, begin typing in the address bar, and click  “Ask Leo”. For the on page chat experience, iOS users can tap “…” and then tap Leo to get started.</p>
<p>Leo is an opt-in feature and can be disabled at any time. Users can easily disable auto suggestions by going to Settings, tapping Leo and disabling Show autocomplete suggestions in the address bar.</p>

This makes it far easier for anyone in the Cosmos ecosystem to start staking NYM tokens and help secure privacy as a fundamental right in the digital&nbsp;age!</p><p>This development is a direct response to Nym community’s request to make it easier for NYM token holders to delegate stake to mix nodes. Delegating stake is an essential part of the Nym <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/depin-and-nym-a-decentralized-physical-infrastructure-network-for-privacy-e41db833816c">DePin flywheel</a> effect. It is a direct value transfer that rewards people in the Nym community for the added value of collectively ensuring high quality of service through staking rewards. (If this all sounds alien to you, scroll down to learn about NYM staking for beginners).</p> What do you need to&nbsp;know? <p>The <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">Nym Explorer</a> is a window into the Nym privacy mixnet. It allows people to browse all the different nodes that make up this global infrastructure, assess their performance, their reputation, where they are located and more. If you are a NYM token holder, the Explorer is likely one of your essential tools for selecting a mix node, delegate stake and start earning. But you would have had to copy the node’s ID from the explorer and then go to your Nym <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/wallet">desktop wallet</a> to delegate.</p><p>The Explorer release provides two new ways for anyone to stake their native NYM tokens: from their mobile phone using the <a href="https://www.keplr.app/">Keplr</a> application as well as from desktop browsers, using the <a href="https://www.keplr.app/">Keplr</a> browser extension.</p><p>The NYM token is the utility token of the Nym mixnet and was minted on Nyx, a fast-finality Cosmos SDK blockchain. With Keplr wallet being one of the popular wallets in the Cosmos ecosystem, the new release enables the broader Cosmos community to more easily take part in securing the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>1) Holders of native NYM tokens can now stake on mix nodes using the Nym Network Explorer and a Keplr Wallet&nbsp;login.</p><p>2) Delegation is also possible through your mobile device, accessing the Nym Network Explorer (<a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">https://explorer.nymtech.net/</a>) from the Keplr mobile wallet’s integrated browser.</p><p>3) This is just one step towards enabling more seamless staking in Nym. More wallets are lined up for NYM token integration. In the meantime, do get in touch with improvement proposals, ideas or feedback related through an email <a href="mailto:feedback@nymtech.net">feedback@nymtech.net</a>.</p>  For community built &amp; maintained Nym mixnet explorers see <a href="https://mixnet.explorers.guru/">Nodes Guru</a> and <a href="https://explorenym.net/">Explore Nym</a> for and by the community   Basic guides for beginners — stake your NYM&nbsp;tokens <p>Do you want to contribute to security privacy as a fundamental human right? And earn rewards for doing so? If you are a beginner, here is how to get started with the Nym token economics. First thing is to join one of the community channels. Here you will have the chance to win NYM tokens by participating in one of the weekly quizzes and contests and get more information on how to get hold of native NYM tokens. Then get the Keplr wallet or Nym desktop wallet to hold your&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Staking means to lock up your tokens with a node in the network (you can unlock whenever you want). You will want to select a high quality node so you can earn good rewards and so that the network continues to perform&nbsp;well.</p>  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/how-to-stake-in-the-nym-mixnet-15a28d687e56">Read this article for a step-by-step staking&nbsp;guide</a>  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/want-to-stake-in-nym-here-is-how-to-choose-a-mix-node-to-delegate-nym-to-c3b862add165">Learn how to select mix node to start&nbsp;staking</a>  <p>You will want to check in on your delegations every once in a while to make sure the nodes you selected are still doing a good job.

You can either create a new wallet or add an existing Nym account to the Keplr wallet using your mnemonic.  Add the Nyx chain to your wallet, by selecting it on <a href="https://chains.keplr.app">https://chains.keplr.app</a>  Send NYMs to your Keplr Nym address that you’ll delegate&nbsp;from.  Navigate to the Nym network explorer: <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">https://explorer.nymtech.net/</a> and click — Connect Wallet &amp; authorize your Keplr to interact with the Nym explorer. Make sure that you have your Nym mainnet selected in&nbsp;Keplr!  Use your criteria to filter the list of nodes (for newcomers: look for higher saturation, lower operating cost / margin&nbsp;nodes).  Hit the delegate button next to your chosen mix node and approve the transaction in your Keplr&nbsp;wallet.  <p>You can access your delegations under the “delegations” tab in the explorer. And remember: staking and un-staking takes up-to an hour, and your rewards auto-compound. You can always check your pending actions under the delegations tab.</p> Stake NYM from your mobile device using&nbsp;Keplr   Download and install the Keplr mobile&nbsp;app.  Set up an account (or import an existing Nym account using your mnemonic password) and navigate with the built-in browser in Keplr to: <a href="https://chains.keplr.app">https://chains.keplr.app</a>, search for Nyx chain and add the&nbsp;chain.  Once the Nyx chain is added, you can send NYM tokens from an exchange or another wallet that you want to delegate&nbsp;to.  Open the integrated browser again in your Keplr wallet app, and navigate to the Nym network explorer: <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">https://explorer.nymtech.net/</a>  Make sure you have Nym mainnet selected in&nbsp;Keplr!  Click — Connect Wallet &amp; authorise your Keplr wallet app to interact with the Nym&nbsp;explorer  Use your criteria to filter the list of nodes (for newcomers: look for higher saturation, lower operating cost / margin nodes) and hit the delegate button next to your selected mix&nbsp;node  Approve the transaction in your Keplr&nbsp;app  <p>You can access your delegations under the “delegations” tab in the explorer.

<p>Anish Mohammed, Co-Founder, CTO, and Chief Scientist at Panther Protocol, recently joined Meher Roy on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwhBWdn3R5M&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Epicenter Podcast</a>. They discussed Anish’s journey into crypto, the genesis of Panther Protocol, how Panther will preserve the privacy of its users, what’s coming in its Mainnet launch, and its mission to enable privacy and compliance in the DeFi space.&nbsp;</p> Who is Anish Mohammed? <p>Anish Mohammed’s foray into the tech world began at Ericsson, where he developed payment systems and became familiar with cryptography. His two decade-long career in security and cryptography has seen him design and audit several blockchain protocols and advise leading Web3 projects. His previous roles include being the lead security architect at HSBC and Lloyds Banking Group, and he’s held strategic positions at Accenture and Capgemini. Four years ago, Anish and Oliver Gale embarked on a journey to found Panther Protocol, a Zero-Knowledge, cross-protocol layer to safeguard user data and facilitate compliant DeFi access.</p> The need to preserve privacy and enable compliance <p>Panther Protocol addresses a critical gap in current blockchain technologies, where public ledgers like Bitcoin and Ethereum expose all transactions and smart contract interactions. This lack of privacy can disadvantage high-performing investors and significantly impact high-volume traders and corporations, who may want to protect the insights and advantages (or alpha) gleaned from their trading strategies. Unlike many 'dark’ pools and privacy chains, which lack transparency and complicate regulatory compliance, Panther provides DeFi users with access to its privacy-preserving protocol but also enables their transaction history to be disclosed to anyone of their choosing, in part or as a whole, at will, enabling compliance. For example, a user might disclose certain information to a tax authority or a regulator, as required in their jurisdiction. Panther uses Zero-Knowledge proof-enabled KYC checks to ensure malicious actors do not use the protocol.</p> Preserving privacy amid disclosure <p>While Panther Protocol allows users to disclose transactions as needed, Panther takes steps to ensure there is always sufficient overall volume to mask non-disclosed transactions effectively.</p><p>One key component of how this gets done is via network participants who are rewarded for staking their assets to generate additional transactions and increase liquidity pools. In the process, the privacy of non-disclosed transactions is preserved.&nbsp;</p> The importance of Shielded Pools for DeFi's future <p>Shielded Pools are at the heart of Panther Protocol, offering a privacy-centric solution for DeFi transactions. These pools, supported by advanced cryptographic methods like zk-SNARKs, allow users to transact while retaining the option to disclose information for compliance. The Shielded Pool is pivotal for the Protocol, enabling users to interact with DeFi applications privately and securely.</p><p>For a deeper dive into Shielded Pools, including the intricacies of Zones and Zone Managers, visit<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-shielded-pools-the-cornerstone-of-panther-protocol/"> Panther’s blog on </a>Shielded Pools.</p> What’s coming in Panther’s Mainnet beta launch? <p>Anish presented some of the features that Protocol participants can expect to see in the upcoming&nbsp; Mainnet beta product:&nbsp;</p>  zAccount registration. A zAccount is your private identity and entry point to Panther, aligning with KYC protocols and using Zero-Knowledge proofs.  Privacy-staking reward mechanism: Panther incentivizes network participants to enhance the pool’s transaction set and liquidity by staking assets.  Transactions and communication between Zones: exchange of assets and information across different Zones in Panther.  Withdrawals: The action of converting and transferring zAssets back to standard tokens.  Basic disclosures: The user can reveal details about transactions conducted within Panther, allowing for compliance and verification.  Advanced disclosures: Offers users the capability to selectively disclose specific aspects of their transactions, providing flexibility in privacy and compliance.  zAccount renewals: Regular verification and update of a user’s KYC information to ensure ongoing compliance and integrity of their zAccount.  DeFi Swap adapter: A tool that integrates Panther with external DeFi platforms, facilitating private and compliant swaps and other transactions.  zTrade: Zero-Knowledge trades with others in the same Zone.   Conclusion <p>As DeFi continues to evolve, the need for on-chain privacy solutions that accommodate regulatory compliance becomes increasingly critical. Panther Protocol, under the guidance of Co-Founder Anish Mohammed, is at the forefront of addressing this challenge. By pioneering Shielded Pools and facilitating the role of Zone Managers, Panther is setting a new standard for privacy preservation and compliance in DeFi. Panther Protocol’s innovative approach protects users’ data and paves the way for institutional participation in the DeFi ecosystem. As Panther progresses toward its next development phases, the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">call for testers</a> lets you, the community contribute to a more private and compliant DeFi future.&nbsp;</p><p>Join Panther’s journey in shaping a balanced world where privacy meets compliance, empowering users and institutions to navigate the DeFi landscape securely and transparently.</p> About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in Shielded Pools; zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs; and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s Zero-Knowledge primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

         TL;DR&nbsp; 
 
 Horizen’s proof verification chain is live on testnet!&nbsp; 
 Aims to redefine blockchain efficiency with ZK proof verification and settlement layers 
 Marks a significant milestone for web3 as the first instance of a modular proof verification network 
 Future plans include enhancing zkStack compatibility and opening up testnet access to the public 
 
<p>We are excited to announce that Horizen has achieved a major milestone: the deployment of our proof verification chain to testnet.&nbsp; This leap forward signals a new era for the Horizen ecosystem, where we aim to redefine blockchain efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
 Backstory: 
<p>Horizen is pioneering a new layer in the modular blockchain stack focusing on ZK proofs verification and settlement. This focus dramatically reduces costs and improves efficiency for zk rollups and appchains. Following the passing of <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42400-modernizing-horizen-technology-via-a-modular-proof-verification-layer/394">ZenIP 42400</a>, we have been heads down building and leveraging dev tools like Substrate, Polkascan, and other open-source resources to bring our vision to life rapidly. Check out this 10-minute demo to see Horizen’s proof verification chain live in action!</p>     
 

 
                     
             
                                    
                                 
            
         
        
             

 
         
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why This Matters? 
<p>The launch of this testnet marks a significant point for the broader web3 space as the first instance of a modular proof verification network. The New Horizen network is composed of the following key components:</p>
 
 A Revamped Mainchain: Powered by Substrate, the Horizen mainchain is the foundation for our modular proof verification network. This network allows for the exchange of $ZEN (Horizen’s native token) and verification of FFLONK Proofs produced by Polygon zkEVM instances. 
 Proof Submission Interface: A user-friendly interface that enables zk-rollups to submit proofs seamlessly to the Horizen network for verification. 
 Attestation Mechanism: A protocol published on date to Ethereum and validates proofs (providing additional transparency). 
 New Horizen Smart Contract: The storage and validation mechanism on Ethereum that allows Horizen users to verify that their proof was included in an attestation. 
 Polygon zk-EVM Rollup: A rollup built with Polygon’s CDK that generates and submits proofs to Horizen’s proof verification chain. 
 
 Looking Ahead: 
<p>Celebrating this milestone is just the beginning. Horizen is committed to pioneering advancements in the modular blockchain space, focusing on dramatically reducing costs and improving efficiency for rollups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are already setting our sights on the next development phase, with lots of exciting developments on the horizon!</p>
<p>Here’s what you can expect from us in the coming months:</p>
 
 Enhanced Compatibility with zkStack: We aim to expand the compatibility of New Horizen with zkStack, and further broaden its interoperability and market reach. 
 Opening Up Access to the Public: In the spirit of bringing our community along for feedback, we will open up access for the Horizen community to run testnet nodes and become validators.

  Partnering with Zafran: Put Your Defense on Offense  <p>Sanaz, Ben and Snir are empowering security teams to fight attacks—with the controls, rules and actions they already have.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/doug-leone/">Doug Leone</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bogomil-balkansky/">Bogomil Balkansky</a>	 



Published March 28, 2024
  







 
<p>In the old days of cybersecurity, you could fix every problem and patch every vulnerability. But those days are long gone. AI is accelerating the speed and ability of legitimate developers and bad actors alike, and the number of attacks keeps growing exponentially. Today’s security teams face a never-ending game of whack-a-mole​​—for every threat they mitigate, two more take its place. It’s an asymmetric battle they must keep fighting but can never win.</p>



<p>Part of the challenge is speed: a recent <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2023/02/28/a-shifting-attack-landscape-rapid7s-2022-vulnerability-intelligence-report/">Rapid7 report</a> found most vulnerabilities are exploited within a week, but remediation can take weeks or months—if it’s feasible at all. While a security team may be able to spot a problem and recommend a patch quickly, they’re at the mercy of busy colleagues in Engineering or DevOps to deploy it.</p>



<p>But even if a company had the unlimited resources necessary, patching every one of its thousands or millions of known vulnerabilities simply wouldn’t make sense—because only a fraction of them are actually dangerous. More often, vulnerabilities exist in a function that’s never called by the code, or a server that’s not exposed to the internet. Addressing these non-problems would be a waste of time and money, and it would introduce risk; modifying existing systems is the number one cause of downtime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What security teams really need is a way to identify, and quickly defuse, the vulnerabilities that are truly a threat—and that’s why Sanaz Yashar, Ben Seri and Snir Havdala created <a href="https://www.zafran.io/">Zafran</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through their work in top security companies and Israeli intelligence, Sanaz, Ben and Snir saw firsthand the frustrations security teams were facing. But they recognized what many others did not: most teams already have more than enough security tooling. What they lack, instead, is better information about how to use it. By connecting to both vulnerability data and an organization’s existing controls, rules and actions, Zafran empowers security teams to identify and defuse threats far more quickly.</p>



<p>The platform correlates control configurations with runtime data, internet exposure, and threat intelligence to pinpoint which vulnerabilities are exploitable—but that’s just the first step. Zafran then adjusts existing security controls, working seamlessly with endpoint detection and response, firewalls, cloud tools and more, to proactively reduce risk and defuse vulnerabilities. It puts companies’ defense on offense—and puts the power to stop attacks and defuse threats in the hands of security teams, freeing them and their teammates up to patch only where it’s really needed.</p>



<p>It’s an innovative product—and we at Sequoia are just as excited about the stellar team. Sanaz is a force of nature, and when Bogomil had the pleasure of spending time with her, Ben, Snir and the rest of Zafran recently in Tel Aviv, he found a group of people with deep experience to match their vision. We are proud to support them and lead their Series A.</p>



<p>No doubt there are plenty of challenges still ahead for companies fighting to reduce risks, adapt to evolving threats and gain the upper hand against attackers. But the work the Zafran team is doing is a critical step toward leveling the playing field and setting security teams up to win.</p>

<p>The Zebra team has released an alpha version of the Zebra Launcher, which enables Zebra to be installed and run on common operating systems without a command-line interface (CLI) or any prerequisites other than the operating system itself.</p>



<p>As of <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra-launcher/releases/tag/v0.0.0-alpha.1">Zebra Launcher v0.0.0-alpha.1</a>, there are now installers for Windows, MacOS, and Debian.</p>



<p>The Zebra Launcher bundles the compiled binary from the latest zebrad code on the main branch, as of the March 7th 2024, <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/tree/9b91d4bc0e7a78566e62af8b129c14be82f8d67e">commit</a>, with the latest changes in zcash_script from<a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zcash_script/pull/108"> Restore Windows support with MSVC</a> building on another hack sprint project for restoring Windows support to Zebra. (Thanks Conrado!!) It streams Zebra’s logs to a native desktop application window, displays Zebra’s configuration, and allows for updating the configuration from within the app.</p>



<p>Made with a web-based UI and a Rust backend, it uses <a href="https://tauri.app/">Tauri</a> as the application framework for inter-process communication and SolidJS as its UI framework.</p>



<p>SolidJS is a relatively new UI framework with a reactive architecture for managing state and displaying updates that offers a robust developer experience, a minimal memory footprint, and minimal updates to the webview that helps keep the UI quick when it’s displaying lots of data and to keep the project maintainable as it grows.</p>



<p>Using a web-based UI with Tauri and SolidJS allows for embedding other web-based projects, such as Grafana or Zingo-PC, into the Zebra Launcher’s UI, enabling users to access them all in one place.</p>



<p></p>



 What’s Next 



<p>The Zebra Launcher currently includes checks and example data for displaying previews of its appearance in-browser without the Rust backend, and a CI workflow for deploying those previews on every pull request so that it’s easy to review style changes. However, there aren’t any automated tests checking the states in either the TypeScript frontend or the Rust backend, we would need to add these initial tests to help find and fix bugs, and to ensure that bugs aren’t reintroduced as we add features or make changes.</p>



<p>There are also several low-effort, high-impact fixes and improvements on the horizon:</p>



 
 Zebra icons (it currently uses the default Tauri icons) 



 Adding a system-tray menu and keeping the zebrad process running when the Zebra Launcher window is closed. 



 Enabling Tauri’s built-in updater so users are notified when updates are available and so that it’s as easy as possible to download and install those updates. 



 Buttons for starting and stopping zebrad. 



 Bundling external binaries for Prometheus and Grafana, and embedding the Grafana dashboard in the Zebra Launcher UI. 
 



<p></p>



<p>There are other ideas for features that could require more effort and which could be prioritized based on community feedback:</p>



 
 Community page for keeping up with the latest updates across ZCash Discord servers, the Community Forum, and the Zebra Github repository, or to inform us about bugs and development opportunities. 



 Validated form for updating Zebra’s configuration 



 A dashboard page and search bar 



 Progress bars based on Prometheus metrics. 



 Embedded desktop wallet in the Zebra Launcher UI such as Zingo-PC. 
 



<p>We want to provide a delightful user-experience for our community, which is what motivated us to work on this project, and we’re excited about the opportunities for making it better.</p>



<p>Please <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra-app/releases/tag/v0.0.0-alpha.1">try it out by downloading and running the installer for your operating system</a> and let us know what you think! We would also welcome any improvements to the project in the form of issues, discussions, or PRs on the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra-app">zebra-launcher Github repository</a>.</p>

  AI Ascent 2024  <p>Sequoia convened leaders in AI for a day of conversations, talks and demos.</p>   
	By Team Sequoia	 



Published March 26, 2024
  



 
<p>On March 20, we hosted our second AI Ascent event in San Francisco, bringing together 100 leading founders and researchers in AI to discuss what partner Pat Grady calls, “the single greatest value creation opportunity mankind has ever known.” Partner Sonya Huang set the stage for how the promise of Generative AI to revolutionize industries and provide amazing productivity gains is starting to come into focus. And partner Konstantine Buhler looked ahead to how AI will infuse the companies of the future.</p>



<p>Over the course of the day we chatted with AI leaders including Sam Altman of OpenAI, Dylan Field of Figma, Alfred Mensch of Mistral, Daniela Amodei of Anthropic, Andrew Ng of AI Fund, CJ Desai of ServiceNow and (currently) independent researcher Andrej Karpathy. The talks ranged from the merits of large and small models, the rise of reasoning agents, the future of compute and the evolving AI ecosystem.</p>



<p>Below is a selection of highlights from the event (some sessions were off the record):</p>

<p>It was really fun for me to participate in the last Zebra Hackathon Sprint, a 2-week period to be creative, explore new ideas and build some proof of concept projects.&nbsp;This time I worked on <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/openapi.html">an OpenAPI specification for Zebra RPC methods</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 Zebra OpenAPI Specification 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In order to provide a documentation resource for Zebra RPC methods, an openapi.yaml specification was added to Zebra,<a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/blob/main/openapi.yaml"> located at the root of the project</a>. This file can be pasted into <a href="https://editor.swagger.io/">Swagger Editor</a> to automatically render documentation for Zebra’s RPC methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
Zebra API in Swagger
 &nbsp; 
<p>If you have a zebrad node running at http://localhost:8232 you will be able to send commands to the blockchain and retrieve data. Otherwise, you can still view the documentation for the methods in the Swagger interface. More information can be found at the<a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/openapi.html"> Zebra OpenAPI book page</a>. The OpenAPI proof of concept pull request is available<a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/8342"> here</a>.</p>
<p>If there is interest, this documentation could be hosted somewhere similar to <a href="https://zcash.github.io/rpc/">https://zcash.github.io/rpc/</a>, and be kept up to date with changes and additions to Zebra’s RPC interface. In the meantime, please try it out and let us know what you think!&nbsp;</p>

 Introducing Switch — The Gateway Currency to Switch Between Stablecoins on&nbsp;Verus  Switch is a decentralized currency fully backed by VRSC, DAI, USDC &amp; EURC. Use it to switch between Verus and the different stablecoins. Or hold it while it accrues value from conversion fees.  ⏱️ Switch is launched on block: 2,984,851 (Saturday 30 March,&nbsp;2024).  🔁 Convert VRSC, DAI, USDC or EURC to Switch, or vice versa. Or use Switch as an AMM and convert the reserves with each&nbsp;other.  ❓ <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/usdc">USDC</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/eurc">EURC</a> are stablecoins issued by <a href="http://www.circle.com">Circle</a>. DAI is a USD stablecoin issued by&nbsp;<a href="https://makerdao.com/en/">Maker</a>.  💸 Low-cost, MEV-resistant DeFi conversions with max. fees of&nbsp;0.05%.  ⌨️ See the Switch statistics (protocol prices, amount in reserves) at <a href="https://cryptodashboard.faldt.net">Cryptodashboard</a> or <a href="https://raw.verus.trading">verus.trading</a>. Or type in /switch in the #trading channel in the <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">community Discord</a>.  📚 Learn in this article how to convert the stables with each other, and how to convert to and from Switch. Also you learn how to bridge EURC or USDC to the Verus&nbsp;network.  What is&nbsp;Switch? <p>Switch is a decentralized currency on the Verus blockchain. It is fully (100%) backed by its reserves. Its initial supply is 20,000&nbsp;Switch.</p>  Its reserves are weighted as follows: VRSC (16%), DAI DAI.vETH (21%), USDC vUSDC.vETH (21%) &amp; EURC EURC.vETH (42%). What does this mean? E.g. when you put EURC in the reserves you get more Switch after preconversion than when you put VRSC&nbsp;in.  Use Switch to convert between any of the reserves for a max. fee of 0.05%. Switch is a MEV-resistant AMM. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/sendcurrency/">Learn more about Verus&nbsp;DeFi.</a>  Switch accrues 50% of the conversion fees — the conversion fees stay in the reserves, increasing the value of&nbsp;Switch.  The other 50% of the conversion fees go to the miners and stakers of&nbsp;Verus.  There is a risk to holding Switch — USDC &amp; EURC are distributed by the centralized company&nbsp;Circle.  The supply of Switch is dynamic. Switch gets minted when people convert to it from VRSC, DAI.vETH, vUSDC.vETHor EURC.vETH, and get burned when people convert back to the reserves.    Register subIDs— *.Switch@ for a 10 EURC (in Switch) fee. Those fees get burned. <a href="http://docs.verus.io/verusid">Learn more about subIDs (VerusIDs).</a>  Switch is perfect to use with <a href="https://docs.verus.io/veruspay/">VerusPay</a> — Get your local businesses to take DAI, USDC &amp; EURC on Verus. If you hold VRSC, DAI, or USDC and need to buy coffee in EURC, just scan a QR code! Verus scales to everyone worldwide and auto-converts payments from your favorite currency for always low transaction fees &amp; a 0.05% conversion fee.   There was a preconversion period for&nbsp;Switch <p>There was a 7-day preconversion period where the reserves of Switch were filled with VRSC, DAI DAI.vETH, USDC vUSDC.vETH &amp; EURC EURC.vETH. Depending on how much people added they got their fair share of the 20,000 Switch after the 7 day&nbsp;period.</p><p>After the 7-day period Switch became a MEV-resistant AMM. All reserves can now be converted between each&nbsp;other.</p> How to bridge USDC &amp; EURC over to&nbsp;Verus <p>USDC and EURC are ERC-20 token stablecoins issued by Circle. Get them on <a href="http://www.coinbase.com">Coinbase</a> or other exchanges. On the Verus blockchain they are called vUSDC.vETH &amp; EURC.vETH.</p><p>DAI DAI.vETH is readily available on the Verus network. Below are the ERC-20 token contracts for the&nbsp;tokens:</p>  <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48">USDC token&nbsp;contract</a>  <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x1aBaEA1f7C830bD89Acc67eC4af516284b1bC33c">EURC token&nbsp;contract</a>  <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f">DAI token&nbsp;contract</a>  <p>To be able to use those ERC-20 tokens to preconvert into Switch they need to be bridged to the Verus blockchain. The bridging is done through the non-custodial and trustless Verus-Ethereum Bridge. Bridging and preconverting can be done with <a href="https://verus.io/wallet/mobile">Verus Mobile</a>, <a href="https://verus.io/wallet/desktop">Verus Desktop</a> (full node) &amp; MetaMask with <a href="https://eth.verusbridge.io/">the bridge&nbsp;website</a>.</p> Verus Mobile&nbsp;bridging <p>Let’s start by bridging with Verus Mobile. First thing to do is to add the ERC-20s in Verus Mobile. This is how to do&nbsp;it:</p>Adding ERC-20s to Verus&nbsp;Mobile.  Press the plus-button bottom-right corner  Press “Add ERC-20&nbsp;Token”  Select checkmark to “Find using mapped PBaaS currency”, and fill in eurc.veth, vusdc.veth or dai.veth. Then press Continue.  Press OK when a warning screen pops&nbsp;up.  <p>Now you are ready to receive USDC, EURC or DAI (as ERC-20s) on Verus&nbsp;Mobile.</p><p>Before bridging the tokens over to Verus let’s add the currencies on the Verus blockchain to the&nbsp;wallet:</p>Adding the currencies on the Verus blockchain on Verus&nbsp;Mobile.  Press the plus-button bottom-right corner.  Press “Add PBaaS currency”.  Fill in eurc.veth, vusdc.veth or dai.veth and press continue.  Press “ADD”.  <p>Now we are ready to bridge the ERC-20s over to the Verus blockchain.</p>Bridging EURC to Verus. It will come out as EURC.vETH.  Select the ERC-20 you want to bridge. (In the example we use&nbsp;EURC).  Press “Send” and then “Convert or cross-chain”.  Press “Send off-chain”.  As the recipient address fill in a Verus address you own (R- or i-address, or VerusID).  Fill in the amount you want to bridge&nbsp;over.  Then as “Select network to send to” choose&nbsp;Verus  Then as “Select currency to receive as” choose EURC.vETH  <p>That’s it. It can take up to 90 minutes before the ERC-20 arrives as a currency on&nbsp;Verus.</p> Bridging with&nbsp;MetaMask <p>Let’s bridge with MetaMask and the <a href="https://eth.verusbridge.io/">Verus-Ethereum Bridge&nbsp;website</a>:</p>Bridging with MetaMask to a Verus-address, EURC used as&nbsp;example.  Connect MetaMask with this website: <a href="https://eth.verusbridge.io/">https://eth.verusbridge.io/</a>  Address: where you want the DAI, USDC or EURC to end up on the Verus blockchain (as DAI.vETH, vUSDC.vETH or EURC.vETH)  Select token: [Euro Coin] as EURC.vETH, [0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48] as vUSDC.vETH or&nbsp;DAI.vETH  Destination: select the same&nbsp;… on&nbsp;VRSC  Choose the amount you want to bridge&nbsp;over  It may take up to 90 minutes before the funds arrive on&nbsp;Verus   Convert DAI, USDC, EURC &amp; VRSC with each&nbsp;other <p>Now that Switch is fully launched you can convert between VRSC, DAI.vETH, vUSDC.vETH and EURC.vETH. It’s now an AMM. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/sendcurrency/">Learn more on Verus DeFi&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Convert with Verus Desktop or Verus&nbsp;Mobile.</p> Convert with Verus&nbsp;Desktop <p>On Verus Desktop click the “Convert Currencies”-button and then go to the “Advanced”-tab.</p>Convert all Switch reserves with each other on Verus&nbsp;Desktop.  Choose amount to&nbsp;send  “From Currency”: fill in DAI.vETH&nbsp;, vUSDC.vETH, EURC.vETH, VRSC  “To Currency”: fill in DAI.vETH&nbsp;, vUSDC.vETH, EURC.vETH, VRSC  “Via Currency”: fill in&nbsp;Switch  “Destination Address”: fill in a R-/i-address or VerusID where you want to receive the currency.  Now click “Convert Currencies”, and that’s it! Wait between 1 and 5 blocks and you will receive the&nbsp;amount.  <p>If you want to convert to&nbsp;Switch:</p>  “To Currency”: to&nbsp;Switch  Leave out “Via Currency”   Convert with Verus&nbsp;Mobile Convert all Switch reserves with each other on Verus&nbsp;Mobile.  Press DAI.vETH&nbsp;, vUSDC.vETH, EURC.vETH, VRSC  Press “Send” and then “Convert or cross-chain”  Press “Convert currency”  As the recipient address fill in a Verus address you own (R- or i-address, or VerusID) or self to receive it on the same address where you send it&nbsp;from.  Fill in the amount you want to&nbsp;convert  Then as “Select currency to convert to” choose what you want to convert it&nbsp;to.  The network to send to is “current network” =&nbsp;Verus  Now press “Send” and confirm, and that’s it! You now have to wait between 1 and 5 blocks and you will see the currency in your&nbsp;wallet.

In DeFi, there are numerous ways of getting exposure to an asset in a leveraged manner: from looping to perpetuals and margin trading, the possibilities are endless (especially when you also account for synthetic versions).

  Partnering with nsave: Trusted Accounts, For Everyone  <p>Amer, Abdallah and their team are bringing safe, stable offshore accounts to the people who need them most.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/george-robson/">George Robson</a>	 



Published March 22, 2024
  







 
<p>In places like the U.S. and Europe, most of us take for granted the institutions that keep our financial systems functioning. From the central banks that issue currency and set monetary policy, to the regulations that ensure we can go to an ATM and withdraw what we’ve deposited—there are countless moving parts operating behind the scenes. And together, they form the bedrock of not just how we store our money, but how we build businesses, how we borrow and how we invest in growth.</p>



<p>In countries with distressed economies, though, life is markedly different. People work hard to save and build security for their future—but dysfunctional banking systems prevent them from preserving that wealth. Most families can’t access basic services such as loans and insurance, and decades of economic and political instability have driven deep distrust in the few options that do exist. With monthly withdrawals capped as low as $400, some depositors have resorted to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/14/world/lebanon-bank-heist-access-money-frozen-savings-intl-hnk/index.html">holding up banks</a> for their own money. And inflation ranges from 20% to 200% and higher—enough to rapidly erode your life savings, if not completely wipe it out.</p>



<p>In theory, the relative stability of currencies such as USD, Euros and GBP offer an escape from these runaway devaluations. But here again, access is severely limited. For the wealthy—those who can afford a million-dollar minimum deposit—such funds can be held in an offshore account. Everyone else must keep their savings either in local banks, where they’re subject to strict limits on foreign currency holdings; with relatives overseas; or literally under their mattress.</p>



<p>But now, everyday people have the same secure, stable options once reserved for the wealthy few, thanks to <a href="https://www.nsave.com/">nsave</a>.</p>



<p>Led by co-founders Amer Baroudi and Abdallah AbuHashem—two Rhodes scholars who know firsthand what it’s like to grow up in a struggling economy—the team at nsave believes everyone deserves a trusted way to store their money. Under Switzerland’s updated regulations for digital financial services, they’ve designed an inclusive verification platform that takes “know your customer” technology beyond traditional data like postal codes that don’t apply to everyone. Customers can continue to live, work and spend in their local communities, with local currency, while their funds stay safe and protected in USD, Euros or GBP. It’s a secure offshore account that everyone can afford.</p>



<p>Long before they met at Oxford, nsave’s co-founders lived through the very problems they’re now solving for their customers. Before becoming a Rhodes scholar and founding multiple companies, Amer watched his father lose his life savings to rampant inflation as their family fled conflict in Syria. Abdallah, meanwhile, made his way from Gaza to a master’s in CS at Stanford on his way to Oxford. Together, they have the perfect complementary skill sets to grow their business, and they share a burning intensity about the problem they’re solving. For Amer and Abdallah, nsave is about much more than making money. It’s a calling to create a financial system that works for everyday people.</p>



<p>We were grateful for the opportunity to lead their seed round last year and welcome them to <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/arc/">Arc</a>, Sequoia’s catalyst for pre-seed and seed-stage founders, and our conviction has only deepened as we’ve gotten to know the team. To build a product compliant with strict financial regulations is no easy task, not to mention building partnerships with banks. Yet nsave has done just that, and we are eager to see more users reap the benefits now that the app has gone live.</p>



<p>But as impressed as we are by nsave’s current offerings—including hard currency accounts, payments, fraud protection and international transfers—they aren’t stopping here. The team’s long-term roadmap includes a full suite of financial services, with the goal of further improving financial resilience and equality for people in struggling economies. Amer, Abdallah and their team are building something that could ultimately give hundreds of millions of people a new sense of control over the savings—and the future—they’ve worked so hard to build.</p>

  Partnering with Foundry: AI Compute, On Demand  <p>Jared and his team are unlocking a massive supply of GPU time for the next generation of AI.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/shaun-maguire/">Shaun Maguire</a>

Foundry’s Jared Quincy Davis



 
<p>A couple of years ago, Jared Quincy Davis had a problem. He was pursuing a Ph.D. in machine learning at Stanford, and getting the GPU time he needed to train his models was proving difficult. He and every other student who needed access to hardware had to reserve a time slot on a Google Sheet to exclusively hold a block of hardware, then wrap up in time for the next student’s window. A polymath with interests that included AI, distributed systems, crypto and economics, Jared was working with more than one advisor, each with their own GPU cluster—and he knew that if he could use those clusters at the same time despite their heterogeneity and separation, and effectively orchestrate the compute and split workloads across them, he could train models far more quickly. But there was no practical way to do so.</p>



<p>While studying for his doctorate, Jared was simultaneously working as a research scientist on DeepMind’s Core Deep Learning team—and before that, he’d been at BCG and KKR, where his work included data center projects—so his knowledge went beyond those firsthand frustrations with ML model training. He also understood the gaps between distributed systems for traditional cloud environments and what was needed for AI. And he also knew that data center hardware was changing.</p>



<p>In 2021, my partner Andrew Reed met Jared. He realized that Jared and I shared many mutual intellectual curiosities, so he connected us, and we immediately decided to make Jared a Sequoia Scout.<br><br>In early 2022, Jared was bursting with unique insights about the coming demand for AI compute and the bottlenecks beginning to emerge. Each time we spoke with him, he had refined his ideas, and in September he started <a href="https://www.mlfoundry.com/">Foundry</a> and we led the seed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two months after we partnered with Jared, OpenAI launched ChatGPT and the demand for AI compute exploded, with shortages and bubble prices highlighting the inefficiencies of the market. But luckily for all of us, these problems now have a solution: Foundry, which makes the world’s supply of compute more accessible and useful.</p>



<p>By solving the problem he once faced as a student and configuring models to run on distributed hardware, Jared and his team have opened up a massive supply of underutilized enterprise compute, which can then be aggregated and used. It’s a radical new approach to cloud computing workload orchestration, made possible by re-envisaging fundamental principles in congestion control and resource packing and scheduling, but with AI workloads in mind. Foundry realized that the AI compute ecosystem is bottlenecked not by under-supply, but by under-utilization.</p>



<p>We are proud to partner with Jared not just because he’s building a desperately needed solution to a fast-growing problem, and not just due to his impressive background, but because of who he is. We look for founders with grit, distance traveled, and irrational motivation, and it is clear when you meet Jared that he has all three. He is driven by a desire to honor the life of his mother, who was a computer scientist herself, and by a deeply held belief in technology as a path to a better world. What’s more, he has an incredible range and depth of knowledge—and we also look for founders from whom we can learn.</p>



<p>Jared’s foresight and innovation led to an exceptional 2023 for Foundry, as the company grew revenue from zero to eight figures with happy customers including the Arc Institute, Poolside and Captions. His team has unique experience in systems design for ML and, like its leader, a steadfast commitment to the hard work of making things simple.</p>
 



Jared giving his final presentation at Arc



 
<p>It has been a pleasure to watch Foundry grow as Jared joined us for <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/arc/">Arc</a>, our company-building immersion for pre-seed and seed-stage companies; as we co-led their Series A; and now as we celebrate the official launch of their groundbreaking product. We know that even after such an auspicious start, there is much more left to do, and we believe Foundry has the potential to not only make the market more efficient, but lead to breakthroughs in economics, climate and beyond. Their mission is nothing short of democratizing compute for the next generation of AI innovations, and we at Sequoia are grateful for the opportunity to support them along the way.</p>

 Introducing Pure — The Currency 100% Backed by Verus &amp;&nbsp;Bitcoin  Pure is a decentralized currency fully backed by Verus (VRSC) &amp; Bitcoin (tBTC). Hold Pure to be exposed to both Verus and Bitcoin while accruing fees from conversions. Or use it to convert from tBTC to VRSC and vice&nbsp;versa.  ⏱️ Pure is launched on block: 2,975,703 (Sunday 24 March,&nbsp;2024).  🔁 Convert tBTC &amp; VRSC to Pure, or vice versa. Or use Pure as an AMM and convert tBTC &amp; VRSC with each&nbsp;other.  ❓ tBTC is BTC on the Ethereum network. <a href="http://threshold.network/">Threshold.network</a> supplies a decentralized bridge for users to bridge BTC to Ethereum. tBTC is also bridged to Verus (as tBTC.vETH).  ⌨️ See the Pure statistics (protocol prices, amount in reserves) at <a href="https://cryptodashboard.faldt.net">Cryptodashboard</a> or <a href="https://raw.verus.trading">verus.trading</a>. Or type in /pure in the #trading channel in the <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">community Discord</a>.  📚 Learn in this article how to convert tBTC &amp; VRSC with each other, and how to convert to and from Pure. Also you learn how to bridge tBTC to the Verus&nbsp;network.  What is&nbsp;Pure? <p>Pure is a decentralized currency launched on the Verus blockchain. It is fully backed by its reserves: Verus (VRSC) and Bitcoin (tBTC), with a reserve ratio of&nbsp;50/50%.</p><p>The currency is called Pure because it aligns with the true ideals of decentralization and transparency:</p>  Bitcoin and Verus are fully decentralized and controlled by its nodes and block producers. No single entity or company controls them. They are not a business — they are rent-free protocols.  Bitcoin and Verus had fair launches. No ICO, no premine and no developer fees or&nbsp;taxes.  Bitcoin and Verus have a limited&nbsp;supply.  Bitcoin and Verus are censorship-resistant.  <p>Hold Pure to be exposed to two decentralized cryptocurrencies upholding true cypherpunk values.</p> Pure is an&nbsp;AMM <p>Another benefit of holding Pure is that the currency accrues conversion fees. When users convert from Pure to VRSC or tBTC (or vice versa) they pay a conversion fee of 0.025%. When users convert between VRSC and tBTC they pay a conversion fee of&nbsp;0.05%.</p><p>Half of those conversion fees (50%) stay in the Pure reserves, increasing the value of Pure since no new Pure is minted. The conversions are MEV-resistant and verified by the miners and stakers of the protocol. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/sendcurrency/">Learn more about Verus&nbsp;DeFi</a>.</p><p>Conversions between VRSC and tBTC are only possible after the preconversion period has ended on Sunday 24 March,&nbsp;2024.</p><p>Users can also create subIDs which cost 0.00021 tBTC.vETH (in Pure). These costs are burned reducing Pure in circulation. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/verusid/">Learn more about VerusID and what you can do with it here</a>. If users create an identity with your subID as referral, they pay 2/3 less — you get 1/3 and 1/3 is discounted.</p> Preconversion period before the launch of&nbsp;Pure <p>Before Pure was fully launched, there was an 8-day preconversion period. In that period users could fund the reserves of Pure with VRSC and tBTC. During this period no conversions could be done. Depending on how much they added they got their fair share of 20,000 Pure after the 8 day&nbsp;period.</p><p>The initial supply of Pure was 20,000. After the initial supply has been distributed by the protocol, the supply became dynamic. When users convert from VRSC or tBTC into Pure, Pure is minted. When people convert from Pure back to VRSC or tBTC, the Pure is&nbsp;burned.</p><p>Learn below how Pure was launched without any coding needed. Just a simple API&nbsp;call:</p> What is tBTC, how do I get it &amp; bridge it to&nbsp;Verus? <p>tBTC is BTC on the Ethereum network. The decentralized bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum is supplied by the <a href="http://www.threshold.network/">Threshold Network</a>.</p><blockquote>Existing solutions that bridge Bitcoin to Ethereum require users to send their Bitcoin to an intermediary, in exchange for an ERC-20 token that represents the original asset. This centralized model requires you to trust a third party and is susceptible to censorship, threatening the premise of Bitcoin as sovereign, secure, permissionless digital&nbsp;asset.</blockquote><blockquote>The second generation of tBTC is a truly decentralized (and scalable) bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum. It provides Bitcoin holders secure and open access to the broader DeFi ecosystem. tBTC v2 allows you to unlock your Bitcoin’s value to borrow and lend, mint stablecoins, provide liquidity, and much&nbsp;more.</blockquote><p>Get tBTC on Kraken, Uniswap, Curve &amp; others. <a href="https://dashboard.threshold.network/tBTC/mint">Or mint it&nbsp;yourself</a></p><p>tBTC token address: <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x18084fba666a33d37592fa2633fd49a74dd93a88">https://etherscan.io/token/0x18084fba666a33d37592fa2633fd49a74dd93a88</a></p><p>You can send tBTC to your MetaMask wallet or Verus Mobile first, and later you have to bridge it to the Verus blockchain.

<p>While large language models (LLMs) are rather passive from an economic perspective on their own, AI agents offer a preview of what truly autonomous AI applications can achieve. Fetch.ai aims to create a platform for economic interactions in the AI economy, where participants can provide many different kinds of stake, ranging from purely financial, in the form of cryptocurrency tokens, to utility based, in the form of data sets that LLMs can be trained on. It thus creates a supply chain that links different actors of the AI economy.</p><p>We were joined by Humayun Sheikh, co-founder &amp; CEO of Fetch.ai, to discuss AI economic models and how LLMs can be integrated by agentic systems as a foundation for autonomous AI apps.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Humayun’s background  Founding Fetch.ai  Multi-agent systems  Autonomous economic agent  Building a Cosmos based blockchain  Integrating ML with agent economy  Scalability &amp; interoperability  Use cases &amp; partnerships  AI x crypto projects  Incentivising developers  AI alignment problem  Fetch AI roadmap  The future of ML &amp; LLMs  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/HMsheikh4">Humayun Sheikh on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/Fetch_ai">Fetch.ai on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

Due to the new <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3855">EIP-3855</a>, it is possible to use the new instruction PUSH0, which pushes the constant value 0 onto the stack. Please note this is used by Solidity compiler from version 0.8.20.&nbsp;  There are important changes in the deployment phase introduced by <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3860">EIP-3860</a>.&nbsp;  The introduction of a maximum size limit for smart contract initcode.

<p>We’ve gathered insights from our team of web3 experts who are eager to share their most valuable tips with you. Whether you’re just considering using blockchain or already knee-deep in the technology, our experts have got you covered. With our wealth of experience and learnings along the way, our web3 experts are here to offer you valuable insights and guidance.</p>



<p>Top web3 expert tips for web3 projects:</p>



 
 Decrease time to market 



 Ask the community to avoid mistakes 



 Address compliance at an early stage 



 Mitigate risk by decreasing volatility 
 



<p></p>



 Expert Tip #1: Decrease time to market 



<p>In the fast-paced web3 world, time is everything. New applications pop up daily, not to mention the numerous new players that enter the space.</p>



<p>By decreasing the time to market, you can launch your product before your competitors. Additionally, it allows you to receive feedback from the (web3) community early on, which can help you refine your product. But remember, this whole web3 space is also new to them. Innovation takes time to sink in. Finally, a faster time-to-market can help you avoid running out of resources before your product even gets to market.</p>



<p>Simplicity is key. By prioritising a smooth and seamless process, and abstracting away as much technical complexity as possible, you create better experiences for your customers and increase your chances of success.</p>







<p></p>



 Expert Tip #2: Ask the community to avoid mistakes 



<p>For a novel and complex technology, it is essential to have a second pair of eyes on all your software. By involving the community and asking for help, you can ensure that your project is built on a solid foundation and has the best chance of success.</p>



<p>Many projects fail because people rush into building something without asking around. Newcomers to the field may not realise the potential challenges they could encounter, many of which may have already been resolved by others. There are public forums for developers and all types of project participants, including technology-focused and business-focused groups.</p>



<p>However, in the web3 space, there remain many solutions that are new and lack proper documentation, making it even more critical to consider what works and what doesn’t work. So, how do you ensure you get the best advice?</p>



<p>Firstly, ensure that you talk to a diverse group of industry players from different budgets and backgrounds. Secondly, clearly understand your project requirements and what you need help with. Clear communication will help your community understand what it is you are trying to achieve and where you might need improvements. Finally, always be respectful and appreciative of people’s time and efforts.</p>



<p></p>



 Expert Tip #3: Address compliance at an early stage 



<p>Before spending a considerable amount on building a minimum viable product (MVP), it is crucial to at least have a quick chat with a seasoned lawyer, to explore potential legal issues. A relatively small investment will help to identify any legal challenges related to your plans. For example, regulatory issues for custodial wallets, property law for tokenisation, intellectual property for NFTs, and GDPR compliance for web3 wallets and public chains. <a href="https://zaisan.io/services/web3-consultancy/">Inserting legal know-how at an early stage</a> might save tons of costs and a lot of time. It might prevent you from completely re-developing or spending precious resources on a project doomed from a regulatory perspective. Professional legal involvement will sit well with investors too.</p>



<p>At Zaisan, we understand that the law might look like a scary beast, but that compliance is essential for the success of your blockchain project. It’s too often that this initial, relatively small spending saves the day.</p>



   



 Expert Tip #4: Mitigate risk by decreasing volatility 



<p>One common challenge faced by many blockchain projects is the lack of users, particularly those projects that rely on transactional volumes such as wallets, exchanges, and marketplaces. Furthermore, when a project has a tradable token, there is a high chance that it can become volatile, which can make the project unusable. To mitigate these risks, we suggest that you ensure your project is sustainable through budget planning and mitigating volatility risks by hedging.</p>



<p>It’s important to avoid basing your business model solely on the token on which it is running. Instead, use business logic and design the project in a way that it doesn’t have overdependence on the system token. You could mitigate the risk by using stablecoins and a variable pricing model.</p>



<p>Introducing crypto or tokens to a project has its pros and cons. On the one hand, leveraging cryptocurrency or tokens can provide a new level of flexibility and accessibility, enabling streamlined transactions and potentially unlocking new revenue streams. Additionally, it can foster community engagement and loyalty through token incentives and reward systems. However, this approach also comes with its challenges, including regulatory compliance complexities, volatility in token values, and the need for robust security measures to safeguard against cyber threats and fraud. Therefore, careful consideration and strategic planning are essential to navigate the intricacies of integrating crypto or tokens effectively into a project. </p>

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>As the week draws to a close, we’re excited to share the latest developments and progress with our community. This update covers a range of key advancements in both our ecosystem and product development:</p> Ecosystem updates  Panther integrates Kyber Network to revolutionize private access to DEXs <p>We are thrilled to announce our <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther/status/1768211882584797674?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">integration with the Kyber Network</a> to revolutionize private access to DEXs while minimizing slippage. With the integration, Panther users can execute trades through the Kyber Network aggregator, which sources liquidity from multiple DEXs. These trades are wrapped in Panther’s privacy-enhancing technology, ensuring that the details of the transactions remain confidential. </p> Blog: how Panther zAssets enhance user privacy in DeFi <p>Our<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/product-insights-how-panther-zassets-enhance-user-privacy-in-defi/"> latest blog </a>examines how Panther’s multi-chain privacy-preserving protocol intends to offer users access to public ledger liquidity while providing transactional anonymity.&nbsp;</p> Panther’s CTO, Anish Mohammed, joins ZK Demo Day as a judge&nbsp; <p>Our Co-Founder and CTO, Anish Mohammed, recently participated as a judge at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhBL4CPcMrc&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">ZK Demo Day</a>, where he shared the stage with notable leaders from Blackrock, top venture capital firms, Web3 protocols, and other industry leaders. In addition, Anish was also recently invited as a guest on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwhBWdn3R5M&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Epicenter Podcast</a>. The podcast focused on discussing on-chain privacy, the vision and progress of Panther Protocol, and our milestones ahead.</p> Panther Protocol testnet and rewards update <p>We’re glad to share that we’ve debuted on<a href="https://airdrops.io/panther-protocol/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Airdrops.io</a> to promote Panther testnet rewards and welcome more participants to Panther community. The testnet currently has over 1500 participants, and we’ve distributed over 500,000 $ZKP as rewards.</p><p>The team is planning to launch a Zealy-based incentivized ambassador program next week to further improve community participation and promote Panther.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our testnet rewards pot is 2 million $ZKP — have you signed up for our test dApp yet to earn your share? Grab the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">latest link</a> from Panther’s docs to join our testing group and receive your $ZKP rewards.</p> Product updates  Stage 5 developments <p>Stage 5 includes using a third party Relayer service and supports gasless transactions via an Account Abstraction Paymaster contract. The team is currently performing integration testing with the second Relayer. Overall, the team is pleased with how well the end-to-end Relayer integration process is working. The team is still working on Stage 5 in parallel with other stages and expects to release it next week for community testing.</p><p>As you might be aware, Oshiya (previously known as Miner) optimizes gas usage by processing batches of newly created UTXOs and updating a Zero-Knowledge proof in a Merkle tree, which introduces a slight delay in batch creation. This process takes place in what’s called the Bus Tree, likened to the communal efficiency of a bus ride.</p><p>For users seeking immediate UTXO updates in the Merkle tree, we offer the Taxi Tree option, which promises faster processing, similar to taking a taxi. Last week, our team successfully deployed the Taxi Tree contract on the Mumbai testnet. The user interface has been updated to allow users to choose between Regular Processing (using the Bus) and Fast Processing (using a Taxi). In Stage 6, users will also be able to compare the network costs associated with these two processing options.</p><p>In addition, we have developed an exchange contract to facilitate the payment of Relayers in native tokens. This contract enables the conversion of $ZKP to $Matic via UniswapV3 on the Polygon network, streamlining transactions and enhancing our ecosystem’s functionality.</p> Stage 6 developments <p>Stage 6 of the testnet dApp includes fee management, basic disclosures, and zAccount renewal. The FeeMaster contract has been upgraded and is currently being reviewed. We anticipate that the Fee Master review will be complete this week and ready for deployment.&nbsp;</p><p>Smart Contracts for Stage 6 is completed with final rounds of internal testing ongoing. The next two weeks will be utilized to get the dApp development close to completion and launch stage 6 for community testing by the end of the month however, we will know precise dates after a week.</p> About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in Shielded Pools; zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs; and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s Zero-Knowledge primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

<p>As technology progresses, infrastructure should be commoditised, especially in Web3, in order to avoid the creation of bottlenecks and gatekeepers. Blockchains are naturally oblivious to off-chain data, so they need oracles to fetch data. However, given their past technical limitations, oracles have failed to provide a decentralised and permissionless framework for data query. SEDA seeks to change this by creating an intent-based modular data layer, which brings off-chain data on-chain, in order for it to be available to any party, regardless of who requested it first.</p><p>We were joined by Jasper De Goojier, co-founder of SEDA Protocol, to discuss the oracle landscape and how SEDA aims to decentralise it and make data access permissionless.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Jasper’s background  High level overview of SEDA  Oracle use cases  How SEDA Protocol functions  Intent-based data availability  Verifying subjective data &amp; LLM integration  ZKPs &amp; FHE for data privacy  Interoperability &amp; bridging  Roadmap &amp; optimistic oracles  SEDA token migration  Chain abstraction  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/jasperflux">Jasper De Goojier on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/sedaprotocol">SEDA Protocol on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>At PIVX, we firmly believe in the rights of all crypto projects to make <br>their own decisions based on what they deem is right for them. We are committed to supporting the diversity within the cryptocurrency ecosystem and respecting the choices made by different projects, particularly when it comes to&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>As everyone is now aware, Binance approached Privacy Coin Projects with a request to develop a super transparent address type that would facilitate compliance with regulatory requirements. PIVX agreed to this request and made “exchange addresses” that ensure no shield transactions can be sent to these addresses.</p><p>While we understand that privacy is an essential feature of PIVX and is currently optional, we recognize the significance of exchanges maintaining compliance with regulators. Implementing the requested address type would make it easier for our users to deposit into Binance, ensuring a smoother experience for all parties involved.</p><p>It is important to note that the introduction of this address type does not compromise PIVX’s commitment to privacy. PIVX has always been about choice, offering both shielded and transparent transactions. By introducing this new address format, we aim to meet the requirements of exchanges operating in regions with stricter privacy coin regulations, such as Korea. This step would enable us to identify and engage in discussions about relistings with these exchanges, ensuring PIVX’s continued presence in these&nbsp;markets.</p><p>We want to emphasize that PIVX’s privacy protocol, SHIELD, will continue to exist and be supported by a wide variety of exchanges and payment gateways. <br> <br> At PIVX, we understand that regulation varies across the globe, and we strive to navigate these complexities while providing options for users and maintaining our principles. We believe in the strength and resilience of PIVX as we move forward, embracing collaborations that allow us to adapt to evolving regulatory landscapes while preserving the privacy choices we offer to our community.</p><p>PIVX Core</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/community-message-from-pivx-core-d5efdbce2122">Community Message From PIVX core</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

        <p>This ZenIP proposes lowering the thresholds required for:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) formally submitting both technical and non-technical improvement proposals; and&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) achieving a quorum of votes for both technical and non-technical improvement proposals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These changes would increase accessibility for community members to put forth proposals and would bring quorum requirements in line with the broader web3 industry standards. Please note that these proposed changes apply to both Zen improvement proposals (ZenIPs) and EON improvement proposals (EONIPs).</p>
<p>ZenIP 42401 aims to make it easier for community members to participate in governance by lowering the $ZEN threshold required for posting a non-technical ZenIP/ EONIP for community vote, as well as lowering the quorum threshold for a vote to be considered valid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The current thresholds for both ZenIPs and EONIPs are as follows:</p>
 
 Technical:
 
 Submit proposal for vote: 200,000 $ZEN held or delegated 
 Vote quorum: 10% of circulating supply participating 
 
 
 Non-Technical:
 
 Submit proposal for vote: 100,000 $ZEN held or delegated 
 Vote quorum: 5% of circulating supply participating 
 
 
 
<p>This ZenIP proposes the following changes to the thresholds:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Technical:
 
 Submit proposal for vote: 100,000 $ZEN held or delegated (vs. 200,000 $ZEN currently) 
 Vote quorum: 5% of circulating supply participating (vs. 10% currently) 
 
 
 Non-Technical:
 
 Submit proposal for vote: 25,000 $ZEN held or delegated (vs. 100,000 $ZEN currently) 
 Vote quorum: 3% of circulating supply participating (vs. 5% currently) 
 
 
 
<p>Again, if ZenIP 42401 passes, these changes will apply to both ZenIPs and EONIPs. There are also no changes proposed to the majority requirements for either proposal type (i.e., 67% of votes in favor for technical proposals, simple majority in favor for non-technical proposals).</p>
 ZenIP Voting Timeline 
<p>ZenIPs are public proposals for the Horizen community to approve or decline. We encourage you to join the discussions on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/z8eebsj7Sv">Discord</a>, <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Discourse</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/horizenglobal">Twitter</a> on ZenIP 42401 and share your thoughts on the proposal. We also encourage you to read the <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42401-updating-proposal-and-quorum-thresholds/440">ZenIP 42401: Updating Proposal and Quorum Thresholds</a> post on Discourse to get a complete understanding of this proposal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voting on ZenIP 42401 will start on Tuesday, March 12th, 2024 at 12pm EST and end on Friday, March 15th, 2024 at 12pm EST.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Horizen DAO voting is done on the Horizen EON chain, using Snapshot and Discourse for governance. The snapshot is taken once voting begins.</p>
 Who is Eligible to Vote?&nbsp; 
<p>Any $ZEN holder can vote on improvement proposals, and those who hold (or who have been delegated) the requisite amount of $ZEN may put forth proposals to the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voting power is determined by the amount of $ZEN you hold on the Horizen mainchain and on the Horizen EON chain. Therefore the more $ZEN you hold, the more voting power you have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To see the vote instructions detailed tutorial, please have a look to the dedicated blogpost. Below we cover an overview of how to vote.&nbsp;</p>
 How to vote – Instructions 
<p>Your vote will be weighted regarding the tokens you hold, either on the Horizen mainchain (the historic one) or Horizen EON (the EVM chain).</p>
<p>If you already linked your mainchain address for a previous vote, you won’t have to connect it again.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Connect your wallet and verify if it’s properly linked here.</a></p>
<p>The vote happens on Snapshot and is done through MetaMask and therefore via the Horizen EON network.</p>
<p>Before going through the tutorial, we assume that the Horizen EON network is properly configured on your MetaMask wallet. If not, <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/connect/connect_your_wallet/">please follow this guide</a>.</p>
 A/ You already voted and linked you mainchain address 
<p>Then it’s very simple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We still encourage you to verify if your mainchain address is properly linked on the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Horizen Governance app</a>.</p>
<p>If it’s not linked, follow the tutorial just below.</p>
<p>If it’s linked, just head to <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot on the Horizen governance page</a>, and vote for the proposal when it’s published and available.&nbsp;</p>
 B/ You have to link your mainchain address 
<p>1/ First, make sure to have some ZEN on Horizen EON, you will need some gas tokens in order to interact with the EVM chain, link your address, and vote.</p>
<p>2/ Now it’s time to link your mainchain address(es). Any ZEN on Arizen, Sphere By Horizen, ZEN wallet, Swing wallet, or multi-sig wallets, Ledger, ZEN on exchanges are usable. Here, we will focus on Sphere By Horizen. If you need assistance for non Sphere By Horizen wallets linking, please have a look to this <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/how-to-link-the-mainchain-address-to-the-horizen-eon-address/174">post on the Horizen forum</a>.</p>
<p>You’ll get a more <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address/">detailed tutorial with a screenshot in the Governance doc</a>, but here are the steps:</p>
 
 Make sure Horizen EON is configured on MetaMask and to have some ZEN on there thanks to the steps stated above. 
 Open the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Horizen Governance</a> page. 
 Click Connect Wallet. The EON wallet (MetaMask) appears in the top-right corner. Once connected, the EON address field is automatically filled with the connected EON address.
 
 Note: If the EON wallet (MetaMask) was previously connected to the Horizen Governance app, then it is automatically connected. 
 
 
 Open Sphere By Horizen and navigate to the mainchain wallet address you want to link to the EON address. Click the Information icon to view your address. 
 In the Horizen Governance app, on the Linked Addresses pane, click Link Mainchain Address.&nbsp; 
 The Link Address pop-up appears. Paste the Sphere wallet address in the Mainchain Address field. 
 Copy your EON address. 
 In Sphere, go to the Addresses pane. Click the compose icon (hand holding pencil). 
 The Sign message with address pop-up appears. Paste the EON address in the message field and click on Create signature. The mainchain signature appears below the message field. Then click on COPY TO CLIPBOARD. 
 In the Horizen Governance app, on the Linked Addresses pane, paste the signature in the Mainchain Signature field. 
 Click Link. The Pending pop-up appears stating that the transaction is being submitted. 
 The MetaMask Notification appears. Read the information details. Click Confirm. 
 The Linked Address appears showing that the EON Address and Mainchain Address are linked 
 You can repeat the process for other addresses. 
 
<p>Now that it’s linked, just head to <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot on the Horizen governance page</a>, and vote for the proposal when it’s published and available.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/PjDFYEh6SDw?si=VgQKGkl_PHj8Q0qW">We also have a helpful video tutorial here with instructions on how to vote for the Horizen DAO.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the adoption of blockchain-based payment surges, the need for on-chain privacy is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-files-for-privacy-etf-with-sec-zcash-part-of-offering.htm?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#:~:text=Crypto-focused%20asset%20manager%20Grayscale,be%20an%20industry-first%20fund">capturing the spotlight</a>. Privacy is particularly important for institutional users and high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs). And, the problem is that any public, pseudonymous blockchain reveals transaction details.&nbsp;</p><p>From wallet addresses, to gas fees, to transaction value, and the tokens traded; transaction data is public. This enables transaction linkage, which exposes a huge data exhaust that may ultimately result in wallet:identity mapping. Simply attempting to make a trade can trigger MEV front-running; even price discovery can be followed. Neither privacy nor confidentiality are a feature of public ledgers.</p><p>Let’s examine how Panther’s multi-chain privacy-preserving protocol intends to offer users access to public ledger liquidity while providing transactional anonymity.&nbsp;</p> A vision for regulatory-compliant, on-chain privacy <p>Panther Protocol breaks the links between the wallet initiating the trade and the trade itself, i.e. it enhances transaction privacy: specifically, it preserves identity, the assets traded, and value transferred. This privacy is granted by Panther’s <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Shielded Pools</a>. Shielded Pools, known in TradFi as dark pools, obscure the trade initiator whose privacy must be preserved from peer traders and external liquidity sources.&nbsp;</p><p>The Shielded Pool acts like a walled garden: only invited users and assets may enter. Assets are deposited in the Panther Vault, part of the Panther Smart Contract, in exchange for a zAsset, or Zero-Knowledge Asset. It’s the zAsset that masks the detail of the user’s trades from observation.</p> What is a zAsset? <p>A zAsset represents a digital asset that users may trade with anonymity within a Panther Shielded Pool. The technology underpinning the zAsset enables trades to be settled privately on a public ledger.</p><p>In essence, the zAsset, is a "mirror" asset that is printed when a digital asset is <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools/depositing-transferring-and-withdrawing?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">deposited </a>in the Panther contract. It’s subsequently spent when that asset is withdrawn. Therefore, the zAsset:asset always exists in a strict 1:1 ratio. Users can send, swap, receive, and pay with zAssets within a Shielded Pool.&nbsp;</p> How does a zAsset enhance trading privacy? <p>A zAsset utilizes Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs. ZK proofs are cryptographic protocols that enable the prover to demonstrate to the verifier that something is true without revealing the underlying data required to form that proof. For example, you could prove that you are over 18 without providing the birth certificate or ID used to generate that proof, nor indeed your actual age.&nbsp;</p><p>zAssets represent their underlying asset in the form of UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs). It’s these UTXOs that users trade within a <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Shielded Pool</a>. To store UTXO data on-chain, the Protocol uses ZK-SNARK (Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) proofs. This allows a user’s on-chain state to be stored privately and to ensure private state changes, i.e. the UTXO data that represents the asset on-chain is condensed and encrypted. This means that asset balances and balance changes are not publicly available should a Panther account address become known to an observer.&nbsp;</p><p>To the observing world, the only available data that results from a trade is that a UTXO was committed to the smart contract. Only the owner of the UTXO can decrypt the proof and ascertain the value and token that the UTXO represents.&nbsp;</p><p>The fact that UTXOs are not all created equal adds further support to the privacy set. The number of UTXOs created as a result of trades does not map to the number of tokens that UTXO represents. Some UTXOs may not even represent an asset, they may prove a zero balance, or null data, allowing the activity level of the protocol itself to also be shielded.&nbsp;</p> Deepening privacy <p>Panther Protocol offers two privacy layers; one is optional, and the other is a feature of the protocol. The zAsset is the protocol’s core feature, and the Panther Relayer is a protocol service provider that adds an additional privacy-enhancing mechanism.</p><p>Panther Relayers provide an additional privacy layer by breaking the link between the initiator of the transaction and the transaction itself. These ecosystem operators charge a fee for:</p>  signing the transactions with their public key  paying the gas fees  relaying bundles of transactions to the Shielded Pool contract&nbsp;  <p>Relayers, therefore, enhance privacy, since observers are unable to pinpoint the actual address that initiated the transaction because the Relayer signs the blockchain transaction with their key.</p> A brighter, more private, public-ledger future <p>Relaying alone goes a long way to confounding transaction linking by disbursing the data exhaust when compared to a peer-to-peer or peer-to-AMM transaction. Combined with zAsset trading, we believe this suite of solutions offers the most robust, and yet compliant, trading privacy mechanism created to date.&nbsp;</p><p>As the global economy migrates to a digital native medium that operates on public ledgers, the utility of on-chain protocols will largely hinge on how effectively they implement features that confer privacy where and when it is needed. We believe that Panther Protocol’s privacy-enhancing technology solves the public ledger privacy problem. Panther Protocol has developed a mature, considered solution set that allows institutions and end-users to balance their privacy and compliance needs.&nbsp;</p><p>Panther Protocol provides dedicated, customizable space, <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools/zones?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">a Panther Zone</a>, to empower institutions to trade in Shielded Pools with allowlisted assets and counterparties. Designed with the needs of compliant privacy-enabled DeFi in mind, Panther Zones deliver a chain-agnostic, fully decentralized, suite of features that provide unparalleled privacy, security, and compliance support for public on-chain transactions.&nbsp;</p><p>Interested in customizing your own trading Zone for privacy-enhanced trading?

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>February was a busy month for Panther Protocol, with the launch of testnet Stage 4 supporting internal transfers and withdrawals, alongside Stage 1 technical enhancements for improved performance and the parallel development of Stages 5 &amp; 6 of the dApp. February also saw the Panther tester community grow to 900+ testers.&nbsp;</p><p>This update covers the ecosystem’s growth, product development progress, and a peek at what’s planned for March:</p> Ecosystem updates  Testnet Stage 4 is live — supporting internal transfers and withdrawals <p>Testnet <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage-4-is-now-live-supporting-internal-transfers-and-withdrawals/">Stage 4</a> was released in February, supporting internal transfers and withdrawals. Stage 4 allows users to send zAssets from one zAccount to another. The release of Stage 4 marks a significant step towards the protocol’s mainnet release.</p> Blog: Let’s end the taboo of on-chain privacy <p>Our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/lets-end-the-taboo-of-on-chain-privacy/">latest blog</a> explores the need for a balanced approach to privacy and transparency in Web3. It stresses the importance of private transactions on the public ledgers. By comparing traditional finance’s privacy and DeFi’s transparency, we argue for a middle ground that supports global finance and compliance. Panther Protocol offers solutions to achieve this balance, aiming for a future where privacy and regulatory demands work together.</p> AMA with Panther’s Head of Product, Saif Akhtar <p>On February 8, we hosted an engaging AMA with Saif Akhtar, our Head of Product, and Joris Koopman, our Head of Community.

<p>Blockchains are, by default, public ledgers containing every transaction recorded by the network. While this ensures transparency, it also violates users’ privacy once an address is linked to an entity. Apart from creating additional risk for self-custody, institutions are also limited by what they can publicly share on a blockchain. As a result, there is great demand and utility for on-chain, compliant privacy, which still requires KYC (&amp; KYT), but protects them through cryptographic constructs. Zero knowledge proofs attest computational integrity, allowing for transactions to be bundled together and their correctness verified, without revealing each individual interaction.</p><p>We were joined by Anish Mohammed, co-founder &amp; CTO of Panther Protocol, to discuss the importance of compliant privacy for on-chain transactions, powered by zero knowledge technology.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Anish’s background  Panther’s value proposition  UX &amp; on-chain privacy  Panther’s multi-asset shielded pool architecture  KYC &amp; KYT  Shielded zones and transactions  Zone administrator  Address mapping  Roadmap &amp; Panther mainnet  Target audience &amp; adoption  Fee model &amp; tokenomics  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/anishmohammed">Anish Mohammed on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther">Panther Protocol on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of Zebra version 1.6.0. This release exposes the shielded scanning functionality through an initial version of a gRPC server. You can find the documentation outlining how to interact with this gRPC interface in the <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/shielded-scan-grpc-server.html">Zebra Book</a>. Please note that due to this new gRPC server, building Zebra now depends on <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf">protoc</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this release we have also been making improvements to simplify the Docker images that we share. We now provide a number of new docker-compose files to make it easier to run, test and develop on Zcash using Zebra. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/main/docker/docker-compose.test.yml">docker-compose.test</a> enables anyone developing on Zebra to easily run CI locally, using a similar approach to what is run through GitHub Actions. We also want to make it easy for users to use Zebra and Lightwalletd without the risk of losing their cached states, so we are now providing <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/main/docker/docker-compose.lwd.yml">docker-compose.lwd</a> to run zebrad with lightwalletd.</p>

We talk about all that, but that’s not even the main event.</p> <p>The Main Event is Ether the asset and a new reference rate he’s building on top of it. This sounds in the weeds but it’s actually actually key to unlocking trillions in new financial products. You might call this new rate the Libor for ETH.&nbsp;</p> <p>------ 🏹 USE PODCAST24 FOR 10% OFF <a href="https://bankless.cc/Citizen2024">https://bankless.cc/Citizen2024</a>&nbsp;  ------ 🎧 Listen On Your Favorite Podcast Player:&nbsp; <a href="https://bankless.cc/Podcast">https://bankless.cc/Podcast</a>&nbsp;  ------ BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>🐙KRAKEN | MOST-TRUSTED CRYPTO EXCHANGE <a href="https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2">https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; ⁠&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>🔗CELO | CEL2 COMING SOON <a href="https://bankless.cc/Celo">https://bankless.cc/Celo</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>🗣️TOKU | CRYPTO EMPLOYMENT SOLUTION <a href="https://bankless.cc/toku">https://bankless.cc/toku</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>🛞MANTLE | MODULAR LAYER 2 NETWORK <a href="https://bankless.cc/Mantle">https://bankless.cc/Mantle</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>💸 CRYPTO TAX CALCULATOR | USE CODE BANK30 <a href="https://bankless.cc/CTC">https://bankless.cc/CTC</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>⚖️ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM <a href="https://%E2%81%A0https//bankless.cc/Arbitrum">⁠https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a></p> <p>🦄 UNISWAP | Swap Smarter <a href="https://bankless.cc/uniswap">https://bankless.cc/uniswap</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ TIMESTAMPS 00:00:00 Start 00:11:33 Intro to Chris 00:13:17 From Banks To Crypto 00:16:27 Hostility Towards Crypto 00:19:16 National Security 00:25:23 Takes on Regulation 00:31:12 TradFi Response To Crypto 00:33:58 ETH ETF 00:37:24 Libor for ETH? 00:42:43 Libor Recap 00:45:35 How Was Libor Corrupted? 00:53:21 ETH Reference Rate 01:04:13 Risk Free Rate 01:10:08 Real vs Nominal Returns 01:21:51 DeFi Applications 01:26:01 Market Size 01:33:17 Going Forward</p> <p>------ RESOURCES</p> <p>CESR home page: &nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/indices/ether/cesr">https://www.coindesk.com/indices/ether/cesr</a>&nbsp;  CESR methodology document: &nbsp;<a href="https://coinfund.io/cesr/">https://coinfund.io/cesr/</a>&nbsp;  CESR Tearsheet: <a href="https://downloads.coindesk.com/cd3/CDI/CESR+Fact+Sheet.pdf">https://downloads.coindesk.com/cd3/CDI/CESR+Fact+Sheet.pdf</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>More Reading: <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/09/26/how-staking-rates-can-drive-the-crypto-economy-forward/"> https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/09/26/how-staking-rates-can-drive-the-crypto-economy-forward/</a>&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/09/27/five-reasons-why-the-world-needs-a-standardized-ethereum-staking-rate/"> https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/09/27/five-reasons-why-the-world-needs-a-standardized-ethereum-staking-rate/</a>&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7957405/new-hope-for-crypto-derivatives-as-markets-urged-to-hail-cesr"> https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7957405/new-hope-for-crypto-derivatives-as-markets-urged-to-hail-cesr</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ Not financial or tax advice.

<p>Today, Brave is excited to announce the release of Leo—Brave’s privacy-preserving AI assistant built right into the browser—on all Android devices. Android users who update to version 1.63 can ask Leo questions, summarize pages, translate pages, create content, and more from both the browser address bar and within the webpage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since launching on desktop three months ago, Brave Leo has seen significant global adoption. With the chat interface built right in the browser and several large language models (LLMs) to choose from, Leo makes it easy to interact with AI in a seamless, familiar way. Leo can help users answer questions, navigate different tasks, and accomplish more each day. And the experience has only gotten better—and the answers more accurate and timely—with the addition of new integrations and <a>new models like Mixtral</a>.</p>
<p>Now, that same great Leo experience is available for users with Android phones and tablets. Brave Android users can seamlessly interact with AI without leaving the security of the browser, and maximize productivity no matter where they are.</p>

 What can Leo do? 
<p>Leo can handle any number of tasks, both in the context of the webpages you’re viewing and completely separate from this context. Among other things, Leo can:</p>
 
 Create real-time summaries of webpages or videos 
 Answer questions about content 
 Generate new long form written content 
 Translate pages, analyze, or rewrite them 
 Create transcriptions of video or audio content 
 Write code 
 
<p>So what can you do with Leo on mobile? Summarize that long webpage you meant to read at the office, but never got around to. Get help hunting for a product mentioned on that page and compare it to others. Plan a recipe for tonight’s dinner. And get smart travel tips to escape the daily grind.</p>
<p>With Leo on Android, you can maximize productivity as you move between home, office, and anywhere else you go. All with the same privacy and security guarantees of the Brave browser. With Brave Leo, there’s no login or signup required—you just open your browser and chat. Privately.</p>

 Mixtral as the default LLM brings higher quality answers 
<p>Brave Leo gives access to several high-quality large-language models (LLMs), ensuring better, more relevant answers to even niche questions, and fewer of the hallucinations that plague other AI experiences.</p>
<p>Out of the box, Leo includes access to Mixtral 8x7B, Claude Instant, and Llama 2 13B. Mixtral—the default LLM—can interact in multiple languages including English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. It can even generate code.</p>
<p>Mixtral 8x7B has quickly gained popularity and usage among the developer community since its December, 2023 release. Mixtral 8x7B currently outperforms ChatGPT 3.5, Claude Instant, Llama 2, and many others, according to the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard">LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard</a>. Mixtral also shows improvements in reducing hallucinations and biases, <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/">according to the BBQ benchmark</a>.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, <a>we recently set Mixtral 8x7B as the default LLM</a> for Leo on desktop, and we’ve seen great feedback. And while Mixtral is the default LLM for Android as well, users have the option to select from other LLMs, or to upgrade to Leo Premium for higher rate limits.</p>

 Leo Premium&nbsp; 
<p>The Brave Leo experience is free to all users. For those who’d like access to higher rate limits, however, Leo is also available as a Premium experience. Users can subscribe to Leo Premium for <a href="https://account.brave.com/?intent=checkout&amp;product=leo">$14.99/month</a>, and one subscription covers up to 5 different devices across Android, Linux, macOS, and Windows. Users log into their Brave account from their other devices with that subscription.</p>

 Smart AI, still private by default 
<p>As with all of Brave’s other features, privacy remains paramount for Brave Leo. Chats with Leo are private and secure. Leo doesn’t record chats, or use them for model training, and no account or login is required to use Leo. These specific privacy protections in Leo include:</p>
 
 
<p>Reverse proxy: All requests are proxied through an anonymization server so the request and user cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address.</p>
 
 
<p>Responses discarded: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded after they’re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers that can be linked to you (such as <a>IP address</a>), and no personal data is retained by Brave-hosted AI models. If you select a model from Anthropic and submit Leo queries, that data will be processed by Anthropic for a period of 30 days, then deleted.</p>
 
 
<p>No login or account required for access for the free version: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo (they access their Premium account if they wish to use Leo across multiple devices however).&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Unlinkable subscription: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you use to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience.</p>
 
 

 What’s next for Leo, and how to get started 
<p>Brave Leo for Android is now available to all Brave Android users who’ve updated to version 1.63. Note that it will be rolled out in phases over the next few days, so users should check back soon if they’re not seeing it today.  Brave Leo for iOS devices will be available in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Ready to try Brave Leo? It’s easy: Simply open the browser, begin typing in the address bar, and click  “Ask Leo”. For the on page chat experience, Android users can tap “⋮” and then tap Leo to get started.</p>
<p>To learn more about Brave Leo, check out our main product <a>main product page</a>, or see Leo’s product <a>roadmap</a>.</p>

<p>With the latest update of Brave on desktop (1.63), Brave Wallet users can now create Native SegWit Bitcoin accounts, which offer lower transaction fees and better error detection compared to other Bitcoin account types. Brave Wallet is now also fully equipped to send and receive from all types of Bitcoin addresses, including Legacy, Nested SegWit, Native SegWit, and Taproot, ensuring compatibility with third-party wallets.</p>
<p>After nearly 15 years, Bitcoin has stood the test of time and proven itself as a resilient asset class. There’s growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin following the approval of several Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S.— and Bitcoin use cases are expanding beyond peer-to-peer payments and serving as a store-of-value with a new wave of innovation fueled by NFTs and DeFi.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our aim with Brave Wallet is to offer the most secure and privacy-considerate software wallet for everyday use. As the Bitcoin ecosystem expands with new apps and services, Brave Wallet will be there to put security and privacy first, to help keep users’ assets safe.”</p>
<p>– James Mudgett, VP Web3 Products at Brave</p>

			Davy Rothbart			is an Emmy Award-winning filmmaker, a bestselling author, a journalist whose work has been featured in The New Yorker, The New York Times, and on NPR's This American Life, and the founder of Washington To Washington, an organization which brings city kids on wilderness adventures.		 
	 
  



 
<p>Fidji Simo sat in a San Francisco hotel room, poring over details for the coming day. As CEO of tech upstart Instacart, the next morning—September 19, 2023—would be a landmark day. Simo was leading the company’s IPO, a historic moment that would be held at Instacart’s headquarters in downtown San Francisco. Nasdaq staff had flown in from New York City to oversee the event, and Simo’s own parents had made the journey from France. Though Simo was known for her equanimity, she was electric with anticipation.</p>



<p>Her husband, Remy Miralles, encouraged her to try to get some sleep. Miralles had been by Simo’s side throughout her journey: from a high schooler in France with big dreams to an MBA student in the United States; from helping scale Facebook, the world’s biggest social media network, to taking the helm as CEO at Instacart, where she led the company through a dramatic period of transition as she prepared it to go public. “Promise me one thing,” Miralles said. “Tomorrow, you’ll be pulled in a million directions. You’ll be focused on what comes next. Please, savor the moment.”</p>



<p>Simo knew he was right. It would be a mistake to breeze past this momentous occasion with her gaze set solely on the future. As the winds off the Bay whistled outside, Simo settled in to wait for the new day to begin.</p>



 



<p>Sète, population 44,576 (about the size of San Luis Obispo), is a bucolic fishing town in the south of France, on the Mediterranean Sea. For generations, Simo’s family, Sicilian by heritage, had worked in the fishing industry. Her grandfather, Rocco, was the captain of a fishing vessel; her father, Jacques, rose through the ranks to captain his own boat. They worked long, hard days, sometimes as long as 18 hours, heading out to sea at 2 in the morning and returning at 8 in the evening with a fresh haul of bass, sole, hake, monkfish, sardines and anchovies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Simo’s grandmother, Viviane, was a fishmonger who sold what her husband caught at a tiny shop in the center of town. Simo took pride in her family’s hard work and their crucial, if perhaps underappreciated, role in supplying food for the village and beyond. But she knew she would never follow in their footsteps. As a kid, though it thrilled her to join her dad at sea, she always got seasick, a malady she never outgrew. Simo preferred being on land and cherished her time in the city gardens with her sketchbook in hand, filling a blank page with drawings inspired by Gaudí and the Surrealists, or in her mother’s boutique, admiring her entrepreneurial spirit and the kind, authentic way she interacted with customers. Over time, Simo developed an interest in business and dreamed of one day launching one of her own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One night, the radio Simo’s grandfather kept on the dining room table crackled to life—an emergency transmission. A fishing boat was in rough seas, in desperate trouble. While her father and other fishermen scrambled into boats to aid the rescue mission, Simo stayed by her grandfather’s side, listening as the captains worked together to organize the rescue, riveted by their composure under pressure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The memory has always stuck with Simo—a demonstration of the power of leadership and community in a moment of crisis. As boat captains, Simo’s dad and grandfather often spoke of their responsibilities, not only in keeping their crews safe but making sure each person on board felt valued. They were the kinds of leaders who wouldn’t assign a task they weren’t willing to do themselves, never too regal to scrub decks or disentangle nets. “The crew comes before you, always,” Simo says, summarizing the ethos her dad and grandfather modeled. For her, this approach has been a lifelong priority. The world of tech may seem vastly distant from life aboard a fishing boat on the Mediterranean Sea, but for Simo, her childhood yielded lasting lessons.</p>



 



<p>After high school, when Simo left her hometown to go to business school at HEC Paris, Miralles went with her. The two had met as teenagers and formed a friendship that would evolve into a lifelong partnership. As she closed in on her master’s degree, Simo elected to take courses at UCLA, fulfilling a long-held dream of moving to the U.S. that she’d nurtured through an obsession with the Southern California TV drama “The O.C.” Again, Miralles joined her. Their decision to move overseas, far from their home and close-knit families, wasn’t made lightly. But Simo, like her parents and grandparents before her, had always been one to rush toward a challenge, not run away. What’s more, she had Miralles’ support, a confidence that would give her the courage to make bold decisions time and again in her career. And she was intrigued by what she viewed as a U.S. appetite for entrepreneurial risk-taking—in business and in developing new technologies.</p>



<p>On the flight to Los Angeles, she blasted the theme song to “The O.C.,” “California” by Phantom Planet, through her headphones: “California, here we come!” She knew the future would come with challenges, but sitting back in her seat, she relished the joy of it beginning.</p>



 



<p>After UCLA, Simo spent four years on eBay’s strategy team before moving to Facebook in 2011. The company had already seen explosive growth but continued to expand its scope. As VP of video, games and monetization, Simo tackled challenges with relish, defying skeptics at every turn. Few believed Facebook could monetize mobile, but Simo cracked the problem by introducing a robust advertising network to the Facebook App, which proved to be a turning point for the company. When there were doubts as to whether the company could compete with YouTube given its eight-year head start on video, Simo and her team built Facebook Live and Facebook Watch, pioneering new approaches to video streaming and generating massive engagement.</p>



<p>In time, Simo developed a powerful sponsor in CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Working alongside him at “the school of Zuck,” as she calls it, Simo learned crucial lessons about balancing long-term strategy and vision with a commitment to short-term execution. “A lot of great operators can do the day-to-day, nitty-gritty work, but don’t have vision,” Simo says. “And a lot of people have great vision, but can’t execute for the life of them. Mark has both. And that really shaped me.”</p>



<p>Zuckerberg’s faith in Simo was apparent when he gave her the reins to the flagship Facebook App, where she would manage a staff of 6,000. As Simo dug excitedly into the new challenge, however, she suddenly began dealing with a constellation of frightening physical symptoms: dizziness, nausea and frequent fainting spells. She was eventually diagnosed with a neuroimmune condition called postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS), which is not life-threatening but can be debilitating.</p>



<p>Determined to rise to the occasion of leading the Facebook App, Simo refused to let the diagnosis hold her back. Instead, she found creative ways of managing her symptoms in the workplace, like bringing a reclining chair into the boardroom to ensure her blood pressure didn’t drop during long meetings. Facebook rallied around her during this time—an outpouring of community support that echoed what she’d experienced as a child in Sète’s fishing scene.</p>



<p>Despite Simo’s successes and close relationships at Facebook, as a creative soul, she yearned to one day be a CEO herself. She viewed the CEO position as the ultimate canvas to shape a business following her own instincts and imagination. She was fascinated with the idea of solving a company’s most critical puzzles. In 2021, when she was approached by a major tech company in need of new ideas and fresh vision on its board, her ears perked up.</p>
 







 
<p>Instacart was founded in 2012 by Apoorva Mehta, Max Mullen and Brandon Leonardo. After an initial rejection, it famously secured a spot in Y Combinator when the founders ordered a six-pack of beer that was delivered to the partners. Michael Moritz, formerly a partner at Sequoia, led its investment in the company soon after.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following nearly a decade of steady growth, Instacart became essential during the pandemic as shopping went digital, and its sales surged. But as quarantine waned and people returned to shopping in person, Instacart’s growth declined. The company recognized it needed to redefine itself in a post-COVID world. Founder-CEO Mehta was the first to identify Simo for the board, noting that her scaled operating experience and product expertise would be valuable as the company navigated the path forward.</p>



<p>While maintaining her role at Facebook, Simo joined Instacart’s board in January 2021 as the company was strategizing on how to expand its ambitions. “Instacart’s mission of helping people access food resonated deeply with me,” she says. “Growing up in a family who for generations harvested food from the sea and brought it ashore, it was this ancestral, deeply cultural connection.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Later that summer, Instacart and Mehta began pursuing a successor for his role to lead the company into its next chapter—someone with a vision for Instacart’s future and experience running an organization at the scale the company hoped to achieve. Moritz, impressed with Simo’s board contributions, began championing her for the role. Recognizing her CEO potential and ambition, he wryly commented to Simo that she would grow old waiting for the chance at Facebook. “Michael had the wisdom of having seen so many people navigate this career moment,” Simo says. “He told me, ‘If one of your goals is to be a CEO, to make a difference and see what you can do when you can drive your own vision, Instacart is your canvas.’”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the position’s appeal, Simo knew it came with pressure and risk. “At the time, Instacart’s gross transaction volume was declining by double digits,” Simo remembers. While Instacart’s success—and her own as its CEO—wasn’t guaranteed, Simo was drawn to the challenge of steering the company’s evolution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After a series of visits from Moritz at her home to discuss the role’s challenges and potential—and bond over her husband’s recipe for madeleines—she was about ready to accept. When she asked Miralles his opinion, he encouraged her to listen to her instincts for where she would find joy. “That’s where you’ll do your best work,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In August 2021, Simo became CEO of Instacart, a seismic industry move that made headlines around the world. Now, the hard work could finally begin.</p>



 



<p>Simo was aware of the whispers in Silicon Valley that Instacart would never be profitable. As newly minted CEO, she was determined to prove skeptics wrong, as she had throughout her career.</p>



<p>Early in her new role as CEO, Simo observed a tension between Instacart and its retail partners, the grocery stores where Instacart shoppers shopped. To the retailers, Simo says, it wasn’t clear if Instacart was a friend or a “frenemy.” She recognized that Instacart was reliant on its retailers for success and sought to strengthen these relationships in a way that was symbiotic. If Instacart could help retailers thrive, she intuited, the company would also prosper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To achieve this, Simo revamped Instacart’s company values and instituted a new leadership ethos known as Grow the Pie to help grocers improve their own processes—both in-store and online—via new technologies. Instacart partnered with over 100 grocery chains like Sprouts and Publix to build smooth, sleek, white-label websites that are individually branded but powered by Instacart. Now, whether a customer orders groceries through Instacart or a grocer’s site, both parties benefit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of Simo’s superpowers is innovating new products, and a major appeal of the CEO role was getting to push product visions forward. As part of its omnichannel strategy, Simo made the decision to acquire Caper AI, a startup offering AI-powered grocery carts. When an in-store customer places an item in a Caper Cart, the cart is able to scan it and add the price to a running tally. The screen serves as a payment terminal, so when a customer is done shopping, they can avoid the line and head for the parking lot. The cart is also outfitted with a screen where brands can suggest recipes and advertise products, a significant revenue opportunity for both Instacart and the stores.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“These changes have allowed Instacart to reach beyond its roots as a service fulfillment company into managing the full grocery shopping ecosystem.”</p>
Fidji Simo</blockquote>



<p>Once retailers were confident that their goals were aligned with Instacart’s, they found other ways to more deeply integrate, adding new online offerings that enabled customers to access every aisle of the store—including alcohol, produce and packaged goods—and to pay via a variety of payment methods, including EBT SNAP. “These changes have allowed Instacart to reach beyond its roots as a service fulfillment company into managing the full grocery shopping ecosystem, while partner stores also benefit,” Simo says. “It’s been absolutely thrilling to see.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simo recognized the critical role played not just by partner stores, but by Instacart’s shoppers. To understand their motivations and challenges, Simo tried her hand at being a shopper herself. The experiment was humbling. Finding parking at a San Francisco grocery store called Gus’s was in itself a daunting feat. Then, managing a customer’s particular dietary preferences presented another challenge. As Simo roamed the aisles trying to locate a specific brand of kombucha (a product that this fish-and-potatoes girl had never tried), a store manager came to her aid and helped her complete the order. “I got a sense for how resourceful the shoppers are and how difficult a job it can be,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simo began holding regular one-on-one meetings with shoppers, too. She notes that Instacart’s shoppers vary demographically from other gig economy workers: about two-thirds are women and approximately half are parents. Simo says the shoppers provided “a tapestry of reasons” why they were drawn to Instacart, though for most of them the flexible hours—and locations—were key. One shopper had a severely disabled daughter and was able to clock in for short stretches when someone else was available to offer support at home. Another woman had always dreamed of traveling to all 50 states. Working for Instacart allowed her to have a job on hand wherever she traveled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simo made it her mission for Instacart to introduce new technologies that would increase shopper efficiency and boost their pay. Instacart began alerting shoppers to peak earnings days; prompted customers to increase tips when they rated a shopper five stars; created batch orders so that a shopper could grab items for multiple customers on a single trip to the grocery store; and built in-app way-finding technologies that allow shoppers to navigate aisles and collect items in a more efficient pattern. These efforts have largely succeeded; Shopper salaries, on a per-hour basis, have consistently notched up. “I’m proud that shoppers are now making more than they did in the past,” Simo says.</p>

<p>Simo was chosen to lead Instacart because investors believed she could grow the company and reimagine it, but also because they felt she could ready the company to go public. In late 2021, however, the tech industry was hit by a market collapse and subsequent IPO drought. Given this difficult climate, a less ambitious person might have shelved the prospect of going public altogether. But Simo was keenly aware of the hundreds of Instacart employees who had worked tirelessly for years, for whom an IPO could be life-changing, allowing them a cash liquidity she felt they’d clearly earned. Simo promised her employees that when the market grew receptive, Instacart would be one of the first companies to go public. To do so, however, Simo “quickly realized that we needed to show the world that this was an industry that was profitable.”</p>



<p>Ravi Gupta, a former CFO and COO at Instacart who became a partner at Sequoia in 2019, became a trusted advisor to Simo as she quickly got up to speed on where Instacart had been and put a strategy in place for the future. Recalling their conversations, Gupta says, “She’s built to be a CEO. She wants the ball. She wants the responsibility that comes with leadership.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“She’s built to be a CEO. She wants the ball. She wants the responsibility that comes with leadership.”</p>
Ravi Gupta</blockquote>



<p>For two years, Simo worked with her team to pivot the company toward profitability. Product innovations—from batching orders to shopper way-finding—improved the margin on each order, and its revenue from advertising has grown significantly. Instacart now boasts more than 5,500 ad partners, including PepsiCo, General Mills and Unilever. It has introduced new ad formats such as shoppable display ads, and because Instacart (and its associated white-label sites) is a closed-loop platform, the company is able to serve up unique insights to partners about how their ads are driving sales. Instacart reported that ad campaigns drive an average 15% incremental sales lift—an almost unheard-of number.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the market downturn, Simo had observed other companies try to hang onto their former valuations, concerned about the optics of a lowered figure. “They buried their heads in the sand and pretended nothing had changed,” she says. “I took a different approach. I faced reality straight-up, and I’m like, ‘Okay, yep, the markets have changed. We are not worth the same. That’s totally okay. Let’s embrace this new reality and grant stock for employees at a fair valuation.’ We’re focused on doing what’s right, not the thing that looks good.’”</p>



<p>By the summer of 2023, Instacart had hit five consecutive quarters of profitability. As the markets continued to warm, Simo kept her promise to her team, setting an IPO date for September, with an opening price of $30 per share. With more than $2 billion in cash reserves, Simo says Instacart’s IPO was less about raising money (and, in fact, was non-dilutive) than making sure that the company’s more than 3,000 employees would finally realize the fruits of their labor.</p>



<p>Usually, when a company goes public and hits the Nasdaq exchange, a few lead executives show up in New York City to ring the bell and celebrate. But Simo knew the company’s success was a result of the employees who had contributed throughout the years, and she wanted all of them to have the chance to participate in the festivities. So she asked Nasdaq officials to come to San Francisco.</p>



<p>The night before the IPO, her husband’s suggestion to be present resonated deeply. The next morning, as the company gathered in the employee cafeteria, now decked out with its CART ticker symbol, Simo circulated among employees, the executive team, the founders and their families, and felt her emotions rise. She and her husband had also invited their 8-year-old daughter Willow to join the occasion, as well as Simo’s parents and grandmother Viviane—the former fishmonger—who’d arrived from her hometown of Sète. “I started seeing the scene through their eyes,” Simo says. “I hadn’t made a big deal out of it, and I don’t think they really knew what to expect. But when I saw the tears in their eyes, it flipped a switch in me.” In particular, Simo was moved by the sight of her dad, Jacques—the hardened fishing captain who could pull a hook out of his hand without flinching—now radiant, bursting with pride and tearing up.</p>



<p>Cameras rolled, broadcasting the ceremony around the world, as Simo stood on stage with Instacart’s executive team and rang the bell, marking Instacart’s emergence as a publicly traded company. For 90 seconds, she clapped along with her colleagues, sharing the joy, accomplishment and pride of the moment. “And then right after the cameras turned off,” she says, “I was just a sobbing mess.”</p>



<p>Through her tears, Simo picked up a microphone and made an impromptu toast, shining a light on Instacart’s co-founders and talented workforce. “I had this immense feeling of gratitude,” Simo says, “because I realized how much of a privilege it was to lead a team like this, and work toward a mission that can make a difference in the world.” Simo says what gives her the most joy in business is finding the magic in others and celebrating it. To have the chance to big-up her hard-working team in front of their colleagues—and even their own families—swept her with another wave of happy tears. Finally, Simo welcomed her daughter, Willow, to join her on the podium, and as a chorus of flashbulbs popped, they both grinned—dreaming of the future, but fully present in the moment.</p>



 



<p>The art studio in Simo’s home, dubbed the flower room, is a space dedicated to her personal projects: paintings, sculptures and collages. Simo takes flowers by the dozens, hangs them up to dry and then uses their distinctive natural dyes as a material in her art. Simo’s health condition makes intensive exercise a no-go, so when she wants to tune out work stress, the flower room is her sanctuary. One recent Saturday afternoon, she huddled with Willow in the flower room, sculpting magic wands out of sticks and flowers. Together, they pretended to imbue each wand with special powers: levitating objects, stopping time.</p>



<p>Though Simo’s free time is limited, she squeezes every drop out of it, cherishing moments with her daughter and the occasional dinner out with Miralles. She also, bogglingly, has found the bandwidth to create the Metrodora Institute, which opened in April 2023 in Salt Lake City. Metrodora, named after a fifth-century female Greek physician, welcomes those living with diseases that many doctors fail to diagnose and often do not know how to treat. The center offers clinical care and conducts scientific research with the goal of developing cures for complex chronic conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Challenges can spur creation,” Simo says. It’s a motto she reiterates to her team at Instacart as the company continues to work to expand its scope and prove its durability in what remains a challenging environment for many public tech companies. One of the initiatives to broaden Instacart’s horizons relates to Simo’s interest in health care and biotech. “Eighty-five percent of health care costs come from treating chronic diseases, like diabetes and hypertension, that can be caused or made worse by diets that lack key nutrients,” Simo says. “It became obvious to me that a company like Instacart, which exists at the intersection of people’s relationship with food, has a role to play in health care.” Simo conceived of Instacart Health, a program that allows doctors to prescribe food as easily as they prescribe medication. Simo imagines a future where a doctor not only recommends that a patient eat healthier, but prescribes specific meals, and by the time that patient arrives home, the ingredients for the meal are waiting on their doorstep, delivered by an Instacart shopper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But for now, here on a Saturday afternoon with her daughter, Simo’s job is to sculpt another magic wand and pass her special powers down to her own child. “I want her to see that everything is possible,” Simo says. “That’s the biggest gift that my parents gave me.” Though Simo’s family had no advanced degrees, Simo says their message to her never wavered: If you work hard and put your mind to something, you can accomplish anything. Now, Simo reflects on Instacart’s IPO, and her special moment on stage with her daughter. “I think that was when everything landed for her,” Simo says. “Like, ‘Okay, wow, this is a big moment. And Mom is right! We can do big things.’”</p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation engineering team has been working on an implementation library for <a href="https://zfnd.org/frost/">FROST</a> (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures) for Zcash. To support this we have built <a href="https://frost.zfnd.org/zcash/ywallet-demo.html">demos</a>, which are NOT to be used in a production environment nor with any secrets. The purpose of these demos are to:</p>



 
 Identify gaps in our documentation 



 Provide usage examples for developer facing documentation 



 Provide reference implementations for developers wanting to use FROST in a “real world” scenario 
 



 



<p></p>



 THREE DEMOS 



<p>We have three demos in this project covering each of the corresponding roles, which are:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Trusted Dealer: a third party or participant who is trusted to:
 
 Generate good randomness 



 Keep secret values confidential 



 Delete secret values after distributing key shares to each participant 
 
 



 Participant: a recipient of a key share 



 Coordinator: a third party or participant who is responsible for:
 
 Determining which participants will take part in generating a signature 



 Coordinating FROST signature rounds 



 Aggregating signature shares generated by each participant 



 Publishing the resulting signature 
 
 
 



 



<p>Note: We also have <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost-zcash-demo/tree/main/dkg">a demo</a> which covers Distributed Key Generation (DKG), where there is no trusted dealer role and participants generate key shares among themselves.</p>



 



<p></p>



<p>We invite you to&nbsp; test the demos for yourself by following <a href="https://frost.zfnd.org/zcash/ywallet-demo.html">our tutorial</a>, which was showcased during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvzESdDtczo&amp;list=PL40dyJ0UYTLII7oQRQmNOFf0d2iKT35tL&amp;index=37">our presentation at ZCon4</a>. The demos allow you to choose one of two journeys—either with a trusted dealer or DKG for key generation. This tutorial describes the trusted dealer journey.</p>



 



 HOW WE BUILT THEM 



<p>The method for building these demos included:</p>



 
 Reading the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852.pdf">FROST paper</a> 



 Reading the <a href="https://cfrg.github.io/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost-15/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost.html">FROST draft</a> 



 Reading documentation in the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/frost-core">FROST crate</a> 



 Reading documentation in library while building the demos 



 Referring to the draft paper to match the documentation 
 



<p>When building a protocol library from a paper, names are likely to change and you need to document the code well; it’s not uncommon to find mismatches. We tried to build the demo from the perspective of someone who had not seen FROST before, and so we went through all the documentation without any assumptions. We also started publishing releases more often so the demos could be updated as we found different API changes we needed to make. This encouraged us to properly document throughout the process.</p>



 



 NEW FUNCTIONALITY 



<p>We realized that we hadn’t created a way for the trusted dealer to accept an existing key rather than allowing the application to generate one for you. Originally we weren’t able to specify an existing secret because generate_trusted_dealer() generated a secret for you. We compared this functionality to that specified in the draft paper and&nbsp; it was discovered this was missing; so we added split_secret() to handle this functionality and trusted_dealer_keygen()would generate one instead.</p>



<p>We also took this opportunity to add serde support to our FROST library. Serde is a library that helps encoding structures into multiple formats such as JSON or XML. We’d had a request to implement serde in our FROST library and decided that the demos created a good opportunity to get this done, since they require copying and pasting structures between terminals. It was pretty straightforward and it meant we could copy structures encoded as a single line JSON object between our terminals, instead of having to copy and paste each field of each structure.</p>



<p>Working on these demos has enabled us to make the library more robust and easier to use for implementers. We’d love to know if you agree!</p>



<p>We hope that this will help anyone understand how frost works and what you can do with it. Please do let us know if you’ve found this useful by reaching out to us on the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/676527656170160146/997122644048613427">ZF Discord FROST channel</a>.</p>

<p>Confidential-DPproof uses Zero Knowledge Proofs for verifiable privacy protection, and garners Spotlight award at prestigious ICLR 2024 conference</p>
<p>by Ali Shahin Shamsabadi, Privacy Researcher at Brave&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Summary. Machine learning models trained on clients’ data without any guarantees of privacy can leak sensitive information about clients. For example, in the application of machine learning to advertising, we ideally want to learn the general patterns (“showing scientific advertisements to clients visiting scientifically related contents”), however parameters of a trained machine learning model might encode specific facts about the interest of an individual client (“Ali visited <a>https://brave.com/research/</a> on 26 Feb 2024.”). Unfortunately, some institutions may not adhere to their claim of training machine learning models with client privacy</p>
 
 Intentionally: not considering client privacy while training the models, or considering inadequate privacy safeguards to achieve better model utility; or&nbsp; 
 Accidentally: hard-to-detect bugs occurred in the implementation of privacy requirements of learning algorithms. 
 
<p>We introduce verifiable private training (Confidential-DPproof – Confidential proof of differentially private training) which enhances training with a certificate of privacy while not revealing any information about the data and model.</p>
<p><a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=PQY2v6VtGe">Confidential-DPproof</a> is accepted at the 12th International Conference on Learning Representations <a href="https://iclr.cc/">ICLR2024</a> as a spotlight (top 5%) paper. Confidential-DPproof will be presented at the conference between May 7th and 11th in Vienna, Austria. <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=PQY2v6VtGe">Confidential-DPproof</a> is available in an open-source implementation, and can be used by institutions to offer verifiable privacy protection to clients in machine learning based products.</p>

 Why should we care about client’s privacy when training machine learning models on their data? 
<p>Machine learning models that are trained without a privacy-preserving algorithm can memorize sensitive information about their training set. Publishing the parameters, or even just the outputs, of machine learning models can consequently risk the privacy of the clients who contributed to their training process. For example,&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.05820.pdf">Membership inference attacks</a>: exploit access to a model’s outputs to infer the presence (or absence) of a particular data point in its training set. 
 <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=oVn5GLyONY">Data reconstruction attacks</a>: reconstruct the original training data points through an analysis of the model’s parameters.&nbsp; 
 

 How can we protect client’s privacy? 
<p>The framework of <a href="https://www.iacr.org/archive/tcc2006/38760266/38760266.pdf">Differential Privacy</a> is the gold standard for formalizing privacy guarantees. When training machine learning models, a Differential Privacy training algorithm provides guarantees for individuals by ensuring that data contributed by each individual client has a bounded influence on the final model in a mathematically precise manner. Therefore, absence or presence of a client will not result in a significantly different model.</p>
<p>Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent is the canonical approach to training machine learning models with guarantees of Differential Privacy. Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent imposes two main modifications to vanilla Stochastic Gradient Descent to provide differential privacy guarantees: 1) clipping per-example gradients to a fixed norm to bound the algorithm’s sensitivity to each individual client’s data (assuming each client only contributes one data point to the training); 2) adding calibrated noise to gradients before they are applied to update the model to ensure indistinguishability across updates. Training machine learning models with Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent mitigates all attacks against the privacy of training data that fall within the threat model of differential privacy, including membership inference and training data reconstruction.</p>

 Why should we care about verifiable privacy? 
<p>Implementing Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent training algorithms can be challenging and hard-to-detect errors can easily occur as a result of uncommon and complex modification to the underlying training optimizer. Therefore, institutions may not adhere to their claims of training machine learning models with differential privacy guarantees intentionally (e.g., if they are trying to evade privacy regulations to maximize utility) or accidentally (e.g., if there are hard-to-detect bugs in the implementation of their private algorithm). For example, see Apple’s ambiguity around not releasing the exact privacy budget of a deployed Differential Privacy mechanism and/or other relevant details: <a href="https://www.cs.brynmawr.edu/Courses/cs380/fall2019/Papers/privacylossappleproducts.pdf">Privacy Loss in Apple’s Implementation of Differential Privacy on MacOS 10.12</a>.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important for companies or other institutions that use DP-SGD to demonstrate that they train models within the privacy constraints expressed by clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Confidential-DPproof framework 
<p>We designed a framework, called <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=PQY2v6VtGe">Confidential-DPproof</a>, that allows institutions to directly and proactively prove to any interested party–users or customers, regulators or governments–, through the execution of a Zero Knowledge Proof protocol, that their machine learning models are trained in a privacy-preserving manner (i.e., protecting the privacy of individuals who provided their data for the training).</p>


    
    

    


    




 How does Confidential-DPproof work? 
<p>In our work, we propose a zero-knowledge proof protocol to proactively generate a certificate of privacy during the training process while preserving the confidentiality of all information including training data and model parameters.&nbsp; Zero-knowledge proof allows a party to prove statements about their private data without revealing it. Therefore, the prover’s dataset or model is not revealed to external parties.</p>
<p>Parties. Consider a setting with two parties, a prover and an auditor:</p>
 
 The prover is an institution that wants to train a model on a sensitive dataset for different purposes such as providing machine learning based services. 
 The auditor is an external entity (e.g., a user or an auditor) that aims to verify the privacy guarantees of the prover’s model. 
 
<p>Desiderata.</p>
 
 Completeness. The auditor must infer the exact privacy guarantee and provide a public certificate of such guarantee. 
 Soundness. The auditor must be able to catch malicious provers who do not adhere to their claims of training machine learning models with privacy guarantees, either intentionally or accidentally. 
 Zero Knowledge. The training data and model parameters computed during training must stay confidential as institutions are not willing/allowed to share their models and data with external parties due to privacy regulations and intellectual property concerns. 
 
<p>Confidential-DPproof framework works as follows:</p>
 
 Prover publicly announces the privacy guarantees that it is planning to provide; 
 Prover and auditor agree on the Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent training algorithm and specific values for its hyperparameters. 
 Prover and auditor run our newly-proposed zero-knowledge protocol. 
 Prover obtains a certificate for the claimed privacy guarantee. 
 

 How is the performance of Confidential-DPproof? 
<p>Since we design Confidential-DPproof to enable institutions to prove the differential privacy guarantees of their model to an auditor while being able to protect the confidentiality of their data and model, our experiments consider the following questions:</p>
 
 What are the best trade-offs between utility and certified privacy guarantees that Confidential-DPproof can achieve given i)&nbsp; the respective interests of the institution (in terms of utility); ii)&nbsp; the respective interests of auditor (in terms of privacy); and iii) constraints imposed by Zero-Knowledge proof regarding the complexity of models? 
 What is the cost (in terms of running time) of verifying the training run while ensuring confidentiality? 
 
<p>

    
    

    


    



ConfidentialDPproof trains machine learning models that achieve high test accuracy with certified privacy guarantees in practical running time!</p>

 Want to improve Confidential-DPproof? 
<p>Confidential-DPproof provides many benefits to institutions and their users; however, there is still room for improvement. For example, one could further extend Confidential-DPproof to prove that no adversarial data manipulation, such as sharing information across data points, was performed prior to data commitment.</p>

<p>The monolithic blockchain era appears to be sunsetting. Among the first to contribute to this paradigm shift was Cosmos, which introduced the idea of specialized sovereign blockchains (appchains), made possible by the Cosmos SDK. Nowadays, the modular thesis employs external data availability and even execution solutions, which enables the creation of countless new chains. Each new blockchains comes with its own ‘specs’, and centralised RPC and node providers have to adapt to each chain’s setting. However, the saying ‘Jack of all trades, master of none’ applies in this scenario too - we have often witnessed RPC failures during high demand periods. Lava Network aims to provide a competitive marketplace for RPC and node providers, which would compete based on their performance and user feedback.</p><p>We were joined by Gil and Yair to discuss Lava Network’s RPC decentralisation in the modular, multi-chain landscape.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  High-level overview of Lava Network  What problem Lava Network solves  Decentralised marketplace for RPC providers  Quality of centralised vs. decentralised RPC providers  Gateways  Lava Network participants  Specs &amp; APIs  Quality of service &amp; provider optimizer  How services are priced  Relayers  Modularity &amp; chain abstraction  Magma &amp; Lava mainnet  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/yaircleper">Yair Cleper on LinkedIn</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/xgilxgil">Gil Binder on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/lavanetxyz">Lava Network on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>As transparent Central Bank Digital Currency <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/euro-backed-stablecoin-eurm-trials-spain?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">(CBDC) pilots</a> continue to gain traction, on-chain privacy has exploded into one of the polarizing issues in the Web3 industry. However, as is the nature of polarizing extremes, neither absolute transparency nor absolute privacy will serve users' real-world needs.</p><p>In fact, the privacy vs. compliance issue has existed and has already largely been solved for, across states and time. Existing systems based in the physical domain tend to operate on the principle of default privacy. As such, state-approved mechanisms are implemented to mitigate against fraud and other dishonest practices. These introduce and enforce transparency, such as mandatory financial reporting and audit requirements. Furthermore, additional privacy protections are extended to individuals and private enterprises such that their financial reporting isn’t exposed.</p><p>In contrast, those blockchain-based, public-ledger systems that underpin DeFi operate on default transparency. This means public ledgers require additional mechanisms that preserve privacy. Then, as per their physical domain equivalents, discoverability features must be implemented to prevent money laundering, tax evasion, and other forms of malicious activity from eluding the state.</p><p>The issue, therefore, is really about Web3 accepting that while DeFi does “solve money”, it must also solve for a balance between privacy and compliance, because money will always be in the domain of the state’s law enforcement (even when the state no longer prints it).</p> Going beyond early teething pains <p>Most Web3 advocates believe that blockchain ecosystems have the potential to provide the best conditions to operate an integrated global economy that is prosperous, liquid, resilient, and fair. However, institutions are never going to agree to operate in a fully transparent environment. Compliant on-chain privacy is the catalyst required to push decentralized financial players to penetrate the mass market.</p><p>To achieve this, the Web3 community must shake off the tendency to polarize DeFi privacy projects as teetering between terrorist financier and a tyrannical surveillance facilitator. While the nascent public ledger privacy sector has been met with <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tornado-cash-strong-defense-trial?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">litigation</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/monero-drops-multi-month-lows-binance-delisting?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">critical delistings</a> — it becomes clear that now is the time for a mature solution set that respects the financial privacy rights of institutions and individual users, while providing the compliance features of its physical-domain cousins.</p><p>Now is the time to get serious about adoption. And, to achieve widespread adoption, Web3 needs to engage in a more nuanced conversation about the integral roles privacy and transparency play in facilitating the fundamental process of exchange, maintaining fair and free markets, and enabling institutions to conduct daily operations. In short, these issues are a matter of existential importance to the future of decentralized systems.</p> On-chain privacy, a problem solved <p>Panther Protocol has developed the mature, considered solution set that allows institutions and end-users to balance their privacy and compliance needs.&nbsp;</p><p>With Panther, institutional players have access to a suite of DeFi tools to manage dedicated trading spaces, called Zones, to trade digital assets in Shielded Pools — revolutionizing private trades with public, on-chain settlement.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools/zones?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther Zones</a> are highly customizable, as are their disclosure mechanisms. The Panther suite empowers institutions to leverage privacy-protocol trades with allowlisted assets and counterparties. Designed with the operational efficiencies of institutions in mind, Panther simplifies portfolio and asset management with a suite of features that provide unparalleled privacy, security, and compliance support for public on-chain transactions.&nbsp;</p><p>Panther Protocol recognizes that the path to adoption isn’t about the mechanics of privacy, transparency, or discoverability, per se; it’s about providing meaningful abstraction to the end user. Panther’s Privacy Protocol is doing for the on-chain domain what the Microsoft Office suite did for the personal computer — delivering abstractions that make it usable. However, unlike Microsoft, Panther presents a Web3-native protocol based on chain-agnostic, decentralized principles.</p><p>Here at Panther, we believe that those who understand institutional operations and pain points intimately and who apply the technical know-how to develop versatile on-chain systems with refined privacy functions will be the major winners in Web3’s next major wave: the institutional onboarding process. We intend to spearhead that revolution.</p><p>Interested in customizing your own trading Zone? Reach out to us at contact@pantherprotocol.io.</p>

<p>PIVX is thrilled to announce the launch of update v5.6.1, a crucial upgrade required for all users, including exchanges and service providers. It’s imperative that everyone updates their software prior to the implementation of the new Exchange Addresses to ensure seamless operations. With the upcoming activation height set at 4281680, the network will begin to isolate older versions to facilitate a smooth transition.</p><p>For most users, the update does not introduce any significant changes, except for the inability to send Shield Transactions to Exchange Addresses. Updating is straightforward: simply replace your existing pivxd or pivx-qt application with the latest version, or install the update via our provided installer packages.</p><p>For exchanges and service providers, the update introduces a novel feature — the “Exchange Address.” This innovation aims to simplify regulatory compliance and minimize accounting challenges associated with shielded transactions sent to exchanges. By utilizing the new RPC command getnewexchangeaddress, exchanges can generate these specialized addresses, which are identifiable by the “EXM” prefix, standing for Exchange Mainnet. This command also allows for labeling the new address, functioning similarly to existing commands like getnewaddress or getnewstakingaddress.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX/releases/tag/v5.6.1">https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX/releases/tag/v5.6.1</a></p><p>Additionally, the v5.6.1 update enhances the overall user experience with various quality-of-life improvements to the PIVX Core. These enhancements include upgraded GUI features, the ability to generate proposal addresses directly when creating proposals, CoinControl for selecting inputs for master nodes, the option to lock shield notes, and more. For a comprehensive overview of all the new features and improvements, we encourage you to read the release&nbsp;notes.</p><p>Please note that by block 4281680, the new Exchange Addresses will activate on chain, which should be around Feb 29th at 12:00 PM UTC. We will be sending our upgrade spork around ~48 hours before that, so please be sure to update before that to avoid any potential forking. All MNs will need to be “restarted” (the controller wallet will need to issue a new start message) during this&nbsp;upgrade.</p><p>This update is a testament to our commitment to continually enhancing the PIVX platform for all users, exchanges, and service providers</p><p>.<br>Many thanks to Liquid369, PIVX Core Dev for writing this announcement.</p><p>PIVXDevsRock! <br>PIVX&nbsp;Core</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/pivx-is-thrilled-to-announce-the-launch-of-pivxs-core-wallet-v5-6-1-894e66a92bf3">PIVX is thrilled to announce the launch of PIVX’s Core Wallet v5.6.1!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Today we're announcing the highly requested and long-awaited rollout of self-custody BAT payouts for Brave Rewards.

<p>Today we’re announcing the highly requested and long-awaited rollout of self-custody BAT payouts for Brave Rewards. An initial group of invitees—and soon Brave users around the world—will be able to receive BAT earned from Brave Rewards to a self-custody wallet address on the Solana blockchain.</p>

 Invite only to start 
<p>Rewards on Solana is launching as an invite-only feature, starting with a limited group of early participants. Brave will send out invitations via a notification in the Brave Rewards panel. This invitation will unlock the ability for users to connect a self-custody Solana address and start receiving BAT on-chain. To find out if you’re eligible, keep an eye on Brave Rewards in your Brave browser.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    
Invitees will receive a notification in the Rewards panel and new tab page</p>
<p>To connect a Solana address to Brave Rewards, you’ll use a Solana wallet to verify that you own the address. You can do this with Brave’s very own integrated wallet, <a>Brave Wallet</a>, or with a third-party browser extension like Phantom.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    
Solana address connected to Brave Rewards</p>
<p>Once connected, monthly BAT rewards will be deposited directly on-chain to your Solana address in Wormhole-bridged <a href="https://solscan.io/token/EPeUFDgHRxs9xxEPVaL6kfGQvCon7jmAWKVUHuux1Tpz">SPL-BAT</a>. That means you’ll be able to receive earned BAT without a custodial account (though the option to receive BAT rewards via a custodian will remain available).</p>

 Only possible on Solana 
<p>We chose Solana as the ideal network for the launch of on-chain Brave Rewards given its high transaction speed and low fees, which help reduce the costs associated with distributing BAT earnings to hundreds of thousands of users. For example, a single transaction on Solana costs on average $0.002 USD, while a single transaction on Ethereum, or on its most popular layer-2 scaling solution, Arbitrum, costs on average <a href="https://l2fees.info/">$1.00 and $0.10 respectively</a>.</p>
<p>This new way of distributing BAT removes many of the barriers everyday people face when onboarding to Web3. There are no withdrawal fees or limits, since the Solana wallet is entirely owned and managed by the user. Users can earn and receive BAT directly on-chain, and use it on-chain however they like. For example, here are some great ways BAT can be used on Solana:</p>
 
 Contribute directly to your favorite <a>Brave creators with on-chain contributions</a> (details below) 
 Exchange between hundreds of tokens through the swap feature in <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/13397025065357-What-are-Brave-Swaps-">Brave Wallet</a> 
 Buy a .SOL domain from <a href="https://www.bonfida.org/">Bonfida</a> 
 Earn trading fees by depositing SPL-BAT to <a href="https://www.orca.so/">Orca</a> liquidity pools 
 Mint and buy <a>NFTs</a> with SPL-BAT 
 

 Support your favorite creators on-chain 
<p>We also <a>recently announced a new on-chain contributions feature</a> as a more Web3-native way for users to support their favorite creators, including with the SPL-BAT they earn. Supporting self custody for users and creators is an important step toward a more decentralized Brave Rewards and Brave Creators experience. Together, they further our mission of providing users with greater control over how they browse, search, and transact on the Web.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on our blog, social accounts, and <a href="https://community.brave.com/">Brave Community</a> forums for the latest news from Brave, and announcements about new rounds of Solana on-chain invites.</p>

<p>Last September, we <a>released a roadmap</a> of innovations for <a>Leo</a>, Brave’s privacy-preserving AI assistant built right into the browser.</p>
<p>Today, we’re excited to announce we’ve completed another piece of the roadmap: Leo can now interact with PDFs and Google Drive files. By seamlessly integrating with these popular productivity apps and document types, Leo enables users to save time and accomplish more at school and work, while preserving user privacy.</p>

 How we built document support 
<p>Brave’s built-in AI assistant Leo has recently gained new capabilities for understanding how to help users while using web-based tools and workflows. Specifically:</p>
 
 
<p>By using the accessibility tree in a PDF’s metadata, Leo can understand the underlying semantic structure of PDF documents.</p>
 
 
<p>By leveraging a technique called Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on canvas-rendered apps, Leo can use an image of a page to extract text in Google Docs and Google Sheets.</p>
 
 
<p>In both cases, Leo can offer insights and suggestions for users working with many different productivity applications, whether at school or at work.</p>

 Use cases for Leo’s document integrations 
<p>With this novel use of the accessibility tree, OCR, and other techniques, Leo can help with several important use cases. These include:</p>
 
 
<p>PDFs: Leo can extract topics and data deep within PDF documents. This can help with understanding research papers, preparing analysis from reports, finding details in a technical specification document, and more.</p>
 
 
<p>Google Docs: When you’re editing a Google Doc, Leo can propose relevant terms or writing styles, or even review the document as a whole.</p>
 
 
<p>Google Sheets: Leo can analyze tables and data in a Google Sheet, and even suggest formulas.</p>
 
 
<p>Slack workspaces: Leo can highlight key discussion points from a thread in a Slack workspace, extracting the thread’s essential points while saving you the time of reading the entire thread history.</p>
 
 
<p>YouTube: Leo can produce video transcripts from classes, industry events, and influencer videos. These transcripts can then be summarized for useful details mentioned in the video, and allow the user to ask Leo follow-up questions about the video or the transcript.</p>
 
 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    

 Brave Leo and unparalleled privacy 
<p>As a privacy-first company, Brave is dedicated to releasing leading alternatives to popular Web tools that also protect user data and anonymity. Leo—and its document integrations—is no different. This is particularly relevant as work and school documents may contain sensitive information:</p>
 
 
<p>Reverse proxy: All requests are proxied through an anonymization server so the request and user-address cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address.</p>
 
 
<p>Discarding of responses: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded after they’re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers such as your IP Address that can be linked to you. No personal data is retained by the AI model or any 3rd-party model providers.</p>
 
 
<p>No login or account required for access: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Unlinkable subscription: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you used to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience.</p>
 
 
<p>Just as Leo utilizes these techniques to preserve your privacy as you chat, it offers the same protections when Leo is helping you analyze documents and other files.&nbsp;</p>

 How to use Leo for PDFs and Google Drive files 
<p>Leo’s support for PDFs, Google Docs, and Google Sheets is available now for all Brave desktop users on version 1.63 or higher.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To try it out, simply open a PDF, Google Doc, or Google Sheet in a tab in the Brave browser. Then click the  in the sidebar, and start asking Leo questions about the file.</p>
<p>Don’t have Leo in the sidebar yet? Just click Settings, then click Leo, and toggle on the Show Leo icon in the sidebar option.</p>

 What’s next for Leo and document / file support? 
<p>Leo will soon support other documents and file types. For example, Leo will integrate with GitHub, allowing code reviewers to summarize the purpose and impact of pull requests by analyzing code changes without line-by-line inspection. Keep an eye out for announcements about GitHub support, and for even more document and file integrations.</p>
<p>From the beginning, we saw Leo as far more than an AI chatbot (though it can handle real-time, contextual chats with ease). Rather, we saw Leo as a true smart assistant that could help you engage with the applications you use every day, to help you learn, work, and plan more efficiently. By surfacing insights from within PDFs, suggesting text for Google Docs, writing formulas for Google Sheets, summarizing YouTube videos, analyzing code in GitHub (and more), Leo saves you time and makes you more efficient and productive.</p>

This is because despite vesting progression &amp; completion for various categories (private raise, grants, dev fund, etc.) many entities have chosen to not claim their earned SHD — thus not directly impacting circulating supply (yet). Another key disclaimer is that of the 1.8M SHD dev fund, none of the dev fund SHD is staked / nor active in any capacity so as to not impact staking yield or governance proposals.</p> Protocol Liquidity Matching <p>Another distribution component to note is Protocol Liquidity Match (PLM) — a novel mechanism whereby Shade Protocol loans out tokens in collaboration with other protocols to bootstrap liquidity. This model is favorable as it does not involve an OTC and does not involve any emissions. However, this deal structure was invented prior to full blown decentralized governance; the core contributors are not comfortable categorizing PLM as “LP” without a community vote. As of right now PLM is handled and accounted for from the dev fund until a formal ratification of categorization via the community pool. The following are the 11 protocols that have been partnered with on liquidity deals (accounting for 40%+ worth of ShadeSwap’s volume) for both PLM &amp; OTC liquidity deals:</p>  Kujira  Manta  Andromeda  FINA  Persistence  Levana  Archway  Composable  White Whale  Sienna  Stride   Onwards To Governance <a href="https://forum.scrt.network/t/dao-dao-x-secret-network-proposal/7119">https://forum.scrt.network/t/dao-dao-x-secret-network-proposal/7119</a><p>With the passing of <a href="https://www.mintscan.io/secret/proposals/280">prop 280</a> Shade Protocol has helped spearhead and coordinate the cross deployment of DAO DAO which will be usable as open source code by various protocols on Secret Network.

							<p>On January 3, 2024, Trail of Bits reached out to us to raise <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2024/02/20/breaking-the-shared-key-in-threshold-signature-schemes/">a denial-of-service vulnerability</a> that affects different implementations of distributed key generation (DKG) protocols. Our FROST implementation was among those impacted.</p><p>This denial-of-service vulnerability introduced the possibility of an attack being carried out as follows:&nbsp;During the DKG run, a malicious participant can generate a random polynomial with a larger number of coefficients than required. In practice, this makes the key shares generated by the protocol have a threshold that is higher than intended. For example, when generating key shares with a threshold of 2, an attacker could silently increase that value to e.g. 3. Thus, two participants would never be able to successfully generate signatures since three or more would be required. Additionally, if the attacker increases the threshold to a number higher than the number of shares, then it would be totally impossible to generate valid signatures. In the Zcash context, this could mean that deposits made into a freshly-generated FROST wallet could become unspendable, leading to loss of funds.</p><p>We do agree that this is a confirmed and important vulnerability, which has been successfully remediated by adding <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost/commit/e1fb9bc953a5ea5c22304c0018f56f407163f101">a simple check</a> to make sure the polynomials generated have the correct number of coefficients. This fix is included in the recently published 1.0.0 stable release of our FROST implementation. We are not aware of any production-ready FROST Zcash deployments using our software, so no user funds should be at risk.</p><p>We thank Trail of Bits for identifying the issue, providing a test case showing our crate was vulnerable and coordinating its disclosure.</p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation is excited to announce the first stable release of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/frost-core">frost-core</a>, a reference implementation of Two-Round Threshold Schnorr Signatures with FROST, written in Rust. This implementation has been <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2023/10/23/public-report-zcash-frost-security-assessment/">fully audited</a> and conforms to the latest and final version of the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost/">IRTF draft specification</a>, which we are confident will soon make it as a final Informational RFC.&nbsp;</p>



 



 What FROST does and why it matters 



<p>FROST is a threshold multi-party signature scheme. It allows a key to be split into multiple shares (or even to be created in a distributed fashion without having to create an original unsplit key), and then enables creating a signature by aggregating multiple signature shares created by participants who hold key shares. The threshold means that a minimum number of participants are required to be able to create a signature.</p>



<p>In the context of Zcash, this means that FROST allows creating wallets where transactions have to be authorized by multiple participants. This has multiple benefits: it’s more robust, since if a participant loses a share, it is still possible for the other participants to sign transactions (and they can help to reissue the lost share); and in the same vein, if a participant gets hacked, the attacker won’t be able to solely sign transactions.</p>



<p>With the <a href="http://www.github.com/zcashfoundation/frost">frost</a> Rust library, the Zcash Foundation provides a reference implementation for the informational “Two-Round Schnorr Threshold Signatures with FROST” CFRG (Crypto Forum Research Group) Internet Draft. The CFRG is a general forum for discussing and reviewing uses of cryptographic mechanisms and is part of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), which in turn promotes research of importance to the evolution of the Internet protocols, applications, architecture and technology.</p>



<p>This release includes the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost/tree/main/frost-rerandomized">frost-rerandomized</a> variant, an adaptation to the FROST threshold signature scheme to make it unlinkable, which is a requirement for its use in the Zcash protocol. The adapted scheme generates signatures that are compatible with spend authorization signatures in the Zcash protocol, for the Sapling and Orchard network upgrades. This makes it possible for Zcash transactions to be authorized by more than one party, while preserving the privacy of individual signers.</p>



 



 Privacy-preserving threshold multi-party signatures for Zcash 



<p>Now that the frost reference implementation is production-ready we look forward to the acceptance of <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zips/pull/662">ZIP-312: “Shielded Multisignatures using FROST”</a> and its implementation in the Zcash ecosystem. We will continue to work on a set of demos to show how some of the challenges for integration into wallets may be solved, as well as to provide a reference for implementers.</p>



<p>We would like to thank the following current and past ZF team members for their contributions to the FROST reference implementation; without their work and support, we would not have reached this milestone today:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chelsea Komlo, Conrado P. L. Gouvêa,&nbsp; Natalie E., Deirdre Connolly, Pili Guerra, Alfredo Garcia, Teor, Marek Bielik, Henry de Valence, Jane Lusby, Josh Cincinnati, Antonie Hodge, Fungai Matambanadzo.</p>



<p>We would also like to thank all of the numerous external contributors to the spec and code base.</p>

<p>As the global need for environmentally conscious energy intensifies, tokenisation emerges as a groundbreaking strategy to democratise energy ownership. Amidst the growing consensus on the need for a shift to renewable resources, the challenge of accessibility and affordability persists. By leveraging blockchain technology to fractionalise ownership of renewable energy assets, tokenisation offers an inclusive pathway for individuals and communities to invest in and benefit from sustainable energy sources. This innovative approach not only aims to lower the barriers to entry in the renewable energy market but also foster a more distributed and participatory energy landscape.</p>



<p></p>



 Democratising energy: The role of tokenisation in ownership 



<p>The shift towards sustainable energy is a global priority, underscored by initiatives like the Paris Agreement, especially within Europe. This movement faces the challenge of perceived high costs and barriers to entry in the renewable energy sector. However, recent commercialisation of energy storage technologies shows significant <a href="https://www.irena.org/Energy-Transition/Technology/Energy-storage-costs">cost reductions</a> in wind, solar power, and grid stability over the past few years. This cost reduction has widened access to renewable energy, allowing a broader spectrum of individuals to benefit from these technologies.</p>



<p></p>



 How tokenisation democratises energy ownership&nbsp; 



<p>Tokenisation plays a pivotal role in further democratising energy ownership. For individuals without direct access to physical assets, such as a roof for solar panels, tokenisation offers a novel solution. Through crypto anchors and property rights encapsulated within tokens, individuals can own a share of an energy asset. This approach not only allows for the ownership of the physical asset but also enables individuals to own carbon credits, kilowatt hours, and even data rights associated with the energy asset.</p>



<p>One such initiative is <a href="https://www.sunified.com/">Sunified</a> –&nbsp; a solar technology company creating critical infrastructure to facilitate yield farming on solar infrastructure. Yield farming is the process of staking or lending cryptocurrency assets within a DeFi protocol’s liquidity pool to receive rewards, often in the form of the protocol’s governance tokens. Liquidity providers are then compensated with an annual percentage yield (APY) in real-time for their contributions as a result. The purpose behind yield farming is to promote the platform’s utilisation and compensate the community for adding liquidity, crucial for the ecosystem’s vitality and growth. Sunified’s initiative also includes storage infrastructure integration into electric vehicles (EVs) and other parts of the energy ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As energy grids undergo a gradual transformation over the next decade, tokenisation offers immense opportunities to introduce new business and ownership models through blockchain and sound crypto infrastructure architectures. This transition presents a unique chance to reconstruct the energy ecosystem, making sustainable energy ownership more accessible and flexible for a wider audience.</p>



<p></p>



 Fractional ownership of solar power&nbsp; 



<p>Fractional ownership in the context of solar power introduces an innovative approach to investing in renewable energy. This concept allows individuals to collectively invest in solar projects, such as solar parks or community solar gardens, through a blend of equity and debt financing. The essence of fractional ownership lies in the tokenisation of solar infrastructure, breaking down the investment into manageable units—whether in the form of €100 blocks or based on the capacity, such as 100 Watt blocks of a solar panel.</p>



<p>A group of experts would initially determine how to capitalise on a solar project, deciding on the mix of equity and debt to make the project investment-ready. This capital structure can then be tokenised, offering participation rights to investors. Tokenisation carves up the asset into fractional pieces, making it possible for a wider audience to invest in solar energy projects.</p>



<p>It is crucial to differentiate between owning a part of the solar park itself and having rights to the energy produced by it. While you might not fractionalise the energy output directly, fractionalising the means of production — i.e., the solar panels and infrastructure — offers a tangible way to invest in solar energy. Fractional ownership and tokenisation democratises access to renewable energy investments, enabling more people to contribute to and benefit from sustainable energy solutions.</p>



<p></p>



 How should a real-world asset, such as energy, be put on the blockchain?&nbsp; 



<p>Placing a real-world asset like energy onto a blockchain involves a multifaceted approach that bridges the physical and digital worlds. With a particular focus on renewable energy sources like solar power, the process starts by establishing a tangible connection or “hook” between the physical asset and its digital representation on the blockchain. This involves integrating a sensor directly into the asset during the manufacturing process, such as embedding it within a solar panel at the Original Equipment Manufacturer’s (OEM) factory. This sensor plays a crucial role in anchoring the asset across three realms: the physical world, the digital world, and the crypto realm.</p>



<p>The sensor enables tracking of the solar panel’s lifecycle from its inception, including its initial performance and the carbon footprint incurred throughout its supply chain journey. By activating the panel in the field, it is possible to account for its entire lifecycle, including production, deployment, and operational carbon emissions. This comprehensive approach ensures that the asset is not only represented accurately on the blockchain but also that its environmental impact is meticulously accounted for.</p>



<p>This method transcends traditional reliance on third-party verification or trust anchors, reducing the need for intermediaries. Instead, it offers a direct and trustworthy linkage between the real-world asset and its blockchain counterpart. This direct connection is essential for leveraging blockchain’s capabilities to support decentralised and distributed energy systems, which are increasingly becoming bidirectional.&nbsp; Unlike the traditional centralised energy distribution model, where power flows from a central hub to consumers, modern energy grids are evolving to support energy flow in both directions. This shift necessitates new measurement infrastructure to accommodate and accurately represent these changes on the blockchain.</p>



<p></p>



 Navigating challenges in energy tokenisation 



<p>The journey of tokenising energy assets is fraught with multifaceted challenges, significantly influenced by regulatory uncertainties, security concerns, data privacy issues, market volatility, and a general lack of understanding and readiness within the industry. A pivotal aspect of navigating these waters involves identifying the nature of energy tokens for regulators—be it as utility, payment, or governance tokens—or even advocating for a multi-use token that transcends traditional categorisations.</p>



<p></p>



 Regulatory Hurdles 



<p>Discourse within the digital asset community highlights a need for regulatory frameworks around energy tokens that must be clearly defined. This confusion necessitates a rigorous educational effort towards regulators, to clarify the distinctions and functionalities of various token types, including utility, energy, asset, and governance tokens. Without clear regulatory guidance, projects are compelled to seek jurisdictions with more favourable legal frameworks. The UK is a regulatory example of a more defined ecosystem for property rights, energy governance, and tokenisation of real-world assets. The only other option would be to work within regulatory sandboxes and project-specific frameworks to advance tokenisation initiatives without overstepping uncertain legal boundaries.</p>



<p>Moreover, the push towards standardising practices across different regulatory environments presents another layer of complexity. The UK has made significant strides in establishing clear guidelines through bodies like The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Other jurisdictions are still in the budding stages of adapting their regulations to accommodate the novel demands of tokenised energy systems. In addition to regulatory hurdles, the practicalities of offering energy tokens without categorising them as equity to facilitate easier trading, and the fundraising challenges for scaling projects across multiple locations, are critical.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 Communication 



<p>The ability to articulate the concept and clear implications of tokenising energy resources, such as solar panels, is crucial for market acceptance and regulatory compliance. This task extends beyond mere product explanation; it encompasses clear dialogue with lawmakers, consumer protection bodies, and entities concerned with data privacy. Simplifying complex technological underpinnings for a diverse audience, from regulators to the layperson at the bus stop, is essential. Failure to do so risks future operational nightmares, underscoring the importance of both education and transparency in the tokenisation ecosystem. Simplification without sacrificing essential information ensures that investors, users, and stakeholders, who will journey with the initiative for years to come, fully comprehend its value and operation, making the technology’s intricate background less daunting and more accessible.</p>



<p></p>



 Where to begin: energy tokenisation 



<p>Embarking on the journey of energy tokenisation requires a foundational understanding of the token’s purpose, its intended holders, and the value it offers. Before diving into the legal and technical specifics of token types, it is essential to address these fundamental questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This approach does not necessitate a one-size-fits-all solution. For instance, investors interested in direct engagement with energy projects can opt for utility tokens, whereas those looking for a more traditional investment route might consider security tokens tied to assets like solar parks. This flexibility allows projects to cater to diverse investor preferences, enhancing accessibility and interaction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Highlighting the significance of inclusivity and accountability in energy trading, an initiative such as the <a href="https://www.amelandenergie.nl/">Amelander Energy Cooperative</a> demonstrates the potential for democratising energy markets. Such a project demonstrates the possibility for transparent, traceable systems that ensure accountability across all levels of interaction—from investors to consumers, and from producers to the overarching financial ecosystem. Achieving this level of integration and transparency is a meticulous process to harmonise understanding and communication across various stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Tokenisation within the energy sector signifies a significant stride toward democratising access to renewable resources and fostering sustainable practices. By bridging the gap between the physical and digital realms, tokenisation introduces a new paradigm where renewable energy assets, like solar power, become attainable and manageable for a wider audience. This process not only democratises access to sustainable energy solutions but also addresses the pressing need for energy independence, resilience, and environmental preservation. As we navigate the complexities of regulatory landscapes and technological challenges, the ultimate goal remains clear: to create an energy ecosystem that is inclusive, transparent, and aligned with the principles of environmental sustainability. Through collaborative efforts, innovative approaches, and community engagement, tokenisation has the potential to reshape our energy future, making sustainable living a reality for all.</p>

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>Another week has flown by in the dynamic world of Panther – now it’s time to share our latest updates and progress with the Panther community! This week’s rundown highlights a series of key developments and testing from the past week.</p> Ecosystem updates  AMA with Panther’s Head of Product, Saif Akhtar <p>On February 8, we hosted an AMA session featuring Panther Protocol’s Head of Product, Saif Akhtar, and Head of Community, Joris Koopman.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ-NfX_4ldY&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Watch the recording</a> for full insights into our latest testnet updates, testing processes, reward systems, and upcoming testnet releases.</p> Panther testnet video guide for account creation <p>You asked – we delivered! Panther has received numerous requests to provide support materials dedicated to the account creation process. For a step-by-step video guide detailing how to make your very own testnet Panther account, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw3LhZKvM_U&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">check out our tutorial video</a>. Once you have your account set up, the video will also show you how to get started earning $ZKP rewards. All you need is a MetaMask wallet and 10 minutes!&nbsp;</p> Panther Protocol testnet and rewards update   Current testnet users: 800+  Total rewards distributed: 500,000+ $ZKP  <p>Our testnet rewards pot is 1.5M $ZKP — have you signed up for our testnet yet to earn your share? Grab the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">latest link</a> from Panther’s docs to join our testnet and receive your $ZKP rewards.</p> Product updates  Stage 5 developments <p>Stage 5 includes using a 3rd party Bundler service and supports gasless transactions via an Account Abstraction Paymaster contract.</p><p>Users will be able to submit transactions via Bundlers and pay gas fees in $ZKP instead of $Matic (on Mumbai testnet but similarly on Polygon) from the Panther Gas account that holds $zZKP.&nbsp;</p><p>Integration testing is underway, with two end-to-end Bundler providers operating successfully. Changes on the dApp side are expected to reach completion as we utilize resources from other stages of development taking place in parallel.</p> Enhancement Stage - 1 developments <p>As we continue to strive for parallel development efforts, a 2-week technical enhancement stage was slated to implement various fixes from previous stages along with a feature for Gas Management. This key feature allows users to move their $zZKP inside MASP from the regular balance to the Panther Account Gas balance and vice versa. Gas Management plays a significant role enabling users to top up their Gas balance and make sure they have sufficient $zZKP to pay for various transaction costs.</p> Stage 6 developments <p>Stage 6 of testnet is a complex stage and includes overall fee management, basic disclosures, and zAccount renewal. Stage 6 allows users to test:</p>  Fee deductions from the Panther Gas account and payment to 3rd parties such as Compliance providers and Bundler service providers.  Protocol fee deductions in a transacted token currently set to be charged on Withdraw.  Basic disclosures that allow Panther users to provide adequate transaction reporting to outside parties issuing requests that can be satisfied by independent on-chain verification.  &nbsp;A zAccount renewal function (after the expiry date). This feature functions in a similar manner to KYC renewals.  <p>Additional smart contract and testing changes are in progress, and will require one more week to complete. Following the completion of these changes, development on the dApp will begin.&nbsp;</p> About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. The Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in shielded pools; zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs; and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s Zero-Knowledge primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

  The latest version of Brave is now even faster on ARM64 Windows. This post covers how you can install it, as well as some technical information about the implementation.

<p>Brave now offers a fully native version for ARM64 Windows. When you newly install Brave on your ARM64 device, then you get an even faster browser. Read on to learn more, or skip to the end to find out how to get the new version.</p>

 What is ARM64, and why is it important? 
<p>ARM64 is a newer type of CPU, developed for speed and efficiency. Every computer has a processor (or “CPU”) that acts a little like a brain. Processors can be made in different architectures that essentially govern at a low level how the CPU works. Typical architectures are the 32-bit x86 architecture and the more recent 64-bit x64 architecture.</p>
<p>You can only run programs on your computer that are compatible with your CPU architecture. For example, you cannot run a program made for x64 on an x86 processor.</p>
<p>Software companies get around this by offering multiple versions of their programs. So you can, for example, download an x86 version of Brave if you are on an x86 CPU, and an x64 version if your computer’s processor has the x64 architecture.</p>
<p>Nowadays, most Windows computers have an x64 CPU. But recently, another architecture has entered the mainstream through products such as Microsoft’s Surface laptops. This architecture is called ARM64 and it offers better power efficiency and performance.</p>

 ARM64 and Brave 
<p>Newer CPU architectures are usually able to run programs with an older architecture. For example, an x64 CPU can run an x86 program. Likewise, ARM64 CPUs can run x64 and x86 programs. But there is a significant performance overhead. In the example of Brave, you could run x64 Brave on an ARM64 computer. But it would be slower than it should be. We therefore spent considerable effort last year to offer an ARM64 version of Brave for Windows.</p>
<p>So what’s necessary to get an ARM64 version of Brave? To create Brave, we write code in programming languages such as C++. The programming language is readable as text by us humans. But CPUs operate in their own machine language. In order for the CPU to be able to run our code, it needs to be translated to machine code with a program called a compiler. We can tell the compiler the architecture of the CPU we want to target. So, mostly, we could take our existing C++ code and tell the compiler to produce machine code for the ARM64 architecture.</p>

 On-demand updates and universal installers 
<p>Given how complex Brave is, there were of course also parts where this process didn’t work quite so seamlessly. The first problem we encountered was the following: When you type <code>brave://settings/help</code> into Brave’s address bar, you get a page that shows Brave’s version. Crucially, this page also checks for a new version of Brave with a little spinning animation. This feature showed an error in x64 Brave on ARM64 Windows. After extensive research, we realized that this is caused by a fundamental limitation in the Windows operating system itself.</p>
<p>To work around the problem, we introduced a universal installer which ensures that our users do not accidentally install x64 Brave on ARM64 Windows. Instead, they always receive a copy of Brave with the correct architecture for their system. What does this look like? When you go to brave.com and download its installer, then you get a 1 MB .exe file. When you run it, it downloads the latest version of Brave for your CPU architecture from our servers. This ensures that you don’t get the error described above.</p>

 DRM protected content and Widevine 
<p>The second main technical hurdle was caused by an optional and downloadable component of the browser called Widevine. Web sites such as Netflix use this component to protect their content. If you do not have the Widevine component installed, then Netflix (and similar sites) may only serve you low-quality videos, if anything at all.</p>
<p>Widevine is proprietary technology and its licensing terms do not allow us to redistribute it. This means that we can’t just create an ARM64 version of Widevine and include it in Brave. But an ARM64 version of the component can be downloaded from public Google servers. So we do the following: The first time you visit a web site that requires Widevine, we ask you if you agree to downloading and installing the component:</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>If you agree, then Brave downloads and installs Widevine from Google’s public servers. While Brave already worked this way for other architectures, it required a lot of extra work for ARM64. If you are interested in the technical details, you can take a look at <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/18695">pull-request #18695</a> on the brave/brave-core repo.</p>

 This sounds great. How do I get ARM64 Brave? 
<p>You need Windows 11 and an ARM64 CPU. To check if your CPU is ARM64, follow the instructions in the <a href="https://pureinfotech.com/check-if-processor-arm64-x64-64bit-windows-11/">How to check if processor is ARM64 or x64 (64-bit) on Windows 11</a> article on pureinfotech.com. If you have an ARM64 CPU, but installed Brave before December of last year, then you need to first uninstall this old copy of Brave to get the newer ARM64 build. When the uninstaller prompts you for confirmation, be sure not to select the check box that says “Also delete your browsing data?”. Once you’ve uninstalled the x64 build of Brave from your ARM64 CPU, go to brave.com, click on the Download button and follow the instructions. When you then type <code>brave://version</code> in Brave’s address bar, you should see “arm64” mentioned on the page.</p>

 Summary 
<p>More and more new Windows computers have ARM64 CPUs. In order for Brave to be as fast as possible, it needs to be optimized for this architecture. We completed this technical work last year. There were some technical challenges on the way, but we were able to overcome them. You can now install ARM64 Brave on Windows 11 by visiting <a>brave.com</a>!</p>

        <p>Horizen Labs has submitted a ZenIP Discussion topic on Discourse, <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42400-modernizing-horizen-technology-via-a-modular-proof-verification-layer/394">ZenIP: 42400 – Modernizing Horizen Technology via a Modular Proof Verification Layer</a>.</p>
<p>Note that ZenIP 42400 focuses on the modular proof verification layer. If this proposal passes, Horizen Labs will roll out subsequent phases to the Horizen community for discussion and debate as the “New Horizen” initiative progresses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ZenIP 42400 is focused solely on the establishment of a Modular Proof Verification Layer, i.e., a blockchain dedicated to verifying proofs with the ability to support any settlement layer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we dive into what this means for the Horizen Ecosystem, let’s review a few points that have been raised by the Community regarding this proposal:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Name of the Initiative: The term “New Horizen” is currently a placeholder for the system and its individual component blockchains. The designation is being used to conceptually describe the initiative until an official name is determined. 
 EON Integration: A key aspect of the development strategy is the integration of EON into the new Proof Verification Chain. The Horizen Labs teams are actively involved in exploring viable pathways for this migration, ensuring that EON remains an integral part of the Horizen ecosystem after the implementation of the blockchains that comprise the “New Horizen” initiative. 
 $ZEN Tokenomics: Currently, there are no plans to modify $ZEN’s tokenomics, and any such change would be subject to community discussion and DAO approval.&nbsp; 
 Market and User Research: The Horizen Labs team used comprehensive market and user research, aiming to design a user-friendly system capable of widespread adoption.&nbsp; 
 
 Why should the community be excited about this “New Horizen” proposal? 
<p>The “New Horizen” initiative will modernize the Horizen tech stack to better align with the broader web3 industry while building on the legacy of the Horizen Mainchain and Zendoo. This will “future-proof” the Horizen network and unlock market value to the Horizen ecosystem. New Horizen is based on current web3 market needs and addresses a problem that affects most modular web3 protocols: volatile and expensive proof verification costs for L2s (ZK-Rollups in particular).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Horizen Labs’ proposed “Proof Verification Chain” aims to substantially reduce rising security costs for L2s.</p>
<p>A dedicated Proof Verification Chain would not only make running a ZK-Rollup more economical, but also align with the anticipated shift towards these technologies becoming the dominant scaling solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, collaboration in the Web3 space is becoming increasingly important, New Horizen aims to foster this collaboration across ecosystems and expand the reach of the Horizen ecosystem. The Horizen Labs team is working to ensure that the Proof Verification Chain described above is being designed to accommodate a variety of proof types and settlement layers. By developing a solution that is versatile enough to be compatible with multiple development frameworks, proving systems, and settlement layers, this positions Horizen as a hub of collaborative innovation. Potentially reaching new audiences beyond our current community, embracing and leading the change towards a more interconnected and cooperative blockchain environment.&nbsp;</p>
 How Will this Work? 
<p>The “New Horizen” initiative is set to deliver multiple components that address the market’s current and future needs across several phases. The Proof Verification Chain (Phase 1) will focus on verifying proofs originating from other blockchains, such as rollups / appchains or applications. Initially, the focus will be on ZK-SNARK proofs, in particular zk-snarks produced by ZK-Rollups, but the plan is to expand its capabilities to accommodate a wide range of proof types in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proof verification layer aims to improve the existing process of proving state validity for ZK-Rollups and other proof-generating applications, offering a more efficient, scalable solution to handle these operations, which will reduce the costs of blockchain networks.</p>

 Scalability, Decentralization &amp; Security — What Trilemma?  The blockchain trilemma is a classic idea that truly decentralized blockchains need to choose between security or scalability. Verus offers a different perspective and a new approach. Together we will come to the conclusion that the Verus Protocol solves scalability by neither sacrificing decentralization or security, effectively solving the trilemma.  A Closer Look at the&nbsp;Trilemma <p>Before we dive in, let’s examine the current perceived definition of the crypto trilemma: “You can’t have a scalable blockchain that is truly decentralized and thus secure” — it is said to achieve worldwide scalability a blockchain needs to be fast so it can process all the transactions for a large population (btw, this is a false premise, you can read about that later.) And to get a fast, high tps (transactions per second) blockchain it must compromise on decentralization and thus security.</p><p>Decentralization and security go hand-in-hand. A truly decentralized protocol (open to all, many validators) is secure because it is difficult to 51% attack such a protocol. If a blockchain is less decentralized (low number of validators, permissioned access) it could be 51% attacked (by external attackers or colluding validators), and transactions can be altered or reversed, completely undermining one of the goals of blockchain — censorship-resistance.</p><blockquote>The trilemma is currently looked at from a single-chain standpoint. A false premise that does not scale to the&nbsp;world.</blockquote><p>There is truth to the fact that it is very difficult to have a decentralized single blockchain that also has a high tps. The larger the number of validators the harder it is to find consensus among them all, which makes them slower, and makes it more difficult to get them to process large numbers of transactions. To get a high tps blockchain you would need to lower the number of validators so they can find consensus more easily, and raise the hardware requirements for running a node so they can process those transactions quicker too. Yet doing so compromises true decentralization. The lower the number of validators, the less decentralized, the less robust. And the higher the hardware requirements, the less accessible it is for people around the world, the less decentralized.</p><p>The trilemma is currently looked at from a single-chain standpoint. A false premise that does not scale to the world. We will show you how Verus offers a new and better approach.</p> Scalability Does NOT Mean High&nbsp;Tps <blockquote>Transactions per second are nothing more than just a performance indicator — like GHz for computers.</blockquote><p>Cryptocurrency protocols often boast about how fast their blockchains are (transactions per second) as an indicator of their scalability. Contrary to popular belief this is a false premise. Transactions per second are nothing more than just a performance indicator. Like how we use GHz (CPU clock speed) to indicate how fast a computer is, or an even better example — how fast servers&nbsp;are.</p><p>To bring the promise of crypto to billions of people around the globe let’s make a comparison with the Internet. The Internet does not run on one single server. All websites and applications that we use daily are not connected to one single server. The Internet has not been scaled to the world by constantly upgrading the one server to a faster one. It’s millions of servers that are servicing billions of people around the world. These millions of servers are perfectly connected, and completely interoperable so that using the Internet today is a seamless experience.</p><p>Now, with this perspective in mind, let’s get back to the current situation in crypto land. Most, if not all, crypto protocols are trying to service the world with their one single, monolithic blockchain. The monolithic blockchain becomes a central hub where all smart contracts and applications revolve around. When they notice that it doesn’t scale (the transaction fees start ramping up) the industry comes up with solutions that heavily compromise on decentralization and security (e.g. L2s, semi-centralized protocols, master nodes). This is not the&nbsp;answer.</p><p>Instead of acknowledging that the Internet today is a giant, interconnected multi-server world where all applications and websites are seamlessly connected, most of the crypto industry thinks we live in a single server (single blockchain) world.</p><p>Verus acknowledged that to realize the promise of cryptocurrency and blockchain, it needed to scale for billions of people around the globe and thus it needed to embrace a multi-server, multi-chain world. And that is exactly what the Verus Protocol does today. Without sacrificing decentralization and security.</p> Unlimited in&nbsp;Scale <p>Before we start explaining how Verus is truly decentralized and secure, let’s start with how Verus embraces the multi-chain world and delivers unlimited scalability.</p><p>Most, if not all, current blockchain protocols argue that to have low transaction fees they must achieve higher transactions per second. They try to scale up — increasing the performance of their monolithic blockchains. This only gets them so far. At some point, they will bottleneck again, and in the process, they compromise on decentralization and security.</p><p>Verus offers a new approach, one in which each organization or business can launch its own highly capable, rent-free, no-coding-required blockchain. It’s called Verus PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service). These PBaaS-chains are fully independent, can be customized to the organization’s need, inherit all the same features as the Verus blockchain, and most importantly are fully interconnected and interoperable with the complete network and other bridged protocols (e.g. Ethereum). A single PBaaS-chain can do between 75 and 800 tps depending on the options&nbsp;chosen.</p><p>There is no upper limit to deploying PBaaS-chains. Just like there is no upper limit to servers being deployed. When we reach a bandwidth limit we don’t go out upgrading our single server, we put another server next to it to spread out the usage. The same thing is here, reaching unlimited scalability.</p><p>Of course, this only works when those PBaaS-chains are fully interoperable and interconnected, which they are — in a provable, trustless and decentralized way. There is no centralized entity sitting in between the PBaaS-chains regulating everything.</p><p>Cross-chain transactions and conversions, cross-chain bridging of identities (VerusID), tokens and basket currencies, even Ethereum (&amp; ERC20/ERC721/ERC1155) — it’s all built into the consensus mechanism, trustlessly bridged over by the decentralized network of miners and stakers only. This is all on mainnet now, for everyone to&nbsp;use.</p><p>We can conclude that Verus is scalable to billions of people around the world with the unlimited deployment of PBaaS-chains. But does it compromise on decentralization and thus security? Let’s dive into&nbsp;it.</p> Built to be Decentralized <p>There are a few things at play here that work in harmony to achieve decentralization and security — Verus Proof of Power (the hybrid 50% proof-of-work, 50% proof-of-stake consensus mechanism), merge-mining and the Fee&nbsp;Pool.</p><blockquote>Verus had no ICO, had no premine and had and has no developer fee or&nbsp;tax.</blockquote><p>Before we jump into the above let’s acknowledge some facts that are pivotal to being a true decentralized protocol, to being credibly neutral. Just like Bitcoin before, Verus had no ICO, had no premine and had and has no developer fee or tax. Verus is not a company or a business. Verus is rent-free and all protocol fees go to the block producers. These facts are super important to incentivize decentralization and to be a credibly neutral protocol in the eyes of the&nbsp;world.</p> A Hybrid Consensus Mechanism <p>Now let’s unpack Verus Proof of Power, the consensus mechanism of the Verus blockchain, and all PBaaS-chains. It’s a hybrid of 50% proof-of-work and 50% proof-of-stake, and it’s <a href="https://verus.io/papers/VerusPoP.pdf">a provable solution to 51% hash attacks</a>. Out of the 1440 daily blocks (on Verus, and when a PBaaS-chain opts for 1-minute block times), half is solved by mining and half by&nbsp;staking.</p><p>VerusHash, the proof-of-work mechanism which disincentivizes ASIC &amp; FPGA development, and favors CPUs, mobile phones and ARM-devices for mining. Mining with mobile phones and for example, Orange Pi 5’s are the most cost-efficient way to do it. This proves a significant leap towards a more inclusive mining environment. It’s accessible to everyone and thus creates a naturally decentralized protocol.</p>An Orange Pi 5 mining farm by community member&nbsp;DCAL4.<p>Additionally, to give even more power to miners, they can merge-mine up to 22 PBaaS-chains simultaneously without sacrificing their original hashing power. This dramatically increases efficiency and network security. So, when considering an unlimited number of PBaaS-chains on the network, each miner can choose up to 22 to mine. They can choose for profitability, or choose the ones they want to&nbsp;support.</p><p>This approach to mining is environmentally conscious. The protocol’s design allows for low-power devices to mine extremely efficiently. It lowers the entry barrier for participation in blockchain validation, especially in low-income countries, yet can also give life to phones that are old or with broken screens. Thus significantly reducing the environmental impact associated with traditional PoW&nbsp;mining.</p><p>Then we have the proof-of-stake part of the consensus mechanism. This one is really simple and powerful. Anyone can run a node and start staking. There is no minimum amount of VRSC needed (pretty unique in the world of PoS). Verus <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/how-verus-solved-nothing-at-stake-and-weak-subjectivity-proof-of-stake-problems-b4dd6a85086e">solved the “nothing-at-stake”-problem</a> therefore there is no slashing of funds. Funds staking are never locked and running a node can be done with something as cheap as a Raspberry Pi 4. All-in-all proving yet again that Verus is accessible to everyone, creating a naturally decentralized protocol.</p><p>We can conclude that Verus is truly a decentralized protocol, naturally emerging from its extremely low-barrier mining and staking. So what does that mean for security?</p> Protocol Security at Another&nbsp;Level <p>Seeing as the Verus Protocol is naturally decentralized and provable 51% hash attack resistant, it’s extremely secure. PBaaS-chains take these properties with them as they have the same consensus mechanism, and the Verus miners can choose up to 21 of them to merge-mine. It’s fair to say that there is no compromise on security given the scalability of the protocol.</p> Verus Introduces the Fee&nbsp;Pool <p>Let’s first explain the fees the protocol generates for the miners and&nbsp;stakers:</p>  PBaaS-chain launches: 10,000 VRSC (5,000 for the block producers of Verus, 5,000 for the block producers of the newly launched&nbsp;chain)  Currency launches (tokens, basket currencies, liquidity pools, ERC-20 mapped currencies): 200&nbsp;VRSC  VerusID registrations: 100, 80, 60, 40 or 20&nbsp;VRSC  subID registrations: 0.02&nbsp;VRSC  DeFi conversion fees: min. 0.0125%, max.&nbsp;0.025%  Transaction fees: 0.0001&nbsp;VRSC  <p>Builders and users pay these protocol fees for their operations and the fees are directed into the Fee Pool. Then, for each new block, 1% of the Fee Pool is added on top of the regular coinbase reward (currently 6&nbsp;VRSC).</p><p>The Fee Pool is introduced as a security measure to keep the protocol stable. We have seen in other blockchain protocols that when a block has large fees, block producers try to “snipe” the block (putting lots of hash onto the network, then pulling it out of the network, or even trying to reorder the blocks for their own gain). In doing so they destabilize the protocol. Verus mitigates this behavior by spreading the extra fees over many&nbsp;blocks.</p> Smart Contracts Are Not&nbsp;Secure <p>Most blockchain protocols use the VM-based application model — smart contracts written with Solidity. It’s full of smart contract hacks and bugs and has insecure and phishing-prone wallet approval mechanisms. On top of that MEV (maximum extractable value) is rampant, due to the serial processing of transactions on the VM-model (it’s easy for a block producer to reorder transactions inside a block for their own gain). We can honestly say that the VM-model is not&nbsp;secure.</p><p>The Verus approach is different as it follows the fundamental systems design principle — the most important security layers should be located in the protocol itself, and not coded on top via L2 (smart contracts). All operations on Verus and PBaaS-chains are directly connected to consensus, secured by the miners and stakers of the protocol.</p><p>Now you might ask yourself “But can we build dApps that are as capable as building them with the VM-model?”. The answer is yes. Developing dApps with Verus is much more straightforward than building to a VM-based application model and results in inherently more capable, secure and scalable solutions.</p> Does Verus Solve the Blockchain Trilemma? <p>A fair question. And hopefully we answered with enough detail. The answer is&nbsp;“yes!”.</p><p>Let’s summarize. Verus does not compromise on decentralization and security to reach unlimited scalability. Unlimited scalability is reached by scaling out, not scaling up. It is the equivalent not of upgrading your server but of putting an extra server next to it to spread the bandwidth around.</p><p>Decentralization is achieved by making mining and staking accessible for everyone through extremely low hardware requirements. This naturally creates a large number of miners and nodes (stakers), making the network robust against attacks of all&nbsp;sorts.</p><p>High security is not only reached through the decentralized nature of the network but also because of the Fee Pool and the fact that all operations are directly connected to consensus and thus the miners and&nbsp;stakers.</p> Now is the Time to Build with&nbsp;Verus <p>Without having to rely on smart contracts, builders can develop dApps that are even more powerful, secure and scalable. Builders can use the no-coding-required API commands, together with VerusID and its VDXF (Verus Data Exchange Format) as a controlled public storage system with multiple levels of nesting to create dApps of any&nbsp;kind.</p><p>The foundation has been laid for a true Internet of Value.

        <p><a href="https://tokenmint.global/">TokenMint</a> was originally designed and built by the Horizen Ecosystem team as a POC (proof-of-concept) sidechain, called Tokenchain, to test the scalability and durability of the Horizen network. TokenMint was a live proof of concept that permitted the team to build Horizen EON, and now that Horizen EON is successfully running, the time to deprecate TokenMint is now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the deprecation, all TokenMint users will need to remove their $ZEN from the sidechain before the deprecation date to avoid loss of funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Important Dates</p>
 
 Wednesday, February 21st, 2024 – TokenMint Testnet will be Deprecated 
 Wednesday, March 6th, 2024 – TokenMint Mainnet will be Deprecated 
 
<p>To move $ZEN off of TokenMint, users can simply send their ZEN from their Cobalt Wallet to a Horizen mainchain address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Warning: ZEN can only be sent to Horizen Mainchain Sphere addresses from Cobalt. Sending ZEN to another Horizen Mainnet address outside of Sphere could lead to a loss of funds.</p>
<p>Please open a ticket on our <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">Discord server</a> with any questions or concerns during the deprecation period and please be sure to REMOVE your ZEN from TokenMint BEFORE March 6th, 2024, as the funds will be permanently lost after that date.</p>
<p>How to Send ZEN to the Horizen Mainchain from Cobalt Wallet</p>
 
 Open your Cobalt Wallet and make sure you are connected to the TokenMint chain.&nbsp; 
 In the Assets and Activity page, click the ZEN row. The page now allows you to send ZEN. It displays the current amount available. 
 Click the up arrow to send a transaction. 
 In the Send to field, enter the desired address you want to send the ZEN to. This field will display an error, if you enter an invalid address. 
 In the Amount field, enter the amount of the ZEN you want to send. 
 In the password field, enter your password to complete the transaction. 
 Click Submit. The Sent flag appears indicating that the transaction is successful. 
 Click Back to display the transaction activity. The Send page appears. If the transaction is pending, a notification will appear stating that the last pending transaction for this address has not been confirmed. Note that it can take up to 72 hours for the transaction to show on the destination wallet, even if the transaction is confirmed on the TokenMint explorer.

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>It’s time to review what Team Panther was up to in January and our plans for February. In this month’s update, we cover ecosystem updates, team expansion, product highlights, and a glimpse of next month’s plans; here’s everything you should know:</p> Ecosystem updates  Testnet Stage 3 is now live with a new design, enhanced security, and added features <p>Testnet Stage 3 was released in January, bringing a new design, enhanced security, and added features. Stage 3 enables users to use the newly allowlisted test Matic and test $ZKPs in Panther’s Shielded Pool.</p><p>Learn more about <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage-3-is-now-live-with-a-new-design-enhanced-security-and-added-features">Stage 3 of our testnet</a>.</p> LBank lists Zero-Knowledge DeFi pioneer Panther Protocol’s $ZKP&nbsp; <p>We are excited to share that Panther Protocol’s $ZKP is now listed on LBank, a leading cryptocurrency exchange. This listing follows $ZKP’s listing on BitMart in December 2023. These listings are part of our focus on cementing strategic partnerships and a strong exchange presence before Panther Protocol’s V1 launch.</p><p>More about the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/lbank-to-list-zero-knowledge-defi-pioneer-panther-protocols-zkp/">LBank listing</a>.</p> AMA recap: Panther’s CEO, Oliver Gale, discusses $ZKP listing on BitMart and the future of privacy in DeFi <p>Following the recent listing of $ZKP on BitMart, Panther’s CEO, Oliver Gale, introduced Panther Protocol to BitMart’s community. Catch a summary of the conversation in our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ama-recap-panthers-ceo-oliver-gale-discusses-zkp-listing-on-bitmart-and-the-future-of-privacy-in-defi/">latest blog</a>.&nbsp;</p> Panther Protocol testnet and rewards update   Number of current testnet users: 634  Total rewards distributed: 500,000+ $ZKP  <p>Our testnet rewards pot is 1.5M $ZKP — have you signed up for our testnet yet to earn your share?<a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Learn more and sign up</a> to join our testnet and receive your $ZKP rewards.</p> Panther’s Co-founder and CEO, Oliver Gale on CryptoCoinShow <p>&nbsp;Our co-founder and CEO, Oliver Gale, was recently on the @CryptoCoinShow discussing Panther’s strategic direction and the future of privacy-preserving tech in DeFi. Watch the complete episode <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zM65JyReAj0&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a>.</p> Panther hires Harrie Bickle to improve product documentation <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harriebickle/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Harrie Bickle</a> has joined the Panther team as a Senior Technical Writer. Harrie brings over a decade’s experience in Documentation and Product Marketing and has been in the blockchain space since 2018. Her range spans writing and editing articles, whitepapers, yellow papers, developer portals, and API documentation.</p><p>We are delighted to welcome Harrie and look forward to seeing our documentation reach a new level, thanks to her expertise gained while editing for Starkware in the Zero-Knowledge space and building out developer portals for Qredo’s crypto trading API and Neon EVM’s Solana settlement layer solution.</p> Product updates  Stage 4 developments <p>The dApp development for Stage 4 is complete, and we expect to launch it in the first week of Feb. Stage 4 of testnet allows users to send zAssets inside the pool from one zAccount to another. Stage 4 is a feature-filled release as it is being shipped with an interesting, related feature originally from Stage 6: Withdrawals.&nbsp;</p><p>Within the Stage 4 dApp, users can also undertake UTXO selection.&nbsp;</p> Stage 5 developments <p>Stage 5 development is underway in parallel, thanks to the team’s efforts over the last two months. The team is currently working on integrating bundle services into the dApp. Stage 5 includes using a third-party Bundler service and the ability to submit gasless transactions using an Account Abstraction Paymaster contract.&nbsp;</p> Oshiya update <p>We’ve updated the code for our Panther miner, Oshiya. The latest version of Oshiya comes with an enhanced miner setting: FORCE_UTXO_SIMULATION. This parameter gives control over whether the miner should consistently add a simulated UTXO, regardless of the presence of any pending queues. When set to ‘false’, a simulated UTXO will only be added if a pending queue exists. We recommend running the updated version of the Oshiya code.&nbsp;</p> Plans for February&nbsp; <p>Following the launch of Stage 4, the team will concentrate on enabling the dApp to support users to select a transaction for the Bundler service and perform end-to-end testing of this feature.&nbsp;</p><p>In parallel, the core team will focus on Stage 6, with its revised scope offering a cohesive Fee and Rewards mechanism. In this stage, users will pay all the fees (mimicking a production experience) and receive ‘subsidies’ from the DAO for certain fees, such as for compliance checks, among others. These subsidies are part of the bootstrapping and will be limited to the initial period of the protocol launch. We wish to understand our users’ views on the fee structures and invite the community to engage with the DAO to discuss the subsidies that should be applied during mainnet launch.</p>  About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. The Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in shielded pools, zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs, and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s ZK primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p>

More broadly TradFi has entered the chat. Franklin Templeton is a TradFi company with $1.5 trillion in assets.

It’s an investment management company (think mutual funds, ETFs) that manages over $1.5 Trillion in assets. This is what we in crypto affectionately refer to as TradFi and they recently came out with a BTC ETF and have big plans for future tokenization. They also seem to be incredibly bullish on crypto and this new intersection between crypto and TradFi.

<p>Firstly, thank you to all our testers for your continued support, patience, and feedback: we could not do this without you.&nbsp;</p><p>Testnet Stage 3 is now complete, and it provided us with valuable insights, resulting in several updates to the codebase.</p><p>We are excited to announce that Stage 4 of our testnet is live. Stage 4 allows users to send zAssets from inside the pool from one zAccount to another. Within the Stage 4 dApp, users can undertake UTXO selection.&nbsp;</p><p>Stage 4 is a feature-filled release as it is being shipped with an interesting, related feature originally from Stage 6: Withdrawals.&nbsp;</p> Protocol rewards update: <p>Before diving into the new features supported by Stage 4, we need to announce our enhanced protocol reward mechanics:</p>  Automatic conversion of pending PRPs into available PRPs upon spending of UTXO/s during transfers and withdrawals  A flat PRP bonus upon spending UTXO/s   Wallets, accounts, and transactions <p>Stage 4 testnet now supports internal transfers and withdrawals.</p> Internal transfers (send and receive) <p>Users can transfer zAssets to other Panther users inside the shielded pool using their zAddress. Every Panther user is assigned a zAddress upon sign-up. Find your zAddress in the dashboard by clicking the Receive button, as shown in the screenshot.</p><p>You can also share your Panther account address (zAddress) via a QR code from the receive screen. </p> Withdrawals <p>Users can now withdraw zAssets from the shielded pool to their external, linked wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>This external wallet may be the wallet linked to the original Panther account. Alternatively, testers may create a new Panther account with an alternative external wallet and withdraw to an account that did not originally deposit assets.&nbsp;</p><p>The withdrawal process performs compliance checks to ensure that users own the zAccount they are interacting with. This step also verifies that the wallet accepting withdrawals has no illegal association as part of the KYT (Know Your Transactions) check.</p><p>For a complete list of Test Stages, visit the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet/testnet-stages?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther docs</a>.</p> Get started with Stage 4 testing <p>To start testing Stage 4, visit the<a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Panther Protocol documentation</a> for the updated dApp test link and follow the steps outlined.</p> Internal Transfers <p>Log into your MetaMask wallet and sign into the Panther dApp.</p> Step 1: Navigate to the Send screen <p>Send is available from:</p>  Top main menu &gt; zAssets &gt;Send tab  zAssets &gt; Portfolio card &gt; Send button  Dashboard &gt; Private zAssets section &gt; token line &gt; token management buttons   Step 2: Create the transaction <p>Enter the amount to send and choose the token from the menu.

If the chosen UTXO/s total value exceeds the transfer amount, the balance is returned as a new UTXO in the user’s zAsset list.	</p> Step 4: Specify the destination&nbsp; <p>Provide the destination address in the Panther account format: beginning with “ZK” and totalling 42 characters.</p><p>&nbsp;Enter a new address or select from previously-used addresses.	</p> Step 5: Send <p>Press the Send button to initiate the internal transfer.&nbsp;</p><p>Congratulations, your transfer is complete!</p> Withdraw  Step 1: Navigate to the Withdraw screen <p>Withdraw is available from:</p>  Top main menu &gt; zAssets &gt; Withdraw screen  Dashboard &gt; Private zAssets section &gt; token line &gt; token management buttons   Step 2: Create the transaction <p>Enter the withdrawal amount and choose the token from the menu.

As always, let us know if you have any additional feedback through our social and community channels.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for participating in testnet Stage 4! </p><p>Note: An issue was reported after Stage 3 that made a specific zZKP UTXO unusable. This UTXO was created by converting PRP to zZKP. Because this UTXO was unusable, we made a custom filter on dApp to not fetch them thus avoiding confusion between good and bad UTXO.&nbsp;</p><p>Users who had those zZKP UTXO, however, will be compensated by a direct distribution to their externally owned account thereby ensuring rewards are not lost. Users do not need to perform any action on their side. </p> Not sure how to create a Panther testnet account? watch our tutorial below:

        <p>On February 7th, 2024, at approximately 12:00pm UTC, ZEN 5.0.0 will perform a network upgrade on Mainnet via hard fork at block #1502800. As previous communications have stated, after this hard fork it will no longer be possible to perform any transactions involving shielded addresses. It is highly recommended to move funds out of the shielded pool before then.&nbsp;</p><p>Failure to remove shielded ZEN from shielded addresses prior to the hard fork will result in the loss of your shielded ZEN. It’s important to note that transparent ZEN is not affected by the hard fork, just shielded ZEN.&nbsp;</p><p>This move came with the successfully passed <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42207-complete-removal-of-shielded-pool-from-the-horizen-mainchain/">ZenIP 42207</a> earlier this year, which enabled the complete removal of the shielded pool from the Horizen mainchain. This change built upon the deprecation of access to the shielded pool enacted by <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/what-is-zenip-42204-deprecation-of-shielded-pools/">ZenIP 42204</a> and is a response to the evolving regulatory environment around privacy tokens, re-confirming and showcasing the project’s strategic pivot away from privacy-focused features. As a result, it will no longer be possible to conduct a private transaction on Horizen or access private addresses as of February 7, 2024.</p><p>This is a complete removal of all private payment features from Horizen, effective Feb 7, 2024. There will be no private payment capabilities in Horizen as of this change. Regular public payments, just like Bitcoin, will continue to be supported by Horizen. Horizen will not be a privacy cryptocurrency anymore when this takes effect on Feb 7, 2024.</p><p>Again, we strongly recommend that all users with existing funds in private addresses transfer their funds to their own transparent addresses using Sphere by Horizen or zen-cli before February 7th, 2024. After February 7th, 2024 it will not be possible anymore to transfer any funds inside of the shielded pool to any other address. Unshielding funds directly to exchange deposit addresses is strongly discouraged.</p><p>There is a guide on the Horizen Blog on how to De-Shield ZEN on Sphere Wallet, users will need to de-shield any ZEN in a shielded address by transferring it out from the shielded pool. Please reference the guide here: <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/how-to-de-shield-zen-on-sphere-wallet/">https://blog.horizen.io/how-to-de-shield-zen-on-sphere-wallet/</a></p><p>The Horizen Ecosystem Team remains readily available to answer any questions around this, please open up a ticket, or reach out to us on our Discord: <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">https://horizen.io/invite/discord</a></p>

<p>January 31, 2024, San Francisco, California— Today Brave Software announced the launch of Brave Ads Manager, a new platform to buy, manage, and report on privacy-preserving ad campaigns in the Brave ecosystem. The platform had been in limited <a>beta</a> since last spring and is now offering open <a href="https://ads.brave.com/">registration</a> to customers worldwide.</p>
<p>The Brave browser has grown to an audience of over 65 million monthly users while Brave Ads, which was <a>introduced in 2019</a>, has successfully run 9,000+ campaigns for 1,500+ advertisers in 200 countries. Throughout 2023, Brave Ads also expanded with the help of early adopters to ad placements on <a href="https://search.brave.com/">Brave Search</a>, the fastest growing search engine since Bing. Brave’s recent clients include Ford, Intuit, Norton, Swarovski, and Wayfair.</p>

 Reaching the next generation of early adopters 
<p><a>Brave users</a> are lead users and are passionate about their role in the future of the Web. As early adopters of emerging technologies like Web3 and AI, they value independence, quality content, and privacy above all when browsing. This makes them engaged but not easily reachable through conventional channels.</p>
<p>Brave Ads reconnects users with advertisers and enables direct relationships where users and brands meet on their own terms. Users set preferences for privacy-respecting ads, choosing when, where and how often to engage. Advertisers signal care for customers by respecting these choices, building goodwill and trust. No trackers or cookies are ever used. Ultimately, both parties benefit from Brave’s model of transparency and control over online experiences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“With over 65 million users and growing, Brave can’t be ignored by brands who want to reach the people at the frontier of the Web. What Brave users do, buy, and talk about today, the rest of the world will be doing, buying, and talking about in years to come.”</p>
<p>Luke Mulks, VP Business Operations</p>
</blockquote>

 The easiest way to advertise with privacy in mind 
<p>Customers can navigate a familiar and streamlined campaign creation process to create their Brave Ads campaigns in minutes. Once a campaign is submitted for review, customers can expect launch within 48 hours. Throughout the campaign, customers will have access to a dashboard to view campaign performance through a range of basic and advanced tools, all designed for practical use in the cookieless Web.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    
Brave Ads Manager campaign creation</p>

 Unique browser-based ad placements 
<p>Brave Ads Manager customers have the option to buy Notification and Newsfeed ad placements, two of four available ad types found throughout the Brave <a>browser</a>.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://ads-help.brave.com/ad-placements/brave-browser/notification/">Notification ads</a> were the first—and remain the most popular—ad unit to launch with Brave Ads in the browser. For acquisition-based campaign objectives, advertisers can leverage Mindset Ad Targeting, Brave’s unique ad-matching technology that delivers precision, interest-based targeting at the browser level without risks or harm to privacy.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://ads-help.brave.com/ad-placements/brave-browser/news/">Newsfeed ads</a> are native image and text placements integrated seamlessly within Brave News, a free and customizable RSS and news aggregator available in the Brave browser via a new tab page. Ads in Brave News are always 100% SOV (share of voice)—two ads will never display in the feed at the same time.</p>

Newsfeed ads</p>
<p>Brave’s two other ad placements—<a href="https://ads-help.brave.com/ad-placements/brave-browser/ntt/">New Tab Takeovers</a> and <a href="https://ads-help.brave.com/ad-placements/brave-search/keyword/">Search keyword ads</a>—are available as managed service buys and can be booked by <a href="https://ads.brave.com/contact">contacting Brave’s ad sales team</a>.</p>
<p>About Brave Ads</p>
<p><a>Brave Ads launched in 2019</a> with the goal of reforming an increasingly user-hostile Web, made worse by ever-invasive tracking from innumerable ad-technology firms competing to capture as much data—people’s data—as possible. Brave Ads are cookieless, don’t track or identify users, and offer choice in how brands engage with them as they browse and search the Web.</p>

 Consensus 2024 — Verus Showcases Fully Completed PBaaS Blockchain Technology  Verus showcases its fully completed Public Blockchain as a Service (PBaaS) technology at Consensus 2024, May 29–31, Austin, USA (booth 1245). The global event for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovations this year. Here, tens of thousands of cryptocurrency enthusiasts gather to explore the newest advancements in the industry.  The L0/1 Verus Protocol Solves Major Issues with Ethereum and Other VM-centric Networks <p>Developing dApps with Verus is much more straightforward than building to a VM-based application model and results in inherently more capable, secure and scalable solutions. The Verus Protocol solves issues with gas fees, enables unlimited scale, is not vulnerable to smart contract hacks and bugs, addresses MEV at the protocol level, provides an identity model (<a href="https://docs.verus.io/verusid/">VerusID</a>) that applications can leverage and profit from, includes provable cross-chain and multichain support, does away with insecure and phishing-prone wallet approval mechanisms, and does not require expensive Solidity developers for applications, unless they must also have an Ethereum component to&nbsp;them.</p><p>All these issues are solved with the L0/1 Verus Protocol. Verus does not use smart contracts — it uses smart transactions. Verus smart transactions [<a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-smart-transactions-vs-smart-contracts-f98079c00ed0">read more</a>] are much easier to use (no programming needed) in practice to achieve most capabilities, if not all, compared to VM-protocols that use smart contracts. Yet Verus is still fully interoperable with Ethereum through the non-custodial, trustless and decentralized Verus-Ethereum Bridge with liquidity pool currency [<a href="https://docs.verus.io/eth-bridge/">more on the&nbsp;Bridge</a>].</p> Showcasing Verus App-Development Opportunities at Consensus 2024 <p>Get ready for a new era of decentralized application development. Unlike today’s complex smart contract applications, requiring VM-based smart contracts that talk to user facing applications through server-side APIs and phishing-prone web-interfaces using public key hashes or rented names as identity, the Verus network is a Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 0 (L0) protocol with composable and powerful multi-chain core primitives, including identities, currencies, MEV-resistant liquidity baskets, updateable, even transferable ID-bound databases that can comprise NFTs and real world assets, all on a 100% fully decentralized, unlimited scale backbone, secured by the 50% proof-of-stake / 50% proof-of-work, 51% hash attack resistant Verus Proof of Power (PoP) consensus and accessible securely from mobile clients or cloud-based web-applications.</p><p>Build applications in your favorite framework for clients and access the Verus network either through QR-codes and deep-links to a client-side wallet under user control or talk directly to data-indexed, blockchain nodes, capable of providing fast access to an unlimited number of user identities and their unlimited Verus Data Exchange Format (VDXF) indexable key-value database providing provable, optionally private, worldwide resolvable data at unlimited scale over an unlimited number of blockchains. All of this power, including inherent eCommerce and markets of all types are usable by applications, and unlike yesterday’s Internet, application-owned data stays under application control, while user-owned data remains under user control and subject to voluntary, provable disclosure, protected by zero knowledge privacy, as it should always have&nbsp;been.</p><p>Write applications your way, your client frameworks, your languages, with links and RPC calls to the decentralized Internet of Value. Connect through one or more blockchains. Use, create, sell, and provision your application’s permanent IDs for secure login, KYC, commerce, and provable data at scale, all on the rent-free, credibly neutral and fully decentralized Internet of&nbsp;Value.</p><p>Builders of applications, organizations, and businesses can use the Verus Protocol to provision IDs, manage and interact with users and user state at any scale, launch currencies (e.g. tokens, liquidity baskets [<a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/launch-currency.html">see docs</a>]), even fully interoperable, independent, customizable worldwide blockchains with their own economics and fee structure, while sharing mining and economic power across the entire Verus Protocol network of unlimited PBaaS chains. All currencies, whether native currencies of a new blockchain, easily created and minted tokens, or MEV-resistant liquidity baskets are easy to launch and access with the protocol on Verus or any connected PBaaS chain. All of them, from the moment they are launched can be exported to Ethereum as ERC20s [<a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/export-to-eth.html">see docs</a>] or ERC721 currencies or any chain across the Verus ecosystem. All currencies on the network, including tokens, cross-chain currencies, and even liquidity baskets and their supplies are secured by miners and stakers according to protocol rules. On other blockchain networks, this level of security is applied to single native currencies, on Verus, all currencies on a chain are primitives known to and accounted for by the protocol, eliminating entire classes of smart contract risks that result when every contract reinvents a new way to account for its currency but has no systemic&nbsp;control.</p><p>With Verus, currencies are compatible with ERC20s. Verus applications can leverage, but do not require Solidity developers or VM-based programming. Additionally all ERC-20s can be permissionlessly bridged over from Ethereum to Verus [<a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/mapping-1:1-eth.html">see docs</a>], giving users and application builders the freedom to switch seamlessly between the Verus and Ethereum networks.</p><p>All currencies on the Verus network (also the ones bridged over from Ethereum) can be used with Verus DeFi, another primitive inherent to the protocol. Verus DeFi enables liquidity baskets of up to 10 underlying reserve currencies and can serve as a unique, self-balancing, MEV-resistant portfolio, a permissionless or permissioned ID registrar where fees go to the LPs of the basket, or an easy way to send from any reserve currency or the basket currency itself to any other without worrying about block builder reordering or MEV, as all conversions of a liquidity basket in any direction that are processed within one or more blocks are always solved simultaneously, no front and not back. Every conversion gets the same price in each direction with no spread and an ultra low fee (max. 0.05%), again, all part of the L1 consensus.</p><p>Whether you plan to build eCommerce enabled supply chains, massively scalable ownership-based games, real world asset eCommerce enabled networks, voting systems, identity management networks, communication networks, financial networks, 3D metaverses with identities, brands, and ownership or just about any application for a better Web3 on the Internet of Value, you’ll be left behind if you don’t deep dive on Verus&nbsp;first.</p><p>Join us in the next crypto revolution. Verus, with truth and privacy for&nbsp;all!</p><p>Come to the Verus booth on May 29–31 at Consensus 2024. The worldwide community is happy to get you started with a free VerusID, the easy to use Verus Mobile or any of the wide range of protocol features.</p> Amazing Verus Community <p>The Verus community united to facilitate participation at Consensus 2024 by generously contributing VRSC, ETH, DAI, MKR, Bridge.vETH and BTC. A heartfelt thank you to all the contributors! ❤️</p><p>The Verus community used the funds to secure a two-block booth at Consensus, along with other facilities that we can not disclose&nbsp;yet.</p><p>Numerous members of the Verus community are participating in Consensus 2024, and we invite you to be a part of it too!

PIVCards, Coinsbee, and <a href="https://www.travala.com/">Travala.com</a> embraced $PIVX as a payment option. Users can now purchase gift cards from all over the world with PIV on<a href="https://mypivxwallet.org/pivcards/"> mypivxwallet.org, PIVCards</a>, <a href="https://shopping.io/">Shopping.io</a> as well as <a href="https://www.coinsbee.com/">Coinsbee</a> offers a platform where $PIVX can be used to purchase various gift&nbsp;cards.</p><p>Listing Growth: <br>PIVX experienced significant listing growth, providing more opportunities for PIVX enthusiasts. New listings included <a href="https://whitebit.com/">Whitebit</a>, <a href="https://changeangel.io/">Changeangel</a>, <a href="https://houdiniswap.com/">Houdini Swap</a>, <a href="https://cointopay.com/">Cointopay</a>, <a href="https://swapuz.com/">Swapuz</a>, <a href="https://easybit.com/">Easybit, </a><a href="https://www.coinex.com/">CoinEx</a>, <a href="https://dex-trade.com/">Dex-Trade</a>, Securus Wallet, <a href="https://www.biconomy.com/">Biconomy,</a> Coinstore, <a href="https://nonkyc.io/">NonKYC</a>, <a href="https://changenow.io/">ChangeNOW </a>widget added to PIVX.org, <a href="https://tradeogre.com/markets">TradeOgre</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/pivx/breaking-news-9615d5416f6c">P2P payments on Binance,</a> <a href="https://www.lbank.com/">LBank</a>, <a href="https://arcticwallet.io/">Arctic Wallet</a>, <a href="https://finchpay.io/">FinchPay</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xt.com/en">Xt.com</a>.</p><p>Enhanced Trading Options: <br>PIVX gained enhanced trading options with various exchanges. In addition to the PIVX/USDT Binance trading pair, some other exchanges introduced BTC as well as USDT options, allowing for more convenient and accessible trading options for the PIVX community.</p><p>Community Engagement: <br>PIVX actively engaged with its community through various activities. These included YouTube shorts, AMAs (Ask Me Anything), the SuperBlock Report (PIVXLabs), PIVXcommunity contests, and the Privacy Roundtable, a collaborative group consisting of PIVX, BasicSwapDEX, Particl, and Firo. The Privacy Roundtable, hosts monthly Twitter spaces where trending privacy topics are discussed and other privacy projects are introduced. These initiatives are fostering a more vibrant and engaged community.</p><p>As we celebrate PIVX’s 8th birthday, we can proudly reflect on these achievements over the past year. The rewards increase, expanded use cases, listing growth, enhanced trading options, and community engagement have all contributed to the growth and success of&nbsp;PIVX.</p><p>On this special day, let us say that growth is not a destination, but an ongoing journey. As we celebrate PIVX’s achievements, we recognize that it is through the relentless pursuit of knowledge, the embrace of new opportunities, and the adaptability to changing circumstances that PIVX continues to evolve and expand. Let us come together as a community committed to learning and adapting, keeping PIVX at the forefront of innovation and progress in the pursuit of privacy and financial sovereignty</p><p>Happy 8th birthday, PIVX!

<p>Backing open-ended breakthrough research is at the core of BlueYard’s investing philosophy, whether it’s nuclear fusion, programmable stem cells or novel crypto-compute infrastructure. Hackers and researchers remain the essential backbone of the crypto industry. We are proud to have supported the work of research-focused companies like <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a>, <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a>, <a href="https://www.flashbots.net/">Flashbots</a>, <a href="https://www.privy.io/">Privy</a>, <a href="https://www.ingonyama.com/">Ingonyama</a>, <a href="https://www.tromero.ai/">Tromero</a> and more in solving critical crypto compute and infrastructure challenges, including those that could be key to unlocking adoption and enabling groundbreaking novel use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>This brings us to our core thesis underpinning our crypto investing strategy:</p><blockquote>In the history of technology, economics and organizations — never has there been a technology and incentive system that can autonomously coordinate machines (compute, storage, etc), algorithms, data and capital at such an incredible scale, so quickly — all while providing independent, robust and trustless infrastructure for economic activity and data. Although still early in its development, crypto might be the ultimate solution to the collective action problem. Also, if one believes in a future where the autonomous coordination between compute, data and capital will play an increasing role, crypto networks could be the “under the hood” operating system for large economic networks.</blockquote><p>Due to crypto’s inherent properties (ability to cut out gatekeepers, separation of state and money, internet native assets with open access) — crypto’s potential will unfold both through novel applications and decentralized infrastructure.</p><p>Within this context, it is essential that individual researchers and hackers continue to explore open-ended research, despite the current funding and regulatory headwinds in the industry. Individual research is often the nucleus of a future key component of the crypto industry. ​​In that spirit, we are announcing BlueYard DYOR (Do Your Own Research, and pronounced like <a href="https://youtu.be/HPsgY7zCtck?feature=shared&amp;t=41">this</a>) funding program. We’re offering $100k to thoughtful researchers and builders to pursue their curiosities and research in crypto, with an open-ended outcome if their work is contributed to the industry and/or forms the nucleation of a new company or&nbsp;network.</p><p>As the name suggests, we expect the BlueYard DYOR cohort to conduct independent crypto research and/or work on a project. You don’t currently have to have a company, team, or a specific idea of what you want to build or research. Simply a direction of what you want to pursue. We are geography agnostic and excited to work with the best minds wherever they might&nbsp;be.</p><p>You are someone&nbsp;who:</p>  Has a track record of experimenting and building (show us your&nbsp;work!)  Might be sitting on the sidelines waiting for the bear market to blow over (now is the best time to start something new) or don’t have the personal funding to spend more time pursuing your crypto curiosities  Is independent, insatiably curious, and excited to try novel things in&nbsp;crypto  Understands the potential of crypto beyond its speculative value and wants to build for the long&nbsp;term  <p>What you can expect from BlueYard&nbsp;DYOR:</p>  Access to the BlueYard team and its crypto portfolio (and the wider science and compute companies in our broader portfolio) to support you in your&nbsp;work  A cohort of 10 other builders experimenting, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in&nbsp;crypto  Help in publishing / releasing and distributing what you have&nbsp;built  Access to crypto and science events alongside meetups within the BlueYard&nbsp;family  Help in setting up an entity through which the DYOR funding will be received via an uncapped&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/documents">SAFE</a>  <p>You can learn more about our crypto portfolio <a href="http://www.blueyard.com">here</a> and apply for BlueYard DYOR&nbsp;<a href="https://blueyard.typeform.com/to/vvc3f8BC">here</a>.</p>

          ZEN 5.0.0 is the official Mainnet Release  ZEN 4.1.1 (previous version) is going to deprecate on Mainnet at block #1502084, on February 6th, 2024 at approximately 6:00 AM UTC. Please, update to ZEN 5.0.0 before February 6th, 2024.  ZEN 5.0.0 will perform a network upgrade on Mainnet via Hard Fork at block #1502800, on February 7th, 2024 at approximately 12:00 PM UTC.  <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0xbb8d72c088637c53cde7aa07c030b63dcdfa901ddffd5ce579b061d6064d5bb0">ZenIP-42207</a> to fully remove the shielded pool from Horizen will be implemented with this release:  All transactions involving shielded addresses will no longer be accepted at the consensus level once the hard fork activates  RPC calls z_sendmany and z_mergetoaddress have been partially disabled so that it will no longer be possible to submit transactions involving shielded addresses (transparent-to-shielded, shielded-to-shielded, and shielded-to-transparent) once the hard fork activates. Transparent-to-transparent transactions will still be accepted and submitted to the network.  Only nodes running on Mainnet have to be updated.      <p>IMPORTANT: 5.0.0.<br>After the previously mentioned Hard Fork, it will no longer be possible to perform any transactions involving shielded addresses. It is highly recommended to move funds out of the shielded pool before then. Directly depositing funds from shielded addresses to exchange wallets is strongly discouraged.<br><br></p><p>See release notes <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zen/blob/release/5.0.0/doc/release-notes/release-notes-5.0.0.md">Here.</a></p><p>Please let us know if you have any questions or if you need further support by reaching out to us on <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">our Discord.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ingonyama.com/">Ingonyama</a> is developing hardware to speed up zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic scheme that secures much of web3 and is a critical component for scaling Ethereum.</p><p>ZK proofs allow verification that a transaction or smart contract was executed without revealing any of the details. This was first used to support private transactions in protocols like ZCash. The even more promising application is to increase the scalability of protocols such as Ethereum. Layer 2 solutions such as StarkWare execute transactions and smart contracts for users and then post a ZK proof to Ethereum. This significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be stored on Ethereum and enables transaction volumes similar to traditional payment networks such as&nbsp;Visa.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>Inside of every CPU are specialized circuits for speeding up the cryptography used to secure the internet today. At first, Ingonyama might look like a niche business designing specialized hardware for scaling crypto protocols. As the internet becomes more decentralized, the same hardware could secure every internet-connected device.
