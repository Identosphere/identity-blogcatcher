 NYM tokens — where do they live and how are they distributed cross-chain?  Learn about the mixnet token economics, NYM tokens and the Nyx&nbsp;chain <p>Nym is a mixnet that provides powerful privacy protections for ordinary people by encrypting and mixing internet traffic. The mixnet has a utility token called NYM to pay for usage, measure reputation and serve as rewards for the privacy infrastructure. The token economics of the Nym mixnet runs on the Nyx blockchain, a layer-1 blockchain built on Cosmos SDK, for the&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>The Nyx blockchain is the home of the smart contracts that form the backbone of the Nym mixnet. These smart contracts manage the topology of nodes that make up the mixnet, the staking and rewarding of mix nodes and of course the peer-to-peer transactions where users send NYM tokens to each other. Nyx is a Cosmos blockchain, it uses CosmWasm smart contracts and is written in Rust, compiled to WebAssembly. (Stay tuned for an upcoming blogpost that gives a breakdown of the mixnet CosmWasm smart contracts!)</p><p>Now, this means the mixnet token economics is not run through a simple Ethereum smart contract for minting ERC20. Instead, tokens are stored on the Nyx Cosmos chain and then shipped cross-chain to other blockchains, such as Ethereum.</p><p>The total supply of NYM tokens is 1,000,000,000 (1 billion). Not all of these are in circulation yet, as there are different vesting instruments releasing tranches of tokens starting from the genesis of the Nyx chain in early&nbsp;2022.</p><p>The team releases quarterly tokenomics updates as more tokens enter into circulation. This is necessary as the increase in liquidity results in a change in the mixnet tokenomic parameters. To give an example: the more native NYM tokens there are in circulation, the higher the stake saturation points for mix&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>Note: NYM is a utility token, which will enable users to access the internet through the mixnet. It is a reputation and incentive vehicle for mixnet infrastructure operators.</p> A bit more complexity: ERC-20&nbsp;NYM <p>To enable access for more users, NYM tokens have also been enabled on the Ethereum chain as an ERC-20 token, using the permissionless <a href="https://www.gravitybridge.net/">Gravity Bridge</a> — a Cosmos native blockchain that bridges assets between the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems.</p><p>The main reason for this is that many centralized exchanges do not support Cosmos chains directly–only some, like Kraken or Deepcoin&nbsp;do.</p> Nym and Gravity&nbsp;bridge <p>Gravity Bridge has two different sides, one of which is Gravity.sol, the Solidity contract that holds &amp; releases funds on Ethereum. In contrast to the mainstream trend in regular bridge designs, Gravity.sol is very compact and easy to review. It has been audited by three independent teams (Certik, Least Authority, and Code4rena) and it is not upgradable. It does not contain any trusted parties — it works as a transparent and solid framework to bridge any Cosmos chain to Ethereum.</p><p>The way <a href="https://github.com/Gravity-Bridge/Gravity-Bridge/blob/8ba6deb81373d9d3b702d22d20bca028f74dc2ed/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L590">Gravity.sol works</a> is that when the ERC20 NYM contract was deployed by Gravity Bridge, it minted the maximum possible amount of NYM Ethereum tokens — <a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/eli5-uint256-in-solidity-a16f22942166#:~:text=uint256%20is%20non%2Dnegative%20integers,Channel%20get%20daily%20Crypto%20News">equals uint256</a>, basically a very big number capped by Ethereum design parameters. This is reflected on Etherscan.</p><p>This minted number is mutually exclusive from the 1 billion total supply of native NYM tokens. It is merely a technicality that is hardcoded into the bridge contract function, like in the case of all other types of Cosmos tokens that <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xa4108aA1Ec4967F8b52220a4f7e94A8201F2D906">Gravity.sol holds</a>. This phenomenon occurs with every chain that uses Gravity Bridge. However it may be less noticeable given that most tokens originate from the Ethereum side where the maximum supply less than the maximum size of uint256 is less&nbsp;common.</p><p>The deployment is done by the bridge contract itself. Deployers have <a href="https://github.com/Gravity-Bridge/Gravity-Bridge/blob/8ba6deb81373d9d3b702d22d20bca028f74dc2ed/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L590">limited parameter control</a>, namely name, symbol and the number of decimal&nbsp;points.</p><p>The reason for this is because on the Cosmos side, the Gravity module mints and burns native NYM tokens based on the bridge interactions requested by users, and this way the Gravity contract does not need to be updated to calculate with any tokenomics of any token specifics — it can stay lean and permissionless, working with all Cosmos&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Essentially, Gravity acts like a photocopying machine, which does not count tokenomics and vesting periods, because it only does two&nbsp;things:</p>  If Native NYM is burnt it releases ERC-20 NYM on the Ethereum&nbsp;side  If ERC-20 tokens get locked, it mints the equivalent amounts on the Cosmos&nbsp;side  <p>Let’s take a look at two example scenarios:</p> Example 1 <p>Alice won X native NYMs in a challenge and would like to sell it on an exchange where she has an account. As her exchange only supports ERC-20 NYMs, Alice has to bridge her tokens via Gravity&nbsp;Bridge:</p>  Alice sends X native NYM over to Gravity&nbsp;Bridge.  Gravity Bridge burns these tokens on Cosmos side (1 billion minus&nbsp;X).  X amount of ERC-20 NYMs gets released from the bridge contract to the wallet that Alice specified.  <p>In the end, the maximum circulating amount does not change — only X amount more circulates on the Ethereum side, and X less on the Cosmos&nbsp;side.</p> Example 2 <p>Bob would like to buy Y NYM tokens to stake them on a mixnode, but he only has an account with an exchange which supports ERC-20 NYMs. Bob knows that he has to bridge his ERC-20 NYMs via Gravity&nbsp;Bridge:</p>  Bob sends Y ERC-20 NYMs from the exchange to Gravity&nbsp;Bridge.  Gravity.sol locks Bob’s Y ERC-20 NYM tokens — this gets added to the already very-big number of NYM tokens outside of circulation held by the smart contract.  Gravity Bridge mints Y Native NYM tokens and sends it to the Nym wallet address specified by&nbsp;Bob.  <p>In the end, the maximum circulating supply does not change, because all NYM tokens will have originally been minted on the native Nyx Cosmos chain. In other words, the Y ERC-20 NYMs that Bob bought off the exchange will have at some point been bridged over from Nyx, just like Alice’s tokens. Thus they were burnt before by someone else who bridged those tokens over to Ethereum.</p><p>The total circulating supply will always be a maximum 1 billion NYM, across all&nbsp;chains.</p> Resources <p>If you want to learn more about how to bridge your ERC-20 to Cosmos read: <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/bridging-staking-and-earning-nym-tokens-8f19f42f171e">https://blog.nymtech.net/bridging-staking-and-earning-nym-tokens-8f19f42f171e</a></p><p>If you are interested in the quarterly tokenomics parameter upgrade read: <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-token-economics-quarterly-parameter-update-e85b6c929b37">https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-token-economics-quarterly-parameter-update-e85b6c929b37</a></p><p>If you’d like to know more about how to stake &amp; delegate your tokens read: <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/how-to-stake-in-the-nym-mixnet-15a28d687e56">https://blog.nymtech.net/how-to-stake-in-the-nym-mixnet-15a28d687e56</a></p> Join Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> // <a href="https://t.me/nymtech">Telegram</a> // <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dev:nymtech.chat">Element</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">Twitter</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-tokens-where-do-they-live-and-how-are-they-distributed-cross-chain-8d134bf9c41f">NYM tokens — where do they live and how are they distributed cross-chain?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Nanotechnology, core to the $200Bn value-added materials market, has for decades been heralded as one of the most promising areas of science and industry. However, we are yet to discover even 1% of what is possible in nanomaterial design because of the challenges in unlocking the unique properties of elements at the nanoscale. Exploiting the unique synergistic effects embodied in novel nanoscale composites has, until now, been almost impossible at a large scale. <a href="https://vsparticle.com/">VSParticle</a>, a TU Delft spin out, has created a quantum-enhanced 3D nano-printer for the high throughput scaling of nanomaterials with broad applicability for scientific, engineering and manufacturing applications.</p><p>The nano-printer uses spark ablation technology (an aerosol-based generation method invented by one of the company’s co-founders) that can uniquely combine different materials into single nanoparticles with controllable sizes and chemical compositions, at low cost and in an environmentally friendly way. One of VSParticle’s first applications significantly improves membrane efficiency to help accelerate the large-scale deployment of green hydrogen production.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>Achieving high-throughput design and test cycles for inorganic nanomaterials is considered the holy grail for a step-change in the inorganic chemicals industry and to propel us to a more sustainable future. By shortening the time to commercialize new value-added materials from 20 to 2 years for high value applications (including solar cells, electro-catalysts, bioelectronics, batteries, sensors and more), VSParticle could play a key role in tackling some of the planet’s outsized challenges including solving for material scarcity in green hydrogen production, decarbonizing the petrochemical industry, and driving a step-change in energy generation, conversion and storage. Finally, as a general purpose technology, VSParticle has the potential to become a global nanofoundry for the discovery and production of advanced materials — akin to becoming the Gingko Bioworks of the inorganic materials world.</p><p>We are excited to be backing the VSParticle team on their mission.

<p>Panther community,</p><p>We are debuting our v1’s Testnet this Monday. Through it, you’ll be able to test the different protocol functionalities in different stages, leading to our protocol’s release.</p><p>In this article, we’ll cover everything you need to know about the Testnet itself, its incremental release, rewards for testers, and the different stages of the testing.</p> What is expected from testers? <p>Voluntary testers are expected to go through a predefined set of test cases to cover the whole range of product functionalities. Besides trying out v1, testers are expected to report on bugs or potential UI/UX improvements. Your feedback will be used to enhance the protocol before the official launch.</p><p>Furthermore, the Testnet can be used to test further versions of the protocol upon the community's request.</p> How will Panther’s Testnet work? <p>At Stage 1 (see the release schedule below), the Testnet will go live at <a href="http://www.testnet.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">www.testnet.pantherprotocol.io</a>.</p><p>The Testnet will be deployed first on the Mumbai Testnet and then the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/polygon-integration-annouced-for-panther-protocol/">Polygon network.</a> Mumbai, a Polygon Testnet, will only be used to test stages 0-6, while Mainnet Polygon testing will take place starting from the 7th stage. At this time, a canary deployment will be used to test the protocol in an environment as close to full production as possible (see “Scope to test” below).</p><p>Test tokens created for testing purposes, including “test” versions of $ZKP, will be deployed to both networks. Testnet ZKP tokens will be exchangeable for Polygon ZKP tokens (see “Incentivization” below).</p><p>Panther will provide users with a series of test cases to execute on the Testnet. These are specific to each testing stage and will be communicated via our official channels prior to the launch of each stage.</p> Sharing feedback <p>Testnet rewards are automatized, and as such, the Testnet itself will reward users for executing on the provided use cases. However, the goal for the Testnet is to debug and enhance the protocol before v1’s launch. As such, our expectation is that users submit bugs and share ideas to enhance the UI/UX based on their practical experience.</p><p>Spotting and fixing any possible bugs within the Testnet will make the production (released) version of the protocol more sustainable in the middle-term, while allowing users to proceed with testing, therefore earning rewards.</p><p>To share feedback, testers will be using <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1djJcyCnglCrdK4brF5bYrcQDb-CnXLCEFmCa4XriNNQ/prefill?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">a dedicated form</a> as the only accepted procedure. The steps mentioned in the form’s description are needed to make this interaction both efficient and productive.<br></p> Testing scope and stages <p>The following are the different stages of testing that users will undertake.</p><p>As mentioned, specific testing guides for each step will be released along with them.</p> How to test <p>Information regarding Stage 0 will go live on July 10th.</p><p>Once Stage 1 is set up, users should visit the Testnet link (<a href="http://www.testnet.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">www.testnet.pantherprotocol.io</a>) and join to test the onboarding functionality. This involves creating a zAccount, passing a simple <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/kyc-aml-how-crypto-might-change-a-traditional-finance-standard-forever/">KYC</a> flow (name and email required, ID not required), and activating the zAccount.</p><p>Each newly-onboarded user will receive tZKP tokens and tPRP (test PRP). tZKP tokens will be used to interact with the protocol during later stages. Interactions with the protocol accrue rewards for users in the form of tPRP, which will be used in the second stage.</p><p>More information about Stage 1 will be published at due time.<br></p> Panther’s Testnet incentivization<br> <p>As mentioned above, the use cases for testing will trigger rewards. These are meant to incentivize users to provide feedback.</p><p>At the end of Testing, users will be left with $tZKP balances proportional to the number of tests they performed. At this stage, $tZKP will be used to redeem real $ZKP 1:1 on Polygon. The method to do this will be described at the time.</p> On Test tokens <p>The Test tokens created to support the testing process will be:</p>  tZKP tokens. Test ZKP tokens deployed on <a href="https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Mumbai</a> and Polygon, as two separate tokens. The proportion of tokens in each chain will be determined in time.  <p>tZKP tokens have a limited supply, which is equal to the reward pool size (see “Amount” below) to maintain a 1:1 ratio for tZKP-ZKP. All tZKP tokens can be exchanged into $ZKP on the Polygon network at a 1:1 ratio at the end of the testing period and, as such, have value.</p>  Additional test tokens (as required for Testing). These tokens will have no monetary value and will be used to test diverse protocol functions.<br>  tPRP. Test PRP granted to all users who successfully onboard to Panther. The goal of these tokens is merely to test PRP/ZKP conversion in Stage 2.   Amounts and sources <p>The total amount of Testnet rewards is proposed to be set on a level of 1.5M $ZKP, with an additional 0.5M $ZKP in reserve to cover additional rewards if needed.</p><p>Testnet rewards are proposed to be taken from the Foundation-General pool. The allocation and transfer of funds to a newly created incentivized Testnet pool can be done by the Panther Foundation. &nbsp;<br></p> tZKP Distribution <p>tZKP will be distributed using the following ratios. Note that distributions can be adjusted during the testing period.<br></p>  Welcome bonus – 20%. This will help users receive tZKP in their zAccount. These tokens are used for paying fees and incentivize users to sign up.  Miner Rewards pool - 10%. Rewards set aside for miners who run a node to execute a batch of on-chain transactions. Miners will be rewarded based on their batch size, i.e. the number of UTXOs included in the batch.  AMM Rewards pool - 60%. This pool will hold the majority of rewards destined to users performing tests.  Third-party service providers - 10%. For third-parties acting as relayers and compliance providers.   About Panther <p>Panther is a chain-agnostic privacy layer that allows users to access DeFi privately and compliantly, maintaining control of their transactional and historical data. Its users can execute transactions and deploy assets across DeFi. Panther’s <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/wip-new-documentation-structure/cryptographic-primitives?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zero-knowledge primitives</a> are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services. Starting July 10th, Panther’s Testnet will be available for voluntary testers.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="http://docs.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Documentation·</a> <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

<p>The Nym core team is closing off the first half of 2023 with some exciting changes to the organisation. Over the past quarter, we have conducted a range of polls and interviews with Nym stakeholders, and we are now implementing the changes needed for us all to gear up for achieving the next major milestones — mass adoption.</p><p>This entails empowering the growing Nym community to contribute with this primary objective. And it entails focusing the organisation into two cross-functional teams to drive adoption: The NymVPN team to enable end-user adoption; and the Nym SDK team to enable B2B adoption, integrations and most importantly, growing the Nym developer community.</p><p>The usability and health of the NYM token is a focus across teams to ensure that the Nym mixnet can grow and be sustainable as it meets&nbsp;demand.</p><p>Some of you will have noticed the phenomenal results of these changes already: our communities have grown by the tens of thousands over the past month and interest in integrating Nym is skyrocketing!</p> So, what is happening exactly? <p>The new structure of Nym core cross functional teams is supporting additional important changes, responding to some of the pain-points that came up in the surveys. There were a few overarching trends, namely: community empowerment, more marketing, improved transparency, clear use-cases and support for the&nbsp;token.</p><p>Each of these areas are being addressed in the following ways…</p> 1 Community empowerment <p>The Nym community is growing, not just in size but also in maturity. It is therefore important that there is something for everyone — ways to contribute and be involved in meaningful ways — whether you are a n00b or a Nymja. In order to facilitate meaningful involvement as well as opportunities for development within the Nym ecosystem here is some of the focus&nbsp;areas:</p>  Community grants&nbsp;program  Regular community activities for all levels and&nbsp;regions  Improved onboarding to Nym mission and technologies  Preparing Shipyard Academy&nbsp;2.0  <p>Furthermore, Nym Head of Communities, Sudo, has been updating the Nym core team on a weekly basis on the excitement, interests, questions and concerns of the community so that there is a continuous, meaningful feedback loop — beyond bug-reports.</p> 2 Marketing <p>Another repeated request in the surveys was for more marketing activities. The core Nym marketing team has had some important hires that have boosted efforts in that area — the results of which are already&nbsp;showing:</p>  Nym <a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">Twitter</a> has doubled from around 60k to more than 120k followers  Nym <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> has seen an additional three thousand community members join, bringing the server to more than&nbsp;12K  The main Nym <a href="https://t.me/nymtech">Telegram</a> group is now nearly&nbsp;23k  <p>Welcome to all the new joiners! Find out more about Nym community channels&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/privacy-loves-company-welcome-to-the-nym-community-59d205e84d09">here</a>.</p> 3 Transparency <p>Some respondents felt there was a lack of transparency on Nym business as well as technical development. In order to address this, Nym core is focusing on the following areas:</p>  Better release notes and changelogs  Swift and clear handling of issues raised on&nbsp;Github  Growing Nym technical community by improving SDKs, docs and developer portal as well as boosting the Devrel team and opening new communication channels on&nbsp;Element.  Maintaining a regular development process — the SDK team is aiming for average weekly&nbsp;releases  Providing regular roadmap updates to the community via a Community Town&nbsp;Hall   4 Use-cases and usability <p>More clear use-cases and improved usability also came up in the survey and interviews. This has led to audience research and persona development. Nym OGs at Pineapple proxy have contributed significantly to this work already via a community grant to develop personas and user requirements for the NymConnect and VPN use-cases. This is happening in collaboration with the Nym UX team, who are delving into UX issues across teams, ensuring a better experience across the protocol, interfaces and&nbsp;website.</p><p>Furthermore, the Nym value proposition is being refined for specific use-cases and ecosystems, from chat apps to the Ethereum, Cosmos and z-cash ecosystems. This is already leading to increasing interest in integrations by wallets as well as for validator privacy.</p> 5 NYM&nbsp;token <p>Finally, pain points around the usability of the token came up a number times in the survey. The availability of the token and in particular bridging between ERC20 and native NYM tokens was mentioned a few times. And here is what we are doing about&nbsp;it:</p>  Focusing on new listings to support token availability  Exploring how to support better transfers of tokens across&nbsp;chains  More guides on Nym utility and token economics including moving across&nbsp;chains  Support for Side protocol partnership  <p>The next half a year many of these changes will come into fruition, with the aim of growing a flourishing privacy ecosystem!</p><p><a href="https://mailchi.mp/fc43409ced76/nym-newsletter-july-2023?">Read the Nym newsletter</a> for more updates from the past&nbsp;month!</p> Join the Nym community <p><a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">Twitter</a> // <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> // <a href="https://t.me/nymtech">Telegram</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dev:nymtech.chat">Element</a></p> These are some of the activities that you will find in the Nym community… <p>Fortnightly Nym DevRel AMAs — Every second Wednesday, the Nym DevRel team jumps on stage to answer community questions about our tech and infrastructure from node runners, developers, and anyone else interested in the nitty gritty of the Nym network.

Over the past month, we’ve made significant strides in decentralising the Nym mixnet both in terms of geo location, and VPS providers.</p><p>In total, over 8M NYM tokens were delegated from the Nym Treasury to the selected nodes earlier this month. Due to the high number of outstanding submissions, instead of the originally planned 25 nodes, 41 participants were onboarded to the program. A warm welcome to&nbsp;all!</p><p>Ongoing Nymja Ambassador Program — Nym’s vision is for a decentralised privacy system that will be operated, sustained and supported by people worldwide. The ambassador program was introduced to reach such talent across the&nbsp;globe.</p><p>‘Nymjas’ are individuals who can grow and nurture the Nym community, closely follow the latest news and events, and co-create a fun, supportive and collaborative environment across all community channels.</p><p>The hunt for new Nymjas is still in full swing!

 Introduction 



<p>Web3, the latest iteration of the internet, is a very hot and current topic of discussion. While still not fully implemented, Web3 is starting to show its potential to disrupt existing trends and systems and create brand new ones.</p>



<p>When it comes to the travel industry, and more specifically, customer loyalty programs, things have been pretty stagnant over the past couple of decades. Air miles and frequent flyer programs are standard fares but haven’t evolved or improved meaningfully. These programs remain highly restricted and centralised, and customers enjoy little or no flexibility.</p>



<p>Web3, with its underlying power to decentralise, tokenise, diversify, and empower the individual/customer thanks to blockchain and other novel technologies, does have a great potential to disrupt customer loyalty programs as we have known them for a very long time.</p>



<p>This article explores the possible applications of web3 to the travel industry, and how web3’s technological traits can improve customer loyalty.</p>



 Customer loyalty programs: historical background 



<p>The Holiday Inn chain introduced the very first customer loyalty program for the hospitality industry in 1983. Originally dubbed ‘Priority Club’, the idea was to keep customers coming back to Holiday Inn establishments by offering rewards and perks for returning customers (the Priority Club was rebranded as IHG Rewards Club in 2013 when the Holiday Inn chain became InterContinental Hotel Group). The idea took off, big time. Soon, all hotel chains introduced similar programs. (Marriott opened its own loyalty program the same year).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The same goes for the travel industry. United Airlines implemented what can be considered the first ‘modern’ frequent-flyer program in 1972. This early iteration awarded flyers commemorative plaques and promotional material. It wouldn’t be until 1979 with Texas International Airlines’s program that actual mileage flown would be used as the basis for a rewards system for travellers.</p>



 Customer loyalty programs: the current state of play 



<p>The short historical background above clearly highlights one fact: customer loyalty programs in the travel industry have been around for a long time, and apart from cosmetic and administrative alterations, the core mechanics have changed little, if at all. Over five decades since their inception, they’re overdue for a quantum evolutionary leap.</p>



<p>Apart from revealing how easily a medical emergency can spread around the world (and how unprepared said world was to deal with it), the covid-19 pandemic caused a tectonic shift for many things. From the way people work, to how travel is perceived, there’s a clear before/after. The travel industry collapsed, for starters, with many airlines and travel companies going out of business entirely. In the wake of such era-defining events, customer attitudes changed dramatically, and consequently, existing and long-standing customer loyalty programs became almost obsolete in a relatively short period of time.</p>



<p>The world has now come out at the other end of the pandemic, but brands need to recognise that this is a new era and that they need to adapt and evolve their customer loyalty strategy if they’re to retain/expand their customer base.</p>



<p>This is where web3 can become the key factor.</p>



 How can web3 improve customer loyalty in the travel industry? 



<p>The web is evolving. Now arguably in its third iteration (web3), the new web is decentralised. Powered by technologies such as blockchain, and leveraging the power of cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and self-sovereign identity (SSI), <a href="https://zaisan.io/web3-explained/">web3</a> opens up a whole new constellation of possibilities.</p>



<p>Web3 is all-encompassing, meaning all aspects of the web experience will be enhanced in one way or another. When it comes to customer loyalty programs, web3 can become a great disruptor and innovator. The very nature of blockchain as a secure, transparent, and immutable technology can establish the basis for a far more efficient and customer-centric experience.</p>



<p>Blockchain-based customer loyalty programs benefit in multiple ways:</p>



 
 Better security: Blockchain technology features cryptographic security, which is way stronger and more robust than security methods found in previous iterations of the web. Furthermore, the native permission management systems found in most blockchains allow for better management of access. 



 Transparency: In traditional customer loyalty programs, the customer might not have always been able to view or track their rewards in real-time or at all. This may lead to reduced trust in the brand and the program itself. Blockchain enables real-time tracking and visualisation of rewards. 



 Reward portability: Customer loyalty programs have, for decades, worked in siloed form. In other words, the rewards accrued in any given program are only good for that program. The customer cannot move them elsewhere. This restricts freedom of choice and prevents the customer from accessing other ecosystems where their rewards may also yield benefits. Web3 disrupts this paradigm by enabling reward portability, maybe in the form of NFTs, which could be utilised and redeemed across multiple systems. This portability adds an immense amount of value to the rewards, and the brand itself. 



 Reduced costs: Smart contracts enable secure, traceable, and transparent transactions that are much cheaper than current bank-based transactions. Blockchain technology eliminates all middlemen, which means the elimination of all the fees taken by all the middlemen along the transaction’s path. 



 Frictionless environment: The web3 wallet becomes the centrepiece of the rewards experience. Rewards are credited and redeemed from the same wallet, which creates a very streamlined and efficient rewards journey. 



 Freedom to exit the program at any time: Current loyalty programs tend to ‘lock’ the customer into one single provider. This usually means that the customer cannot dispose of the rewards until a certain period of time has elapsed, or certain conditions are met, or both. Within a web3 rewards ecosystem, the customer may be able to sell or trade rewards at any time. 
 



 The challenges of implementing web3 in the travel industry 



<p>Web3 is a relatively new concept, as are the technologies underpinning it. Consequently, development and implementation are far from standard or battle-tested. There remain many unanswered questions about data privacy, regulatory issues, and of course, adoption.</p>







<p>Let’s look at some of these yet unanswered questions, and some lingering challenges.</p>



 Data privacy 



<p>The handling of personal information is presently the subject of thorough scrutiny, following several high-profile incidents over the last couple of decades that saw millions of personal accounts become compromised. Data is the lifeblood of the digital age, and so companies must ensure they protect their users’ privacy and comply with all existing regulations.</p>



<p>Web3’s based on the decentralisation and transparency afforded by blockchain technology. But these two factors, while they enable protection against major hacking events, do spark concerns about the privacy of the data being handled. For example, the very nature of blockchain technology means that information cannot be altered or destroyed, once it becomes immutable on-chain. Because of decentralisation, no single authority exists to even take on the responsibility of erasing data, should this become necessary due to legal issues, for example. Such conflict may lead to compliance problems across one or many jurisdictions.</p>



 Regulatory issues 



<p>While web3 is likely to disrupt many paradigms, the new web must still remain a lawful environment. Any companies, either startups or long-established firms embracing web3 concepts and technologies, must be compliant if they’re to thrive, evolve, and remain in business!</p>



<p>The responsibility to establish a lawful web3 environment is two-pronged: on one side, regulators must create clearly defined frameworks for digital asset management entities, startups, and entrepreneurs to follow and abide by. On the other side, these same entities, startups, and entrepreneurs must implement the necessary measures to comply with regulations. This may require hiring specialised lawyers or firms with a proven track record in the field. <a href="https://zaisan.io/services/">Zaisan</a> is one such company, for example.</p>



 Adoption 



<p>Customer loyalty programs have existed for a long time, as we have seen. Because of this, practices, systems, and sentiments may have become deeply rooted, and the desire to change may be weak, or legacy systems may be hard or expensive to upgrade.</p>



<p>Still, as mentioned above, the covid-19 pandemic did signify a seismic shift in many aspects of life, with travel habits being particularly impacted. Web3’s new technologies may introduce a far more efficient way to manage customer loyalty.</p>



 Fierce competition 



<p>Following the lead of Holiday Inn, most other hotel chains followed suit and created their own versions. Same goes for the air miles/frequent flyer. Because most hotel chains/airlines use these programs, competition is intense, which means it’s harder for the business to gain new customers or retain existing ones, and it’s even harder for the actual customers to decide which loyalty program to sign up for.</p>



 Shifting customer preferences 



<p>Another considerable challenge is the always-changing customer preferences. Times change, and so do market trends, and consequently, customer behaviour. The pandemic only accelerated these issues, but this evolution is largely unavoidable, so it’s up to the brands themselves to adapt their programs to new trends, choices, and needs. For example, customers may want experiences tailored to them based on the personal information provided. Customers may choose one brand over another if said brand is able to offer personalised experiences and rewards, for example, rather than a ‘one-reward-fits-all’ approach.</p>



 Examples of real-life Web3 cases in the travel industry 



<p>Though web3 is still an evolving concept, some companies actively embrace its potential and make significant strides in integrating web3 technologies into the travel industry. Here are a few real-life examples of companies that are leveraging web3 in travel environments:</p>



 
 Chain4travel: <a href="https://chain4travel.com/">Chain4travel</a> has developed Camino, a web3-powered travel ecosystem that utilises blockchain technology. Camino aims to create a decentralised marketplace where travellers can book flights, accommodations, and other travel services directly with providers, cutting out intermediaries and reducing costs. 



 WindingTree: <a href="https://windingtree.com/">WindingTree</a> is a blockchain-based platform that builds decentralised solutions specifically for the travel industry. By leveraging web3 technologies, WindingTree aims to facilitate direct connections between travel suppliers (such as hotels and airlines) and consumers, eliminating the need for traditional intermediaries and reducing fees. 



 TravelIX: TravelIX focuses on tokenising airline tickets, providing a web3-based system for digitising and managing flight bookings. By tokenising airline tickets, TravelIX aims to enhance the travel industry’s transparency, security, and efficiency. This approach allows for seamless ticket transactions and provides travellers with greater control over their bookings. 
 



<p>These companies exemplify the growing interest and exploration of web3 technologies in the travel industry, demonstrating the potential for enhanced efficiency, transparency, and customer experiences through the adoption of web3 principles.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>The web is evolving, and will probably keep evolving for as long as the web exists. Web3 is the next iteration, bringing blockchain-based technologies and decentralisation to the ecosystem.</p>



<p>The travel industry (and by extension, customer loyalty programs) may benefit greatly from these technological advances. Web3 can improve customer loyalty by giving customers greater control over their data, more personalised experiences, and enhanced rewards programs, for instance.</p>



<p>But these are just some of web3’s potential applications for the travel industry. Blockchain remains a relatively new technology, and its adoption is still far from widespread in this particular sector. Future use cases may involve blockchain-based digital passports or tokenised rewards. The bottom line is that web3 is here. The technology is happening, and the travel industry can only become better because of it. </p>

<p>In May, <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ecc-restructuring-to-better-serve-zcash/">Zooko announced that ECC had restructured</a> to better serve the interests of Zcash while reducing costs and increasing sustainability of the organization. In that post, he summarized two categories of our efforts moving forward: further increasing Zcash decentralization and focusing ECC. This post is intended to provide more detail and an update on our current plans. We welcome the community’s feedback.&nbsp;</p>



 Increasing Zcash decentralization 



<p>Our objective in the further decentralization of Zcash is to meaningfully improve Zcash’s resilience without unduly increasing centralization risk. An example of a change that would not improve resilience would be transferring responsibility to the Zcash Foundation (ZF). Because ZF manages the Zcash trademark, its Zcash Community Advisory Panel, and the Zcash Community Forum, and because they now offer their own consensus node (Zebra), adding more reliance on ZF would not make Zcash more resilient against single points of failure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Transitioning some of the work ECC owns, or has owned in the past, to others in the community will:</p>



 
 Increase Zcash sustainability and resilience, through a greater distribution of responsibility 



 Increase goodwill and accountability with the community 



 Increase opportunities for others who have demonstrated reliable participation in the ecosystem 



 Free ECC to focus on improvements to the project that we are uniquely qualified to deliver 
 



<p>This process will take time, as ECC develops and rolls out mechanisms to ensure functions transition smoothly and safely to trusted members in the community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Transitioning some responsibilities may seem counterintuitive, as ECC’s existence depends on Zcash community funding. However, it is precisely because our funding comes from the community that we are bound to honor the best interests of ZEC holders with good stewardship and leadership.</p>



 Focusing ECC 



<p>Our mission is to empower all people with economic freedom, and our “North Star” is delivering a world class UX for ZEC. In the near to mid term, <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ecc-restructuring-to-better-serve-zcash/">as announced,</a> we are focused on empowering ZEC holders and giving them a voice.</p>



<p>This specifically includes the following objectives:</p>



 
 Create an excellent user experience for proof-of-stake ZEC 



 Build and support a commercial wallet — built by and for Zcashers — that is easy to use and accessible for anyone 



 Build and support a mobile-wallet SDK that is useful to other Zcash builders 



 Ensure ZEC, self-custody, and staking remain viable in the USA through focused policy work 
 



 Timeline and specifics 



<p>ECC uses an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectives_and_key_results">OKR process</a> for prioritizing and delivering measurable work on four-month cycles. Typically, our terms are: February – May (Term 1), June – September (Term 2), and October – January (Term 3). Due to ECC’s restructuring and our focus on exiting emergency mode, we moved the kickoff date of Term 2 to July 10. Term 3 will kick off, as usual, in October.</p>



 Term 2, 2023 



<p>The priorities set for the remainder of Term 2 are:</p>



<p>Before the end of July</p>



 
 Exit emergency mode 



 Release the <a href="https://z.cash/">Z.cash</a> website, version 3.0 (completed) 



 Release the new ECC SDKs (iOS and Android), version 1.0 



 Release the new ECC commercial wallet, version 1.0 



 Release version 0.1 of our proof-of-stake design recommendations 
 



<p>The lionshare of our immediate focus remains on <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/update-addressing-zcash-wallet-performance-issues/">exiting “emergency mode,”</a> which we anticipate will be possible this month, depending on how quickly wallets are able to integrate with our new SDK.</p>



<p>The new ECC SDKs will support pre-sync fund availability.</p>



<p>ECC’s wallet will be announced and made available for early testing. This release will be a professional, but no-frills, basic wallet that will serve as the foundation on which to meet the specific needs and wants of Zcashers. We will drive feature development based on ZEC user feedback. Future wallet features might include such things as ZEC holder polling and staking functions, for example.</p>



<p>Our research team will publish a top-level roadmap and proposed timeline to move Zcash from proof of work to a hybrid solution, and then potentially pure proof of stake. We’ll publish this information this month and then host a workshop at Zcon4 to continue the discussion. This version 0.1 proposal is an early step in the design process, published specifically to garner feedback and collaboration across the Zcash ecosystem, and to ensure this significant transition proposal is well understood and addresses community needs.</p>



<p>August – September (Remainder of Term 2)</p>



<p>We intend to pause new development efforts on PoS research and commercial wallet and SDK development in order to focus on decentralization activities. Our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectives_and_key_results">OKR</a> planning for the remainder of Term 2 will be focused on:</p>



 
 Clearly defining the specific use cases where ECC will focus 



 Identifying use cases well suited for decentralization, to improve resilience and sustainability 



 Mapping out the transition between ECC support and end-of-support for specific use cases (i.e., Do we stop working on these things completely, wrap them up, and/or transition them to others?) 



 Meta transition planning where appropriate, including how to identify and safely transition responsibilities to other Zcash contributors 



 Beginning the transitions 
 



<p>Some efforts will be relatively swift, as is the case with ending ECC support for global regulatory relations. Others will take more time, including the transition of some functions currently supported by ECC in Zcashd (pending final determination of which use cases ECC will continue to support). Others may take significant planning and time, due to complexities and in order to minimize any disruption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One such complex decentralization effort referenced in the restructuring announcement is the management of digital properties. This includes the z.cash website, the Zcash Twitter account, Zcash.readthedocs.io, and the Cypherpunk Zero assets. Our objective is to empower the community to contribute to, help steward, and better utilize these assets over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The stewardship of these digital properties, platforms, and assets are incredibly important and complex, so transition efforts will take considerable time and diligence to execute safely and in a way that will foster the best possible outcomes. In these cases, we believe “meta transition planning” is most appropriate. We have been studying this for many months and will provide a recommended approach to the community in a blog post next week. We have requested that the Zcash Foundation provide ECC with time and space for community engagement on this topic at Zcon4, with an intent to begin approach and planning efforts in August. We look forward to working with qualified members of the community on this effort and will provide more detail soon.</p>



 October – January (Term 3, 2023/24) 



<p>Much of the decentralization efforts, formalized in Term 2, will occur during these months. As we are able to wind down and transition work, we will turn our attention back to new research and development on the ECC defined focus areas. As previously stated, some transitions may be quick, and some may require months to years.</p>



 February and beyond (Term 1, 2024 – ) 



<p>While we focus our research and development efforts as stated above, we will roll out updated roadmaps and plans based on the funding available to ECC under the current development fund, which ends in November 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The community is currently discussing the possibility of a new development fund and possible structures. When we gain clarity on the effort and time needed to decentralize core capabilities, we intend to provide a proposal to the community on what we plan to accomplish and at what level of funding over another term.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Further decentralizing Zcash by focusing ECC’s efforts on fewer things is a meaningful contribution to the project and ZEC holders in support of our mission. It will result in a more diverse group of contributors and set up ECC to iterate on new innovation, more quickly and less expensively, by focusing on those areas we are uniquely qualified to deliver.</p>



<p>I look forward to seeing you at Zcon4! Please grab me for some time there if you’d like to explore any of this in more detail.</p>

<p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>During the last month, we finished our documentation, v1 Testnet launch plans, reached a new milestone in our decentralization, and published our new site.</p><p>Here’s a rundown of everything that happened in the month of June.</p> Tech Updates  v1 Testnet <p>Our v1 Testnet launch plan has been delivered internally, and we are preparing explanations, content, and user guides for its go-live.</p><p>As v1 progresses, core components, such as smart contracts, circuits, and in-browser zk-proof generation systems have been delivered, and the team is now tending to UI/UX configuring. The first version of the subgraph was also successfully deployed this month, along with new integrations at a protocol level, such as zAccounts, which will be covered in depth as we expand our documentation, as well as a frontend service layer. The dApp was also updated to support new binary trees.</p> Upgrading Panther’s documentation <p>This month, we also finished the first version of Panther’s <a href="http://docs.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">new documentation</a>, which will be continuously improved and expanded as the protocol develops.</p><p>With our v1 about to go live, this documentation aims to give users a detailed overview of every aspect of Panther Protocol. It also features a section detailing cryptographic elements used by Panther, and provides further insight into some of v1’s components, such as the following diagram detailing zTrade’s user flow</p>zTrade user flow.<p>For a deeper look into the new additions, visit our new documentation at <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">docs.pantherprotocol.io</a>.</p> Governance <p>We reached a new milestone towards decentralization through PIP-15, which successfully passed with an overwhelming approval. Initially, PIP-15 was introduced as a routine procedure to renew Panther's Admin and Authors for Snapshot set by PIP-8. However, for the first time, the Admin and Author roster was updated to have community members take full ownership, with no core Panther contributors featured in these roles.</p><p>This comes on the heels of our formalized governance framework and the introduction of our new DAO Council members, and propels us further along the path to decentralization.</p>Panther Improvement Proposal #15<p>Following the approval of PIP-14, we also provided an overview of the procedure for submitting a Panther Improvement Proposal (PIP). <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther/status/1664534512825507841?s=20&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">The thread</a> sheds light on the journey from conception to final implementation.</p> Multi-compliance vendors <p>The Panther community, along with some team members, is now publicly brainstorming the next steps for regulatory compliance, introducing the topic of multi-compliance vendors. Interestingly, PureFi, one of the discussed vendors, has now also engaged the <a href="https://forum.pantherprotocol.io/t/regulatory-compliance/90/17?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">discussion</a> to evaluate strengths and weaknesses of different projects.</p>Community Discourse Thread on Compliance<p>Panther’s mission is to facilitate compliance DeFi access that preserves users’ privacy, and this discussion represents the protocol’s first steps into decentralized compliance, a fastly-developing field.</p> Testnet incentives <p>The Panther community is also now actively discussing v1 Testnet incentives. Join the discussion on our Discourse forum: <a href="https://forum.pantherprotocol.io/t/v1-testnet-incentives/298?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">https://forum.pantherprotocol.io/t/v1-testnet-incentives/298</a></p>Head of Product Saif Akhtar shares some insights about Testnet incentives Ecosystem <p>This month, we presented <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">our new website</a> in a milestone mission to simplify Panther by clearly defining its components.</p><p>We're demystifying Panther and its design for institutional and retail users alike!

<p>The software movement around blockchains often called crypto or web3 has evolved models for democratic governance, interweaving civic and corporate governance traditions in a way that was previously impossible: Public goods and private incentives are entwined. Projects can be open source and for-profit. Customers are also owners. </p><p>web3 governance also has radically open participation and rapid execution. Not only is a new form of digital participation emerging — but it also features widespread experimentation and continuous, fast cycles of iteration. In other words: web3 is a new laboratory for governance. So what can we all learn from it?</p> Feature: What we can learn from the history and evolution of governance  <p>Direct democracy sometimes leads to low participation and concerns about weak oversight, interest-group capture, and group decision-making. However, there’s room for borrowing best practices from the history of governance systems here. While web3 may be new, governance isn’t; these are the same governance challenges societies and organizations have experienced for millennia — spanning the cradles of the Athenian Ecclesia to the rise of the Dutch East India Company to the modern United States. </p><p>Tensions between competing imperatives — such as empowering experts vs. encouraging broad participation, creating open systems vs. capture of those systems by non-aligned actors — have always loomed large. What can we learn from this history, applying hard-learned lessons from democracy and corporate governance to build more effective political systems? In this piece, Andrew Hall (Stanford professor and our frequent collaborator) + Porter Smith (a16z crypto partner focused on governance) explore key challenges in decentralized governance… and offer a path to decentralized governance systems of the future.<br>📜📃 <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/lightspeed-democracy-what-web3-organizations-can-learn-from-the-history-of-governance/">read more</a></p><p>see also: <br>▶️ 🖥  <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/videos/the-evolution-of-decentralized-governance/">The Evolution of Governance</a>, with Andy Hall </p> Resources &amp; views: on designing governance, best practices, lessons learned <p>Massive, centralized web2 organizations have become the internet’s “accidental monarchs”, ruling our online lives with iron fists, argue Andy Hall and Porter Smith. But web3 governance — if built thoughtfully and in a way that reflects lessons from the history of governance — offers an embedded foundation of credible trust for building the next generation of platforms. <br>📝 📖 <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/toppling-the-internets-accidental-monarchs-how-to-design-web3-platform-governance">read more</a></p><p>Tracing innovations in governance through time, Porter Smith tracks the recent emergence of web3 governance through NFT communities, DAOs, and more in this recent talk on Designing Effective Governance from a16z Crypto Startup School 2023.<br>▶️🖥  <a href="https://youtu.be/niOyn2Rw6tw">watch here</a> </p><p>How to encourage more participation in governance? Game theory has a lot to say about what’s possible and what’s not. In this contributed article, Ethan Bueno de Mesquita (University of Chicago) and Andy Hall observe that <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/the-cryptoeconomics-of-slashing/">slashing</a> or rewarding participants for voting with the majority can be prohibitively expensive. But there may be a way to actually <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/paying-people-to-participate-in-governance/">pay voters</a> for reporting how costly they find it to vote — and then <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/the-problem-with-slashing-or-majority-rewards/">pay</a> the subset that finds it the least costly — to encourage more informed participation in decentralized governance.<br>📝 📖 <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/the-problem-with-slashing-or-majority-rewards/">read more</a></p> Applications: for decentralization in crypto, and beyond  Bringing decentralized governance to tech platforms <p>One of the main promises of web3 is helping platforms create governance systems in ways that people believe are fair and legitimate — while also getting more (and better) output from developers, creators, sellers, and other producers on a given platform. So in this talk originally delivered in our a16z crypto research seminar series, Stanford professor Andy Hall offers a political-economy perspective on the governance failures inherent in web2 platform structures. Hall also proposes ideas for how web2 platforms can use techniques from web3/ decentralized governance to address such problems, drawing on his experience working in social media. <br>▶️🖥  <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/videos/bringing-decentralized-governance-to-tech-platforms/">watch here</a></p> How the U.S. can rewire the Pentagon for a new era  <p>Defense innovation has always sparked a helix of action and reaction — where faster evolution means greater success — but we are in an accelerated such moment today: As general computing platforms become applicable to a host of defense applications, sweeping advances in software and other technologies not originally designed for defense have unintentionally compounded computing’s impact on war. We are in the early stages of a generational defense cycle that requires unconventional thinking, new tools, and emerging tech. Responding to such a paradigm shift requires re-engineering U.S. defense DNA for a new era, observes Porter Smith (also former U.S. military). </p><p>The winner of the next big war will more closely resemble a distributed computer operating at scale: programmatically collecting, sharing, and acting upon data from relatively inexpensive and configurable endpoints (like drones). But computing design and organizational principles honed in the tech industry — particularly decentralized systems — can help provide guidance to meet the challenge. <br>📝 📖 <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/decentralization-for-defense/">read more</a></p><p><br>*July 4th special edition*<br>-- Sonal Chokshi, Tim Sullivan, and a16z crypto teams<br><br>You’re receiving this newsletter because you signed up for it on our websites, at an event, or elsewhere (you can opt out any time using the ‘unsubscribe’ link below).

It combines public and private execution into a single zkRollup, providing seamless composability across encrypted and unencrypted transactions.</p><p>Previously, a <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect/tree/b13a58f439cab0e87062f0567896d8665d9c12a0/yarn-project/nym-gateway">Proof of Concept integration was done with Aztec Connect</a>, Aztec’s privacy infrastructure that served as the encryption layer for Ethereum. Following its sunset and being fully open sourced out, Aztec has focused on the development of a next-generation layer 2&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Scaling problem with private blockchains</p><p>This integration partnership with Nym will solve a major component of the privacy stack for&nbsp;Aztec.</p><p>To be a private blockchain, all states must be end-to-end encrypted which includes a massive pool of commitment and encrypted note preimages. Information such as assets, values and sender data is needed for you to spend the&nbsp;note.</p><p>You will need to acquire the state that belongs to you in an unencrypted form and also obtain the global public state to prove ownership of selective parts.</p><p>Aztec Connect previously used trial decryption to overcome this, which involved downloading both global private and public chain data. This approach however has a scaling&nbsp;issue.</p><p>The state becomes more extensive which makes trial decryption inefficient and there is no existing single solution.</p><p>In comparison in the Web2 world, you could simply ask the server what belongs to you. This does not work for private blockchains as the server would require your private keys, which should not be compromised.</p><p>Privacy leak in the public&nbsp;state</p><p>The public state is of course more open and consists of commitments in the Merkle trees. This means that there are no security concerns on private&nbsp;keys.</p><p>The public state does not require decryption as there are no preimages visible and it contains all the commitments as&nbsp;hashes.</p><p>However, when someone provides the public state, privacy information is inadvertently leaked. Sophisticated bad actors could potentially triangulate who owns what parts of the state by combining this information with network&nbsp;data.</p><p>Nym CEO Harry Halpin says, “From preventing MEV to DDoS attacks, you need network-level privacy and Nym is happy to provide these cutting-edge capabilities to Aztec. Using zero-knowledge systems for privacy makes no sense without network privacy from Nym, it’s like wearing a face mask but forgetting to put on your&nbsp;pants.”</p><p>The Nym mixnet plays an important role to solve&nbsp;this.</p><p>How the Nym mixnet protects the public&nbsp;state</p><p>By routing requests through the Nym mixnet, identifying information including location and IP address are obscured and anonymises requests.</p><p>The server thus receives an anonymous request for a specific portion of the public state and privacy is preserved.</p><p>Your encrypted notes remain separate from this request and the server is unable to provide&nbsp;them.</p><p>The linkability issue in public state is thus resolved. Transaction profiling, which is a concern when privacy is compromised, is prevented from happening.</p><p>The importance of infrastructure privacy</p><p>Nym’s role in the privacy stack is more necessary than ever. This crucial role of enhancing privacy at the network level, which is below the level of even a protocol, is the only way to protect users and developers from being vulnerable to targeted&nbsp;attacks.</p><p>By anonymizing requests and securing public state access, Nym strengthens privacy in the blockchain ecosystem, which has a major privacy&nbsp;problem.</p><p>Privacy partnerships</p><p>Nym and Aztec are core members of the <a href="https://privacyalliance.com/">Universal Privacy Alliance (UPA)</a>, which was formed to advance the understanding of privacy as the very basis of free and flourishing digital societies.</p><p>One of the unifying principles of UPA is that “privacy by design is essential”. A holistic approach to privacy protection is necessary when designing and implementing blockchain solutions. User privacy should remain a top priority and not as an afterthought. Privacy by design will prevent any chance of attacks like MEV and&nbsp;DDos.</p><p>This partnership between Nym and Aztec is just a first step towards full-stack privacy.</p><p>With the right combination of technologies and a commitment to user-centric privacy, we can build a more secure and confidential decentralized future together.</p> Resources   <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nym-wallet/">Download Nym&nbsp;wallet</a>  <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">Mixnet explorer</a>  <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/introduction.html">Docs</a>  <a href="https://github.com/notrustverify/awesome-nym">Awesome Nym tooling by the community</a>   Join Nym Community <p><a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">Twitter</a> // <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> // <a href="https://t.me/nymtech">Telegram</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dev:nymtech.chat">Element</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-partners-with-aztec-to-provide-integral-infrastructure-privacy-in-ethereum-chains-694963c55192">Nym partners with Aztec to provide integral infrastructure privacy in Ethereum chains</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Why release a transparency report? 



<p>Electric Coin Co. is committed to openness and transparency — as we help evolve and support the Zcash digital currency, and in support of our mission to empower people with economic freedom. This transparency report details company income, expenses, and use of funds during Q4 2022.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Key takeaways</p>



 
 Bootstrap received coins at a value below the ECC operating-expense level for Q4 2022. During this time, Bootstrap received coins at an average of $330,000 a month (at the Q4 average ZEC price, $43, for each of the three months’ distribution dates), and Bootstrap and ECC incurred average monthly expenses of approximately $698,000. 



 At the end of Q4 2022, Bootstrap and ECC collectively held approximately $1.5M in USD and approximately 126.3K ZEC. As of June 22, 2023, the company held approximately $767K in USD and approximately 98K ZEC.

<p>Circle recently responded to the Bank of England’s consultation paper discussing the Bank’s objectives and proposals for a UK Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), or a “digital pound”. In its response, Circle noted that well-regulated, privately-issued payment stablecoins can and are fulfilling the need for digital forms of money in the 21st century.&nbsp;</p>

      Open-Sourcing the Future of AI         
	By Sam Eifling	 



Photography: James Jackman



Published June 29, 2023
        Hugging Face’s Clement Delangue, the man behind the emoji, pushes AI to rewrite old rules.      



 
<p>In a fit of pique, Clem Delangue began live-tweeting. He was packed inside a lecture hall at the University College in Dublin, where Delangue was continuing a hopscotch of study abroad posts, from his full-time university in Paris, to Madrid, to Bangalore, and now in the fall of 2011 to Ireland. “Peter O’Neill, Country General Manager for IBM Ireland on stage @ucddublin for a guest lecture,” he typed, and <a href="https://twitter.com/ClementDelangue/status/123744930748317698">hit tweet</a>. It was 9:01 AM on a Tuesday. Everyone was facing the same direction, hunched over notebooks and laptops. Delangue, frustrated to be staring silently at the backs of heads, was doing his best to tweet his way to some kind of connection.</p>



<p>Lectures like this, with hundreds of students taking identical notes, struck Delangue as a hived-off relic of pre-internet thinking. “Why would we be doing that,” he thought, “without sharing with each other. Without sharing externally?” They weren’t just missing out on collaboration within the room; they were also missing an opportunity to share insights with a community of students around the world who could only dream of such an education.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Back in his dorm that night, Delangue began work on a solution to what he considered to be a fundamental, unjust bottleneck in how learning is distributed worldwide. The following summer, a 23-year-old Delangue was on a stage in Paris, delivering <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWRn3W8QI_0">a TEDx Talk</a> about his platform, UniShared—his effort to connect classmates and offer the benefits of a college education to everyone on the planet. “The classroom is a bubble,” he told that audience in Paris. “Whereas it should be a place for openness to the world, to others. I’ve never felt so isolated than in a classroom.”</p>



 



<p>Delangue knows a thing or two about isolation. Years before he created his open-source education software, Delangue’s world didn’t extend much beyond the borders of La Bassée, his home town on the Northern tip of France, that Delangue remembers as “remote, with barely anything to do.” The third child of four to a nurse and a lawnmower shop owner, Delangue always felt that he played the role of connector and peacekeeper in his family. Travel was a challenge, logistically and financially, with a family of six, so Delangue’s opportunities for exploration were limited. That is, until the internet arrived. “When I got my first computer,” he remembers, “it was kind of like a window into the rest of the world that was, you know, mind-blowing.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not only did the internet expand Delangue’s horizons, it also created opportunities for the budding entrepreneur that the ‘real’ world simply couldn’t. Online, he and his older brother set up shop on eBay and sold hundreds of imported ATVs and motorbikes. Yet when 16-year-old Delangue stood in his father’s store trying to sell tractors to grown men, he knew they didn’t take him seriously. “The internet was creating new rules for me,” he says.</p>



<p>Clem’s platform, UniShared, didn’t knock the world off its axis (it remains available <a href="https://github.com/UniShared/unishared">as an open source tool</a>). But it did help ensure that when he graduated college in 2012, he had a job offer at Google waiting for him. Ultimately he declined, already feeling more at home in smaller, nimbler environments. He instead went to work for a Paris-based computer vision startup called Moodstocks. The company was building an app that allowed a user to scan an object and immediately see relevant reviews and e-commerce portals. See a book, point your phone at it, and buy it in an instant. This was Delangue’s first flirtation with the then-niche realm of machine learning—and it felt like a revelation.</p>



<p>A chance meeting at a conference in Paris with the famed Apple marketer <a href="https://guykawasaki.com/">Guy Kawasaki</a> cemented for Delangue the power of this tech. Delangue approached Kawasaki as he was signing books (young Delangue is center-frame in <a href="https://youtu.be/bnVTd1cmpIY?t=155">this video</a> of the event) and introduced himself and his app. Kawasaki was skeptical of the technology—specifically its ability to identify random objects in the wild, a revolutionary claim at a time when ML still relied on engineers to specify a relatively short, static list of permitted definitions and rules in order to get accurate results. “He said something like, there’s no way you can create rules to recognize the total of objects in the world,” says Delangue.</p>



<p>So Delangue offered Kawasaki a demo, pointing his smartphone at Kawasaki’s bottle of water. To Kawasaki’s surprise, the app correctly identified the brand and pulled up social reviews, including an effusive comment from one of Delangue’s colleagues at Moodstocks.&nbsp;The true electricity of that moment for Delangue wasn’t just that his app worked. Rather, it was the potential he saw for machine learning to create connections between people in new ways. “The two people who have never met—one French geeky engineer and this American Silicon Valley guy—they discovered, thanks to machine learning, they actually like the same water brand.” Delangue says. To be sure, ML had incredible potential—but even more so when developed with a community of users in mind.</p>
 



Delangue embodies the emoji at Hugging Face HQ in Miami.



 
<p>Clem shows up to our video interview from his home in North Miami Beach wearing a T-shirt with a screen-printed grid of nine images depicting a man mowing the iconic grassy field from the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/27/Bliss_%28Windows_XP%29.png">old Windows XP wallpaper</a>. The pictures were generated, he tells me, by Dall-E Mini, an explosively popular text-to-image AI tool that Delangue also used to explain AI to his father. “I told him, ‘OK, tell me anything, and the AI will make it.’ And he said, ‘a John Deere tractor, on the moon.’” So, father and son got to bond over heavy machinery in space, seemingly placed there by some impossible miracle, or perhaps by a superhuman effort (which, when you consider the technology underlying the image, is not so far from the truth).</p>



<p>It was a swing at the impossible that put Hugging Face on its current trajectory as the home for the world’s largest community of open source AI builders. After leaving Moodstocks in 2012 (four years before Google acquired it), Delangue worked in product and marketing for a handful of startups that all got acquired. By 2016, he was itching to build something for himself again. In New York City he linked up with Julien Chaumond (a computer engineer who was working in France’s economic ministry). He’d known Julien, an elite mathematician and friend with whom he’d had a mutual professional crush, for years. The two decided to take an online Stanford engineering class together, and, true to form, surrounded themselves with a study group of three dozen people. Among them was Thomas Wolf (a trained scientist turned patent lawyer), who played in a band with Julien. By the time the class finished, Julien and Clem had invited Thomas to come work with them.</p>



<p>Together they set out to solve one of the most difficult problems they could identify in the burgeoning field of machine learning: The trio aimed to leverage a technology called natural language processing (NLP) to build an open-domain, conversational AI chatbot. One that could talk with you about anything. Siri had been around since 2011; Alexa, since 2014. “They were extremely boring,” Delangue says. “They would only do productivity stuff. We got excited by the idea of building a fun conversational AI.”&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We got excited by the idea of building a fun conversational AI.”</p>
Clem Delangue</blockquote>



<p>In 2023 that sounds like an attainable—perhaps even obvious—goal. But in 2016, the field of deep learning for NLP (that is, NLP that relied on deep neural networks for learning rather than the statistical, rule-based NLP of the past) was so nascent that their objective was borderline sci-fi. To create the sort of digital companion they were after, the chatbot would have to incorporate multiple learning models, to perform information extraction, to understand sentiment, and to generate answers. And for those models to function, they’d need to train them on unruly quantities of data. Managing that data—figuring out how to gather enough of it, label it, host it—was their first major challenge. Long before Hugging Face could become a nerve center for AI development, it had to address these core difficulties of the ML space.</p>



<p>From the jump, the Hugging Face team displayed a certain spirit of generosity and democracy that positioned them for success. It began with their employees. Delangue and his co-founders empowered them to take ownership of their product, creating and shipping features for their chatbot. Eventually that bot lived on social, mobile and the web, and its users exchanged more than a billion messages. Over time, it embraced an open-source first approach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No moment better encapsulated this ethos than when Hugging Face released its own custom version of an ML model called BERT (short for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). At the time, advances in machine learning tended to arrive via dense, theoretical academic articles. Similarly, when <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">Google first released BERT</a> in October 2018, it was too complex for most users—compounded by the fact that BERT was available only on Google’s TensorFlow platform. The Hugging Face crew decided that BERT needed to be more widely accessible. Within a week, they’d created a working version that used the machine learning framework PyTorch. Then they made their conversion open-source, giving it away on Github to anyone who wanted to use it, or modify it further.</p>



<p>“That was a watershed moment,” says Pat Grady, a Sequoia partner who works with Hugging Face. “People were like, ‘Oh my God, I can use a cutting edge language model.’ It just hadn’t been possible before. That made Hugging Face heroes within what was then the very small community of natural language processing people.” When Grady later asked Delangue what inspired them to release BERT to the world, he was struck by the straightforwardness of his answer. “It just seemed to be something a lot of people would like to use,” Delangue replied.</p>



<p>The response to BERT within the ML community reaffirmed what Delangue had felt years earlier in his lecture hall in Dublin—that sharing knowledge benefits everybody. That’s when the mission at Hugging Face changed. Delangue and his co-founders decided to start sharing everything that they had learned about ML in the process of building their chatbot. Gradually, they started to become a go-to resource for engineers, researchers and hobbyists in the machine learning space.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the process of building their BERT adaptation, Delangue and his team became experts on a new model called a transformer. All AI models are trained on massive amounts of data, and transformers were capable of generating excellent results from unlabeled data (e.g., no longer would a computer vision system need a human to label an image as a cat, as it could learn to identify cats on its own). This form of unsupervised learning saves data curators massive amounts of time, and makes much more data available for training ML systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Hugging Face team saw transformers’ potential and established Hugging Face as the go-to open-source hub to develop them. And the community took note—coders and researchers started flocking to Hugging Face, cross-pollinating an abundance of ML projects and tools with fresh insights and expertise. Today, anyone who wants to build with transformers can access <a href="https://huggingface.co/models">some 200,000 different public models</a> in Hugging Face’s hub.</p>



<p>Delangue realized that given the vast potential of these tools, making sense of them takes a village: people who organize around common goals, needs and values. With their move to open-source, Hugging Face was starting to become the community Delangue had hoped he would someday build.</p>


 
	
							
			
	 

<blockquote>
<p>“We felt like if we started to have community managers, it would be outsourcing a responsibility that all members must keep,”</p>
Clem Delangue</blockquote>

 
 



<p>“It was pretty obvious there was something happening with the company,” says Sequoia Partner Sonya Huang. “Very few people are actually extraordinary at creating communities. Delangue understands the user—he is the user—and he has this intuition for grassroots community. He nurtures it so authentically.”</p>



<p>Huang was also struck by the way Delangue seemed to walk the open-source walk. She notes that instead of hiring a dedicated community manager to interface with Hugging Face’s users, Delangue did it himself, routinely tweeting bug fixes and troubleshooting features with more than 1,000 AI researchers and 10,000 companies chasing AI breakthroughs in biotech, imaging, and language processing.</p>



<p>To this day Hugging Face not only has no single community manager, every one of its 160 employees are expected to be active participants in this online community. “We felt like if we started to have community managers, it would be outsourcing a responsibility that all members must keep,” says Delangue. To that end, every employee has access to the company’s official Twitter and LinkedIn accounts. If the future of AI is to be crowdsourced, Delangue is ensuring that Hugging Face has positioned itself as the source of the crowd.</p>



 



<p>Today, the company is a go-to hub for machine learning. The sheer size of the Hugging Face community feeds the inertia of its strategic position. It has become the place where everyone goes for everything, because it’s the place where everyone goes for everything. For example, when the text-to-image generator <a href="https://stablediffusionweb.com/">Stable Diffusion</a> chose to post its models, datasets and demos to Hugging Face, it lit a flurry of user-led activity to modify and improve the model (yielding such masterpieces in <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusion">their demo space</a> as “<a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusion/discussions/15397">a rubber duck making a political speech at a podium</a>” and “<a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusion/discussions/15334">Pikachu in Pripyat</a>”).</p>



<p>In short order, AI has rocketed. Large language models (LLMs) have evolved from a backend tech underpinning, say, the suggested short replies Gmail offers you, into something more fantastic (and in some cases, frightening). In rapid succession, text-to-image tools and ChatGPT broadened our ideas about what was possible, and ChatGPT became the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/">fastest-growing app in history</a>.</p>



<p>Lookie-loos and tinkerers are flooding into AI by the millions, crowding a space that has long been a speakeasy frequented only by PhDs and engineers. We’re all using AI now, and this mob of end users is about to exert a lot more influence on the entire space—in ways impossible to predict. In Delangue’s view, anyone invested in the future of AI should be part of the community Hugging Face fosters. “If users don’t understand how this technology is built,” he says, “it creates a lot of risks, a lot of misconceptions.”</p>



<p>In Delangue’s view, the concerns over the rise of a yet-hypothetical artificial general intelligence are misplaced. He aligns with the framework that Andrej Karpathy, the former director of AI at Tesla, put forth in 2017, describing AI as <a href="https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35">Software 2.0</a>. In this view, AI is a major advance in how the modern world operates, certainly, and one already shaping the economy. But it’s hardly an understudy for God.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“AI is the new paradigm to build all technology. It’s not more; it’s not less. It’s not a new human form. It’s not Skynet or a super sentient being. But it is something massive.”</p>
Clem Delangue</blockquote>



<p>“AI is the new paradigm to build all technology,” Delangue says. “It’s not more; it’s not less. It’s not a new human form. It’s not Skynet or a super sentient being. But it is something massive. It’s bigger than the internet, and it’s bigger than traditional software. It’s going to create new capabilities for technology. In the same way most technology companies write software, most technology companies will write AI.”</p>



<p>This ear-popping growth has intensified another concern for Delangue—that of values. If machine learning lives up to a fraction of its hype and promise, it risks deepening the biases and mistakes of existing technology. To ensure that Hugging Face remains on an equitable path, Delangue has hired Dr. Margaret Mitchell, a former Google ethicist whose research focuses on bias and fairness in algorithms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the tools rush into the mainstream, Delangue wants them to remain open and democratic. Every Hugging Face employee is expected to hold up the company’s stated values, which Delangue tries to impart not as edicts, but as Socratic nudges, questions he poses every day in the 300-or-so company Slack channels. Users on the site can also give feedback on results the ML models produce, via the “community” tab. You feel like a model produced results that were biased against you because of your race, religion or gender? “Report it,” Delangue says. He believes the more individuals and companies and regulators understand and can participate in machine learning, the safer the future will be from monopolistic control.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Delangue understands that the sheer speed of AI adoption almost guarantees a degree of chaos, which is, in part, why he isn’t after explosive growth for Hugging Face. “Our main goal is not so much to build a big company or to make money,” he says. “I’m most excited about the potential for change and reinventing new rules, new ways of doing things. And the opportunity to use this moment in AI as a reset button, in a way, to do things differently, to push different values.”</p>

<p>Last summer, when Delangue was in Paris for his friend (and Hugging Face investor) Ludovic Huraux’s wedding, the two enjoyed dinner at Huraux’s home in the 2nd Arrondissement. Over drinks (wine for Huraux, water for Clem), the founders asked each other: Does money lead to happiness? Huraux admitted that for him, ever more money did not make him happier. Delangue said that he doesn’t think money changes much, because what makes him happy is the work itself. “He’s quite different from other successful CEOs I’ve met,” Huraux says. “What he really loves is to create this community. This philosophy to see his business growing is a way for him to express himself in the world.”</p>



<p>By way of a comparison, Huraux invokes Albert Camus, a favorite philosopher of Delangue’s. And here we find that to understand Delangue, you must take a short detour through hell. There you’ll observe a mythological mortal named Sisyphus. A bit of a trickster, Sisyphus angered the gods by cheating death. They condemned him to roll a boulder up a mountain, on repeat, forever.</p>



<p>In Camus’ read (made famous in <a href="https://www.fadedpage.com/showbook.php?pid=20160912">his essay</a> Le Mythe de Sisyphe) Sisyphus labors in genuine pain. Yet he nonetheless experiences lightness, even joy, in the moments after the stone rolls back down the mountain. He has no goal but the work; no gods or peers to impress; no money to make; no scorecard of any sort. And as he once again lays hands on that boulder, he finds fulfillment in la lutte elle-même, the struggle itself.</p>



<p>Clem sees a bit of himself in the eternal work of this rule-breaker. “The last sentence in the book,” Delangue tells me, “says you should picture Sisyphus happy. If we compare that to building a company, it means that happiness doesn’t come from being successful. It actually comes from the everyday struggle and endeavor of building one feature after another. Convincing one community member. One step after another. And even the most mundane tasks, you can find joy in them.”</p>



Delangue imagines that his Mythic desk companion is happy.



<p>In March of 2023, Delangue <a href="https://twitter.com/ClementDelangue/status/1633508553875943424">tweeted</a> that he was holding an impromptu get-together with Hugging Face users on <a href="https://twitter.com/ClementDelangue/status/1633508553875943424">an upcoming trip to San Francisco</a>. Within a few hours, <a href="https://twitter.com/ClementDelangue/status/1634191799919976449">more than 400 people</a> registered using the password he’d shared in a tweet: ossftw (open-source software for the win). By the following week, the cat was officially out of the bag. “The buzz is real, and we’ve just expanded capacity of the meetup to match it (from 300 to 1,000!),” the main Hugging Face account <a href="https://twitter.com/huggingface/status/1635629873598468098">tweeted</a>. Two weeks later, an engineer at Hugging Face <a href="https://twitter.com/osanseviero/status/1640815157793239042">added</a>: “What’s better than a meetup of 2000 people? A meetup of 2500 of course!”</p>



<p>You may be asking how anyone holds a get-together for anywhere between 400 to 2,500 people on short notice, in San Francisco. The answer includes: Signing a venue as late as possible. Haggling with multiple caterers who drop out, looking into the number of pizzerias within a 25-mile radius, then eventually settling for a couple of thousand macarons to feed everyone. Also, you’ll want to have someone sew a Hugging Face mascot costume in just 24 hours. Finally, you’ll need to call every <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/llama">llama farm</a> in California (a nod to LLaMA, or Large Language Model Meta AI) and then check for state and city regulations about camelids in public spaces.</p>



<p>By the time of the event, it had earned the moniker “Woodstock of AI” (and the accompanying <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WoodstockAI?src=hashtag_click">#WoodstockAI</a> hashtag). Some 5,000 people (and three llamas) showed up to the Exploratorium science museum. Videos from the event capture something reminiscent of a rave crossed with a robotics competition. AI companies jammed into booths. One of them, an <a href="https://twitter.com/ReadPandaOrg">AI-in-education company</a> that formed during a hackathon just a few days earlier, had their public launch at the event. Delangue <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewRogers/status/1642240986108796928">danced with a mascot</a> in bright yellow tights and an enormous Hugging Face emoji body. He gave a shout-out to everyone who has pushed AI forward (so, pretty much the whole crowd). “This event is a celebration of the power of open source,” Delangue told them. “It’s really important for us to remember in AI that we are where we are because of open science and open source.”</p>



<p>If you didn’t make this one, don’t sweat it. Delangue loves bringing people together, so you can be sure this event won’t be his last. And as always, when the next one comes around, everyone’s invited.</p>

  Bending the Arc: Founders Share Their Journeys  <p>As we close out the latest session of Arc, Sequoia’s catalyst for pre-seed and seed-stage founders, three alumni reflect on what brought their companies to this moment—and what comes next.</p>   
	By Team Sequoia	 



Published June 29, 2023
  



 
<p>Last week, we were thrilled to welcome the second cohort of <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/arc/">Arc</a> Europe to our Menlo Park office for the culmination of their seven-week company design curriculum. As they prepared to present their company stories to our community of partners, founders, customers and talent, we sat down with a few founders from the group—Anant Kapoor and Eric Daoud Attoyan of <a href="https://guided.energy/">Guided Energy</a> and Samuel Colvin of <a href="https://pydantic.dev/">Pydantic</a>—to talk about the journey of building their companies, including through Arc itself.</p>



 



<p>Tell us about the problems you’re solving, and the journey to creating your companies.</p>



<p>Anant: We’re building a platform to help fleets operate electric vehicles. Because of regulation and other incentives, there’s a huge push right now toward EVs, and companies are setting ambitious targets for decarbonization. But at the operations level, things are breaking down. Fleet managers suddenly have to deal with fluctuating grids, variable pricing, and nonlinear battery curves that change based on demand and location and weather. Their legacy systems just don’t work, and they end up with higher costs and lower per-vehicle revenue than they expected.</p>



<p>I’d built software for fleets and seen those struggles firsthand. Then Eric and I met at Entrepreneur First in Paris, and we had a hunch that the research he was doing could help.</p>



<p>Eric: Right—my background is in data science and machine learning, and before Guided Energy I’d gone back to academia and done a PhD applying ML to oncology care. I knew I wanted to work on climate change because it’s one of the biggest challenges we face. Anant and I realized if we combined his knowledge of EV fleets with my resource allocation and optimal transport algorithms, we could accelerate the transition to electrification.</p>



<p>Samuel: Pydantic started as an open-source data validation library, and earlier this year we launched a company to build great cloud services. Our founding principle is that the right interface—whether it’s an API, or UI, or even a language—solves a whole host of problems before they occur. By putting developer experience at the center of what we build, we can create a better experience for everyone.</p>



<p>I’ve always been interested in entrepreneurship—I ran a startup previously—and I’d love to pretend I had this grand vision ever since the Pydantic open source package launched in 2017. But the reality is, this wasn’t my plan. I thought I’d release v2 and then go start a company around a different idea that was also close to my heart. The irony is that as<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-montague/"> David</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-garcia-badaracco/"> Adrian</a> and I have started to work out exactly how we want to build Pydantic, what’s bubbled to the top actually has a lot in common with that other idea. It’s funny how these things circle around.</p>



<p>What has the journey through Arc been like?</p>



<p>Samuel: I knew participating in Arc would be a time commitment, and initially I was nervous about that. I have a young daughter, and my partner is also starting a company, so she’s extremely busy. The team is busy, too. But I’m now a complete convert and very glad we did it, even as someone with prior experience running a company.</p>



<p>Arc coincided perfectly with our process of exploring what to build, which culminated in a user<a href="https://pydantic.dev/roadmap/#2-how-you-can-help"> survey</a> that has been enormously valuable. We got the idea from Karri Saarinen, the CEO of Linear, who we visited during Week 4 of Arc in Helsinki; their team had sent some similar questions to a list of early users. We didn’t have a clue how people would react, and it’s been great to see the community’s response—especially because the idea that’s been most popular definitely wasn’t what we thought we’d build first.</p>



<p>I’ve also met lots of inspiring people in this cohort, and made some valuable connections. Eric, for example, helped us with his opinions on technical issues, and also introduced us to some people who we interviewed and who took the survey.</p>



<p>Eric: We’ve had a very similar experience in some ways; so many things we thought we knew about our company have been challenged during Arc. When it started, we were pretty sure we knew who our customers were. But working with the Sequoia team gave us a far deeper understanding of who we are actually helping and how, as well as a clear sense of the questions we should be asking them to get to the bottom of each problem they have.</p>



<p>Anant: Absolutely—it’s been transformational. Something that stands out to me is the way it’s helped us set ambitions for everything we’re doing, across every function of the company. If we think about culture, or recruiting, or communications—there’s a way to 10x each of those things, to do them incredibly well and lead to far better outcomes. It feels like it’s helped us set the bar for what great looks like. And being surrounded by the other members of our cohort, who are also doing that kind of level-setting—it just pulls everybody up.</p>



<p>What do you think you—and other founders at your stage—need on the journey to come?</p>



<p>Eric: Conviction and confidence. We’re convinced now more than ever that we are onto something that can transform an entire industry. And this experience has made us bolder; it’s given us the confidence to move faster. We have an incredible opportunity and don’t want to miss that shot. Plus, I know when we encounter something that’s new to us, we can call on the experience of Sequoia and the other founders in our cohort.</p>



<p>Anant: Yeah, we have more confidence in our ability to execute, which is a big focus right now. We are working with exciting customers, and as we connect thousands of electric vehicles and onboard our first tranche of users, we want to nail the interface between our platform and the fleet managers and drivers who will actually use it.<br><br>Samuel: For us, we need to find product-market fit—to build, and then get the product into the hands of the right people and see if they like it. I learned from Arc to be practical about that process and try to take the emotion out of it. Here’s this awesome, technically interesting thing we really wanted to build—and if it turns out that it doesn’t work well for people, throw it away. When we were in Helsinki, we also visited Supercell, and it struck me how they run as a sort of broad church, with people shifting from team to team, learning from failures, and moving on. That’s how I’d like to run Pydantic. If you build something and it doesn’t work, we’ll celebrate that learning and you can work on something else. And if it does work, that’s amazing, too.</p>

<p>We are at the beginning of a new frontier in biology and medicine unparalleled in human history. Scientific advances like the latest generation of CRISPR, new computational methods, entirely new cell and gene therapies, cell-free synthetic biology and breakthroughs we cannot even imagine today will unlock the applications and treatments of the future. At the same time, new technology/tooling is changing the biology game along a few vectors: i) cost ii) ability to program, simulate and iterate and iii) entrepreneurial accessibility.</p><p>BlueYard’s strategy around biology is based on the premise that humankind’s ability to engineer biology will not only fundamentally transform how we diagnose, treat, and manage diseases, but also reinvent how we produce new materials and the food required to support human life and sustain our planet. This includes biotechnology, therapeutics, advanced diagnostics, precision medicine and genomics, and synthetic biology, which can revolutionise the production of advanced materials and ingredients (i.e., alternative proteins, textiles, fertilizers, energy, flavors&nbsp;etc.).</p><p>As a generalist firm, BlueYard views the biology companies, networks and protocols we invest in as key parts of a broader fabric of systems for a more decentralized, sustainable and empowered future and we plan to continue to apply this core thesis in health, life sciences and synthetic biology (e.g. <a href="https://www.bit.bio/">Bit.Bio</a>, <a href="https://biofidelity.com/">Biofidelity</a>, <a href="https://www.chemify.io/">Chemify</a>, <a href="https://clock.bio/">Clock.bio</a>, <a href="https://www.meatable.com/">Meatable,</a> <a href="https://origin.bio/">Insempra.bio</a>, <a href="https://www.rarebase.org/">Rarebase</a>, <a href="https://www.zafrens.com/">Zafrens</a> etc.), but also beyond to areas such as breakthrough engineering efforts (e.g. <a href="https://marvelfusion.com/">Marvel Fusion</a>, <a href="https://seeqc.com/">Seeqc</a>, <a href="https://vsparticle.com/">VSParticle</a>, <a href="https://www.utvate.com/">UTVATE</a>, <a href="https://www.anysignal.com/">AnySignal</a> etc), crypto protocols (e.g. <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a>, <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a>, <a href="https://www.flashbots.net/">Flashbots</a> <a href="https://openzeppelin.com/">OpenZeppelin</a>, <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/forta-a-decentralized-solution-to-keep-the-open-economy-safe-285d4d4a01a4">Forta</a>, <a href="https://tableland.xyz/">Tableland</a>) and new economic operating systems (e.g. <a href="https://centrifuge.io/">Centrifuge</a>, <a href="https://dance.co/">Dance</a>, <a href="https://pitch.com/">Pitch</a>,&nbsp;etc.).</p><p>We are excited to continue our fellowship program, which launched last year with <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/welcoming-blueyards-first-bio-fellows-999fdc13d373">our first four fellows</a>, by opening up the process to find the next cohort of aspiring entrepreneurial scientists who want to spend a few months inside a VC firm. The program is designed to be 6 to 9 months long, as a 4 to 6-hour-per-week engagement. At the core of BlueYard is the belief that venture capital is a product for entrepreneurs, and if you are inspired by working with an intellectually curious, small and value-driven team, we want to hear from you. We are looking for individuals who can stake a claim at the intersection of these multiple evolving fields in human health and biology and bring a holistic view to make sense of how nature-inspired technologies can transform the fundamental well-being and longevity of every human being on our&nbsp;planet.</p> As a visiting fellow, you&nbsp;will:   Help to identify the critical computational biology and biological engineering platforms we should be thinking about as we continue to expand our strategy in the&nbsp;space,  Work closely with the team in evaluating potential investment opportunities, especially helping us find the best and most entrepreneurial scientists in&nbsp;Europe,  Keep building the entrepreneurial ecosystem across Europe and help bridge the gap between the lab and commercialisation.,  Have the opportunity to be immersed in the inner workings of a venture capital&nbsp;firm,  Take part in shaping the future of our fellowship program   Here’s what we’d like you to bring to the&nbsp;table:   A strong understanding of and passion for life sciences (biology, chemistry, medicine, physics or&nbsp;similar)  Self-(fire)starter — be able to run on your own, prioritize without much&nbsp;guidance  The ability to clearly articulate thoughts and opinions about markets, companies and technology, both in written and spoken&nbsp;form  Strong interpersonal skills — happy to work extensively within the team and with entrepreneurs  Native (or close to) English language skills both written and&nbsp;oral  The willingness to roll up your&nbsp;sleeves  <p>If you are interested in the position please send your CV to fellows@blueyard.com</p>

However, once the mainnet launches, Verida tokens (VDA) will serve as personal data storage credits, allowing users to continue enjoying secure and private data management within the network. You can read more about the <a href="https://news.verida.io/verida-storage-node-tokenomics-part-1-storage-node-economic-model-overview-780385fddac1?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=medium&amp;utm_campaign=missionlaunch">Verida storage node economics in this&nbsp;article</a>.</p>The Verida Token (VDA) creates a data economy enabling secure interactions between accounts to facilitate secure data storage, trusted sharing, fast querying and trusted messaging.<p>By completing tasks and actively testing the network, participants earn XP points*, which can be converted to VDA storage credits on the mainnet during the claim phase. 1,000,000 VDA have been allocated for Verida community incentives, and eligibility and conditions will apply for claiming tokens. More details on the claiming process will be covered in a future&nbsp;article.</p><p>*XP points are not shown in the current Verida Missions app. These will appear in the next app&nbsp;release.</p> Conclusion <p>Verida Missions has entered the public release phase, inviting users to <a href="https://missions.verida.network/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=medium&amp;utm_campaign=missionlaunch">join the mission</a> and be part of the movement that empowers individuals to take control of their personal data, ensuring privacy, security, and autonomy in the digital world. With the success of the early access phase and the launch of the inaugural Verida Mission, the Verida community is actively shaping the Verida Network and preparing it for the mainnet launch. Together, we can shape a future where data is truly in our&nbsp;hands.</p> Learn more about&nbsp;Verida   <a href="http://www.verida.io/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incentivizedtestnet&amp;utm_content=subscribe">Subscribe</a> to&nbsp;Verida  Build on the <a href="http://www.verida.network/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incentivizedtestnet">Verida&nbsp;Network</a>  Download the <a href="http://www.verida.io/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incentivizedtestnet">Verida&nbsp;Wallet</a>  Join the <a href="http://www.verida.one/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incentivizedtestnet">Verida One</a> wait&nbsp;list  Follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/verida_io">Twitter</a>  Join the conversation on&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/qb6vS43/">Discord</a>  Explore <a href="https://developers.verida.network/">developer documentation</a>  Ask us a question on&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/verida_community">Telegram</a>   <p><a href="https://news.verida.io/verida-missions-now-live-join-the-mission-and-pave-the-way-for-a-decentralized-future-8e9da990c5bb">Verida Missions Now Live: Join the Mission and Pave the way for a Decentralized Future</a> was originally published in <a href="https://news.verida.io">Verida</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Removing Privacy from Mainchain and ZENThe Horizen community recently approved ZenIP 42204 for the deprecation of the Horizen mainchain shielded pools - the removal of shielded transactions with transparent inputs from the Horizen mainchain, which will prevent shielded transaction (T addresses to Z addresses) support at the consensus level.&nbsp;What Does This Mean for the Horizen […]

     Removing Privacy from Mainchain and ZEN <p>The Horizen community recently approved <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/commit/4b34d67914d3cf76eb773a9d43949fae23f32f60">ZenIP 42204</a> for the deprecation of the Horizen mainchain shielded pools – the removal of shielded transactions with transparent inputs from the Horizen mainchain, which will prevent shielded transaction (T addresses to Z addresses) support at the consensus level.&nbsp;</p> What Does This Mean for the Horizen Ecosystem and ZEN? <p>After the deprecation of mainchain shielded pools, all privacy features will be removed from Horizen main blockchain at the consensus level. This also means ZEN will no longer be a privacy coin after this change.</p><p>The purpose of the deprecation is to ensure Horizen does privacy technology the right and sustainable way to drive ecosystem growth and minimize risks. It proposes a solution to eliminate technical debt and avoid regulatory threats that can prevent the greater Horizen community from fully and freely participating in our ecosystem.</p><p>Mitigate Regulatory Threats</p><p>The current regulatory environment presents challenges for the accessibility and adoption of privacy cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Supporting privacy features on the mainchain level is not the only way to offer privacy capability for the Horizen ecosystem. Horizen’s mission is to ensure data integrity and privacy freedom by enabling real-world use cases. Horizen’s privacy vision relies on a secure and decentralized mainchain that supports Horizen’s sidechain platform to focus on more scalable and resilient data privacy. The purpose of the deprecation of the mainchain shielded pools is to de-risk the Horizen vision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Eliminate technical debt</p><p>Horizen’s implementation of shielded transactions relies on ZCash’s outdated Sprout technology. Moving away from outdated technology will give Horizen room to improve and innovate privacy technologies.</p><p>In a <a href="https://youtu.be/pNbTVfQPjoc?t=751">recent episode</a> of Beyond the Horizen podcast, co-founder of the Horizen blockchain, Rob Viglione and Head of Strategy of Horizen Labs, Inc., Jordan Calinoff, shared their thoughts on this matter and how this change can help and grow the Horizen ecosystem and making Horizen more resilient and competitive.&nbsp;</p> When Will the Deprecation Happen? <p>The deprecation of the Horizen mainchain shielded pools will be implemented as part of the upcoming mandatory software upgrade of ZEN 4.1. The target release windows are as follows:</p><p>Testnet – August 2023</p><p>Mainnet – September 2023</p> FAQ   Does this mean Horizen will no longer support privacy?<br>No. Supporting privacy features on the mainchain level is not the only way to offer privacy capability for the Horizen ecosystem.&nbsp; Horizen’s privacy vision relies on a secure and decentralized mainchain that supports Horizen’s sidechain platform to focus on more scalable and resilient data privacy. We are only removing support for shielded transactions with transparent inputs (T addresses -&gt; Z addresses)&nbsp; on the Horizen mainchain level. This change also focuses on removing the shielded pools by preventing new transparent inputs being sent to it.<p>&nbsp;</p>  &nbsp;What will be the status of&nbsp; $ZEN following these updates?&nbsp;<br>$ZEN will no longer be considered a privacy coin after the deprecation of the mainchain shielded pools. We are actively working with our exchange partners to keep $ZEN accessible for our global users.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>We highly encourage you to read the full <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/commit/4b34d67914d3cf76eb773a9d43949fae23f32f60">ZenIP 42204 on GitHub</a> to get a complete understanding of what this means.

 1. New book: on the past, present, future of the internet; fostering creativity &amp; entrepreneurship <p>The internet of today is a far cry from its early promise as a decentralized, democratic network of creativity and innovation; in the past decade, it’s fallen under the control of just a few big tech companies. But in the forthcoming new book Read Write Own: Building the Next Era of the Internet (Random House, March 2024) Andreessen Horowitz general partner &amp; a16z crypto founding partner Chris Dixon argues that the dream of an open network for fostering creativity and entrepreneurship doesn’t have to die… <br><br>Drawing from his first-hand observations, mental models, and experiences over a 25-year career in the tech industry, Dixon shows how the internet has undergone three distinct eras — and how we’re now entering an era in which blockchain networks can democratize ownership, granting power and economic benefits to the participants in the network (not just to massive corporations). Dixon takes controversial questions head on in the book — including policy and regulatory topics — and he also makes a crucial distinction between “The Computer vs. The Casino” (that is, the currency-based speculation that hurts public perception of crypto and undermines its true potential). </p><p>The book goes deeper into other intersecting trends as well: AI, social networks, finance, media businesses, collaborative creation, video games, virtual worlds, and more. Whether business leader, artist, creator, entrepreneur, internet user, or just the tech-curious — Read Write Own is a must-read for anyone seeking to understand where we’ve been and where we’re going.<br><br><a href="https://readwriteown.com/">pre-order here<br></a><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/announcement/chris-dixon-book-read-write-own/">read more</a><br>share on <a href="https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1671899459889029123">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://warpcast.com/cdixon/0xce62c8">Farcaster</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chris-dixon-9599b127b_for-the-last-12-months-ive-been-working-activity-7077666303364235264-4J0G">LinkedIn</a></p> 2. Recommendations: What else we’re reading (and playing) this summer  <p>In a now-annual (and semi-annual) tradition, we’re sharing what various a16z crypto team members are reading, playing, and recommending this summer 2023. The list  covers creativity for all, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_manipulation">bit twiddling</a>… with a few vacation-worthy fantasy reads in between.&nbsp;</p><p>And while there are always repeat mentions in our lists and across years (see also the team’s <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/some-books-were-reading-and-games-were-playing-this-winter/">winter ‘22</a> and <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/reading-books-list-summer-2022/">summer ‘22</a> lists, as well as <a href="https://a16z.com/tag/what-were-reading/">lists</a> from seasons past) — it’s fun to see which books appear or re-appear in the zeitgeist at a particular moment in time. This time? Repeats included Peter Attia’s frameworks for longer living, Outlive; Susanna Clarke’s magical-realist wizarding tome Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell; and Gabrielle Zevin’s novel on gaming and friendship Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow.&nbsp;<br><br><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/reading-and-gaming-list-summer-2023/">check out the list</a></p> 3. Resources: Keeping up with the… crypto policy <p>It’s become clear over the last year that blockchains and the software movement around them (often <a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/blockchains-crypto-web3-movement-models">called</a> crypto or web3) can only succeed with a clear regulatory regime that provides an open pathway for startups, while also protecting consumers from fraud and manipulation.

  Partenariat avec Dust: Productivité Alimentée par les LLM  <p>Partnering with Dust: LLM-Powered Productivity | Stanislas, Gabriel and their team are harnessing AI across applications to improve the lives of knowledge workers.</p>   
	By Konstantine Buhler

<p>It might seem counterintuitive given the rate of technological progress over recent decades, but western civilization has a productivity problem—and a stubborn one at that. From 2011 to 2019, for example, the rate of growth in output <a href="https://www.conference-board.org/pdfdownload.cfm?masterProductID=46310">fell</a>, particularly in mature economies. And after a brief pandemic-related spike, that trend has continued, with GDP per hour worked <a href="https://www.conference-board.org/press/global-productivity-brief-2023">expected to contract</a> in both the euro zone and the U.S. yet again this year.</p>



<p>While the underlying reasons for this slowdown remain a subject of debate among economists, there’s no question that knowledge workers, who make up <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sisense/2021/12/01/who-are-knowledge-workers-and-how-do-we-enable-them/?sh=6eea80da6018">close to one-third</a> of the global workforce, are a big piece of the puzzle—which only adds to the exciting potential of large language models. With LLMs such as OpenAI’s GPT making it possible to automate and streamline an ever-growing list of tasks, companies are racing to “add AI” to their products and make the tools we use every day even smarter.</p>



<p>But to unlock the power of LLMs to make our work better, we will need AI not only within our tools, but also between them—in our browsers, where so much work is done, and with all the cross-application context and knowledge to connect docs to datastreams and Slack messages to spreadsheets. We will need AI that helps information flow freely where and how it’s needed most, that allows fast-growing teams to tackle documentation debt, that empowers all of us—not just those with technical know-how—to demand more from the software we use every day. That’s the mission of <a href="https://dust.tt/">Dust</a>, a “Smart Team OS” to help you do better work in less time, and focus on the things that matter most.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dust co-founders Stanislas Polu and Gabriel Hubert knew this moment in AI was coming, and they’ve spent years thinking about how to meet it. Among the first 150 employees to join Stripe after it acquired their previous startup, they honed their company-building skills on that legendary team. Then, Stanislas joined the <a href="https://openai.com/research/formal-math">Research Engineering team</a> at OpenAI, while Gabriel led product at the well-respected French health company Alan. Stanislas is truly an engineer’s engineer, and Gabriel a product person’s product person—but it’s not just their expertise and talent that set them apart. They are also funny, light-hearted and positive—the kind of founders we dream of partnering with.</p>



<p>Who better to make AI more accessible? As Stanislas <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7049311855047012352/">describes</a> it, Dust is designed to put their beloved tools of programming in hands of all knowledge workers, not just engineers—to “compile” by digesting information, to “debug” by finding inconsistencies and maintaining accuracy, to “lint” by analyzing and synthesizing across applications, and to “script” by running workflows on data. It can define jargon for non-technical teammates, describe a spreadsheet in prose to use in a presentation, or edit tricky words out of an email to a client who has dyslexia. Dust uses LLMs to go beyond the normative software experiences of today—and supercharges our work in the process.</p>



<p>Now, Stanislas and Gabriel are <a href="https://dust-tt.notion.site/Software-Product-Engineer-8e0e8f69464647b087c549301b68080d?pvs=4">growing their team</a> in their home city of Paris, where they will help advance France’s pioneering work in the global AI revolution—and help tackle the productivity problem on a national, regional and global scale. We at Sequoia were thrilled to lead their seed round and become their partners. Just as working with Stanislas and Gabriel has been a dream come true for us, it is our pleasure to support their dream—that knowledge workers everywhere spend less time on the mundane, and more time on what they love.</p>

<p>This is the 27th post in an <a>ongoing, series</a> describing new privacy features in Brave browsers. This post describes work done by Sr. Research and Privacy Engineer Shivan Sahib. This post was written by Peter Snyder.</p>



    


    


<p>Starting in version 1.54, Brave for desktop and Android will include more powerful features for controlling which sites can access local network resources, and for how long. Most popular browsers allow websites to access local network resources without protection or restriction, which puts users’ privacy and security at risk. <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2020/05/websites_conduc.html">Many popular websites query your local network</a>, often as a fingerprinting technique; others do so to observe and possibly exploit information from other software running on your machine.</p>
<p>Brave is the first popular browser to extend the Web’s permission API to control when sites can access localhost resources. Brave’s implementation allows advanced users to give any site access to localhost resources, while also avoiding the annoyance of prompts that a localhost request is likely malicious. Brave’s implementation also takes advantage of <a>existing improvements Brave has made to Web permissions</a>.</p>

 What are localhost resources, and why might sites want to access them? 
<p>“Localhost resources” is a broad term that refers to resources (images, web pages, etc.) that websites can access, but which don’t come from the “Web.” Instead, these resources are hosted (often unknowingly) by other software on your computer.</p>
<p>Surprising though it may be, most browsers allow websites to access these local resources just as easily as they can access other resources on the Web. Browsers allow websites to access localhost resources for a range of reasons, but the main two reasons are historical legacy (i.e. it’s always been done this way) and backwards compatibility. Browsers used to be less concerned about user privacy, and so didn’t enforce distinctions between first-party resources (those hosted by the site you’re visiting), third-party resources (those hosted on other public websites), and localhost resources.</p>
<p>Thanks to this historical “accident,” a small but important amount of software has been built expecting to be freely accessible by websites, often in ways invisible to users. And many of these uses are benign. Examples include some wallets for cryptocurrencies, <a href="https://palant.info/2023/01/02/south-koreas-online-security-dead-end/">security software provided by banks</a> or security companies, and hardware devices that use certain Web interfaces for configuration.</p>
<p>In some situations, browsers also allow public websites to access localhost resources to help developers test their software.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a wide range of malicious, user-harming software on the Web <a href="https://blog.nem.ec/2020/05/24/ebay-port-scanning/">uses access to localhost resources for malicious reasons</a>. For example, fingerprinting scripts try to detect unique patterns in the other software you have running on your device to re-identify you, and other scripts try to identify insecure and vulnerable software on the machine and try to exploit it.</p>

 How does this change affect how websites can access localhost resources in Brave? 
<p>Brave is the only popular browser to ship multiple protections against sites maliciously accessing localhost resources. Brave currently uses filter list rules to:</p>
 
 Block scripts known to maliciously scan localhost resources 
 Block requests from public sites to localhost resources&nbsp; 
 
<p>This is in contrast to other browsers, which generally ship no protections against sites accessing localhost resources (see the next section for some caveats).</p>
<p>Brave will soon start rolling out a new approach for protecting users against sites abusing local network resources. This new system will have the following parts:</p>
 
 Requests to localhost resources, from a localhost context are allowed automatically; Brave does not block a locally hosted page from accessing other locally hosted resources. <a>1</a> 
 Brave will continue to use filter list rules to block scripts and sites known to abuse localhost resources. 
 Brave will include a new permission called the “localhost” permission. Only sites with this permission will be able to make sub-resource requests to localhost resources. By default, no sites have this permission and, importantly, most sites have no way to prompt users for this permission. However, advanced users can use the existing site settings interface to grant sites this permission. <a>2</a> 
 Brave will also include a list of trusted sites, or sites known to access localhost resources for user-benefiting reasons. The first time a site on this list initiates a sub-request to a localhost resource, it will trigger a permission prompt of the previously mentioned localhost permission. This list <a href="https://github.com/brave/adblock-lists/blob/master/brave-lists/localhost-permission-allow-list.txt">is publicly available</a>, and will be maintained by Brave. 
 
<p>Brave has chosen to implement the localhost permission in this multistep way for several reasons. Most importantly, we expect that abuse of localhost resources is far more common than user-benefiting cases, and we want to avoid presenting users with permission dialogs for requests we expect will only cause harm.</p>
<p>Additionally, we’re purposely inserting a permission prompt into a situation where sites won’t expect it (or even realize third-party scripts are trying to access localhost resources), and so we want to further limit the permission prompt to situations where we expect it’s beneficial to users and sites alike.</p>

 How do other browsers handle connections to localhost resources? 
<p>As mentioned, most other browsers do not significantly prevent websites from accessing localhost resources. The desktop versions of Firefox and Chrome allow both secure and insecure public sites to access localhost resources, and seem to intend to allow public secure sites to access localhost resources indefinitely.</p>
<p>As a side-effect of security restrictions, <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171934">Safari currently blocks requests</a> to localhost resources (as do other WebKit browsers) from secure public websites. But to the best of our understanding, Safari does not explicitly intend to block these requests from public websites.</p>
<p>As far as we can tell, Brave is the only browser that will block requests to localhost resources from both secure and insecure public sites, while still maintaining a compatibility path for sites that users trust (in the form of the discussed localhost permission).</p>

 What’s next for localhost resource handling in Brave? 
<p>We’re excited to share this work with Brave users, and expect it to make the Brave browser even more powerful without harming user privacy. However, there’s more work to be done to improve how browsers handle localhost resources.</p>
<p>First, we’re exploring ways to better explain to users what localhost resources are, while they’re using Brave. Once we’re confident we’ve found a way of explaining what the permission controls that non-advanced users can understand, we plan on making the permission available to all sites, and not only those on our list.</p>
<p>Second, we’re pushing these protections deeper in the network stack, so that Brave can protect users against additional, less common methods of sites making localhost requests (including DNS records that refer to localhost). We also hope to have more to share soon.</p>
<p>Third, we’re interested in unifying and expanding how we can apply permissions (or permissions-like controls) to network requests in general. Brave already applies <a>permissions protections to Google login requests that require third-party cookies</a>, and we’re interested in seeing what other similar uses make sense. The main difficulty here is applying an asynchronous permission model to requests that are often made with synchronous expectations. Again, we’re exploring several options, both within Brave and with external researchers, and hope to have more to share soon.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Brave’s localhost protections do not apply to aliases the user may have installed for localhost, such as in <code>/etc/hosts</code>. See the final section of this blog post for more details.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>
 
 
<p>On Desktop, users can grant sites the localhost permission at <code>brave://settings/content/localhostAccess</code>. Android users can do the same by visiting <code>Settings &gt; Site settings &gt; Localhost Access</code>.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

 People in Geneva voted 94% in favour of the Right to Digital Integrity and it’s bigger than&nbsp;privacy… <p>Languages: <a href="https://medium.com/@nymturkish/cenevrede-zafer-anayasaya-dahil-edilen-dijital-b%C3%BCt%C3%BCnl%C3%BCk-hakk%C4%B1-d20a4bbb29e9">Türkçe</a></p><p>A whopping <a href="https://www.ge.ch/votations/20230618/cantonal/4/">94% of voters in Geneva have just voted</a> for protecting the individual against abusive data processing and for the right to an offline life. The Right to Digital Integrity is now being incorporated into the constitution of the canton of Geneva, Switzerland.</p><a href="https://www.ge.ch/votations/20230618/cantonal/4/">94% of voters in the Swiss Canton of Geneva</a> voted in favour of including digital integrity into their constitution.<p>Where does Nym fit into all this? Apart from being headquartered in Switzerland, Nym COO Alexis Roussel has been campaigning for the right to <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integridad_digital_(derecho)">digital integrity</a> for years, with the understanding that privacy is only one small part of what is at stake when our core infrastructures are built with a surveillance business&nbsp;model.</p><p>There are three important lessons that can be learned from this historical moment:</p>  People understand that the state of the digital world today is very&nbsp;worrying  People do not like to have the details about them and their lives traded on open&nbsp;markets  Privacy is not the primary&nbsp;concern…  <p>…let’s delve into that last point a bit as it contains important lessons for all of us building privacy enhancing technologies!</p> Privacy was not the core&nbsp;argument <p>For many years now, activists, progressive technologists and regulators have been working hard to try and protect privacy in the digital world. But after a few decades of this approach, it is clear that privacy is just one symptom of the deeper problem of a surveillance-driven business model at the core of the internet.</p><p>For ordinary people, there is much more at stake in the digitisation of life than privacy. When people are turned into data and traded on open markets, this threatens people’s security, creates new forms of exclusion and inequality, leads to job loss, persecution, mental health issues and more. These are the direct effects of generalised systems that treat our digital selves with far less respect and consideration as our physical&nbsp;selves.</p><p>What is groundbreaking about the results of the Geneva constitutional amendment was that it did not foreground privacy per se. Instead it was a recognition of a much larger fact: that our digital selves are deserving of the same levels of recognition and protection as our physical selves, from both administrative, state and commercial intrusion. Because our digital lives have a very real&nbsp;impact.</p><p>The key thing that drove these results was that the amendment to the Geneva constitution was not presented as a right to privacy. Instead, it was presented as the right to <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integridad_digital_(derecho)">digital integrity</a>, emphasising protection against the abusive processing of data related to a person’s digital life, the right to digital security, the right to an offline life and the right to be forgotten. This resonated far wider with people’s experiences of the effects of digital surveillance than the concept of&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>This is a lesson for all of us building privacy preserving technologies: what is at stake is far bigger than privacy and ordinary people recognise this.</p><p>Many of us in the privacy technology ecosystem are already putting effort into the narrative work needed in order to articulate an empowering alternative vision for our digital future: from <a href="https://watch.web3privacy.info/session/sessionriseanon-lunarpunkandmemeticwarfare">Lunarpunk</a>, to self-sovereignty, to the post-web and <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/digital-integrity-disrupting-the-personal-data-economy-509642bc756b">Digital Integrity</a>.</p><p>The aim of this narrative work is to articulate a vision that recognises the importance of people being able to determine their own terms of engagement with&nbsp;others.</p><blockquote>Keen to discuss and work with others on this in the Nym ecosystem?</blockquote> Join Nym Community <p><a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">Twitter</a> // <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> // <a href="https://t.me/nymtech">Telegram</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dev:nymtech.chat">Element</a></p> What next? <p>Several other cantons of Switzerland are now lining up to adopt similar amendments to their constitutions as this recognition of the need for digital integrity is gaining momentum.</p><p>View the <a href="https://www.ge.ch/votations/20230618/cantonal/4/">results</a> and read the original amendment in <a href="https://ge.ch/grandconseil/data/texte/PL12945B.pdf">French</a>. Translation:</p><p>“The amendment proposed by Constitutional Law 12945 aims to introduce a fundamental right aimed at protect the digital integrity of citizens, mainly in the context of their relations with the public administrations.</p><p>This fundamental right enshrines principles related to integrity, which are in particular the right to be protected against the abusive processing of data related to their digital life, the right to digital security, the right to an offline life and the right to be forgotten.</p><p>It obliges the State, in the context of data processing personnel for which it is responsible, to ensure a level adequate protection, in particular if this treatment is carried out in foreign jurisdictions.</p><p>This constitutional law commits the State on the ground of digital inclusion in order to support citizens and citizens in the digital revolution and to raise their awareness issues related to digitization. It invites the State of Geneva to play an active role in the development of Swiss digital sovereignty. Since it concerns a modification of the constitution of the Republic and canton of Geneva, of October 14, 2012, the vote of the electorate is compulsory.”</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/victory-in-geneva-the-right-to-digital-integrity-incorporated-into-the-constitution-ce6762497ae7">Victory in Geneva!

<p>We’ve asked our team of experts in the web3 space to share their single most valuable tips for a project team or POC that is considering using or already using blockchain technology. We had our fair share of learnings as well so our aim is to provide you with valuable insights.</p>



<p>Top expert tips for web3 projects:</p>



 
 Decrease time to market 



 Ask the community in order to avoid mistakes 



 Address compliance at an early stage 



 Mitigate risk by decreasing volatility 
 



 Tip #1: Decrease time to market 



<p>In the fast-paced web3 world, time is everything. New applications pop up daily, not to mention the numerous new players that enter the space.</p>



<p>By decreasing the time to market, you can launch your product before your competitors. Additionally, it allows you to receive feedback from the (web3) community early on, which can help you refine your product. But remember, this whole web3 space is also new to them. Innovation takes time to sink in. Finally, a faster time-to-market can help you avoid running out of resources before your product even gets to market.</p>



<p>Simplicity is key. By prioritising a smooth and seamless process, and abstracting away as much technical complexity as possible, you create better experiences for your customers and increase your chances of success.</p>







 Tip #2: Ask the community in order to avoid mistakes 



<p>In the fast-paced world of blockchain technology, it’s essential to have a second pair of eyes on all your software. By involving the community and asking for help, you can ensure that your project is built on a solid foundation and has the best chance of success.</p>



<p>Many projects fail because people rush into building something without asking around. People that are new in the space don’t know the challenges, and those might have already been solved by others. There are public chats for developers and all types of project participants, including technology-focused and business-focused groups.</p>



<p>In the web3 space, many things are new and not well documented, making it even more critical to ask what works and what doesn’t work.</p>



<p>So, how do you ensure you get the best advice? Firstly, ensure that you talk to a diverse group of people from different budgets and backgrounds. Secondly, have a clear understanding of your project requirements and what you need help with. Finally, always be respectful and appreciative of people’s time and efforts.</p>



 Tip #3: Address compliance at an early stage 



<p>Before spending a considerable amount on building an MVP, it’s crucial to at least have a quick chat with a seasoned lawyer, to check potential legal issues. A relatively small investment will identify your legal challenges, related to your plans. Such as regulatory issues for custodial wallets, property law for tokenisation, intellectual property for NFTs, and GDPR compliance for web3 wallets and public chains.<a href="https://zaisan.io/services/web3-consultancy/"> Inserting legal know-how at an early stage</a> might save tons of costs and a lot of time. It might prevent you from completely redeveloping or spending precious resources on a project doomed from a regulatory perspective. Professional legal involvement will definitely sit well with investors too.</p>



<p>At Zaisan, we understand that the law might look like a scary beast, but that compliance is essential for the success of your blockchain project. It’s too often that this initial, relatively small spending saves the day.</p>



 Tip #4: Mitigate risk by decreasing volatility 



<p>One of the most common pitfalls of blockchain projects is the lack of users. Many projects based on transactional volumes such as wallets, exchanges, and marketplaces often face this challenge. Moreover, when you have a tradable token, there’s a high chance that it becomes volatile which can make projects unusable. To mitigate these risks, we suggest that you make sure your project is sustainable through budget planning and mitigating volatility risks by hedging.</p>



<p>We emphasise not basing your business model on the token on which it is running. Use business logic and design the project in a way that it doesn’t have overdependence on the system token. You could mitigate the risk by using stablecoins and a variable pricing model.</p>



<p>Introducing crypto or tokens to a project has its pros and cons. If it grows too much, it becomes unusable. If it becomes too low, there’s a chance of spammers coming in. Therefore, it is essential to consider whether the crypto angle will help you or become counterproductive in your business logic.</p>



<p>SMEs usually don’t need the crypto side; they just need the blockchain side.</p>

Enter your email address or phone number to register and create a secure password.  Verify your email or phone number by entering the code sent to&nbsp;you.  Congratulations! You are now one step closer to helping NYM get&nbsp;listed!   Step 2: Identity Verification (KYC) <p>To ensure your vote counts, you must complete the first stage of Know Your Customer (KYC) verification with Bybit. Just follow the steps on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bybit.com/en-US/help-center/s/article/How-to-Complete-Individual-KYC-Verification">Bybit</a>.</p> Step 3: Topping up your Spot&nbsp;Wallet <p>Please note that you do not need to send tokens anywhere to vote. The voting process will be conducted using the instructions provided&nbsp;below.</p>  Go to the “Assets” section of Bybit and select “Spot account.” Then, navigate to the assets&nbsp;page.  Choose the currency you wish to use for topping up your balance. For voting purposes, you must select one of the following currencies: USDT, USDC/BUSD/CUSD/USDD/DAI.  Click on “deposit” and copy the provided deposit wallet&nbsp;address.  Send the desired amount of funds to the deposit wallet address you&nbsp;copied.   Step 4: Voting with&nbsp;ByVotes <p>Please note that there is no need to lock your assets to vote. Your assets will remain in your balance throughout the voting process. The voting process is straightforward:</p>  The voting period on Bybit will begin at 3:00 AM UTC on July 6th and will last for 24&nbsp;hours.  The number of votes you possess will be proportional to the assets held in your Bybit&nbsp;account.  On July 5th at 23:59:59 UTC, a snapshot will be taken of your Spot, Earn, Funding, and Derivatives accounts balance on Bybit to determine the number of votes you have. To be eligible to vote, your assets must be in your account before this time. Please note that topping up your balance to obtain additional votes will not be possible once the voting begins. Only the assets in your account three hours prior to the start of the vote will be&nbsp;counted.  <p>As soon as voting begins, visit the <a href="https://www.bybit.com/en-US/trade/spot/vote-home/">ByVotes site</a> and cast your vote for NYM. According to the rules, a maximum of 10,000 votes (equivalent to $10,000) can be allocated to one project from one account. Remember, 1 vote equals 1 USDT. To maximize our chances, we encourage you to vote within the first few seconds after voting begins. Set a reminder to ensure you don’t miss the vote right at the beginning.</p><p>After NYM Technologies secures the listing vote, you will automatically be entered into our NYM token airdrop. The airdrop will take place on July 7th from 3:00 AM to 7:00 AM (UTC). The total prize pool for the airdrop will consist of $100,000 in NYM tokens. Please note that the maximum reward amount sent to participants will be 1% of the total prize&nbsp;pool.</p><p><a href="https://www.bybit.com/en-US/sign-up?affiliate_id=56941&amp;group_id=95829&amp;group_type=1">VOTE NOW</a></p><p>If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don’t hesitate to ask in the <a href="https://t.me/nymtech">NYM Telegram</a>.</p><p>We are available around the clock to support you, so feel free to stop by and say&nbsp;hi!</p><p>Join Nym Community</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">Twitter</a> // <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> // <a href="https://t.me/nymtech">Telegram</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dev:nymtech.chat">Element</a></p><p>Learn more on <a href="https://www.bybit.com/app/terms-service/information">Bybit Terms &amp; Conditions.</a></p><p>Disclaimer:</p><p>Participation in this program is only available to individuals who do not reside in locations that makes them ineligible to participate and/or receive prizes, including: The USA, Central African Republic, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, Yemen, and Russian occupied regions of Ukraine (including Crimea, and parts of Donetsk and Luhansk).</p><p>Prior to receiving NYM token rewards for this program, participants are required to successfully complete KYC verification with Nym’s KYC provider of&nbsp;choice.</p><p>Nym reserves the right to determine the final outcome of the activity and disqualify any participants without prior notice or recourse for any reason, including fraudulent behavior and failure to adhere to the Nym Code of Conduct <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/coc.html">https://nymtech.net/docs/coc.html</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/voting-instructions-for-nym-nym-listing-on-bybit-200k-airdrops-prize-pools-25a827b6d1fa">Voting instructions for NYM ($NYM) Listing on ByBit — $200K Airdrops prize pools!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Members of the <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a> (ZCG) committee are elected by the Zcash Community Advisory Panel, and serve a one year term. One committee member’s term is expiring at the end of June, and another member has volunteered to resign their seat and stand for re-election in order to facilitate staggered elections. </p>



<p>Last month, <a href="https://zfnd.org/opening-nominations-for-the-zcash-community-grants-committee-june-2023/">we invited candidates</a> to express their interest in serving on the committee. </p>



<p>Three candidates are standing for two seats on the committee. Here is the list of candidates, with links to their candidacy announcement on the Zcash community forum:&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



<p>Note that Beth <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zcg-committee-election-june-2023/44668/8">withdrew her candidacy on 21st June</a>. </p>



<p>Last Friday, the candidates took part in a Community Call, during which they introduced themselves and answered questions from the Zcash community. You can watch <a href="https://youtu.be/4jLG0niVqRE">a recording of the call on Youtube</a>. </p>



<p>Today, we opened a <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/1a67b74a-0f4b-11ee-b703-ce0c56736bd3/questions">Helios poll</a> of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP), which will run until 30th June. The poll will be decided by approval voting for two members out of the three candidates. The results will be released on July 1st, and the two candidates with the most approval votes will become the new ZCG committee members with immediate effect.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y-GbVFA1csIgPbvHOR-1ruOlh7YdA-CHvMtd6R8iSdY">ZCAP members</a> should check their mailbox for instructions on how to vote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Good luck to all the candidates, and thank you for volunteering to serve on the ZCG committee!&nbsp;</p>

You, as a staker on that mix node, will earn a share of that node’s&nbsp;rewards.</p> How to&nbsp;stake  1. <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nym-wallet/">Download the Nym wallet </a>and get native NYM&nbsp;tokens <p>The Nym wallet provides the interface for you to delegate your stake. You will need native NYM tokens in order to delegate stake in the Nym mixnet. If you have ERC20 NYM tokens, you can bridge these to native NYM tokens on the Nyx chain— <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/bridging-staking-and-earning-nym-tokens-8f19f42f171e">read&nbsp;more</a>.</p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Join our community</a> to find out more about how to get native NYM&nbsp;tokens.</p> 2. Go to the <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/network-components/mixnodes/active">mixnet explorer</a> and chose a mix&nbsp;node <p>In the explorer you can browse Nym mix nodes. You will want to find a mix node that&nbsp;has:</p>  Good stake saturation (as that signifies reputation), but not 100% or over — as that means the mix node is fully saturated and will not yield optimal&nbsp;rewards.  Low’ish profit margin as that is the amount the operator takes for themselves before sharing with their delegators. (You don’t want too low though as you want to ensure the mix node is financially viable).  Good routing score, as this is the performance of the mix&nbsp;node.  <p>You might want to look at other parameters also, like location and so on to ensure the mixnet <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/introducing-the-nym-delegations-program-c5ecf320ed12">remains global and decentralised</a> — <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/want-to-stake-in-nym-here-is-how-to-choose-a-mix-node-to-delegate-nym-to-c3b862add165">read&nbsp;more</a>.</p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Join our community</a> to get tips on which mix node to delegate&nbsp;to.</p> 3.

 Launching currencies on Verus, and any other PBaaS-chain (Public Blockchains as a Service), is better, faster, cheaper and more secure than any EVM-like protocol out there. This article explains why, gives an in-depth view of all the options and parameters, and teaches how to launch these currencies. Welcome to Verus, a fundamentally different protocol, and the future of currency launches and value creation.  What are Currencies? <p>Let’s go back to basics first. Currencies, also called tokens on many other cryptocurrency protocols, are a critical part of what makes blockchain useful. They can be used as a means of accounting, can represent property or rights external to the blockchain, and over bridges can be thought of as a means of communication or data transfer between blockchains.</p><p>A real-life example is a project that uses the Verus Protocol to account for energy production, transfer and usage. Other examples can be a token pegged to a fiat currency which is a representation of property external to the blockchain. Or fractionalized tokenization of assets, so many can share in group ownership of something. With all the capabilities Verus has in ways to relate tokens and currencies with VerusIDs (and subIDs), novel use cases arise naturally.</p><p>And what makes Verus currencies so powerful is that there is no coding involved. It is just creating a transaction, and then sending that transaction to the blockchain making the currency a reality. Anyone can do&nbsp;it.</p> Better, Faster, Cheaper and More&nbsp;Secure <p>Why is it smarter to launch currencies on the Verus Protocol? The answer is simple, because all launched currencies are part of the consensus mechanism. On EVM-like and account-based protocols (Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polkadot, Cosmos, Avalanche) currencies are not part of consensus and thus easily exploitable by smart contract bugs and malicious developers. With Verus, a UTXO model, all currencies are accounted for, and verified by the worldwide miners and stakers of the protocol, making it as secure as sending BTC on Bitcoin. To make it simple — all features on the Verus Protocol are on the first layer, the consensus layer.</p><blockquote>Verus fundamentally revolutionizes the preexisting cryptocurrency landscape</blockquote><p>Also, where other protocols need L2 solutions which are mostly centralized, Verus includes self-sovereign identities, namespaces, privacy, DeFi, bridges, and currency and blockchain launches on the first layer. An innovation that fundamentally revolutionizes the preexisting cryptocurrency landscape.</p><p>Launching currencies with Verus is also much faster and cheaper than with the alternatives. The magic here is that there is no coding involved. Anyone can launch a currency by just choosing the options and parameters they would like. It is as easy as typing in a command and the currency is ready to be used by the world within minutes. This process does not involve expensive Solidity developers or security audits, saving a lot of development costs.</p><p>Another big advantage is being able to export launched currencies to Ethereum as ERC-20. These currencies can then partake in the Ethereum ecosystem, yet have better security and cheaper DeFi transactions than when they are created on Ethereum itself. Each ERC-20 token can also be bridged to Verus. It’s all super easy thanks to the non-custodial Verus-Ethereum Bridge.</p><p>This is not all some fantasy, this is all functional (the Verus-Ethereum Bridge is in testing), right now, on mainnet, on the Verus Protocol. As you now know, Verus is built fundamentally differently than any other protocol out there, and ushers in a new era for brands, communities, businesses, entrepreneurs and organizations to create value in a better and more secure way than ever&nbsp;before.</p><p>The next chapter explains the options to choose from when launching currencies.</p> Options to Launch Currencies <p>For ease of explaining, all PBaaS-chain launch options are omitted. Good to know — with Verus anyone can also launch fully interoperable, independent and customizable blockchains with all the same L1 features as the Verus blockchain. The focus of this article is on launching currencies only, on Verus or any other PBaaS-chain.</p><p>To launch a currency on Verus (and any other PBaaS-chain) a namespace is needed. That namespace is a VerusID. The namespace is the name of the currency (e.g. MyBrand@). That namespace can also have subIDs (e.g. product.MyBrand@, user.MyBrand@, more on this&nbsp;later).</p><p>On Verus a VerusID registration costs between 20 and 100 VRSC, and the launch of a currency costs 200 VRSC. These costs are always paid in the chain’s native coin (to the worldwide miners and stakers). On other PBaaS-chains these costs can differ since the chain launcher can define its own costs for VerusID registrations and currency launches.</p><p>To define a currency, choose options. Then combine these options to whatever the currency needs to be. Just add the numbers together in the currency definition. The currency options are listed&nbsp;below.</p>  options:1 — The currency has reserves, and can be converted to and from the reserves (option 32 needs to be added). Can have one currency as its reserves, or multiple with up to 10 currencies. Let’s call it a “Basket currency” — a currency with a basket of reserves. Such a currency can be launched centralized or decentralized.  options:2 — Only the controlling VerusID (the namespace of the currency, the rootID) can create&nbsp;subIDs.  options:8 — Referrals and discounts are enabled for subID creation.  options:16 — Referrals are required for subID creation.  options:32 — The currency is a simple token currency without any reserves. Such a currency can be launched centralized or decentralized. This option is also used for <a href="https://docs.verus.io/definecurrency/mapping-1:1-eth.html">Ethereum ERC-20 mapped&nbsp;tokens</a>.  options:2048 — A single satoshi (0.00000001) NFT token is created &amp; has tokenized control of the root VerusID. Which means you can send the single satoshi token to other addresses and then they have control of the root&nbsp;VerusID.  <p>Let’s give some examples of combined&nbsp;options:</p>  "options":33 — this launches a basket currency. It is options 1 + 32 combined.  "options":2080 — this launches a single satoshi token that has control of the root VerusID. It is options 32 + 2048 combined.  "options":35 — this launches a basket currency, and only the rootID can create subIDs. It is options 1 + 2 + 32 combined.  <p>And so on. More information on basket currencies, simple token currencies and subIDs in the next&nbsp;chapter.</p> Two Types of Currencies <p>There are two types of currencies that can be launched with the Verus Protocol. Basket currencies and simple token currencies. Both can be issued decentralized, or centralized (has minting and burning capabilities.)</p> Basket Currencies A simple example of a basket currency containing two reserve currencies.<p>Basket currencies are magical currencies that have reserves. Have a look at the simplified image. If anyone has currency X or Y, they can convert to the basket currency, or convert from reserve to reserve. If anyone has the basket currency, they can go to currency X or Y. A basket currency can have 1 and up to 10 reserve currencies.</p><p>The basket currency supply is dynamic, depending on how much is converted to the basket currency (supply minted), or back to its reserve(s) (supply&nbsp;burned).</p><p>A basket currency can be 100% backed by its reserves, 5%, or anything in between. This is called the reserve ratio, or the weight. The lower the reserve ratio, the more volatile the currency is when people are converting into or out of the basket currency. The value of the basket currency is directly linked to what is in the reserves and what the reserve ratio&nbsp;is.</p><p>When a centralized version of this currency is created, the owner of the rootID can mint currencies into existence, while automatically lowering the reserve ratio. Or they can burn currencies and automatically raise the reserve ratio. Anyone can also just burn the currency at will without raising the reserve&nbsp;ratio.</p><p>The conversion fees are incredibly low, 0.025% when converting to and from a basket currency, and 0.05% when converting from reserve to reserve currency. These fees go directly to the worldwide miners and stakers of the protocol, and/or they are accrued into the reserves making the basket currency worth&nbsp;more.</p><p>Because all currency conversions are solved simultaneously inside a block, giving all participants the same price, the protocol is MEV-free. The protocol doesn’t have any of the problems EVM-like account-based systems have. Verus DeFi is fair, cheap and has no rent-seekers.</p><p>Every(!) currency on the Verus network (also mapped ERC-20s!), can be used as reserves for basket currencies. As you might start to understand now — basket currencies are unique currencies that can not be found anywhere else and offer an enormous amount of opportunities for value creation. And anyone can launch them without needing any programming knowledge!</p> Simple Token Currencies <p>Simple token currencies are just currencies without any reserves. They are not as exciting as the basket currencies, yet still offer much value. With all the parameters that can be added, subIDs created and decentralized crowdfund mechanism, these currencies can support a lot of use cases that are difficult to do with alternative protocols. <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/unleash-the-power-of-verus-technological-showcase-of-centrally-issued-token-fully-backed-by-gold-dcc9fae7ca0f">A small example of a centralized currency&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>The supply of this type of currency is static when it’s a decentralized version. When it’s a centralized version, the owner of the rootID can mint tokens into existence, and anyone can burn&nbsp;them.</p><p>This option is also used to create currencies that are mapped to Ethereum ERC-20s. Which means you can send those ERC-20s over to Verus, or from Verus to the ERC-20. This is made possible with the non-custodial Verus-Ethereum Bridge. <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/get-ahead-of-the-game-with-verus-groundbreaking-1-1-decentralized-currency-mapping-for-erc-20-cc23584a7037">You can read more about it&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>And of course, a simple token currency can be one of the reserves in a basket currency.</p> What are&nbsp;SubIDs <p>SubIDs are powerful objects on the blockchain. They can be registered in an unlimited amount under any created currency (basket and simple token currency). A few examples are product.MyBrand@ or user.MyBrand@. The name MyBrand@ is a VerusID (a namespace) that is converted into a currency. The subIDs are ‘product’ and&nbsp;‘user’.</p><p>SubIDs can be bound digitally to many things. They can be bound to people and products. They can be bound to an unlimited amount of content, data, and provable information, both public and private. Including provable contracts and rights that can be bound to ownership of the subID&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Another powerful feature is that it has read, write and delete functions in what is called the “content multimap”. All kinds of information can be read and processed in the mempool of the blockchain.</p><p>It doesn’t stop there, it’s also a friendly name blockchain address that can receive, send, hold and stake funds, and can be used to login to services, password-free. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/verusid/">Read more about VerusID&nbsp;here.</a></p> Parameters to Launch Currencies This is all anyone needs to do to launch powerful currencies. Zero&nbsp;coding!<p>Next up are the parameters. Choose the parameters wisely to launch a currency that suits any need. Not all parameters are needed or combinable. There are many to go through, so let’s&nbsp;start.</p> “proofprotocol” <p>This parameter defines, among others, if the currency is centralized or decentralized. You can choose 1,2 or&nbsp;3.</p><p>1 is default, which launches a decentralized currency (no need to include this parameter when defining such a currency). When subIDs are created with this option, the registration fees are&nbsp;burned.</p><p>2 is for a centralized currency. If it’s a basket currency the rootID can mint and burn supply while automatically lowering and raising the reserve ratio (also anyone can burn supply without lowering the reserve ratio). Or when it’s a simple token currency they can just mint and burn supply. The subID registration fees go to the&nbsp;rootID.</p><p>3 is for Ethereum ERC-20 mapped tokens. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/definecurrency/mapping-1:1-eth.html">Read more&nbsp;here</a></p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"MyBrand", <br>  "options":32, <br>  "proofprotocol":2, <br>  "preallocations":[{"Klaus@":100}]<br>}' <p>🔍 A simple token currency called MyBrand, centralized (the controller of the rootID can mint and burn), and has a preallocation of 100 tokens to&nbsp;Klaus@.</p> “currencies” <p>Here you put the names of the currencies (or just one — it must have VRSC when launched on Verus) that will be in the reserves when it’s a basket currency (options:33).</p><p>Or when it’s a simple token currency (options:32), what people convert during the preconversion timeframe will go to the rootID of the currency, as a funding mechanism. In the case of a simple token currency, combine it with "conversions" to determine the preconversion price.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"CommunityX", <br>  "options":33, <br>  "currencies":["vrsctest","MyBrand"], <br>  "minpreconversion":[10,50],<br>  "initialsupply":100<br>}' <p>🔍 A basket currency called CommunityX. It needs to get a minimum of 10 VRSCTEST and 50 MyBrand into its reserves within the preconversion time frame to be launched. The initial supply of 100 CommunityX will be distributed among the preconverters.</p> “conversions” <p>Use this parameter when launching a simple token currency. Together with "currencies", it can be used as a funding mechanism for the rootID. It’s for the preconversion price. So when doing "conversions":[0.1], it means that for every VRSC the preconverter receives 10 CURRENCY after launch. The converted VRSC goes into the&nbsp;rootID.</p><p>People can preconvert to this currency within the preconversion time frame. Define a "startblock", or let the default and minimum time frame play out, which is 20&nbsp;blocks.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"CoolBrand",<br>  "options":32,<br>  "currencies":["vrsctest"],<br>  "conversions":[0.1],<br>  "minpreconversion":[1000]<br>}' <p>🔍 This simple token currency is called CoolBrand. During the preconversion time frame people need to convert 1000 VRSCTEST to the rootID. In exchange for that they receive 10.000 CoolBrand. If this minimum amount is not met, the currency will not launch, and everyone who did a preconvert will get their funds&nbsp;back.</p> “minpreconversion” <p>Use this parameter to set a minimum amount of preconversions. The minimum amount of preconversions needs to be met or the currency will not launch and everyone gets their conversions returned, minus the transaction and conversion fees. It works both with basket currencies and simple token currencies.</p><p>There is a 0.025% fee taken when preconverting. Take this into consideration when trying to meet the minimum amount of preconversions.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"CompanyX",<br>  "options":32,<br>  "currencies":["vrsctest"],<br>  "conversions":[2],<br>  "minpreconversion":[500]<br>}' <p>🔍 This simple token currency is called CompanyX. During the preconversion time frame people need to convert 500 VRSCTEST to the rootID. In exchange for that they receive 250 CompanyX. If this minimum amount is not met, the currency will not launch, and everyone who did a preconvert will get their funds&nbsp;back.</p> “maxpreconversions” <p>Use this parameter to set a maximum amount of preconversions. During the preconversion time frame the amount set can not be exceeded. Everything above this amount will be automatically refunded after the currency is launched.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"CoinCommunity", <br>  "options":33, <br>  "currencies":["vrsctest"], <br>  "maxpreconversion":[100], <br>  "initialsupply":100<br>}' <p>🔍 This is a basket currency called CoinCommunity. During the preconversion time frame people can convert VRSCTEST into its reserves for 100 CoinCommunity in return. During the preconversion time frame there can not be more than 100 VRSCTEST converted into its reserves. Whatever is preconverted more will be returned.</p> “initialcontributions” <p>The rootID can contribute some or all of the minimum preconversions directly as part of the currency definition. Use this parameter to make an initial contribution to either the reserves when it’s a basket currency (options:33), or to the rootID when it’s a simple token currency (options:32).</p><p>The funds to initially contribute need to be in the rootID when defining the currency. After the preconversion time frame is over and the currency launched, the rootID has received an amount of the launched currency.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"CommunityBasket", <br>  "options":33, <br>  "currencies":["vrsctest","CoinCommunity"], <br>  "initialcontributions":[10,200], <br>  "initialsupply":100, <br>  "preallocations":[{"Jane@":100},{"John@":50}]<br>}' <p>🔍 This is a basket currency called CommunityBasket. The launcher of the currency wanted to make initial contributions to its reserves. At the moment of broadcasting the currency to the network, there needed to be 210 VRSCTEST and 200 CoinCommunity in the rootID. The initial supply of 100 went to the rootID (if there weren’t any more preconverters). At the same time of the launch, 100 CoinCommunity was minted into Jane@ and 50 into John@, this lowered the reserve ratio of the currency.</p> “initialsupply” <p>A required parameter for basket currencies (options:33). Does not work with simple token currencies. This is the initial supply during the preconversion time frame, before the currency is launched. People preconverting into the reserves receive from this initial&nbsp;supply.</p><p>Immediately after the currency is launched, the supply can be larger due to "preallocations".</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"SocialBrand", <br>  "options":33, "currencies":["vrsctest"], <br>  "initialsupply":500, <br>  "preallocations":[{"Max@":1000}]<br>}' <p>🔍 This is a basket currency called SocialBrand. People can preconvert VRSCTEST into its reserves and in return they get 500 SocialBrand distributed among them. Immediately after launch Max@ receives 1000 SocialBrand, lowering the reserve ratio of the currency.</p> “preallocations” <p>Use this parameter to receive a chosen amount of funds after the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched. Funds can be directed to VerusIDs and R-addresses. Works with simple token currencies and basket currencies.</p><p>When using this parameter with basket currencies, after the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched, the reserve ratio is lowered. This is because new currency has been minted after the initial supply ("initialsupply") is distributed.</p> “prelaunchcarveout” <p>Only works with basket currencies (options:33). Use this to redirect a percentage of preconverted reserves to the&nbsp;rootID.</p><p>After the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched, a percentage of the reserves is taken and redirected to the rootID. This lowers the reserve ratio, making the currency more volatile.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"BusinessBrand", <br>  "options":33, <br>  "currencies":["vrsctest"], <br>  "initialsupply":100, <br>  "prelaunchcarveout":0.1<br>}' <p>🔍 This is a basket currency called BusinessBrand. People can preconvert VRSCTEST into its reserves in return for 100 BusinessBrand distributed among them. When the currency is launched, 10% VRSCTEST is taken out of the reserves, into the rootID. This lowers the reserve ratio by&nbsp;10%.</p> “prelaunchdiscount” <p>Only works with basket currencies (options:33). Use this to give people a discount during the preconversion time frame. After the preconversion time frame and the currency is launched, the conversion price will be higher, depending on what percentage the discount&nbsp;was.</p><p>When using this parameter, after the currency is launched, the reserve ratio will be lowered by the discounted percentage.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"DiscountBrand", <br>  "options":33, <br>  "currencies":["vrsctest"], <br>  "initialsupply":100, <br>  "prelaunchdiscount":0.5<br>}' <p>🔍 This is a basket currency called DiscountBrand. People can preconvert VRSCTEST into its reserves in return for 100 DiscountBrand distributed among them. Immediately after the launch of the currency, when people want to convert, the price is 50% higher. Also, the reserve ratio is 50% lower because of the prelaunchdiscount.</p> “weights” <p>Only works with basket currencies (options:33). Use this to change the respective weights of the reserves in a basket currency. The total of all weights must equal 1. With a minimum of 0.1, since there can’t be more than 10 reserve currencies in a basket currency.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"MyBusiness", <br>  "options":33, <br>  "currencies":["vrsctest","BusinessBrand","DiscountBrand"], <br>  "initialsupply":100, <br>  "weights":[0.5,0.25,0.25]<br>}' <p>🔍 This is a basket currency called MyBusiness. During the preconversion time frame there are various currencies that can be converted into its reserves. They have different weights to them. 0.5 for VRSCTEST, 0.25 for both BusinessBrand and DiscountBrand.</p> “startblock” <p>Use this parameter to define the block height when the currency is launched. There is a preconversion time frame before the currency is launched. When omitting this parameter it uses a 20 block preconversion time frame before the currency is launched.</p><p>The preconversion time frame is always 20 blocks, this can not be&nbsp;less.</p> “endblock” <p>Endblock can not be defined on basket currencies. It does nothing. It could be set as a signal to software that might use the basket currency.</p><p>It can be set on centralized (proofprotcol:2) simple token currencies. When the endblock is reached, it turns the centralized currency into a decentralized one.</p> “idregistrationfees” <p>Use this parameter to change the costs of registering subIDs under the rootID. The default registration fee is&nbsp;100.</p><p>When it’s a decentralized currency the fees are burned, when it’s centralized the fees go to the&nbsp;rootID.</p><p>To enable discounts when using referrals, add "options":8 to the currency definition.</p> “idreferrallevels” <p>Use this parameter to change the levels of referrals used when registering subIDs. The default is 3&nbsp;levels.</p> “nativecurrencyid” <p>Use this parameter for mapped ERC-20 tokens. The parameter includes the Ethereum contract address for the ERC-20. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/definecurrency/mapping-1:1-eth.html">Read here for more information</a>.</p><p>These were all the parameters to use when defining currencies. There are many, and combining them in the right ways make powerful currencies and tokens. The community is always ready to help when defining and launching currencies for your use cases! <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Please go to Discord and ask&nbsp;away.</a></p><p>The next chapter explains how to exactly launch these currencies.</p> How to Launch the Currencies <p>Launching these currencies is quite easy. Launch with the command-line interface, or Verus Desktop for Windows, Linux or macOS. <a href="https://verus.io/wallet">Download&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>In the chapter before many examples of currency definitions are given. Let’s use one and see how it is launched.</p><p>First of all let’s see the difference between launching with Verus Desktop and the command-line interface. Verus testnet is used for testing purposes.</p><p>⚠️ It is highly recommended to launch currencies on testnet first before going to mainnet!&nbsp;⚠️</p><p>Verus Desktop: go to “Settings” (cogwheel top-right) -&gt; “Coin Settings”. There you see an input&nbsp;field.</p>Here you can run commands in Verus&nbsp;Desktop<p>To use the input field and launch a currency on Verus Desktop (see run before the command):</p> run definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"MyBrand",<br>  "options":32, <br>  "proofprotocol":2, <br>  "preallocations":[{"Klaus@":100}]<br>}’ <p>Command-line interface: (this is for testnet, when on mainnet omit -chain=VRSCTEST or for any other PBaaS-chain, just edit VRSCTEST)</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency ‘{<br>  "name":"MyBrand",<br>  "options":32, <br>  "proofprotocol":2, <br>  "preallocations":[{"Klaus@":100}]<br>}' <p>Now, after doing these commands in either Verus Desktop or the command-line interface you get a HEX returned. It’s a very large array of letters and numbers. We need to use this HEX to broadcast the currency to the blockchain. Only then will the currency really start and the funds taken (distributed to the miners and stakers) for the&nbsp;launch.</p> Using the&nbsp;HEX <p>To start the currency use these commands:</p><p>Verus Desktop:</p> run sendrawtransaction "HEX" <p>Command-line interface: (this is for testnet, when on mainnet omit -chain=VRSCTEST or for any other PBaaS-chain, just edit VRSCTEST)</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendrawtransaction "HEX" <p>After doing these commands the currency has started, the funds from the rootID are taken, and it takes a minimum of 20 blocks to actually launch it (and if all preconversion goals are&nbsp;met).</p> Currency information <p>During the preconversion time frame and after the launch you can lookup all kinds of information on the currency.</p><p>Verus Desktop:</p> run getcurrency "MyBrand" <p>Command-line interface: (this is for testnet, when on mainnet omit -chain=VRSCTEST or for any other PBaaS-chain, just edit VRSCTEST)</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrency "MyBrand" <p>Now you know everything to launch currencies! 👉 <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">The worldwide community is happy to help on&nbsp;Discord</a>!</p> Start to&nbsp;Build <p>For all the builders out there, you can start to use the Verus Protocol right now for your Dapps or businesses.

  Partnering with Mach Industries: A New Generation of Defense Technology  <p>Ethan and his team are solving hypersonic defense and revolutionizing defense technology.</p>   
	By Stephanie Zhan and Shaun Maguire	 



Published June 15, 2023
  







 
<p>Defense technology plays a pivotal role in upholding national security and protecting the welfare of citizens. As industries experience a widespread technological revolution, the defense sector is undergoing a crucial transition. With aging defense systems and struggling supply chains, the opportunity for innovation has become increasingly compelling and is driving modernization initiatives aimed at advancing the US’ defense technology. One area of particular interest is hypersonics, defined as controlled flight at speeds greater than five times the speed of sound.</p>



<p>Shaun was in the command room at DARPA when they flew <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersonic_Technology_Vehicle_2">Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 (HTV-2)</a>. He was also deployed to Afghanistan in support of DARPA’s mission. Hypersonic defense has been underestimated by most civilians, but we had a front row seat to this development and had been looking for a technological solution. That experience led to the belief that it is essential the US develops hypersonic missile defenses.</p>



<p>This was top of mind for us when Stephanie first met Ethan Thornton, founder of <a href="https://www.machindustries.com/">Mach Industries</a>. Ethan has worked on hardware for much of his early life, and by age 16, was already prototyping defense applications in his garage. He continued prototyping while studying at MIT, and his work attracted interest from the Lincoln Laboratory, a research and development center funded by MIT and the Department of Defense.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ethan detailed his vision for Mach Industries: a hardware-first approach to defense, with cutting-edge hydrogen creation and combustion techniques. Central to Mach’s innovation is the use of a new generation of fuel: hydrogen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hydrogen offers many benefits: it’s a versatile fuel that can be easily manufactured in the field, it can be interchangeable across all Mach systems, and, most importantly, it enables major advancements in range and power for projectiles as well as unparalleled loiter time and speed for aerial systems. Leveraging this, Mach is focused on developing a suite of oxyhydrogen defense platforms, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and aerial protection devices. With this innovative approach, Mach ultimately aims to solve the challenging problem of hypersonic defense.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve long partnered with companies that support US national security interests, such as SpaceX, Cohesity and Palo Alto Networks, among others. Today, we’re proud to continue this work and lead Mach’s seed round, representing our first investment in a hardware defense technology company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mach is a step-function advancement to the state of the defense industry. We’re incredibly optimistic about the future the <a href="https://www.machindustries.com/team">growing Mach team</a> is building and the potential to revolutionize defense technology.</p>

    <p>Discord started as a place where video game fans and other enthusiasts could chat and bond. Over time, it’s grown into a popular social media platform for millions of people, used for everything from work to fun. Even though the safety measures on Discord have improved since it first started, there are still some major gaps. This has, unfortunately, made the site a magnet for scam artists and mischief-makers who want to make money or create confusion.<br><br>So to stay safe out there, we have put together these best practices for our community:</p>
 
 Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): This adds an additional layer of security to your account by requiring a second verification form.<br> 
 Beware of Phishing Attempts: Phishing scams attempt to trick you into providing your personal information, such as your username and password. Never provide your login credentials in response to an unsolicited request.<br> 
 Watch Out for Suspicious Links: If a link seems suspicious, don’t click it. Scammers often use malware links to gain access to your account or personal information.<br> 
 Monitor Your Account Activity: Regularly check your account activity. If you notice any unfamiliar activity, report it immediately.<br> 
 Privacy Settings: Only allow direct messages and friend requests from people you know. Adjust your security settings to avoid getting contacted by potential scammers.<br> 
 Maintain Vigilance with QR Codes: It’s crucial to stay alert when encountering QR codes from unknown senders. Refrain from scanning any QR codes through your Discord app, except when trying to log in. Nonetheless, avoiding this practice is generally recommended, unless you are entirely sure you are accessing Discord’s official login page. 
 
<p>For issues within our Discord, community members should immediately bring those to the attention of our moderators and support staff if they see any activity that seems suspicious.</p>
 Common Discord Scams 
<p>Here are some typical scams encountered in the Discord environment:</p>
 
 Free Game Scams: These types of scams often involve advertisements for free games or in-game rewards. The scammer provides a link to access the ‘free’ content, which redirects you to a fraudulent login page or downloads malware onto your device. 
 Friend Request Scams: In these instances, a scammer sends a friend request and initiates a conversation. They will eventually either send a malicious link or request personal information. 
 Bot Scams: These scams involve bots that can send bulk messages containing phishing links or deceptive claims. It’s important to be cautious of unanticipated messages or friend requests from bots. 
 Cryptocurrency Scams: Be on guard against those who might tempt you into ‘foolproof’ cryptocurrency investments with promises of astronomical returns. These are often duplicitous schemes, known as rug pulls, or they harbor other malign intentions. 
 Nitro Scams: Scammers may promise free Nitro subscriptions in exchange for your account details or other information. Discord Nitro is a premium service, and there’s no way to obtain it for free. 
 QR Code Scams: Scammers could send a QR code and ask you to scan it for various reasons, such as part of an alleged verification process. Upon scanning, it could reroute you to a deceptive, cloned website resembling the Discord login page, exploiting this to obtain your login credentials/token. 
 The bottom line: The underlying similarity among all these scams is their objective to steal personal information or deliver malware. Always remember, if something appears too good to be true, it probably is. 
 
<p>In conclusion, while Discord has evolved from its initial purpose to become a multifaceted social media platform utilized by millions, it remains a target for those with ill intentions. However, by taking a proactive approach to your safety, you can help to shield yourself from these threats. By implementing these best practices, you can enjoy a more secure experience on Discord. Always remember your digital safety is in your hands. Stay informed, stay vigilant, and most importantly, stay safe!</p>

<p></p>



<p>Today, we’re excited to announce the launch of a newly redesigned Zcash community website (<a href="https://z.cash">https://z.cash</a>). We’ve taken your feedback to heart and have reimagined the site to better serve as an educational and onboarding resource for the Zcash community, and to reintroduce Zcash for a new era.</p>



<p>The new z.cash offers an enhanced user experience and a wealth of resources for Zcash enthusiasts and newcomers, alike. Key features of the new site include:</p>



 
 Learn Hub (“Learn Zcash”): An easy-to-navigate, built-to-grow source of information about Zcash, privacy, and blockchain technology. 



 Ecosystem Hub: A directory of stakeholders, contributors, and tools that fuel the growth and vibrancy of the Zcash ecosystem. 



 Community Hub: A home for upcoming events, news, and developments in the Zcash community. 



 Network Information Hub: Information about the operations and governance of the Zcash protocol. 
 



<p>This website relaunch is a milestone, but it’s also simply a start — a patch of land to grow a garden. In the coming months, we’ll begin working toward fostering greater community involvement with the ultimate goal of transitioning this site and other Zcash digital properties into shared public goods. To stay up-to-date on this forthcoming proposal and other news, follow Electric Coin Co. on social media and keep an eye on the Zcash <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/">community forums</a>.</p>



<p>ECC’s goal is to help build a world where billions of people are empowered with economic freedom through a fair and open currency. To the Zcash community, we appreciate all your ongoing support and your contributions to the ecosystem. We look forward to working together toward a more equitable and decentralized future for all.</p>

 Verida Storage Node Tokenomics — Part 1: Storage Node Economic Model&nbsp;Overview Verida Storage Node Tokenomics — Part 1: Storage Node Economic Model&nbsp;Overview<p>This article is a high level summary of the proposed storage node economic model to support the Verida network self-sovereign database storage infrastructure.</p><p>The Verida network is a self-sovereign “user-pays” model, whereby users pay for their own storage needs. In this way, “access to user data” is not the product, rather the product is the “security and protection” of user&nbsp;data.</p><p>The design is still in draft form and subject to revision prior to launch. Verida will be working with the community and expert partners to refine the model prior to full implementation.</p><p>To progress that work Verida has issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) process for independent parties to bid to provide analysis, modeling, designs, and implementation recommendations for the economic aspects of its protocol.</p> What is the Verida Data&nbsp;Economy? <p>The Verida Token (VDA) creates a data economy enabling secure interactions between accounts to facilitate secure data storage, trusted sharing, fast querying and trusted messaging.</p> Network Participants  End Users <p>Users interact with Verida by interacting with applications and creating DIDs. If users share or create data, they can earn VDA tokens through interactions with the Verida Network applications.</p> Applications <p>Builders create applications that leverage the Verida Network. These applications can earn tokens through end users interacting with the app, through network growth rewards for onboarding users, community incentive grants, and by self-hosting a node on the&nbsp;network.</p> DBStore Node Operators <p>The storage provider market works similarly to a normal storage network. Node operators must bond (i.e. through single-sided staking) VDA tokens to make their nodes discoverable. It is intended that the storage market self regulates itself through competitive forces as providers set their own storage&nbsp;prices.</p>The Verida Token (VDA) creates a data economy enabling secure interactions between accounts to facilitate secure data storage, trusted sharing, fast querying and trusted messaging. Data Storage Economics <p>The Verida network has the following storage objectives:</p>  Create a sustainable economic “user-pays” model  Maximize the geographical distribution of storage&nbsp;nodes  Maximize the availability and security of data stored on and across the&nbsp;network  Incentivize early adoption to bootstrap the&nbsp;network  <p>Users pay a monthly fee to access storage on the network. There are currently no charges for bandwidth.</p><p>Storage node operators earn fees, in arrears, for the storage capacity they provide to the network that is utilized by&nbsp;users.</p><p>A small transaction fee, similar to gas fees on blockchain networks, is intended to be retained by the Verida network to support its ongoing development and&nbsp;growth.</p> Building a self-sovereign data&nbsp;network <p>Verida enables a “self-sovereign” data network, so it’s essential that all stakeholders have control and choice. Users can choose which storage nodes they want to use for storing their data, while storage node operators have the choice to not provide their service to a particular user.</p>A self-sovereign data network, where users can choose which storage nodes they want to use for storing their&nbsp;data<p>This creates a free market that can evolve as the Verida Protocol matures and the network grows. Storage node operators can differentiate themselves by offering service level agreements, geographical coverage and eventually pricing.</p><p>The Verida network requires end users to pay for storage, but they need to be supported by the network and applications to ensure a smooth onboarding experience. Storage of user data in web2 is supported by centralized platforms that pay for the storage on behalf of the user and then earn revenue from other sources (such as advertising).</p><p>We are seeking to replicate the web2 model where users can start for free, but then move to a more sustainable user pays model once the user discovers the value of the network and its applications.</p><p>The network will sponsor the initial storage of a user when they join the network and then reward the user with VDA tokens as they bring meaningful value and utility to the network. These end user rewards can then be used to pay for storage on the&nbsp;network.</p> Crypto Economic Modeling for the Verida&nbsp;Network <p>Verida has issued an RFP to find a qualified independent vendor to provide analysis, modeling, designs, and implementation recommendations for the economic aspects of the Verida protocol and token&nbsp;design.</p><p>The RFP process is being managed by Dave Costenaro at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/build-well-consulting/">Build Well</a>. Dave previously worked at the CryptoEconLab at Protocol Labs, focusing on token incentives, tokenomics, mechanism design, network monitoring for Filecoin.</p><p>If you are interested in submitting a proposal to be considered for the engagement please check the following <a href="https://docsend.com/view/4hy7rjyug4n8f369">document</a>. This document also contains detailed information about the RFP’s Evaluation Criteria, Timeline, and Submission Instructions. If you have questions about submitting a proposal please get in touch with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidcostenaro/">Dave</a>.</p> What’s next <p>We hope this article has given an insight into the design of Verida Network economics. In the following weeks, we’ll be publishing follow up articles which go into further details on the economic model, covering storage fees, payments, claims and storage node infrastructure.</p><p>If you have questions or feedback please chat with us in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/664594912460668960/1092274729328574464">#storage-nodes channel</a> in the Verida discord.

  The New Language Model Stack  <p>How companies are bringing AI applications to life</p>   
	By Michelle Fradin and Lauren Reeder	 



Published June 14, 2023
  







 
<p>ChatGPT unleashed a tidal wave of innovation with large language models (LLMs). More companies than ever before are bringing the power of natural language interaction to their products. The adoption of language model APIs is creating a new stack in its wake. To better understand the applications people are building and the stacks they are using to do so, we spoke with 33 companies across the Sequoia network, from seed stage startups to large public enterprises. We spoke with them two months ago and last week to capture the pace of change. As many founders and builders are in the midst of figuring out their AI strategies themselves, we wanted to share our findings even as this space is rapidly evolving.&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. Nearly every company in the Sequoia network is building language models into their products.&nbsp;<br>We’ve seen magical auto-complete features for everything from code (Sourcegraph, Warp, Github) to data science (Hex). We’ve seen better chatbots for everything from customer support to employee support to consumer entertainment. Others are reimagining entire workflows with an AI-first lens: visual art (Midjourney), marketing (Hubspot, Attentive, Drift, Jasper, Copy, Writer), sales (Gong), contact centers (Cresta), legal (Ironclad, Harvey), accounting (Pilot), productivity (Notion), data engineering (dbt), search (Glean, Neeva), grocery shopping (Instacart), consumer payments (Klarna), and travel planning (Airbnb). These are just a few examples and they’re only the beginning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. The new stack for these applications centers on language model APIs, retrieval, and orchestration, but open source usage is also growing.&nbsp;</p>







 
 65% had applications in production, up from 50% two months ago, while the remainder are still experimenting.&nbsp; 



 94% are using a foundation model API. OpenAI’s GPT was the clear favorite in our sample at 91%, however Anthropic interest grew over the last quarter to 15%. (Some companies are using multiple models).&nbsp; 



 88% believe a retrieval mechanism, such as a vector database, would remain a key part of their stack. Retrieving relevant context for a model to reason about helps increase the quality of results, reduce “hallucinations” (inaccuracies), and solve data freshness issues. Some use purpose-built vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, Qdrant, Milvus, and many more), while others use pgvector or AWS offerings. 



 38% were interested in an LLM orchestration and application development framework like LangChain. Some use it for prototyping, while others use it in production. Adoption increased in the last few months.&nbsp; 



 Sub-10% were looking for tools to monitor LLM outputs, cost, or performance and A/B test prompts. We think interest in these areas may increase as more large companies and regulated industries adopt language models.&nbsp; 



 A handful of companies are looking into complementary generative technologies, such as combining generative text and voice. We also believe this is an exciting growth area.&nbsp; 



 15% built custom language models from scratch or open source, often in addition to using LLM APIs. Custom model training increased meaningfully from a few months ago. This requires its own stack of compute, model hub, hosting, training frameworks, experiment tracking and more from beloved companies like Hugging Face, Replicate, Foundry, Tecton, Weights &amp; Biases, PyTorch, Scale, and more. 
 



<p>Every practitioner we spoke with said AI is moving too quickly to have high confidence in the end-state stack, but there was consensus that LLM APIs will remain a key pillar, followed in popularity by retrieval mechanisms and development frameworks like LangChain. Open source and custom model training and tuning also seem to be on the rise. Other areas of the stack are important, but earlier in maturity.</p>
 







 
<p>3. Companies want to customize language models to their unique context.&nbsp;<br>Generalized language models are powerful, but not differentiating or sufficient for many use cases. Companies want to enable natural language interactions on their data—their developer docs, product inventory, HR or IT rules, etc. In some cases, companies want to customize their models to their users’ data as well: your personal notes, design layouts, data metrics or code base.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right now, there are three main ways to customize language models (for a deeper technical explanation, see <a href="https://build.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/db3f4859-cd30-4445-a0cd-553c3304f8e2">Andrej’s recent State of GPT talk</a> at Microsoft Build):&nbsp;</p>



 
 Train a custom model from scratch. Highest degree of difficulty.&nbsp;<br>This is the classical and hardest way to solve this problem. It typically requires highly skilled ML scientists, lots of relevant data, training infrastructure and compute. This is one of the primary reasons why historically much natural language processing innovation occurred within mega-cap tech companies. BloombergGPT is a great example of a custom model effort outside of a mega-cap tech company, which used resources on Hugging Face and other open source tooling. As open source tooling improves and more companies innovate with LLMs, we expect to see more custom and pre-trained model usage.&nbsp; 



 Fine-tune a base model. Medium degree of difficulty.&nbsp;<br>This is updating the weights of a pre-trained model through additional training with further proprietary or domain-specific data. Open source innovation is also making this approach increasingly accessible, but it still often requires a sophisticated team. Some practitioners privately admit fine-tuning is much harder than it sounds and can have unintended consequences like model drift and “breaking” the model’s other skills without warning. While this approach has a greater chance of becoming more common, it is currently still out of reach for most companies. But again, this is changing quickly.&nbsp; 



 Use a pre-trained model and retrieve relevant context. Lowest degree of difficulty.&nbsp;<br>People often think they want a model fine-tuned just for them, when really they just want the model to reason about their information at the right time. There are many ways to provide the model the right information at the right time: make a structured query to a SQL database, search across a product catalog, call some external API or use embeddings retrieval. The benefit of embeddings retrieval is that it makes unstructured data easily searchable using natural language. Technically, this is done by taking data, turning it into embeddings, storing those in a vector database, and when a query occurs, searching those embeddings for the most relevant context, and providing that to the model. This approach helps you hack the model’s limited context window, is less expensive, solves the data freshness problem (e.g. ChatGPT doesn’t know about the world after September 2021), and it can be done by a solo developer without formal machine learning training. Vector databases are useful because at high scale they make storing, searching and updating embeddings easier. So far, we’ve observed larger companies stay within their enterprise cloud agreements and use tools from their cloud provider, while startups tend to use purpose-built vector databases. However, this space is highly dynamic. Context windows are growing (hot off the presses, OpenAI just expanded to 16K, and Anthropic has launched a 100K token context window). Foundational models and cloud databases may embed retrieval directly into their services. We’re watching closely as this market evolves.&nbsp; 
 



<p>4. Today, the stack for LLM APIs can feel separate from the custom model training stack, but these are blending together over time.<br>It can sometimes feel like we have a tale of two stacks: the stack to leverage LLM APIs (more closed source, and geared towards developers) versus the stack to train custom language models (more open source, and historically geared towards more sophisticated machine learning teams). Some have wondered whether LLMs being readily available via API meant companies would do less of their own custom training. So far, we’re seeing the opposite. As interest in AI grows and open source development accelerates, many companies become increasingly interested in training and fine-tuning their own models. We think the LLM API and custom model stacks will increasingly converge over time. For example, a company might train its own language model from open source, but supplement with retrieval via a vector database to solve data freshness issues. Smart startups building tools for the custom model stack are also working on extending their products to become more relevant to the LLM API revolution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>5. The stack is becoming increasingly developer-friendly.<br>Language model APIs put powerful ready-made models in the hands of the average developer, not just machine learning teams. Now that the population working with language models has meaningfully expanded to all developers, we believe we’ll see more developer-oriented tooling. For example, LangChain helps developers build LLM applications by abstracting away commonly occurring problems: combining models into higher-level systems, chaining together multiple calls to models, connecting models to tools and data sources, building agents that can operate those tools, and helping avoid vendor lock-in by making it easier to switch language models. Some use LangChain for prototyping, while others continue to use it in production.&nbsp;</p>



<p>6. Language models need to become more trustworthy (output quality, data privacy, security) for full adoption.&nbsp;<br>Before fully unleashing LLMs in their applications, many companies want better tools for handling data privacy, segregation, security, copyright, and monitoring model outputs. Companies in regulated industries from fintech to healthcare are especially focused on this. They are asking for software to alert, or ideally prevent, models from generating errors/hallucinations, discriminatory content, dangerous content, or exposing new security vulnerabilities. Robust Intelligence in particular has been tackling many of these challenges, with customers including Paypal, Expedia and others. Some companies are also concerned about how data shared with models is used for training: for instance, few understand that ChatGPT Consumer data is default used for training, while ChatGPT Business and the API data are not. As policies get clarified and more guardrails go into place, language models will be better trusted, and we may see another step change in adoption.</p>



<p>7. Language model applications will become increasingly <br>multi-modal.&nbsp;<br>Companies are already finding interesting ways to combine multiple generative models to great effect: Chatbots that combine text and speech generation unlock a new level of conversational experience. Text and voice models can be combined to help you to quickly overdub a video recording mistake instead of re-recording the whole thing. Models themselves are becoming increasingly multi-modal. We can imagine a future of rich consumer and enterprise AI applications that combine text, speech/audio, and image/video generation to create more engaging user experiences and accomplish more complex tasks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>8. It’s still early.&nbsp;<br>AI is just beginning to seep into every crevice of technology. Only 65% of those surveyed were in production today, and many of these are relatively simple applications. As more companies launch LLM applications, new hurdles will arise—creating more opportunities for founders. The infrastructure layer will continue to evolve rapidly for the next several years. If only half the demos we see make it to production, we’re in for an exciting ride ahead. It’s thrilling to see founders from our earliest-stage Arc investment to Zoom all laser focused on the same thing: delighting users with AI.</p>



<p>If you’re founding a company that will become a key pillar of the language model stack or an AI-first application, Sequoia would love to meet you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you to all the founders and builders who contributed to this work, and Sequoia Partners Charlie Curnin, Pat Grady, Sonya Huang, Andrew Reed, Bill Coughran and friends at OpenAI for their input and review.</p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of the first stable, audited version of Zebra, <a href="https://zfnd.org/zebra/download/">Zebra 1.0.0.</a></p>



 What Zebra Does and Why it Matters 



<p>Zebra, the first Zcash node to be written entirely in Rust, can be used to join the Zcash peer-to-peer network, validate and broadcast transactions, and maintain the Zcash blockchain state in a more distributed manner. This alternative node implementation has been written from the ground up and avoids any technical baggage from the bitcoin legacy code. Diversity in node implementations and platforms help to strengthen the resilience of the network from targeted attacks affecting a particular codebase, programming language or operating system.</p>



 Building Critical Privacy Infrastructure in Rust: Modern, Memory-Safe  



<p>Zebra is developed in Rust, which is a memory-safe language, and thus less likely to be affected by memory-safety security bugs that could compromise the environment where it is run. Rust emphasizes performance and concurrency and these are qualities we have aimed to achieve in Zebra as well.</p>



 A New Paradigm for Privacy Infrastructure Development  



<p>Unlike zcashd, which originated as a Bitcoin Core fork and inherited its monolithic architecture, Zebra has a modular, library-first design, with the intent that each component can be independently reused outside of the zebrad full node. For instance, the zebra-network crate containing the network stack can also be used to implement anonymous transaction relay, network crawlers, or other functionality, without requiring a full node. With Zebra, we have redesigned our network layer to be fully compatible with Zcash and at the same time easier to maintain, more secure, and have better performance.</p>



 Future Plans  



<p>While this is a major milestone for Zebra, it’s just the beginning! There is a lot more to do before Zebra can fulfill all the use cases that the zcashd node is currently used for. We want to hear from the Zcash community regarding which use cases and functionality they would like to see prioritized for integration into Zebra. Please share your feedback and ideas on the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zebra-1-0-0-stable-release/44867">Zcash Community Forum</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 



<p></p>



<p>We would like to thank the following current and past ZF team members for their contributions to Zebra. Without their work and support we would not have reached this milestone today:</p>



<p>Josh Cincinnati, Antonie Hodge, Deirdre Connolly, Teor, Pili Guerra, Alfredo Garcia, Marek Bielik, Conrado P. L. Gouvêa, Gustavo Valverde, Arya Solhi, George Tankersley, Henry de Valence, Jane Lusby, Janito, Vaqueiro Ferreira Filho, Fungai Matambanadzo</p>



<p>We’d also like to thank the ECC team for their contributions to Zebra in the form of both code and code reviews, as well as the advice and support they’ve provided to the ZF team, and those community members who have <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/graphs/contributors">contributed in various ways</a>, including code, fixes, and typo corrections.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are excited to announce our partnership with Auros, a global algorithmic trading and market-making firm, have entered a strategic partnership that will increase widespread access to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/horizen/">$ZEN</a> in preparation for the launch of the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io">EON</a> ecosystem, Horizen’s new EVM-compatible smart contracting platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The partnership is set to drive significant growth for the EON ecosystem. Enhanced liquidity for the $ZEN token across centralized and decentralized exchanges, underpinning many functionalities of the EON ecosystem, will increase opportunities for traders, DeFi users, and builders to participate in one of the fastest growing layer-0. Besides instant liquidity provision, this long-term partnership will extend beyond the $ZEN token to future projects building on EON, providing bespoke support based on the unique needs of each project.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Liquidity for any ecosystem token is not only essential for seamless trading, but also key to unlocking the utility and potential of innovative smart contract platforms, advancing the overall growth of digital assets. Bringing our proprietary trading technology and strategies to Horizen’s EON, we are proud to expand the availability of liquidity in both the platform and the $ZEN token, delivering more value for all of its users. Beyond liquidity provision, this partnership also represents a significant step and a new hope for the decentralised ecosystem as we jointly work towards a more resilient future for digital assets.”</p>
– Ben Roth, Chief Information Officer and Co-founder of Auros </blockquote>



<p>As a major market participant trading upwards of several billion dollars daily and integrated with dozens of venues, this partnership is underpinned by Auros’ algorithmic and high-frequency heritage. Their distinctive, partnership-oriented approach to liquidity provision is designed from the ground up, incentivizing Auros to ensure that the liquidity for the token matches the growth of Horizen EON.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We are thrilled to join forces with Auros, a market leader in algorithmic trading and market-making services. Their expertise in bespoke liquidity solutions will undoubtedly enhance the EON ecosystem. More importantly, the partnership deepens cornerstone liquidity in the ecosystem, delivering more value to our users and enabling seamless trading experiences that will drive the growth of EON as the premier platform for traders and DeFi enthusiasts alike. Together, we are committed to shaping the future of decentralized finance and setting new industry standards.”</p>
– Rob Viglione, Co-founder of Horizen and CEO of Horizen Labs</blockquote>



<p>Horizen’s EON is a fully EVM-compatible smart contracting platform and is the first of many smart contract sidechains on the Horizen ecosystem. The integration of Auros’ market-making services will serve to cement EON as an accessible yet valuable network for traders and DeFi users.</p>



<p>Horizen EON is currently live on its permanent public testnet, <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/status/gobi">Gobi</a>, and is supported by a network of products, integrations, and tools, including Auros. With the collaboration between Horizen and Auros, <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/ecosystem">the EON ecosystem</a> is set to welcome a wealth of dApps and services in the coming months.</p>

<p>A way forward for privacy in&nbsp;CBDC’s.</p><p>In a world where digital transactions are becoming increasingly prevalent, ensuring privacy and data protection has emerged as a critical&nbsp;concern.</p><p>As governments and financial institutions explore the development of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), we at Aztec Labs aim to stand at the forefront of educating decision makers on the privacy revolution in digital transactions.</p><p>We hope our cutting-edge approach to Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) will be considered by the Bank of England, particularly in response to the recent consultation on the digital&nbsp;pound.</p><p>In February, 2023 the Bank of England and His Majesty’s Treasury published a consultation paper titled “<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2023/the-digital-pound-consultation-paper">The digital pound: a new form of money for households and businesses?</a>”</p><blockquote>Read the Bank of England and Treasury’s consultation paper and accompanying technology working paper&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2023/the-digital-pound-consultation-paper">here</a>.</blockquote><p>In this blog post, we delve into the context of the consultation and highlight Aztec Labs’ responses that we hope have shift the digital pound’s design toward incorporating blockchain-based privacy.</p> Consultation on the Digital&nbsp;Pound <p>The digital pound, a proposed central bank digital currency (CBDC) by the Bank of England, has sparked considerable discussion about its design, functionality, and associated privacy implications.</p><p>The Bank of England has sought feedback and ideas through an open consultation process, and as a leading provider of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies, we at Aztec Labs are proud to present our vision for a privacy-enhancing digital pound that aligns with the highest standards of data protection.</p> Aztec: A Paradigm Shift in Privacy and Data Protection <p>Aztec Labs’ response to the consultation underscores our commitment to incorporating advanced PETs into the digital pound’s infrastructure.</p><p>Our privacy-centric approach centers around the use of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) — a powerful cryptographic tool that enables the verification of statements without revealing sensitive underlying data. At Aztec Labs we’re focused on researching at the forefront of ZKP’s, which have significant advantages over other PETs in terms of technical feasibility, production use, compliance, interoperability, and data protection.</p> ZKP Tooling: Empowering Practical Implementation <p>To facilitate the practical implementation of ZKPs within the digital pound, Aztec Labs is funding the development of Noir, an open-source programming language.</p><p>Noir streamlines the development of ZKP applications, making it accessible for developers to integrate compliant privacy solutions to blockchain applications without extensive knowledge of cryptography.</p><p>This user-friendly tooling eliminates the need for developers to focus on circuit-building complexities and empowers them to concentrate on designing the logic behind ZKP applications. Additionally, Noir’s compatibility with various proving systems ensures future-proof integration and scalability.</p> Applicability of ZKPs to the Digital Pound: Privacy and AML-CTF&nbsp;Measures <p>There is an inherent tension between ensuring Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) measures while safeguarding consumer data privacy. Previous solutions are either airtight, forgoing compliance, or involve installing data backdoors, compromising user&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>ZKPs offer a solution that allows the Bank to perform the necessary AML and CTF checks without compromising individuals’ privacy. By leveraging ZKPs, the digital pound can maintain robust compliance measures while protecting users’ personal data, surpassing the privacy levels of traditional digital money&nbsp;systems.</p> ZKPs for Compliance and User Privacy: A Win-Win&nbsp;Solution <p>We illustrate the practical application of ZKPs in verifying compliance with regulatory requirements. Through ZKPs, end consumers can provide proofs of fulfilling various conditions, such as valid Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, absence from sanctions lists, and adherence to transaction limits.</p><p>These proofs can be verified in milliseconds, ensuring efficient and secure transactions. Furthermore, ZKPs empower the Bank to oversee the digital pound’s operation while mitigating risks associated with relying solely on compliance from payment interface providers (PIP’s).</p> Tiered Access and User Control: Fostering Financial Inclusion <p>Aztec Labs recognizes the importance of tiered access to the digital pound based on user identity information. By implementing ZKPs, the digital pound can link the level of user identification with specific account features and transaction limits.</p><p>This approach enables financial inclusion, allowing users with limited identification documents or means to access the digital pound and enjoy its benefits. ZKPs’ role in tiered access ensures both privacy and compliance, providing users with control over their personal transaction data.</p> Privacy-Enhancing; Future-Proof <p>Without base-layer privacy protection, digital currencies risk headwinds to adoption, as they may be even more privacy exposing than current encrypted financial systems.</p><p>Aztec Labs firmly advocates for embedding privacy-enhancing techniques into the digital pound’s design to offer users greater control over their privacy preferences. We strongly believe zero-knowledge protocols as a category are the most effective technology for achieving the digital pound’s policy objectives while protecting privacy.</p><p>Furthermore, we believe deployment of the digital pound on the Ethereum blockchain harnesses its broadly recognized benefits of transparency, innovation, and global integration. This approach would not only bolster privacy and security but also position the pound as a prominent fiat currency in the digital&nbsp;economy.</p> Conclusion <p>Aztec Labs’ responses to the consultation on the digital pound present an innovative and transformative approach to privacy in digital transactions. By harnessing the power of Zero-Knowledge Proofs and their proprietary tooling, Noir, Aztec Labs offers a practical and efficient solution to address privacy concerns while ensuring compliance with AML, CTF, and KYC requirements. Our vision for a privacy-enhancing digital pound, coupled with potential deployment on the Ethereum blockchain, heralds a new era of secure, inclusive, and forward-looking digital currency.</p><p>As the world moves toward digitalization, we are leading the charge in protecting individual privacy and data security for digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Read our full response&nbsp;here:</p> Join the Conversation <p>Aztec is building at the cutting edge of blockchain privacy and encryption.

   A reminder in the command line (or Debug Console) help that “dumpprivkey” and “dumpwallet” does not include private keys for stealth addresses. “Use wallet.dat file or seed words for complete backup”. This note is also now added to the output of dumpwallet, to be sure. 
   The “Overview” wallet page in the GUI wallet is where we normally see a list of transactions, but when someone starts the wallet without any transactions yet, it shows some information to help them get started! People can forget all about these things once a single transaction appears, and there was no way to see that page again! You might know it as the <a>“Looks like you are new here” page</a>! So a helpful contributor made a very neat way of displaying it again whenever you want, which also as a side-effect made the existing in-wallet FAQ much more accessible! The link to Veil.tools now works there too.

 The Veil official TWITTER promo for MAY 2023 has completed 
<p>A 10,000 Veil bounty was paid to the indefatigable Veil enthusiast “VEILionaire | @veilminer007”! “@C0nt1ng3nt” came in a very worthy second, and received a 500 Veil bounty, while “Alex mail | @Alex_m_here” is offering his third place prize of 50 Veil (which we will double) to someone else who retweets and includes their Veil stealth address and follows his Twitter account and ours! It’s presently the pinned post on <a href="https://twitter.com/ProjectVeil">@ProjectVeil on Twitter</a> — <a href="https://twitter.com/ProjectVeil/status/1663726287582642179?s=20">The exact tweet is here</a>! Our favorite Veil meme artists are therefore currently VEILionaire and C0nt1ng3nt, with “Alex mail” providing enthusiastic support! 😀</p>

 Reminder that miners on Veil are currently SOLO mining ProgPoW without a pool 
<p>With the Veil price still a bargain, there was not enough money in it for our appreciated former ProgPow pool WoolyPooly to keep supporting the coin. There was another pool that started not long ago for RandomX, <a href="https://fastpool.xyz/veil-rx/">fastpool.xyz/</a>, remind us if there are any others!
SHA256D is still solo CPU mining. No ASICs developed. This would and will change with a much better Veil price, as incentives would make it happen.</p>

 TWITTER alternatives 
<p>Results from Twitter have not been up to expectations, so we would like to encourage people (and this is a call to the Veil team also) to get active on other platforms such as:</p>
 
   YOUTUBE <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@VEILProject/">@VEILProject</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@VeilCryptoPrivacy">@VeilCryptoPrivacy</a>

   TUMBLR <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/veil-project">veil-project</a> 
   TRUTH SOCIAL - Maybe try this too. <a href="https://truthsocial.com/">truthsocial.com</a> USA only? 
   Tried Parler.com but it doesn’t even load any more. 
   Please let us know (in our <a href="http://discord.veil-project.com">DISCORD</a>) about any other platforms worth trying! 
 

 Core development 
<p>More developers are coming in, but if you know of people who have an outstanding understanding of Applied Cryptography, ZK Proofs, zkSNARKs, and such things, like serious mathematicians, and have goals aligned with the Veil, cryptocurrency and Bitcoin community, they would be ideal candidates. We have a number of textbook PDFs for others who would like a refresher.</p>

<p>RingCT staking, while running on the development network is still awaiting some bug fixes and further rigorous testing.</p>

 The markets 
<p>The VEIL price and volume, last time checked on CoinGecko, there seems to be a bug in their data that suggests that not only there hasn’t been any volume for six days, (not true), that the price is $151.7 BILLION DOLLARS and the volume $207.6 million dollars! 🤪 Also NOT true!</p>

<p>On the other hand, on CoinMarketCap they are using PROBIT’s data, which in fact has days of zero volume, while TradeOgre’s price and volume is perfectly correct, just not what CoinGecko is currently showing you!</p>

<p><a>CoinGecko-priceError</a></p>

<p>Please check the Veil markets directly for the time being!</p>

 Verida Wallet — The Ultimate Guide to Getting&nbsp;Started <p>With the growing adoption of web3 and the emergence of wallets, Verida has built a digital wallet that holds and protects its users’ crypto as well as private encrypted data. In this article, we will take a closer look at Verida Wallet, its key features and benefits, and how it&nbsp;works.</p><p><a href="http://verida.io">Verida Wallet</a> is more than just a crypto wallet; it’s a gateway to a new world of decentralized identity, allowing users to control their personal data, manage digital credentials and securely communicate with other applications and&nbsp;users.</p><p>Data is now one of the most important assets for both individuals and corporations in the modern digital age. Data privacy and security have, however, grown to be very important issues for many people due to the rise in data breaches and the exploitation of personal information.</p><p>As a potential response to these issues, Verida has built a digital wallet that is capable of decentralized data management with evolved sharing systems that give users more control over their personal data and more effective methods of sharing it with others. You know the saying “Not your keys, not your crypto”; for Verida we extend that to data, “not your keys, not your&nbsp;data”.</p> Things you should know about the Verida&nbsp;Wallet <p>Verida Wallet is built on top of the <a href="http://verida.network">Verida Protocol</a>. It is a decentralized, user-centric wallet that allows users to securely store, manage, and share their data across multiple decentralized applications (dApps) and platforms.</p><p>The wallet uses the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">w3c decentralized identifier (DID) standard</a> for maximum compatibility. User identities can be found via a public address or a friendly username. Users can manage multiple identities to separate their anonymous work and even personal information. Each identity has a public profile, you can share as much or as little information as you like, you can also connect web2 accounts and crypto wallets to showcase who you are to the world. A built-in multi-chain crypto wallet supports Polygon, Ethereum, NEAR and Algorand.</p><p>Verida Wallet is a user-focused wallet for decentralized data management and helping you gain control over your personal&nbsp;data.</p> Core Features of the Verida&nbsp;Wallet <p>Verida Wallet is a mobile application with a comprehensive data management platform for end-users that provides private key management and a user-friendly interface for interacting with the <a href="http://verida.network">Verida network</a> and other supported networks. It consists of several components, such&nbsp;as:</p> Decentralized Identity <p>The Verida Wallet allows users to create new decentralized identities, create new blockchain wallets, manage private keys, and facilitate single sign-on which provides simple, consensual authentication and authorization across an ecosystem of decentralized applications.</p> Zero-Knowledge and Verifiable Credentials <p>The wallet also supports verifiable credentials that meet the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">w3c specification</a>, the wallet supports credentials on the <a href="https://cheqd.io/">Cheqd network</a>, Verida Network, as well as zero-knowledge credentials on the <a href="https://polygon.technology/polygon-id">Polygon ID network</a>. Users can connect and receive their credentials, store them on the Verida Network and then use them to prove information about themselves, either in a zero-knowledge way or using standard credentials</p> Crypto Tokens, NFTs and Transactions <p>Users earn incentives in the form of Verida token rewards by using the Verida network. You can perform transactions and manage crypto on your favourite blockchains. Verida Wallet allows users to interact with any supported blockchain by signing transactions, managing NFTs/Collectibles, and viewing or minting Soulbound Tokens/Badges.</p> User Data <p>With the Verida Wallet, you are in control of your personal data. You can apply a set of delegated permissions when sharing it with other users and services.</p><p>Users can take ownership of their data that exists on web2 platforms by storing the encrypted data on the Verida Network in the wallet, and this data is then available for web3 applications to request access. It also provides users with a secure and decentralized storage solution for managing their personal&nbsp;data.</p> Encrypted Inbox <p>The Inbox feature, a secure data inbox built into the Verida Wallet allows messages, requests, and data to be safely sent or received to other users or third-party services. The inbox can be used by to grant permission to requests for accessing user data or synchronize large amounts of data. Users can receive notifications and messages and respond to requests from their&nbsp;inbox.</p> Profiles <p>Profiles in the Verida Wallet allows users to create and manage both public and private profiles that can be shared with third parties. Users can manage their public profile, which contains information such as name (or pseudonym), avatar and profile description. The public profile is available for reuse across applications.</p> Single Sign&nbsp;On <p>The wallet also supports QR code single sign-on with rapid onboarding for users that don’t have a crypto wallet. You can easily and quickly sign-on to take advantage of the wallet features to manage and store your data securely.</p> WalletConnect <p>With the WalletConnect (v1 &amp; v2) integration, the Verida Wallet has enhanced security for crypto transactions and provide a secure, reliable connection to dapps on multiple&nbsp;chains.</p> How to Set Up Verida&nbsp;Wallet <p>Verida Wallet is a powerful and flexible platform for managing decentralized identity, personal data and crypto. Built on the Verida Network, Verida Wallet provides users with a decentralized and secure way to manage their data across multiple decentralized applications and platforms.</p><p>Let’s walk you through the steps of getting started with Verida Wallet, from creating a new DID to managing your profiles and&nbsp;data.</p> Step 1: Download and Install Verida&nbsp;Wallet <p>The first step in getting started with Verida Wallet is to download and install the app on your device.

Then record your seed phrases in a secure&nbsp;place.</p> Step 3: Set Up Your&nbsp;Profiles <p>After creating a new Identity, the next step is to set up your profile. Profiles are a key feature of Verida Wallet and allow you to create and manage both public and private profiles that can be shared with third parties.

<p>It is strongly believed that blockchain technology can be the missing puzzle piece to explicate the crossing of digitalisation and sustainability. Blockchain technology gives the opportunity to focus on the complete triple bottom line, instead of on single pillars.</p>



<p>In today’s business landscape, sustainability has become a key differentiating factor for enterprises. The upcoming booms are rooted in digitalisation and sustainability. Still, there are problems with current sustainability approaches. One major problem is greenwashing, where organisations claim their initiative to be way more sustainable than it actually is. Additionally, sustainability strategies often only serve single sustainability pillars, instead of sustainability as a whole. More and more enterprises are now investing in digital technologies as a means to achieve their sustainability goals. </p>



 Three pillars of sustainability 



<p>This article is an introduction to a deeper explanation found in our ebook: <a href="https://zaisan.io/ebooks/using-blockchain-for-sustainability/">Using Blockchain for Sustainability.</a></p>







<p>Often, sustainability is solely associated with the environmental aspect, but it encompasses much more than that. In essence, sustainability is about achieving continuous growth within an enterprise. It is built upon three fundamental pillars that are often referred to as the “triple bottom line” (TBL).</p>



 
 Economic Sustainability (Profit): Includes all aspects within the business, which aim towards creating economic growth without colliding with environmental and social needs 



 Social Sustainability (People): Includes all social features a business should imply, in order to create a planet driven by equal and inclusive manners 



 Environmental Sustainability (Planet): Can be defined as the attention of a business to act and adjust in favor of the planet 
 



<p>All in all, it is the mixture of all three pillars that allow for a fitting plan of action. The idea of creating shared value is a good representation of what sustainability consists of. Whilst focusing on the triple bottom line, businesses simultaneously do such whilst still aiming for profitability, cost-effectiveness, and risk mitigation. So where can blockchain play a role, to cater to all those goals?</p>



 ESG 



<p>Another term that has gained popularity is ESG goals (Environmental, Social, and Governance). ESG goals primarily focus on monitoring and controlling business activities and business performance toward achieving sustainability. In contrast, the triple bottom line looks at the business from a wider perspective by taking into account sustainability beyond the four walls of the organisation.</p>



 A power couple: Blockchain technology driving sustainability 



<p>More and more have jumped on the blockchain bandwagon and the interest is assumed to only increase in the future. To keep it short and simple: the main function of blockchain technology is secure data storage and information sharing (transactions) across a wide network. The main reason, as to why blockchain can be a key to sustainability improvements are its characteristics of being:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Decentralised 



 Transparent 



 Accessible 



 Secure 
 



<p>All in all, blockchain technology’s transparent and decentralised nature allows for open communication and traceability of data. It can drive internal efficiency through automation and smart contracts and embraces financial and social inclusion. These are only a few of blockchain technology’s many advantages concerning sustainability.</p>



 Key takeaways 



 
 Businesses are investing in digital technologies to achieve their sustainability goals. 
 



 Economic insights 



 
 Blockchain technology’s transparent and decentralised nature allows for open communication, internal efficiency through automation and smart contracts, and financial and social inclusion, making it a key factor in achieving sustainability.&nbsp; 



 Using blockchain technology for supply chain management can help businesses achieve their sustainability goals by promoting a circular economy, increasing transparency, and improving efficiency through automation with smart contracts. 
 



 Social insights 



 
 Social sustainability is becoming increasingly important, and blockchain technology can help with financial and social inclusion by promoting trust and accountability and enabling equitable and sustainable development. 



 DAOs offer businesses an approach to decision-making that includes contributions from anyone in the community, promoting diversity and strengthening of community management. 



 Blockchain technology can be used for charity purposes to build trust with donors by providing a transparent ecosystem where donations can be tracked and verified. 
 



 Environmental insights 



 
 Decentralised waste management systems through blockchain can streamline coordination with waste removal organisations, incentivise environmentally friendly waste disposal practices, and engage consumers in businesses’ sustainability efforts. 



 Blockchain technology can help create a more efficient and sustainable renewable energy market, providing cost-effectiveness, regulatory compliance, and competitive advantage for organisations investing in renewable energy. 



 Carbon credits and offsets can be traded on the blockchain, creating an additional revenue stream for organisations and demonstrating their commitment to environmental sustainability. 



 Barriers to the adoption of blockchain include a lack of knowledge, a steep learning curve, data compliance, the conception of blockchain as a major energy consumer, and cost-efficiency.

<p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>It's the end of the month again. As such, it’s time to reflect on the progress we made in the last month.</p><p>Let’s start with our monthly update.</p> Tech Updates  v1 fees and rewards <p>Panther v1's fees and rewards are fully developed, now being tested using simulations to replicate real-world product activity cases. This is a milestone that will inform many decisions for Panther's release, as well as critical for the user experience throughout the product.</p><p>Furthermore, we have made significant progress on our relayers integration.</p> Gasless transactions and Relayers <p>Panther’s relayers are now also developed and interacting with external entities, enabling many testing use cases. Panther is also creating dApp nodes to support our activity in a decentralized way. Acting as intermediaries between Panther's privacy layer and the decentralized network, relayers support our privacy-preserving stack by obfuscating the origin of transactions, making it difficult for third parties to trace them.</p><p>Relayers can also be used to pay for gas in users’ name, adding an extra layer of anonymity to transactions. This integration is expected to significantly increase privacy by making it harder to link transactions to specific users.</p> v1 prototyping Panther’s v1 is underway!!<p>v1 is not an MVP for Panther. It is a self-contained, finalized DeFi product that will protect users’ data and open new possibilities for institutional and retail users.</p><p>With v1's visual components finalized, just a few features are pending definition. We're nearing a point where prototypes are complete and gearing up towards upcoming releases. Some key parameters are also finalized, and, as mentioned above, we’re completing the fees and rewards schemes that will support the protocol. The main goal is to present a system that balances flexibility with maximum utility for $ZKP.</p><p>More work is also focusing on the mechanisms through which users exchange PRPs for $zZKP and their associated rewards. The main goal of this system is to balance on-chain privacy's value with utility, empowering users to make the most out of protocol rewards.</p><p>Finally, progress is ongoing with compliance support through third-party Web3 integrations that leverage ZK tech.</p> Panther’s SNARK: PMONK <p>Our CTO and Chief Scientist, Anish Mohammed, presented a research paper on Panther’s SNARK: PMONK (Permutations over Monomial-bases for Oecumenical Noninteractive arguments of Knowledge), at the Leading Privacy Alliance’s summit in Istanbul, Turkey.</p><p>You can watch his presentation on Youtube:</p><p>Keep an eye out for more updates on PMONK and other advancements in the Panther Protocol ecosystem! The published paper by the Panther team <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/788.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">can also be found here.</a></p> Governance <p>We are thrilled to announce that the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/dao/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther DAO</a> has officially approved <a href="https://snapshot.org/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0xcb272ecdb9e9f820772c193ebbd3bb05b8d80c11d00735925c8d5e38355ef9a5">PIP-14</a>.

Governance framework The community’s framework for building a more robust and decentralized Panther Protocol.<p>A large part of PIP-14 involved the Panther community establishing a new governance framework and formalizing it.</p><p>This landmark development follows extensive discussions on our <a href="https://forum.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">community forum</a> about the need for a decentralized, high-level decision-making process, and accountability for non-team members. The governance framework also formalizes implicit rules and guidelines for the community and technology contributors to collaborate in a decentralized way where every community member can make their voice heard.</p><p>We <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-dao-approves-pip-14-a-milestone-in-project-decentralization/">wrote about the significance of PIP-14 here.</a></p> Ecosystem  Events <p>Co-founder Oliver Gale is scheduled to speak at the <a href="https://twitter.com/EBlockchainCon?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">European Blockchain Convention</a> 2023 in Barcelona!</p><p>Oliver will be sharing his perspectives on privacy with the Blockchain Conference's 5000 Web3 ecosystem attendees.</p><p>Let us know if you'd like to schedule a meet!</p>#EBC2023 with Oliver Gale<p>Oliver also participated in the <a href="https://familyofficesummit.co/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Global Family Office Summit 2023</a>, organized by GDA Capital &amp; SD - Global Markets.

<p>SAN FRANCISCO, CA, June 1st, 2023 — X Reality Safety Initiative (XRSI), a leading non-profit organization globally recognized for advocating safety, privacy, security, and inclusion in the domain of emerging technology, today unveils a significant brand evolution.

The rebranding signifies that the initiative has transformed into a global movement, requiring the power of human intelligence and detailed research to guarantee a safe and inclusive technological evolution worldwide.</p>



<p>“Our transformation into XRSI – The Human Intelligence in the Loop, embodies our collective obligation and united strength in building trust and fortifying our digital landscapes,” states Kavya Pearlman, the founder &amp; CEO of XRSI. “We stand at a crucial crossroads where emerging technologies such as AI, VR/AR/MR, and BCI are redefining our world and increasingly automating it. It’s imperative that our network of human intelligence remains vigilant, informed, and actively involved. We are a passionate community deeply concerned about humanity, thoroughly studying the impacts of decisions being made to advance emerging technologies on both individuals and societies. We are the individuals who care deeply and comprehend the consequences of our choices. We are XRSI.”</p>

<p>In an era where trust is diminishing and the consultancy industry often falls short, XRSI’s commitment to promoting mutual understanding and collective intelligence has become increasingly crucial. By emphasizing the importance of a dedicated human intelligence network and empowering communities and governments with informed solutions, XRSI fortifies our digital future.</p>



<p>Valentino Megale, President of XRSI-Europe, the European counterpart headquartered in Italy, states, “For a well-balanced, secure, and inclusive technological advancement, we need the commitment and vision of XRSI.

      An outsider’s path to financial inclusion         
	By Michael Gold	 



Published June 2, 2023
        Sebastian Siemiatkowski has steered Klarna through waves of turmoil in buy now, pay later.      



 
<p>Burger King is the kind of company that rarely, if ever, tops lists of inspirational wellsprings for tech entrepreneurs. Yet Sebastian Siemiatkowski, founder and CEO of Swedish fintech insurgent Klarna, discovered plenty to admire when he worked at the fast-food giant as a teenager.</p>



<p>“These restaurant chains have incredibly meticulous processes,” Siemiatkowski enthuses. “They don’t have the advantages of a software firm; they are thin-margin businesses that are always squeezed. I realize now after running my own business for so long how well-engineered those kinds of systems are.”</p>



<p>If Siemiatkowski’s two years flipping burgers gave him a taste for the rigors of a well-oiled corporate machine, it also helped crystallize a relationship that would prove pivotal—that with his Klarna co-founder, Niklas Adalberth. Although Adalberth would eventually leave the company in 2015, the two boys’ formative experiences in the literal boiler room sparked a friendship that would evolve over the course of a round-the-world excursion, a failed entrepreneurship competition and the ultimate founding of Klarna in 2005.</p>



<p>“Niklas gave me a fantastic gift: in my youth, I was always convinced that I was right, while Niklas was always able to show me when I was wrong,” Siemiatkowski says. “He was this amazingly patient, focused, solid person, while I could be quite emotionally all over the place.”</p>



<blockquote>

Sebastian Siemiatkowski</blockquote>



<p>Siemiatkowski chalks this characteristic up to his upbringing as a Polish immigrant in Sweden. His parents fled the Communist bloc in 1980, becoming a minor cause célèbre in Swedish media due to the daughter they had to leave in Poland as they worked to overcome immigration hurdles. Siemiatkowski’s older sister would not be able to join the family until a year later, when Siemiatkowski was a few months old.</p>



<p>The family settled in Uppsala, a medium-sized city on the outskirts of Stockholm. It was a time of considerably less pan-European integration than today, when even a place like Sweden could feel alien to people from a country separated by nothing more than a thin slice of the Baltic Sea. The family maintained strong ties to their Polish background, and Siemiatkowski grew up speaking Polish at home, eating Polish food and celebrating Polish Catholic holidays. Stories of the trials his ancestors endured during World War II, including relatives who suffered in German concentration camps, lingered in the background.</p>



<p>Overall, the immigration experience was hard on Siemiatkowski’s parents, especially his father Michal, who sacrificed his budding career as a veterinarian in Poland in exchange for a job driving a taxi. Siemiatkowski’s parents had little money in his youth and struggled to provide the basics.</p>



<p>“We would go a full week at a time eating meal after meal of Swedish pancakes, which are essentially nothing more than flour and milk,” Siemiatkowski says. “My parents couldn’t afford anything else.”</p>



<p>Although Siemiatkowski describes both his parents as attentive and loving, poverty, poor health—his mother suffered from scoliosis—and an on-again, off-again marriage that persisted for much of his youth meant that his early years were not as carefree as many of his Swedish peers’ childhoods were. “I don’t want to put myself on the same level as people who go through much worse, but there were definitely some tough times,” he recalls. “Where other kids spent their summers traveling, I would bike to the library with my father and read.”</p>



<p>It was there that he discovered novels that pushed his conception of the possible—classic science fiction tomes like Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and works by Isaac Asimov. Alongside books about corporate titans like IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad and Virgin founder Richard Branson, they helped nurture an interest in business as a means of changing the world.</p>



<p>Fulfilling that vision saw Siemiatkowski march a path strewn with a mix of adventure, discovery and disappointment over the course of his pre-Klarna life. Excelling at school proved a relatively easy task. “I was always the kind of pupil who went all-in on my work,” he says. “If our teachers assigned students to write a group report on 17th century French writers, say, I would convince my group to stage a play about Molière.”</p>



<p>Following his early Burger King stint at 15, Siemiatkowski dipped his toe into different areas of the job pool, working as a caretaker for elderly people with dementia, a school teacher—a role that Siemiatkowski says would have been his lifelong career in a parallel universe—and a telemarketer hawking internet subscriptions. It was this stint that gave him his first inkling of the hustle and grind of the workaday salesperson—a mode he says he connected with instantly.</p>



<p>“Sales is typically seen as this kind of sleazy, lowlife thing, but I find it beautiful” he says. “I always loved polishing and refining my sales script; eventually I knew I got it perfect one day when I closed 16 calls in a row. This kind of thing—the art of convincing—it’s just a fascinating skill.”</p>



<p>Siemiatkowski’s mix of academic smarts and on-the-ground experience would go on to gain him entry into the Stockholm School of Economics, one of Sweden’s top institutions of higher learning. Siemiatkowski studied business, a field that his father in particular questioned. “He had no idea what I would do with that kind of training,” he says. “He wanted me to be a doctor.”</p>



<p>Indeed, Siemiatkowski found himself adrift and unhappy during his first few years of business school. The ambition of many of his classmates to land cushy jobs in consulting or investment banking put him off, and amid the dot-com bust of the early 2000s there was little zeal for entrepreneurship.</p>



<p>“It’s funny—when you look at Swedish students now, something like 70% want to start their own business,” he says. “When I was in school it was more like 7%.”</p>



<blockquote>

Sebastian Siemiatkowski</blockquote>



<p>This mismatch spurred Siemiatkowski to take a leave of absence after his first two years. Joined by Adalberth, his Burger King colleague who would go onto become a business-school classmate, the two embarked on a series of projects and trips emblematic of restless young adults on a quest to find themselves: a certification from bartending school, a trip to Florida to look for work on a cruise ship (“no one wanted us,” Siemiatkowski admits), and finally a return to Europe to wait tables at a ski resort in St. Moritz.</p>



<p>The money earned from that gig funded the pair’s next idea: a hitchhiking jaunt around the world, entirely overground. “We literally buried a bottle of champagne in the ground in St. Moritz.” That bottle would sit entombed for months, beckoning the pair back as a reward for finishing their journey. User-generated video was just taking off at the time, and Siemiatkowski and Adalberth decided to <a href="https://youtu.be/Tqu9ybkxMvA">document</a> their travels on YouTube. “You can still find our travelogue there, incredibly,” Siemiatkowski says.</p>



<p>Cut to a loading dock halfway around the world: the pair just missed hitching a ride on the last monthly cargo ship to Los Angeles from Sydney. Siemiatkowski says the experience “really taught us the value of resilience. We had to spend a full month in a foreign city, unsure what we would do or how we would support ourselves. We eventually found cheap hostel beds and jobs as furniture movers. We proved to ourselves that we could be resourceful. No matter how bad things looked, we proved to ourselves that we could find a way to survive.”</p>



<p>The timing also proved fortuitous in another way. Because the duo had vowed to avoid air travel throughout their journey, once they arrived in North America (a month later than planned), they hitchhiked their way through the continent and jumped a ship back to Europe. Upon returning to Stockholm (after exhuming and imbibing the St. Moritz champagne), they realized they had narrowly missed the annual cut-off for course re-registration.</p>



<p>“This left a full year entirely blank,” Siemiatkowski says. “Here I was, thin and poor after a year’s travel, no job, no school, no support whatsoever.”</p>



<p>Siemiatkowski survived on welfare checks and food stamps until landing a job as a salesperson at a factoring company—essentially, loaning money to small companies that need cash to cover unpaid invoices. Through this experience, he discovered a wealth of mom-and-pop shops struggling with payments, especially as the budding e-commerce boom of the time proved to be overwhelming to outlets used to a slower pace of transactions. To guarantee their income, these sellers would demand debit cards at checkout on each transaction. Siemiatkowski started to wonder whether someone could step in as an intermediary between the customer and the merchant, paying the seller at checkout and claiming the money from the shopper upon receipt. From the customer’s perspective, paying only when they felt satisfied with the item would surely be preferable to paying upfront. This was how many mail-order transactions—also known as cash on delivery—already took place in Sweden, a country where trust was baked into the social fabric. Why couldn’t buy now, pay later (BNPL) work as well in digital commerce as it did in the brick-and-mortar world?</p>



<p>When Siemiatkowski brought this idea back to school with him the following term, he enlisted Adalberth and another classmate, Victor Jacobsson, to start Kreditor, a company aiming to usher BNPL into the digital era. They tapped into a then-tiny angel network at their university and landed $60,000 in seed financing from tech investor Jane Walerud in exchange for 10% of the company. They used the cash to hire engineers to build the first iteration of the Kreditor platform, trading away nearly two-fifths of the remaining shares in a transaction that Siemiatkowski now realizes was a mistake.</p>



<p>“We thought these guys would stay on and help us build the company, but they left after only a year—taking their shares with them,” he says. “It was my first real learning as a founder: you have to make sure your employment contracts don’t leave any room for uncertainty.”</p>



<p>The company’s early growth was fueled by a blitz of one-to-one outreach that put Siemiatkowski’s sales instincts to the test, as he and his co-founders hopscotched across Sweden in an old Volvo, enlisting small firms to use Kreditor’s BNPL service. The intent was to feel simultaneously as well-established and trustworthy as a big bank and as nimble and fresh as a tech startup.</p>



<p>They wanted to be taken seriously, so they honed everything down to the last detail. They got a phone number with more zeros at the end, which in Sweden at the time made it look like there was a big switchboard with a lot of extensions. They put their name cards on thick stock paper. They put on starched suits and “acted as if,” to paraphrase the movie Boiler Room.</p>



<p>Kreditor started catching on, growing from 1.5 million Swedish krona in revenue to 270 million in its early years. Uniquely for a fast-growing company in the Silicon Valley mold, the company also turned profitable soon after founding and stayed profitable for its first 16 years. “This meant that we developed a well-balanced culture, where creating value for customers was clearly what was paying the bills and our salaries,” Siemiatkowski says. “It was not about things that would simply drive valuation of the company or its perception in the wider world.”</p>



<p>These early successes helped them recover from an earlier setback that came just as the company was getting off the ground: Siemiatkowski, Adalberth and Jacobsson had entered Kreditor into an entrepreneurship competition at their school presided over by Sweden’s corporate elite, including Stefan Persson, chairman of H&amp;M, and a member of the Wallenberg family, a prominent venture outfit. Even Sweden’s king was in attendance.</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, none of them was convinced,” Siemiatkowski says with a laugh. “‘It’ll never work…why can’t the banks just do it’…they had all kinds of arguments about why it wouldn’t pan out.”</p>



<p>Siemiatkowski describes their loss—they ranked last out of three startups—as an “emotional” blow that nevertheless provided spiritual fodder for the harder fight ahead. “My reaction wasn’t to give up and go home, it was to curl up my fist and say ‘I’ll show you’.”</p>

<p>The fact that Klarna has since become one of the most well-known companies in Swedish history is as much a comeuppance as Siemiatkowski could have imagined. Securing an early lead in digital BNPL helped pave the company’s expansion across Scandinavia in subsequent years. By 2009, the company decided it wanted a fresher name to present to its international clientele. It hired a consultant, which presented a list of “1,000 candidates,” in Siemiatkowski’s telling. The company’s bosses wanted to lean harder into the startup image and away from banking. “It wasn’t a matter of trust at that point—people trusted us,” Siemiatkowski says. “We needed something that could draw attention.”</p>



<p>The name “Movondo” bubbled to the top of the list, but was shot down by staff. “They decided to go with ‘Klarna,’ which means ‘clear’ in Swedish,” Siemiatkowski says. “We ran with it and I think it helped us make our point. It really represented what we wanted to do with the entire financial services world.”</p>



<p>Klarna’s progress in tapping into growing consumer appetites for BNPL continued largely unabated, including through the financial crisis of 2008–09 and into 2010. By then, a new goal had emerged for the company: to become the go-to technological architecture for processing digital transactions across virtually any medium and pathway. Klarna was approaching unicorn status after a successful rollout in Germany. Siemiatkowski had established himself as a rising star in fintech and knew the landscape inside and out. He decided that the time was ripe to conquer an adjacent market that was also exploding in popularity: digital payments.</p>



<p>Siemiatkowski presented his vision to the board, which endorsed it wholeheartedly. “We went over the competitive landscape and I kind of glossed over these other players—this company ‘Stripe’ founded by these two Irish brothers, and this other one, Adyen, founded by a few Dutch guys,” Siemiatkowski recalls sheepishly. “I knew these firms were onto something, I knew we had to keep an eye on them, but I was a bit too cocky for my own good.”</p>



<p>This overconfidence included a failed pitch to Adyen’s founding team to acquire the company. “After they rebuffed my offer we set about building this payments system ourselves. And that became a slow burn of dashed expectations,” Siemiatkowski admits, contrasting Adyen’s proliferation across huge markets in Asia and elsewhere against Klarna’s struggles to launch a single payments product in Germany.</p>



<p>“The moment that clinched it was in 2015, when Spotify went with Adyen over us,” Siemiatkowski notes. “Here was our Swedish neighbor, our BFF, going with our biggest rival.”</p>



<p>This frustrating loss of a massive opportunity proved a major turning point for Klarna. Siemiatkowski saw two potential options: sell the company, earning a tidy return for himself and his shareholders, and call it a day. Or double down on Klarna’s core competencies, embedding BNPL deeper into the consumer finance landscape across Europe, and setting his sights on the biggest prize of all: the United States. He chose the latter—but not before making some significant changes at the company.</p>

<p>Siemiatkowski recounts harboring a fascination with Silicon Valley from an early age, of idle moments logging onto Google Maps, zooming in on a region halfway across the planet and thinking, this is the promised land. Unlike many founders, he did not physically move to the Bay Area to pursue his entrepreneurial dreams, instead latching onto the success story of Niklas Zennström, founder of Skype, as a model for what could be possible in his home continent.</p>



<p>When it came time to answer hard questions about Klarna’s future, however, he looked back to the highest flyers in his fabled promised land.</p>



<p>“We tried every startup tactic in the playbook” to reform Klarna’s corporate culture, he says. “Google let their engineers devote 20% of their time to pursue personal projects. We tried it and nothing changed. We put Legos, a ping pong table in our rec room. Big deal—nothing changed.”</p>



<p>Those strategies emerged in response to how Siemiatkowski and his leadership team diagnosed the problems that led up to Klarna’s failure to conquer payments. Put simply, Klarna was not set up in a way that permitted its employees to act fast and pivot quickly.</p>



<p>“The ideas were all solid—there was nothing wrong with the vision,” explains David Fock, a 13-year veteran of the company who now serves as its chief product officer. “It was our organization that hindered our ability to deliver on them.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The ideas were all solid—there was nothing wrong with the vision. It was our organization that hindered our ability to deliver on them.”</p>
David Fock</blockquote>



<p>Fock describes the problem as one that bedevils myriad companies looking for new direction: a siloed hierarchy that separated technical and business functions, excluding each from buy-in on the other’s success. “At that time, we had a sales department that was generally out selling stuff, but weren’t really that interested in what they were selling,” Fock says. “Simultaneously, we had an engineering department that was solving technical problems, but without any real investment in growing the company. In between we had product, which was supposed to bridge the gap but ended up remaining subservient to both verticals.”</p>



<p>The result was a lack of accountability that tossed the burden of failure back and forth. “It was just this endless, pointless game,” Fock recalls.</p>



<p>For the remedy, Siemiatkowski and his team reached back to Silicon Valley, but took away something much more substantive than the superficial fixes he’d toyed with earlier: a wholesale restructure of the company, from root to stem.</p>



<p>In Fock’s telling, “a company like Amazon is composed of small, cross-functional teams that look to solve a single overarching problem. You have a page-long mission statement and the team will draw on the company’s resources to accomplish it. This is how we realized we needed to transform Klarna in order to thrive.”</p>



<p>Siemiatkowski says the positive effects of the reorganization soon became apparent. “We started to feel a greater sense of momentum, to get products out at a higher pace, to launch more features. It wasn’t a daylong exercise, to be sure, and some employees weren’t sold on it, but in the end it was the best thing for the company.”</p>



<p>This shift would set the stage for Klarna’s entry into the American market. The company had already laid the groundwork by opening offices in Columbus, Ohio and New York City in 2015, and started making a serious push in 2018. Similar to Kreditor’s embryonic days, Siemiatkowski filled his calendar with sales meetings with potential clients, a slew of merchants that the company was courting as a means of overtaking its chief rival in BNPL, Australia’s Afterpay (which has since been acquired by Block).</p>



<p>As Fock describes it, “we recognized that Afterpay was ahead of us, but we made a concerted effort to enter that race and win. Sebastian got out there and stayed on the road nonstop—he must have delivered 1,000 pitches.”</p>



<p>The covid-19 pandemic put a halt to Siemiatkowski’s travels. Like virtually all companies, Klarna entered a wait-and-see mode as the virus spread and lockdowns ensued. “It was so hard to predict what was going on,” Fock recalls. “We couldn’t do anything except monitor and adjust on practically a minute-to-minute basis.”</p>



<p>The opportunities the outbreak afforded for much of the tech sector are well-documented. Nowhere was this more apparent than in e-commerce. In 2019 Klarna had launched its consumer-facing app in the US, following its initial European rollout in 2017. Usage volumes spiked over the course of the pandemic.</p>



<p>“I remember one investor calling me early on, fretting about the end of the world and insisting that I start downsizing,” Siemiatkowski recalls. “I’m always glad I didn’t take that advice, because COVID ended up being a major acceleration.”</p>



<blockquote>

Sebastian Siemiatkowski</blockquote>



<p>This acceleration would drive Klarna’s valuation to a peak of $45.6 billion by July 2021, a number that implied supernova-like growth ahead. The company harnessed this energy to push harder into the US market, incurring losses for the first time in the company’s history. Throughout this upward surge, Siemiatkowski remained wary about reading too much into valuation figures as a barometer for the company’s long-term health. “I was cautioning people that if your valuation grows faster than your revenue, there’s bound to be a correction.”</p>



<p>Siemiatkowski’s wife Nina says that Siemiatkowski has always tended toward circumspection. “During Klarna’s first half-decade or so, Sebastian would relay to me—on practically a weekly basis—that the company was on the brink of collapse, even when it was clearly growing at a phenomenal rate.”</p>



<p>As the froth built up on the entire tech sector, few expected that the bubble would deflate so sharply. By the time of Klarna’s mid-2022 investment round, its valuation had plummeted by 85%, in line with most of its peers. Despite drawing the largest funding infusion of any European startup that year, the urgency of job cuts became too pressing to ignore. The company ultimately reduced headcount by a little over 10% in 2022, drawing headlines amid this turbulent period for tech overall.</p>



<p>Siemiatkowski speaks frankly about “making mistakes” during this period, a stressful time marked by tears and sleepless nights and compounded by the difficulty of letting go of colleagues who had been on his team for years.</p>



<p>“It’s one of those balancing acts that I, as a boss, had never really encountered before,” Siemiatkowski admits. “Of course no one wants to lay people off, but it’s a matter of making sure I’m fulfilling my duty to every stakeholder—to shareholders, to customers and to current employees alike. And the fact that our first set of cuts preceded that of most of our peers meant that I didn’t have the opportunity to learn from their example. Unfortunately, we just had to ‘bite the sour apple’, as they say out here.”</p>



<p>Siemiatkowski’s wife Nina cites this confluence of unenviable factors—job cuts and a potentially make-or-break fundraise occurring against the backdrop of a savage market downturn—as pushing Siemiatkowski to his limit. “Every time I tried to get him to take a rest, he would just say to me, ‘I have to get this right, I have to do right by my colleagues’,” she recalls. “Another person might just lay back and give up, but he just worked around the clock for weeks.”</p>



<p>Despite the turmoil, Siemiatkowski sees silver linings in the need to make tough choices in order to right the ship.</p>



<p>“As you get older, you start to take a more measured view of these kinds of rollercoaster moments,” he says. “Startups are often propelled by the high of building, building, building, but at some point you need to take stock and ask tough questions. Am I really doing this in the most efficient way possible? Is there a way I can accomplish this goal with a bit more focus? This is the kind of test that can break a company, or it can help push it to emerge stronger and wiser. I know that’s where we are now.”</p>

<p>Klarna now occupies a major perch in a <a href="https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/buy-now-pay-later-market-analysis/">sector worth nearly a third of a trillion dollars</a>. The company’s vision for its growth lies in the opportunity to break the stranglehold of the credit card on consumer-finance. It hopes to shake up an ecosystem in which a large number of mostly low-income credit-card users spend beyond their means, paying high interest rates in order to prop up the perks and benefits of wealthier clientele who can typically afford to pay off balances in full.</p>



<p>Its efforts are playing out against flux in the global regulatory framework that permits this disparity. The EU is in the midst of <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/12/02/council-and-european-parliament-agree-to-improve-protection-for-consumers-applying-for-credit/">updating</a> its laws overseeing consumer credit of all kinds, while the UK recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/britain-sets-out-legislation-regulate-buy-now-pay-later-credit-2023-02-13/">proposed</a> new legislation to regulate BNPL. The U.S., meanwhile, is grappling with fallout from three high-profile bank failures this year which, although unrelated to consumer credit provision, may spur tighter regulation over the financial system more broadly. At the same time, regulatory trends that <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">increase competition</a> and prioritize <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/outcomes-focussed-regulation-measure-success">fair outcomes</a> for consumers over onerous processes could help the company maintain its edge.</p>



<p>Regardless of how BNPL regulations shape up in the coming years, they will likely inject some uncertainty into the landscape. The broader macroeconomic environment—including <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-09/buy-now-pay-later-unicorn-klarna-threatened-by-rising-rates#xj4y7vzkg">high interest rates</a>, which are squeezing finance across the board—could present another challenge. Still, Siemiatkowski has more than proved he can steer his company through choppy waters. Nina attributes this to a dogged work ethic he developed growing up as the child of a poor family. “He’s always had a bit of a chip on his shoulder,” Nina says. “He’s always craved the means to help his parents escape their own cycle of poverty, and he ended up mapping this aim onto the millions of consumers who use Klarna to buy things they wouldn’t be able to otherwise.”</p>



<p>The fact that his own father descended into depression and alcoholism during Siemiatkowski’s mid-20s and died when he was only 33 adds a level of poignancy to this description. “My father was a fantastic character,” Siemiatkowski muses. “I still think today about how little regard he had for my choice to go to business school. ‘What the hell would you learn there?’”</p>



<p>Although Siemiatkowski has achieved far more than his father could have wished for, the sense of living up to the hopes of others—of his parents and his heritage, of his shareholders and his employees, of the market and the wider world—lingers over both his personal and professional story. Expectations like these could easily overwhelm the person who bears them. To Siemiatkowski, they are the foundation of his resolve.</p>

<p>As crypto evolves, it becomes clearer that the future will be multi-chain. Presently, moving funds between different blockchains is frustrating...to say the least. The current bridging solutions are prohibitive from a UX perspective, mainly due to how finality is reached across different blockchains. This translates to long wait times and anxiety when interacting with new protocols, caused by the incertitude of funds arriving safely on the other side. Another major blockage consists of gas fees, particular to each blockchain, which often require an additional swap.

<p>by Deirdre Connolly, Conrado Gouvea</p>



<p>We optimized our implementation of FROST by upwards of 50% over the trivial implementation, without changing the protocol and therefore maintaining its existing security guarantees. We use a known trick to do so: multi-scalar multiplication, which is exactly designed to give this kind of performance speedup.</p>



<p>In the FROST threshold signing protocol, we perform many elliptic curve operations for key generation, signing, and signature verification. Because FROST is a Schnorr threshold signing scheme, the signature that is produced is compatible with single-party Schnorr signature verification. As such, there is no additional computation overhead to verifying signatures produced by FROST vs single-party.</p>



<p>However, when performing FROST signing, signers must perform a linear number of group element multiplications, proportionate to the number of signers, as shown below (see the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost/">FROST specification</a> for details).</p>


 
Group commitment computation algorithm from the FROST specification. 


<p></p>



<p>If implemented trivially, the computational overhead of FROST signing grows computationally more expensive as more parties are involved. When the number of parties is small, which is typically the case for threshold signing, (i.e. 2-out-of-3 or 3-out-of-5) this extra computational overhead is marginal. However, we would like to reduce the number of expensive elliptic curve operations wherever possible.</p>



<p></p>



 Multi-scalar Multiplication? 



<p>In the context of elliptic curves, a scalar multiplication is written as kP where k is an integer mod a prime p and P an elliptic curve point, an abelian group element; points can be added or subtracted. With only those operations it’s possible to compute kP. The naïve approach would be to simply add k copies of P together with k-1 additions, but there are more efficient approaches that take a number of additions in the order of log(k). These go through the bits of the scalar, doubling the point for every bit and adding the point P if the bit is 1. For example, 5P can be computed with 3 additions:</p>



<p>2P = P + P<br>4P = 2P + 2P<br>5P = 4P + P</p>



<p>In order to speed up FROST signing, we must do more efficient point multiplications with respect to multiple variable base points, which is called multi-scalar multiplication. It consists of computing the sum aP + bQ + … + dS for some number of points and scalars. It can be naïvely computed by doing each scalar multiplication and then summing them all up. Thankfully, we have several algorithms at our disposal that can do better.</p>



<p></p>



 Algorithms to Optimize Multi-scalar Multiplication 



<p>Most of the multi-scalar multiplication algorithms rely on the observation that you do some operations on all of the points at the same time. For example, you can compute 3P + 3Q with only 3 additions:</p>



<p>P + Q<br>2(P + Q)<br>2(P + Q) + (P + Q)</p>



 Interleaved wNAF 



<p>The NAF (non-adjacent form) is a way to encode the scalar with digits -1, 0, and 1 (instead of the regular bits 0 and 1). This is useful because point subtraction is as easy as a point addition, and the NAF has fewer non-zero elements, which speed up the point multiplication algorithm (recall that there is a point addition for every non-zero digit). The wNAF is a windowed version of the NAF (e.g. a 2NAF can have digits -3, -1, 0, 1, and 3). We have been using an interleaved width-w non-adjacent form in our scalar implementation to support multi-scalar multiplication. We pre-populate a lookup table of multiples of the points being multiplied (e.g. P, 3P and 5P for 3NAF), which are then used to add the non-zero terms of the scalar being multiplied in the non-adjacent form.</p>



<p>Interleaved wNAF is often used where part of the points are fixed, and then a larger window is used for those and their table can be precomputed in advance once, instead of being computed on-the-fly. However, that is not useful for FROST: we will describe an alternative solution later in this post.</p>



<p>Other algorithms such as Pippenger and Bos-Coster can be more efficient than the interleaved wNAF, but they are more complex to implement. We will eventually look into them. (We mostly went for interleaved wNAF because we already had an implementation of it used in batch verification!)</p>



<p></p>



 Optimizing FROST 



<p>In our FROST libraries, we have already used a variable-time multi-scalar multiplication implementation to verify batches of Schnorr signatures all in one go. We now describe how we used this multi-scalar multiplication implementation to speed up how signers generate the group commitment R when performing the second round of FROST signing.</p>



<p>As a reminder, during the second round of the FROST signing protocol, each party computes the group commitment based on the nonce commitments sent by each i-th signer in the first round of the signing protocol. This group commitment is also computed by the coordinator in the final aggregate step, after all signing participants have created and sent their signature shares.</p>


 
Baseline implementation computing the group commitment. 


<p>Computing this group commitment is a ripe opportunity to use multi-scalar multiplication, because we have to compute a multiplication of varying elliptic curve element bases (the nonce commitments from each participant) by a varying scalar (the binding factor). Previously, we would do a variable-base scalar multiplication for each participant, and then add the result to an accumulator elliptic curve group element. However, we can restructure our algorithm to accumulate the hiding commitments, and save the variable base multi-scalar multiplication of the binding commitments and the binding factor scalar to the end, in one shot. Then we add the result to the accumulator, to result in the full group commitment.</p>


 
Optimized implementation computing the group commitment. 


<p>Because we already had a variable time multi-scalar multiplication implementation in our code base, this change only touched a few lines of code, but <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost/pull/345">resulted in an over 50% speed up at the high values of threshold and max possible participants</a>. The speed up was seen in the second round computation and the final aggregate step, as both are computing the group commitment.</p>


 
FROST performance scaling after our multi-scalar multiplication optimizations. 


<p>This optimization is compliant with the FROST specification, as the change to use multi-scalar multiplication only involves a rearrangement of equation terms in the generation of the group commitment. The speed up is available with any multi-scalar multiplication implementation, variable-time or constant-time. The underlying elliptic curve group software implementation used by your FROST implementation might already have this optimization available.</p>



<p></p>



 Comparing Optimized FROST to FROST Variants 



<p>There are now several different variants of FROST in the literature, all that offer speedups with respect to the overhead of the group commitment. Notably, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1375.pdf">FROST2</a> allows for constant overhead when computing the nonce, and <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/550">another variant presented in the context of ROAST</a> improves on the bandwidth that is sent from the coordinator to each signing participant. However, FROST2 achieves <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/833">weaker security than FROST</a>, and the variant in the ROAST paper has not been demonstrated to have any stronger notion of security <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/833">(i.e. TS-UF-1 and higher)</a> other than unforgeability. As a result, we chose to keep the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost/">CFRG draft</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost">our implementation</a> pinned to the original FROST design.</p>



<p>Using multi-scalar multiplication to optimize computing the group commitment over the full execution of the FROST protocol is significant, because it brings the performance overhead of FROST closer to these alternatives, while retaining stronger security properties.</p>



<p>As opposed to making breaking changes to the protocol itself, we use known optimization tricks under the hood to speed up our implementation. Making protocol changes requires re-analysis and new security proofs, so such changes are not done lightly. Happily, in this case, we can get the best of both worlds: performance that is better than the trivial implementation of FROST (i.e. from linear overhead in the number of signers to close to constant), without having to compromise on the security or flexibility of the scheme.</p>



<p>These optimizations are now available in <a href="https://crates.io/crates/frost-core">frost-core</a>, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/frost-ed25519">frost-ed25519</a>, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/frost-ed448">frost-ed448</a>, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/frost-p256">frost-p256</a>, frost-<a href="https://crates.io/crates/frost-ristretto255">ristretto255</a>, and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/frost-secp256k1">frost-secp256k1</a> as of 0.3.0 on crates.io!</p>

<p>We live in a time where the boundary between science fiction and reality is rapidly blurring. Scientists have used high-power lasers to reproduce the sun’s power on Earth, satellites launched by reusable rockets have made high-speed internet ubiquitous and affordable, and new computer architectures have accelerated super-human AI capabilities and understanding. These exponential technologies will transform the fabric of our markets and societies.</p><p>We are also witnessing the increasing convergence of technologies at the intersection of science and engineering that are enabling breakthrough opportunities — physics, material science, AI and next-generation computing, nanotechnology, and more are being combined in unprecedented ways to leverage nature’s design principles and manufacturing capabilities at the atomic level to open entirely new economic lanes of growth — and more critically address the most outsized challenges of our time in climate breakdown, rapidly diminishing finite resources, democratic resilience, and human&nbsp;health.</p><p>We’re searching for an individual who can navigate the intersection of these rapidly evolving fields. Their mission would be to offer a comprehensive understanding of how technology can better the health and lifespan of people and positively impact our&nbsp;planet.</p><p>We are excited to expand the BlueYard team with a new Associate position — this role is remote but requires frequent travel. At the core of BlueYard is the belief that venture capital is a product for entrepreneurs, and if you are inspired by working with an intellectually curious, small, and value-driven team, we want to hear from&nbsp;you.</p><p>The role includes:</p>  Working directly with our General Partners as part of the investment team, allowing for a steep learning curve and significant exposure to the entrepreneurial ecosystem  Identifying technologies and trends that will positively impact economies and societies and represent attractive venture investment opportunities  Carrying out market and company due diligence on investment opportunities  Working with our portfolio companies to support&nbsp;them  Helping with our community management and&nbsp;events  Supporting with fund reporting and&nbsp;analyses  <p>Here’s what we’d like you to bring to the&nbsp;table:</p>  A strong understanding of and passion for science or engineering and the ability to have a universal view of new technologies and their commercialization  Self-(fire)starters — be able to run on your own, identify opportunities, and prioritize without much&nbsp;guidance  The ability to clearly articulate thoughts and opinions about markets and companies, both in written and spoken&nbsp;form  Strong interpersonal skills — happy to work extensively within the team and with entrepreneurs  Ability to carry out market and financial analyses  Native (or close to) English language skills, both written and&nbsp;oral  The willingness to roll up your&nbsp;sleeves  <p>There is no ideal background for this role, and a formal degree is optional. We, however, think that the role will be most suitable for folks with an engineering degree, a couple years of work experience, and with a track record of working in science or engineering.</p><p>If you are interested in the position, please send the following to <a href="mailto:team@blueyard.com">team@blueyard.com</a>:</p>  Your CV  If applicable, a collection of links that best characterize your online&nbsp;presence  <p>Our process will then be as&nbsp;follows:</p>  After the initial screening, we will invite selected candidates for a video interview  We will then invite a limited group of candidates for in-person interviews with both the team and our entrepreneurs  A decision will be made shortly thereafter

<p>Brave’s vertical tabs feature is now available for users to experience a new way to manage open tabs. With today’s 1.52 desktop release, the vertical tabs setting is available to Brave users on Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>

 How do vertical tabs work? 
<p>Enabling the vertical tabs setting relocates your open tabs from the top of your browser window (i.e. above the address bar) to the left side of the window, where they’ll appear stacked vertically rather than horizontally. To do so, right-click an existing horizontal tab and select “use vertical tabs” from the menu.</p>
<p>With open tabs arranged vertically, you’ll be able to scroll through them as needed. To open a new tab, simply click the button to create a new tab at the bottom of the vertical tabs sidebar.</p>
<p>There are additional settings you can adjust to further customize your vertical tabs experience, which we’ll get to shortly.</p>


    


    

 
     
        
        
        
        
     
 

 The advantages of vertical tabs 
<p>Vertical tabs help to eliminate overcrowding your browser window, and to increase your on-screen real estate.</p>

 Identify open tabs more easily 
<p>The more horizontal tabs you have open, the smaller and more squished they become—often to the point of not being able to read any text on the tab. Vertical tabs, however, provide much-needed breathing room, allowing for more information to be displayed at a glance, so you can find the tab you’re looking for faster.&nbsp;</p>

 Use on-screen space more efficiently 
<p>Computer screens are almost always wider than they are tall, meaning you have more screen real estate left-to-right than you do top-to-bottom. By relocating tabs from the top of your window to the side, you maximize your available on-screen space.</p>

 Early feedback shows users love vertical tabs 
<p>While you may experience a short adjustment period as you become accustomed to vertical tabs, most users love the experience and don’t plan on going back.</p>
<p>“This, along with tab groups, should help me better organize my almost 300 tabs (!). Before, I used an extension called “Tab Manager Plus for Chrome” along with separating the tabs in multiple windows to keep things just enough organized to be usable. (yes I’m lazy I know). I was considering switching browsers, but thankfully now I won’t have to do that.”&nbsp; - Brave’s vertical tabs user</p>

 Customize your vertical tabs experience 
<p>By default, enabling vertical tabs will relocate your open tabs to the left side of your browser window. (This keeps the right side of your browser open to access Brave’s Sidebar feature, which provides quick access to your bookmarks, reading list, Brave Wallet, Brave Talk, and more. To enable Brave’s Sidebar, click on <code>brave://settings/appearance</code> in the Brave browser and enable / disable the Sidebar.)</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>You can also click the vertical tabs button  to collapse the vertical tabs panel. This way, you can maximize on-screen space by only opening the tabs panel when you need to access a different tab.</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    


 A new tab management experience with familiar functionality 
<p>Despite a few key organizational changes, vertical tabs work much like the horizontal tabs you’re used to.</p>
 
 Navigation and shortcut keys remain the same 
 Pinned tabs still function the same way, and are pinned at the top of the vertical tabs panel 
 Grouped tabs also still function the same way, letting you create, label, and color code groups. 
 


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>Vertical tabs give you an all-new, highly efficient system of tab management, without breaking anything you’ve come to love about tab management in Brave. Ready to try out vertical tabs? Make sure you’re on our latest desktop release (v1.52) and visit <code>brave://settings/appearance</code> to get started.</p>

<p>Today, Brave is excited to announce the release of the <a>Brave Search API</a>, making the backbone of Brave Search available to companies and developers worldwide as they build the next generation of apps that require Web search capabilities.</p>
<p>As the only privacy-preserving and independent search index in the West, Brave Search brings much-needed competition to Google and Microsoft Bing. The Brave Search <a>API</a> allows anyone to integrate billions of private, ad-free results from the Web with a simple API call.</p>
<p>The Brave Search API delivers great quality at an affordable cost. Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models developers in particular should benefit from the Search API, which offers access to high-quality, Web-scale data, with exhaustive coverage of recent events. It also brings a novel data set versus competitors who might be falling back to the standard Google / Bing options.</p>
<p>With a free plan and <a>affordable paid plans</a> starting from $3 per 1000 queries, the Brave Search API gives independent search access to all. Those interested can get started at <a href="https://api.search.brave.com/register/">api.search.brave.com</a>.</p>

 Brave Search, the Brave browser, and innovation 
<p>Since its initial launch in June 2021, Brave Search has grown to over 8 billion annualized queries, making it the fastest growing search engine since Bing. As the only global, independent alternative to Google and Bing, Brave Search is striving to make Web search more private and transparent. It’s also constantly innovating, with novel features like <a>Goggles</a>, <a>Discussions</a>, and the <a>AI Summarizer</a>, giving users more relevant results.</p>
<p>Brave Search is the default search engine in the Brave browser, which has nearly 60 million users worldwide. The browser’s opt-in <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409406835469-What-is-the-Web-Discovery-Project-">Web Discovery Project</a> adds millions of new webpages to the index every single day, and ensures the index is populated with real, useful data: no dead links, SEO spam, or other junk content. Together, this private browser / private search combo ensures a constant source of fresh data for the index, and for the Search API.</p>
<p><a>The Goggles feature</a> expands and customizes the ranking. Goggles allow any individual—or community of people—to alter the ranking of Brave Search by using a set of instructions (rules and filters). Anyone can create, apply, or extend a Goggle. Essentially Goggles act as a custom re-ranking on top of the Brave search index. This means that, instead of a single ranking, Brave Search can offer an almost limitless number of ranking options.</p>
<p>All Goggles will appear in the Brave Search API.</p>

 Pricing tiers, and getting started with the Brave Search API 
<p>Anyone can visit <a href="https://api.search.brave.com/register/">api.search.brave.com</a> and start testing in minutes. After creating an account, users can search the Web and get back every result the search engine has access to, in an easy, intuitive format. This includes Web results, enriched metadata, entity search, news, video results, and more.</p>
<p>All users can <a href="https://api.search.brave.com/register/">get started for free</a> for up to 1 query per second, and 2,000 queries per month. For users who need more, we offer a variety of paid plan options:</p>

<p>Dear Panther Community,<br></p><p>We are thrilled to announce that the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/dao/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther DAO</a> has officially approved <a href="https://snapshot.org/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0xcb272ecdb9e9f820772c193ebbd3bb05b8d80c11d00735925c8d5e38355ef9a5">PIP-14</a>. This proposal formalizes the project’s Governance Framework and introduces a DAO Council, marking a significant stride in the project's decentralization journey.<br></p><p>This landmark development follows extensive discussions on our <a href="https://forum.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">community forum</a> about the need for a decentralized, high-level decision-making process, and accountability for non-team members.<br></p> Significance<br> <p>The approval of PIP-14 puts us on the path to:<br></p>  The formation of a DAO Council, which will be entrusted with reviewing Panther Improvement Proposals (PIPs) from our Discourse forum. By verifying the alignment of proposals with Panther DAO’s mission, vision, and values, the Council will effectively weed out spam requests and proposals that are out of budget or misaligned with Panther's scope and <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/roadmap?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">roadmap</a>.<br>  Establishing a transparent Governance Framework, bringing implicit rules and guidelines into the light. These rules, which are now formalized, can be found in the following diagram:  All the above advancements will allow us to build a more robust and decentralized Panther Protocol. The Council<br> <p>The elected Council will consist of three respected community (non-team) members:<br></p>  Santiago Velez: Co-Founder &amp; Division Lead (R&amp;D) at <a href="https://blockdigitalcorp.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Block Digital Corporation</a>, VP of R&amp;D at Sindric Solutions, LLC. Former Nuclear Engineer, VP of UWUA L590 Engineers Union, and Panther Protocol user.<br>  Jillian Godsil: Journalist, Broadcaster, Influencer, CEO, Writer, Former European Parliament Candidate, Law Changer, Panther Protocol user &amp; early contributor.<br>  Debra Farber: Host of <a href="https://shiftingprivacyleft.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">The Shifting Privacy Left Podcast</a>, CEO, Principled LLC, and Advisor to the PrivacyTech Rise, Privado, the Institute of Operational Privacy Design, and XRSI.<br>  <p>These individuals will ensure that the Council safeguards Panther's mission, vision, and values, which emphasize privacy, scalability, security, transparency, and <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/cross-chain-defi-possible-or-forever-limited/">interoperability</a> in Decentralized Finance (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/defi-decentralized-finance/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">DeFi</a>). Their tenure will be for 6 months, with the possibility of re-election.<br></p> Moving Forward<br> <p>The approval of PIP-14 marks an exciting chapter in Panther's roadmap. By installing a council to review PIPs and instating a transparent governance framework, we are becoming more open and democratic. Your trust and active participation have been instrumental in this success.<br></p><p>Let's continue to build and accelerate the development of <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/the-worlds-first-private-decentralized-protocol-launch-panther-dao-votes-to-launch-private-defi-e721df1364/">private</a>, scalable blockchain infrastructure for <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/web3/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Web3</a> together.

<p>The current cloud and server architectures are vulnerable to hacking because of their centralised IT infrastructure. For applications that require a high level of data integrity, such as those that handle financial or privacy-sensitive data, exploring blockchain technology in a clean slate scenario can be highly interesting. </p>



<p>By leveraging a blockchain database, you can create a custom solution that meets your specific needs without having to conform to the limitations of pre-existing systems. This allows for greater flexibility and control over the database’s functionality and security.</p>



<p>In this article, we will address the much-debated topic of the difference between blockchain and a traditional database. So, without further ado, let us get to the point…</p>



 Key takeaways 



 
 Traditional database only stores the current state information 



 Blockchain stores a history of all transactions in the cryptographic signed database 



 On a blockchain, you can replay all transactions to reach the state information 



 Blockchain database provides a complete audit trail of all information flow 



 Blockchain databases offer an extra layer of security by creating an unalterable and tamper-resistant data record 



 On a blockchain, the historical record can be available and can be checked and verified by anyone with access to the blockchain database, in multiple locations 
 







 The fundamental difference 



<p>Blockchain databases differ from traditional databases in that they comprise a sequence of transactions that are securely anchored and immutable. In contrast, traditional databases are a collection of state information that can be mutated and lose logging history over time or in the case of a hack.</p>



<p>Blockchain databases store every transaction that has ever taken place. Consequently, creating a complete sequence of events that forms an unalterable record. So, in order to find the person’s state information, you can replay the whole chain of transactions.</p>



<p>To replay all transaction from the entire blockchain can be extensive and time-consuming. If you want to read a database state and don’t want to replay the complete history, you can also store it in a database next to the blockchain, or use a block explorer application. And then, it becomes a whole architecture that is highly secure, has high performance, and can not be changed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For quick recovery after an incident, block producers can take snapshots of the blockchain at regular intervals, decreasing replay time.</p>



 Significant improvements in security 



<p>Blockchain transactions are completely encrypted and usually decentralised on multiple servers. Because of this, you have highly available architecture with multiple operators across the globe to check and verify transactions. This makes the whole architecture cyber secure.</p>



<p>Imagine having 21 validators plus 5 standby who operate the blockchain. In a hypothetical scenario where one validator gets hacked and the hacker tries to change the information on the blockchain, the hacker would not succeed. This is because the other 20 validators have the original sequence of all transactions. Any new information added to the database needs to be approved by the majority of validators before being added on-chain.</p>



 Ideal use cases 



<p>In the current market landscape, blockchain databases offer a more tailored solution for addressing custom in-house applications. As an example, if you are an IT manager for a municipality, and you want to create a database specifically for administration purposes, building it on top of a <a href="https://zaisan.io/solutions/europechain/">blockchain (like Europechain) </a>is an option. This wouldn’t be feasible with an off-the-shelf application that is already built on an existing data architecture.</p>



<p>A blockchain database can be an ideal solution in situations where data security, transparency, and immutability are crucial. Among these industries are finance, healthcare, supply chain, and real estate, all of which require secure and reliable tracking of transactions.</p>

<p>Today, in order to better serve the Zcash mission, we are announcing a restructuring of ECC, including layoffs of valued team members. Going forward, ECC will focus our time and expertise on specific parts of the Zcash mission, and help transition other parts to other organizations in the Zcash community.</p>



<p>We at ECC have been trying to do too much with too few resources, especially in the last year and a half as the bear market began to impact our finances. It has become clear this was limiting our ability to execute on the things we’re best at.</p>



<p>Zcash has grown and changed, and today there are many organizations outside of ECC who are also committed to the Zcash mission, many of them funded by the Zcash Dev Fund, including the Zcash Community Grants committee, Zingo Labs, Nighthawk Apps, the Zcash Foundation, Zcash Media, the Zcash Global Ambassadors program, and many other individuals and organizations. There are also the promised contributions to Zcash by QEdit and Shielded Labs and by the Filecoin and Anoma projects. We are grateful to these people for their contributions to the Zcash movement, and by committing ECC to doing fewer things and doing them well, we hope to further empower them, making Zcash as a broad movement even more resilient and sustainable.</p>



<p>Restructuring ECC was a challenging decision. It required that we lay off 13 employees — about half of our team. Many of the people we let go today were instrumental in bringing to market groundbreaking technologies and ideas that no other team in the world has been able to deliver. We are sad to part ways with them and will always be grateful for the opportunity we had to work with these incredible individuals.</p>



<p>In the coming weeks, ECC will release a revised roadmap centered on empowering ZEC holders and giving them a voice. This includes:</p>



 
 Creating an excellent user experience for proof-of-stake ZEC 



 A wallet, built by and for Zcashers, that is easy to use and accessible for anyone 



 A mobile-wallet SDK that is useful to other Zcash builders 



 US-based policy work to ensure ZEC, self-custody, and staking remain viable in the USA 
 



<p>We will help transition ownership to the broader community of some functions ECC has undertaken in the past.</p>



 
 Support for zcashd outside of ECC’s Roadmap 



 Protocol review for Zcash core protocols outside of ECC’s roadmap 



 Alliances and exchange support 



 Global regulatory relations 



 Management of digital properties, including z.cash and the Zcash-specific social accounts 



 Product marketing 



 Zcash related PR and media engagement 
 



<p>Importantly, our immediate-term work on solving third-party wallet performance issues is still our highest priority at the moment, and we are committed to releasing zcashd 5.6.0, an updated lightwalletd, and new mobile SDKs for iOS and Android soon.</p>



<p>As with any transition, this restructuring of team and priorities will take some time to fully settle, and there are some other projects and initiatives that are nearing completion — such as the relaunch of z.cash and a proposal to foster community ownership of this and other Zcash digital properties — that we’ll be delivering to the community in the near term. We’re still engaging on important initiatives such as the Filecoin Foundation grants and other activities that will benefit the Zcash user.</p>



<p>This is hard. I asked all of the ECC team to join me in my work to serve human freedom. It became our collective mission, and something we’ve all fought for day-in and day-out. While we won’t all be able to continue on this particular path together, I am confident that in the scope of history, each one of us will look back proudly on what we did together for human freedom. I am grateful for all the team members to whom we said goodbye as employees today, and for the ones that will continue at ECC. We remain fully committed to our mission and believe ECC is now in a much stronger position to serve the Zcash mission, both today and into the future. </p>



<p>I’ll be joining an ECC-hosted Twitter Spaces on Friday, May 26th, to answer questions from the community. Please keep an eye on <a href="https://twitter.com/ElectricCoinCo">@electriccoinco</a> for details.</p>

<p>This is the 26th post in an <a>ongoing series</a> describing new privacy features in Brave browsers. This post describes work done by Sr. Software Engineer Mark Pilgrim, with critical help from Cryptography Researcher Sofia Celi and Sr. Research and Privacy Engineer Shivan Sahib. This post was written by Peter Snyder.</p>



    


    


<p>Starting in version 1.53, Brave will begin rolling out a new feature called “Request Off the Record (OTR).” This feature aims to help people who need to hide their browsing behavior from others who have access to their computer or phone. For example, a person who is the victim of intimate partner violence who needs to find support services without their partner knowing, or someone needing to find personal healthcare without others in their home finding out.</p>
<p>Request OTR allows websites to optionally describe their own content as “sensitive.” The browser can then ask if the user would like to visit the site in OTR mode, where the site is visited in a clean, temporary storage area. Sites visited in OTR mode are not saved to your browsing history, and any cookies, permissions, or other site data do not persist to disk. Meanwhile, other sites visited are stored and treated as normal, obscuring to anyone who may access the device later that any “unusual” behavior happened.</p>
<p>Request OTR is another in Brave’s suite of features that support the privacy needs of individual users, protecting far beyond the “standard” threats browsers typically watch out for. Brave intends to work with other browser vendors to standardize OTR, so that at-risk browser users can be private and safe, across the Web, regardless of which browser they’re using.</p>
<p>This feature has been designed with the input of, and in collaboration with, several civil society and victim advocacy groups. We agree with Mallory Knodel, the CTO at the Center for Democracy and Technology, in the following:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Brave Browser's attention to detail with OTR Mode—users can more easily choose which websites are recorded in their browsing history—is an important privacy innovation that can protect users in "attacker you know" situations or anyone who wants more control over what their browser remembers and what it doesn't. This feature empowers people who browse the web—all of us—and gives us more agency over content consumption.</p>
    <p>— Mallory Knodel, CTO at the Center for Democracy and Technology</p>
</blockquote>

 Some users need to hide their browsing from people who have access to their device 
<p>Most often, when people talk about Web privacy they’re talking about protecting personal data from websites (e.g. blocking Google from recording the sites you visit).</p>
<p>However, Web users have other privacy needs too, needs that are currently poorly served by most browsers. Consider “Sarah,” a hypothetical Web user who lives with “Stan,” a physically abusive partner. Sarah needs to use the Web to learn about legal, medical, and other support services in her area, so she can safely exit her relationship. Stan, though, suspects Sarah may be planning to leave, and begins monitoring Sarah’s phone, computer, and other devices to see if she’s contacting support services.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not only do browsers fail to protect users like Sarah, they actually make it easier for abusers like Stan to digitally surveil others. Browsers record a wealth of information about our browsing behavior and interests, both explicitly (e.g. browsing history, DOM storage, and cookies) and implicitly (e.g. cache state, saved credentials, URL autocomplete). Worse still, the tools browsers do include to protect people like Sarah are incomplete and / or difficult to use correctly.</p>

 Current browsers tools are insufficient for protecting against known abusers 
<p>Browsers currently provide some tools to help users hide their activity on sensitive sites. However, these tools are insufficient to protect people whose safety depends on hiding visits to specific sites from people who have access to their device. Existing tools either hide too much (thus inviting suspicion from abusers), too little (thus allowing abusers to recover browsing history), or are otherwise difficult to use successfully.</p>
<p>Private (also known as Incognito) windows allow users to browse the Web without their browsing activity being permanently recorded. Unfortunately, private windows do a poor job protecting users from on-device surveillance. It’s easy to forget to open a private window before visiting a site, especially under stress, thus causing the site visit to be permanently recorded. And it’s equally as easy to forget to close the private window, and thus continue browsing in the private window beyond just the target sensitive site. This can reveal to the abuser that private browsing modes have been used, which on its own may elicit suspicion or put the victim at further risk.</p>
<p>Similarly, some browsers include advanced browser controls that can be used to delete browser storage for specific sites. This approach has the drawback of needing to be performed after the site was visited, instead of protecting the user during the visit, which may put the user at risk if the browser needs to be closed quickly. Additionally, these controls are often difficult to find, and more difficult still to use correctly for non-technical users. And finally, these browser controls typically only allow the user to delete stored values for the site (e.g. cookies or permissions), but do not allow the user to delete other traces of the site (e.g. browsing history or caches).</p>
<p>Finally, some sensitive sites include quick-exit buttons in the site themselves, which allow a visitor to quickly navigate away from the site in a way that may be semi-difficult for an abuser to detect. While useful, this approach is also incomplete. Quick-exit buttons cannot delete many types of site data (e.g. permissions or caches), and are constrained in their ability to modify browsing history. Further, they depend completely on the correct implementation by the site; the browser is unable to protect the user.</p>

 Brave’s Request OTR provides a novel, powerful protection 
<p>Brave’s Request OTR approach provides a comprehensive way for sensitive sites to request to be omitted from a user’s browsing history and local storage. Any site can request to go OTR, and the user is prompted to see if the user would like to do so. If so, the Brave browser creates a temporary storage area for the site, and does not record the site visit in the user’s browsing history. The OTR session is tied to the site, and any other sites the user visits in the same tab (along with any sites visited in any other tabs) are recorded in browsing history as normal.</p>
<p>More specifically, Brave’s implementation of Request OTR protects the user in the following ways:</p>
 
 The user is protected the entire time they’re visiting a sensitive site; they don’t need to try and scrub their browsing history later. 
 Other, non-sensitive sites are recorded as normal, which prevents big gaps in browsing history that might look suspicious to an abuser. 
 All target site behaviors are prevented from persisting to disk, including cookies, caches, browsing history, permissions, etc. 
 OTR prevents sites from abusing the feature; a site cannot go off-the-record unless a user explicitly gives the site permission to do so. 
 

 How can sites request to be off the record 
<p>Brave has developed Request OTR specifically to help people suffering from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimate_partner_violence">intimate partner violence</a>, or people otherwise needing to hide visits to sensitive sites from their browsing history. However, OTR is intentionally a general browser feature, and is intended to be usable by any site on the Web.&nbsp;</p>

 Request-OTR header 
<p>Currently, there are two ways for a site to request to go off the record in Brave. The primary, intended way is for the site to include the header <code>Request-OTR: 1</code> in the response to the initial navigation request for a site. If the browser sees this header, the browser will halt the navigation and ask the user if they would like to visit the site off the record.</p>
<p>If the user says yes, then the browser does two things:</p>
 
 It does not record the site visit in the browser history 
 It creates a temporary storage area for caches, cookies, permissions, etc. 
 
<p>The browser continues using this temporary storage area for all subsequent pages visited within the same tab, within the same site. When the user closes the tab, or navigates away from the site, the temporary storage area is discarded, and browsing behaviors return to being recorded as normal.</p>

 Request-OTR preload list 
<p>The second way for a site to request to go off the record is to be included in Brave’s preloaded <a href="https://github.com/brave/adblock-lists/blob/master/brave-lists/request-otr.json">list of “request off the record” partner sites</a>. These are sites that serve victims of intimate partner violence, and have told Brave they’re interested in being considered a sensitive site by the browser. This list is intended as a bridge measure, until all sites can implement the previously mentioned header approach.</p>

 Limitations of Brave’s Request-OTR implementation&nbsp; 
<p>Brave’s Request OTR feature prevents visits to sensitive sites from being recorded in a user’s browser history, both overtly (browser history, cookies) and incidentally (caches, permissions, etc). Brave’s Request OTR feature is covered by <a href="https://hackerone.com/brave?view_policy=true">Brave’s security bug bounty program</a>, and we welcome any reports of data from an “off the record” session being incorrectly or incompletely cleared.</p>
<p>However, users should be aware that Brave’s Request OTR feature does not protect users from other software on their computer that might record information about what sites they visit. Examples of software the Brave browser cannot hide browsing history from include:</p>
 
 Browser extensions 
 Network spying 
 Malware or spyware installed on the device 
 Information saved by sites before or after you visit the “off the record” (such as if you have “Google Web History” enabled on Google Search or Gmail) 
 Operating-system level logging 
 Crash logs 
 
<p>Brave is exploring what additional protections can be provided against such threats, but users should be aware that (as with systems like private browsing mode) Brave’s Request OTR mode only prevents recording of core browsing behaviors and data.</p>

 Next steps in Request-OTR 



    


    


<p>We’re excited to release Request Off the Record in upcoming version 1.53 of our desktop browser, with an Android version coming in the 1.54 release. We’ll be rolling it out to users shortly, though people interested in testing the feature now can enable it by visiting <code>brave://flags</code> and enabling <code>#brave-request-otr-tab</code>. Please note that this should only be done if you understand the risks of testing experimental browser features. We welcome all feedback on the feature.</p>
<p>We’re also excited about the next steps we’re taking to further improve the Request OTR feature. First, we’re working with experts and researchers at <a href="https://gwusec.seas.gwu.edu/">George Washington University</a> and <a href="https://cs.uni-paderborn.de/en/">Paderborn University</a> to evaluate how Request-OTR is understood by users, and how we can further convey to users exactly what protections the feature does (and does not) provide. We will both share the research that results from this collaboration on this blog, and incorporate it into future versions of Request-OTR in Brave.</p>
<p>Second, we’re interested in working with other browsers, organizations, and Web companies to potentially standardize Request-OTR, so that users of other websites and browsers can benefit from the protection. Our current implementation is the result of working with a wide range of abuse advocates, technologists, browser specialists, and NGOs, and we’re eager to continue working with similar organizations to best support Web users.</p>

<p>Today, we’re excited to announce a new Web3 feature for Brave Talk, our privacy-preserving video calling product: token-gating. Web3 Brave Talk calls allow hosts to use <a>NFTs</a> and POAPs <a>1</a> to token-gate access, configure avatars, assign moderator permissions, and more. Web3 calling also expands utility for Brave’s browser-native Brave Wallet: Together, they create the first-ever fully integrated Web3 live event platform, combining browser, wallet, and video.</p>
<p>Whereas with other video calling solutions (like Zoom or Google Meet) the host can only control access to a call using a password, Brave’s new Web3 calls enable new functionality regarding user authentication and authorization. Since NFTs can be sold and traded, using NFTs as the gating system creates a video calling system that mimics real life events: You can enter if you have a ticket.</p>
<p>Token-gating is a key development in Brave Talk, allowing hosts to use NFTs and POAPs as access passes to live events. For example, communities can hold members-only calls for token holders. Creators can reward select fans who hold their tokens with exclusive access to them. Businesses can use the open NFT marketplaces to sell and resell tickets to events.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Web3 calls are available to all Brave Talk users on any browser with any Web3 wallet. Hosts can start a Web3 call with a Premium Talk subscription.</p>

 How to get started with Web3 calling 
<p>To get started with Web3 Brave Talk calls, follow these steps:</p>
 
 Open the Brave browser, and visit <a href="https://talk.brave.com/">talk.brave.com</a>. 
 Click Host a Web3 Call (you’ll need a Premium Talk subscription to see this option). 
 When you create (or join) a Web3 room, your wallet will ask to authenticate, and allow access to one of your accounts. 
 Choose an NFT as an avatar. 
 Specify whether participants have to own an NFT or be a member of a POAP group to enter. 
 Share the link to the call with those you’d like to attend. 
 
<p>Note: You don’t have to use <a>Brave Wallet</a> to start or join a Web3 Talk call. Any browser-based or hardware wallet will work.</p>

 What is token-gating? 
<p>Token-gating is one of the main ways you can control access in Web3, and it generally has two parts: authentication and authorization.</p>
<p>Authentication</p>
<p>Web3 authentication starts with a blockchain wallet address that you own. Ownership is verified using the unique signature of your wallet, which only the holder of the wallet can generate:&nbsp;</p>
 
 A service sends a message to you. 
 You sign the message using your crypto address. 
 You send the message back to the server. 
 The service verifies the signature, and then knows you “own” that address. <a>2</a> 
 
<p>Brave Talk uses the <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361">SIWE</a> (Sign-In with Ethereum) protocol for Web3 authentication.</p>
<p>Authorization</p>
<p>For token-gating, authorization consists of specifying a token that an address must have to be authorized.</p>
 
 NFT ownership: You select one or more NFT collections, and if someone wants to join the Web3 room, their authenticated address must have an NFT from at least one of these collections. 
 POAP membership: You select one or more POAP events, and if someone wants to join the Web3 room, their authenticated address must be a member of one of those groups. 
 
<p>There are of course other authorization options, and we may expand to include these options in the future. For now, we’ve selected the two most common methods of NFTs and POAPs.</p>

 What’s next for Web3 Brave Talk? 
<p>While we’re excited to bring Web3 Talk calls to all Brave users, we’re already investigating several enhancements. These include:</p>
 
 Support for non-Ethereum NFTs: At present, only Ethereum NFTs (ERC-721) are supported. We hope to extend token-gating to NFTs on other platforms soon. 
 Token-gating for owners of a particular token: In this case, a participant has to have a specific balance of a particular token to gain entry. 
 Token-gating based on past ownership: this is a variation of the first two possibilities, but instead of looking at the current state of the blockchain, past activity is considered (e.g. if the user address ever owned an NFT from a particular collection). 
 Sending crypto to a participant: Since each participant has authenticated themselves, a “Send crypto” menu option could open a wallet widget with the recipient address already filled-in (with the user then having to enter an amount and approve the transaction). 
 
<p>These are just possibilities. We’d love your feedback and thoughts on other useful Web3 features you’d like to see come to Brave Talk. Feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/brave">tweet at us</a> or <a href="https://github.com/brave">submit an issue on Github</a> to share your ideas.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>A POAP—which stands for Proof of Attendance Protocol—is a type of NFT that signifies real-life attendance or participation in an event like a concert or conference. <a href="https://poap.xyz/about-the-protocol">Learn more at poap.xyz</a>.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>
 
 
<p>Ownership is defined as the wallet has access to the private key that generated the address.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This release includes new key features and introduces a hard fork</p>
 
 A hard fork to support V2 sidechains (See V2 Sidechain New Features) will activate at&nbsp; block #1363115, which will occur on June 7th, 2023 at approximately 13:00 UTC. 
 ZEN 4.0.0 sets the upcoming deprecation date to block #1422426, which will occur on September 19th, 2023 at approximately 12:00 PM UTC. 
 
<p>Note: Zend 4.0.0 is the last version of Zend supporting Ubuntu Bionic. Future releases of Zend will only support Ubuntu Focal or newer, as Ubuntu Bionic is End of Life starting May 31, 2023.</p>     
 

 
         
     Main V2 Sidechain New Features: 
 
 Non-ceasable Sidechains: The Horizen mainchain verifies each sidechain and ensures its integrity. Unlike traditional sidechains that have a limited time to produce a valid proof to keep exchanging information with the Horizen mainchain, sidechains declared as V2 and non-ceasable don’t share this constraint. The certificate can arrive at any time. Non-ceasing sidechains makes the verification process more flexible and frictionless without compromising the security of the system. 
 Key Rotation: A security enhancement that gives the ability to sign transactions and certificates using keys that are not stored locally, that are instead in a separate trusted execution environment 
 One Version: Starting from this version, Bitcore versions of Zen binaries will no longer be released. There will be only one version, which includes the AddressIndexing features (previously included in bitcore version). 
 
<p>Meanwhile, the EON sidechain <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-eon-is-now-live-on-gobi-testnet-with-bug-bounties/">is already live on testnet</a> check it out! We take this opportunity to also thank everyone for the continued support.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a> (ZCG) program funds independent teams to perform major ongoing development (or other work) that benefits the Zcash ecosystem. Grants are chosen by a five-person committee whose members are elected by the<a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/"> Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP)</a>. </p>



<p>Of the current members, Cody Burns’ term expires at the end of June, and Wobbzz has announced that they are resigning their seat and will stand for re-election, in order to facilitate a move to staggered elections (i.e. where two committee members are elected in June, and three in December). </p>



<p>Therefore, we are inviting nominations for an election to be held in June.</p>



 How to Stand for Election to the Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) Committee 



<p>Anyone can stand for election to the ZCG committee. Existing members may stand for re-election, and there are no term limits. </p>



<p>Candidates should submit a forum post (ideally five paragraphs or less) in the&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/governance/zcg-elections/38">governance zcg-elections category of the Zcash Community Forum</a>, announcing their candidacy, and outlining their priorities and vision for Zcash. Community members will have an opportunity to ask candidates questions directly as replies to their respective posts.</p>



<p>The deadline for nominations is 09:00 UTC on Monday 12th June 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We cannot prevent anyone from talking about their candidacy in other media, but we encourage candidates to use the forum threads as their primary method of “campaigning.” Doing so will make it easier for Zcash community members to interact with and assess candidates.</p>



<p>During the week commencing 12th June, the Zcash Foundation will host a community call, during which the candidates will have an opportunity to introduce themselves, and answer questions from the Zcash community. </p>



<p>After the community call, ZF will open a Helios poll of <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">ZCAP</a> to select two candidates to join the ZCG Committee. The poll will close at 09:00 UTC on 1st July 2023.&nbsp;As with previous polls, the election will be decided by approval voting. The two candidates with the most approval votes will become the new ZCG Committee members. They will serve a one-year term, ending on 30th June 2024. </p>



<p>Prospective candidates should familiarize themselves with the Conflict of Interest policy (see below). </p>



 About the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>The largest slice of the&nbsp;<a href="https://zfnd.org/how-the-zcash-foundation-is-funded/">Zcash Dev Fund</a>&nbsp;is earmarked for major grants “<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">to fund independent teams entering the Zcash ecosystem, to perform major ongoing development work (or other word) for the public good of the Zcash ecosystem</a>”. While the funds are administered and disbursed by the Zcash Foundation (ZF), applications for major grants are subject to approval by a five-seat Major Grant Review Committee, which is elected by the <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/"></a><a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP)</a>.</p>



<p>The Committee reviews, assesses and approves or rejects grant applications. Committee members currently meet for brainstorming sessions every week, with formal committee meetings held every two weeks.</p>



<p>The first Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/fd30d13c-e010-11ea-88f3-4a6a23563c24/view">September 2020</a>, and adopted the moniker Zcash Open Major Grants (ZOMG). The second Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/2d0787fc-61de-11ec-8619-8ee85a8a1b8a/view">December 2021</a>, and re-branded itself&nbsp;<a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a>&nbsp;(ZCG).&nbsp;Hudson Jameson stepped down from the committee in <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/hudson-jameson-leaving-zcg/41941">June 2022</a>, triggering the election of Cody Burns, whose term expires at the end of June 2023. Wobbzz has <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/wobbzz-for-zcg-june-2023/44665">announced</a> that they are resigning their seat, effective June 30th, and will stand for re-election, thus facilitating a move to a staggered election cycle, where two seats are up for election in June, and three in December. </p>



<p>Committee members currently receive a stipend of $1,650 per calendar month (paid as shielded ZEC) from the Zcash Foundation (ZF).&nbsp;However, given the budgetary constraints that ZF currently faces, this stipend  may be subject to review over the coming year. </p>



 Conflict of Interest Policy 



<p>As a 501(c)(3) non-profit, the Zcash Foundation is subject to rules regarding private benefit and inurement. </p>



<p>To avoid conflicts of interest, the following policy applies to the ZCG Committee:</p>



 
 Serving ZCG Committee members, and entities in which a serving ZCG Committee member is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest, are ineligible to submit a new grant application to ZCG. 



 A person who has submitted a grant application (or who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that has submitted a grant application) on which the ZCG Committee has not yet rendered a decision is ineligible to serve as a ZCG Committee member (unless the grant application is withdrawn). 



 A person who is a current grant recipient (or a person who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that is a current grant recipient) is eligible to serve on the ZCG Committee so long as the decision to accept their grant application was made before they began serving as a member of the ZCG Committee. 



 Milestone payout decisions that relate to a serving ZCG Committee member’s grant (or a grant awarded to an entity in which a serving ZCG Committee member has a financial interest) will be taken by the executive director or other officer of ZF. 



 Before taking their seat on ZCG Committee, newly-elected Committee members will be required to undergo the ZF’s KYC process, complete a conflict of interest questionnaire, and sign an independent contractor agreement with ZF (to ensure that their status and relationship with ZF is clearly-defined). Additionally, serving ZCG Committee members are required to notify ZF of any new conflicts of interest that develop or emerge during their tenure. 
 



<p></p>



<p>If prospective candidates have any questions about the role, they should post them to <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zcg-committee-election-june-2023/44668">this topic on the Zcash Community Forums</a>.</p>

 🛠️ Deep dive: On new sources of competitive advantage &amp; moats in web3  <p>Scott Duke Kominers et al</p><p>A deep dive and tour through key business concepts from theory to practice, the latest episode of our podcast ‘web3 with a16z’ covers the tricky nuances of business strategy in a new world of open source. The discussion — which features a16z crypto research partner and Harvard Business School professor Scott Kominers in conversation with editor in chief Sonal Chokshi — covers foundational business frameworks yet also what changes in web3, as well as guidance for builders. </p><p>For decades, Michael Porter’s Five Forces model on the competitive forces that shape strategy helped companies understand the structure of their industry to “stake out a position that is more profitable and less vulnerable to attack” — but how do those assumptions change in web3? Where do so-called vampire attacks come in? And what even IS competition in web3, where so much is publicly available on blockchains?</p><p>The question throughout is basically how to compete when you're building in public… So we also go into the new moats of “community cohesion” and software “embeddedness” — and how network effects really work, beyond common misconceptions. Finally: since web3 changes the game altogether, what’s ahead for the evolution of business strategy overall?</p><p><a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/network-effects-moats-competitive-advantage-business-strategy-web3">listen to the discussion</a><br><a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1658516258579685376?s=46&amp;t=m_MyW3EHf_hr6YPWeAdbGA">share on Twitter</a> | <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0x050fe5">share on Farcaster</a></p><p>related:</p>  <p>Vampire attacks: A theory (and thread) on 'blood sucking' platform competition by John William Hatfield and Scott Duke Kominers (2023) — on <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/vampire-attacks-competition/">a16zcrypto.com</a></p>  <p>Can web3 bring back competition to digital platforms? by Christian Catalini and Scott Duke Kominers (2022) — in <a href="https://www.competitionpolicyinternational.com/can-web3-bring-back-competition-to-digital-platforms/">Competition Policy International</a></p>  <p>Why build in web3 by Jad Esber and Scott Duke Kominers (2022) — in <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/05/why-build-in-web3">Harvard Business Review</a></p><p></p>   ▶️ Builder resources: On protocol to product, design, security, &amp; decision making  <p>Taking an idea, and turning it into a real product for people to use, is nothing short of alchemy. So it’s not easy… but several expert speakers at this year’s Crypto Startup School (our accelerator that connects builders with the resources, expertise, and networks they need) distilled their hard-earned experience, and journey through the idea maze, into guidance and frameworks for founders. </p><p>We shared the first batch of talks in our last <a href="https://a16zcrypto.substack.com/p/how-to-build-and-scale-in-web3">edition</a> (be sure to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@a16zcrypto">subscribe to our channel</a> for the next releases), but subsequent batches cover the themes of “from whitepaper to reality”; product and design; leading and decision-making — as well as infrastructure, smart contracts, and security.

While the intention is to reduce any negative impact from cryptocurrency mining on local electricity prices and global pollution, it is far from obvious — from an economics perspective — that the other goals will follow. Or so argues Joshua Gans, professor and economist at the Rotman School of Management, and author of the forthcoming book on The Economics of Blockchain Consensus… </p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/a-new-mining-tax-on-crypto/">read more</a><br><a href="https://twitter.com/joshgans/status/1658573424539717647?s=20">share author’s tweet</a></p><p>see also:</p>  <p>The economics of cryptocurrency mining with Aviv Zohar of Hebrew University — on <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/videos/the-economics-of-cryptocurrency-mining/">a16zcrypto.com</a></p>  <p>Proof-of-Stake Blockchains: Designs, consensus, attacks with Valeria Nikolaenko, Tim Roughgarden, and Sonal Chokshi — on <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/podcast/pos-blockchains-designs-consensus-attacks/">web3 with a16z</a></p>  <p>What The Merge means with Ali Yahya — on <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/what-the-merge-means/">a16zcrypto.com</a></p>   <br><a href="https://twitter.com/milesjennings/status/1658515975170555904?s=20">register here</a><br><br> <p><br>--Sonal Chokshi with Stephanie Zinn, Tim Sullivan, a16z crypto teams<br><br>You’re receiving this newsletter because you signed up for it on our websites, at an event, or elsewhere (you can opt out any time using the ‘unsubscribe’ link below).
