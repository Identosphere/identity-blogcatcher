Enter your email address or phone number to register and create a secure password.  Verify your email or phone number by entering the code sent to&nbsp;you.  Congratulations! You are now one step closer to helping NYM get&nbsp;listed!   Step 2: Identity Verification (KYC) <p>To ensure your vote counts, you must complete the first stage of Know Your Customer (KYC) verification with Bybit. Just follow the steps on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bybit.com/en-US/help-center/s/article/How-to-Complete-Individual-KYC-Verification">Bybit</a>.</p> Step 3: Topping up your Spot&nbsp;Wallet <p>Please note that you do not need to send tokens anywhere to vote. The voting process will be conducted using the instructions provided&nbsp;below.</p>  Go to the “Assets” section of Bybit and select “Spot account.” Then, navigate to the assets&nbsp;page.  Choose the currency you wish to use for topping up your balance. For voting purposes, you must select one of the following currencies: USDT, USDC/BUSD/CUSD/USDD/DAI.  Click on “deposit” and copy the provided deposit wallet&nbsp;address.  Send the desired amount of funds to the deposit wallet address you&nbsp;copied.   Step 4: Voting with&nbsp;ByVotes <p>Please note that there is no need to lock your assets to vote. Your assets will remain in your balance throughout the voting process. The voting process is straightforward:</p>  The voting period on Bybit will begin at 3:00 AM UTC on July 6th and will last for 24&nbsp;hours.  The number of votes you possess will be proportional to the assets held in your Bybit&nbsp;account.  On July 5th at 23:59:59 UTC, a snapshot will be taken of your spot account balance on Bybit to determine the number of votes you have. To be eligible to vote, your assets must be in your account before this time. Please note that topping up your balance to obtain additional votes will not be possible once the voting begins. Only the assets in your account three hours prior to the start of the vote will be&nbsp;counted.  <p>As soon as voting begins, visit the <a href="https://www.bybit.com/en-US/trade/spot/vote-home/">ByVotes site</a> and cast your vote for NYM. According to the rules, a maximum of 10,000 votes (equivalent to $10,000) can be allocated to one project from one account. Remember, 1 vote equals 1 USDT. To maximize our chances, we encourage you to vote within the first few seconds after voting begins. Set a reminder to ensure you don’t miss the vote right at the beginning.</p><p>After NYM Technologies secures the listing vote, you will automatically be entered into our NYM token airdrop. The airdrop will take place on July 7th from 3:00 AM to 7:00 AM (UTC). The total prize pool for the airdrop will consist of $100,000 in NYM tokens. Please note that the maximum reward amount sent to participants will be 1% of the total prize&nbsp;pool.</p><p><a href="https://www.bybit.com/en-US/sign-up?affiliate_id=56941&amp;group_id=95829&amp;group_type=1">VOTE NOW</a></p><p>If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don’t hesitate to ask in the <a href="https://t.me/nymtech">NYM Telegram</a>.</p><p>We are available around the clock to support you, so feel free to stop by and say&nbsp;hi!</p><p>Join Nym Community</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">Twitter</a> // <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> // <a href="https://t.me/nymtech">Telegram</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dev:nymtech.chat">Element</a></p><p>Learn more on <a href="https://www.bybit.com/app/terms-service/information">Bybit Terms &amp; Conditions.</a></p><p>Disclaimer:</p><p>Participation in this program is only available to individuals who do not reside in locations that makes them ineligible to participate and/or receive prizes, including: The USA, Central African Republic, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, Yemen, and Russian occupied regions of Ukraine (including Crimea, and parts of Donetsk and Luhansk).</p><p>Prior to receiving NYM token rewards for this program, participants are required to successfully complete KYC verification with Nym’s KYC provider of&nbsp;choice.</p><p>Nym reserves the right to determine the final outcome of the activity and disqualify any participants without prior notice or recourse for any reason, including fraudulent behavior and failure to adhere to the Nym Code of Conduct <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/coc.html">https://nymtech.net/docs/coc.html</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/voting-instructions-for-nym-nym-listing-on-bybit-200k-airdrops-prize-pools-25a827b6d1fa">Voting instructions for NYM ($NYM) Listing on ByBit — $200K Airdrops prize pools!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Members of the <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a> (ZCG) committee are elected by the Zcash Community Advisory Panel, and serve a one year term. One committee member’s term is expiring at the end of June, and another member has volunteered to resign their seat and stand for re-election in order to facilitate staggered elections. </p>



<p>Last month, <a href="https://zfnd.org/opening-nominations-for-the-zcash-community-grants-committee-june-2023/">we invited candidates</a> to express their interest in serving on the committee. </p>



<p>Three candidates are standing for two seats on the committee. Here is the list of candidates, with links to their candidacy announcement on the Zcash community forum:&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



<p>Last Friday, the candidates took part in a Community Call, during which they introduced themselves and answered questions from the Zcash community. You can watch <a href="https://youtu.be/4jLG0niVqRE">a recording of the call on Youtube</a>. </p>



<p>Today, we opened a <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/1a67b74a-0f4b-11ee-b703-ce0c56736bd3/questions">Helios poll</a> of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP), which will run until 30th June. The poll will be decided by approval voting for two members out of the three candidates. The results will be released on July 1st, and the two candidates with the most approval votes will become the new ZCG committee members with immediate effect.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y-GbVFA1csIgPbvHOR-1ruOlh7YdA-CHvMtd6R8iSdY">ZCAP members</a> should check their mailbox for instructions on how to vote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Good luck to all the candidates, and thank you for volunteering to serve on the ZCG committee!&nbsp;</p>

 Put your NYM tokens to work for preserving privacy in the age of&nbsp;AI <p>Never before has privacy mattered just so much as it does today. After decades of mass data harvesting, AI is now being deployed across industries threatening people’s integrity and security through deep-fakes and stealing people’s jobs, images, compositions, voices and identities for automation. But it <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/five-ways-privacy-tech-can-revolutionise-ai-590db82ec0ab">does not have to be that&nbsp;way</a>!</p><p>Privacy technologies are the deciding factor between AI that works for the people or people that slave for AI and the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90892235/researcher-meredith-whittaker-says-ais-biggest-risk-isnt-consciousness-its-the-corporations-that-control-them">handful of companies that own&nbsp;them</a>.</p><p>Why? Because privacy technologies prevent the ability to extract data, which puts the power to decide back in the hands of&nbsp;people.</p><p>Nym is a powerful privacy mixnet that fixes the privacy problem at the core of the internet. Put your NYM tokens to work, join the global revolution to ensure AI for the people and earn&nbsp;rewards!</p> Put your NYM tokens to work — staking <p>The Nym mixnet is operated by mix nodes all across the world. These nodes mix internet traffic protecting data, metadata, IP addresses and patterns of communication. The mix nodes are rewarded for this work in NYM&nbsp;tokens.</p>  Want to run a mix node? <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/nodes/setup-guides.html">Read&nbsp;more</a>  <p>Nym token holders can stake NYM tokens on a mix node — <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/staking-in-nym-introducing-mainnet-mixmining-f9bb1cbc7c36">which helps secure the network</a>! So even if you don’t want to run a mix node you can still contribute by staking&nbsp;NYM.</p><p>When you stake on a mix node, that increases the mix node’ reputation. This makes it more likely that it will be part of the mixnet, which in turn increases its chances to earn rewards. You, as a staker on that mix node, will earn a share of that node’s&nbsp;rewards.</p> How to&nbsp;stake  1. <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nym-wallet/">Download the Nym wallet </a>and get native NYM&nbsp;tokens <p>The Nym wallet provides the interface for you to delegate your stake. You will need native NYM tokens in order to delegate stake in the Nym mixnet. If you have ERC20 NYM tokens, you can bridge these to native NYM tokens on the Nyx chain— <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/bridging-staking-and-earning-nym-tokens-8f19f42f171e">read&nbsp;more</a>.</p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Join our community</a> to find out more about how to get native NYM&nbsp;tokens.</p> 2. Go to the <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/network-components/mixnodes/active">mixnet explorer</a> and chose a mix&nbsp;node <p>In the explorer you can browse Nym mix nodes. You will want to find a mix node that&nbsp;has:</p>  Good stake saturation (as that signifies reputation), but not 100% or over — as that means the mix node is fully saturated and will not yield optimal&nbsp;rewards.  Low’ish profit margin as that is the amount the operator takes for themselves before sharing with their delegators. (You don’t want too low though as you want to ensure the mix node is financially viable).

 Launching currencies on Verus, and any other PBaaS-chain (Public Blockchains as a Service), is better, faster, cheaper and more secure than any EVM-like protocol out there. This article explains why, gives an in-depth view of all the options and parameters, and teaches how to launch these currencies. Welcome to Verus, a fundamentally different protocol, and the future of currency launches and value creation.  What are Currencies? <p>Let’s go back to basics first. Currencies, also called tokens on many other cryptocurrency protocols, are a critical part of what makes blockchain useful. They can be used as a means of accounting, can represent property or rights external to the blockchain, and over bridges can be thought of as a means of communication or data transfer between blockchains.</p><p>A real-life example is a project that uses the Verus Protocol to account for energy production, transfer and usage. Other examples can be a token pegged to a fiat currency which is a representation of property external to the blockchain. Or fractionalized tokenization of assets, so many can share in group ownership of something. With all the capabilities Verus has in ways to relate tokens and currencies with VerusIDs (and subIDs), novel use cases arise naturally.</p><p>And what makes Verus currencies so powerful is that there is no coding involved. It is just creating a transaction, and then sending that transaction to the blockchain making the currency a reality. Anyone can do&nbsp;it.</p> Better, Faster, Cheaper and More&nbsp;Secure <p>Why is it smarter to launch currencies on the Verus Protocol? The answer is simple, because all launched currencies are part of the consensus mechanism. On EVM-like and account-based protocols (Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polkadot, Cosmos, Avalanche) currencies are not part of consensus and thus easily exploitable by smart contract bugs and malicious developers. With Verus, a UTXO model, all currencies are accounted for, and verified by the worldwide miners and stakers of the protocol, making it as secure as sending BTC on Bitcoin. To make it simple — all features on the Verus Protocol are on the first layer, the consensus layer.</p><blockquote>Verus fundamentally revolutionizes the preexisting cryptocurrency landscape</blockquote><p>Also, where other protocols need L2 solutions which are mostly centralized, Verus includes self-sovereign identities, namespaces, privacy, DeFi, bridges, and currency and blockchain launches on the first layer. An innovation that fundamentally revolutionizes the preexisting cryptocurrency landscape.</p><p>Launching currencies with Verus is also much faster and cheaper than with the alternatives. The magic here is that there is no coding involved. Anyone can launch a currency by just choosing the options and parameters they would like. It is as easy as typing in a command and the currency is ready to be used by the world within minutes. This process does not involve expensive Solidity developers or security audits, saving a lot of development costs.</p><p>Another big advantage is being able to export launched currencies to Ethereum as ERC-20. These currencies can then partake in the Ethereum ecosystem, yet have better security and cheaper DeFi transactions than when they are created on Ethereum itself. Each ERC-20 token can also be bridged to Verus. It’s all super easy thanks to the non-custodial Verus-Ethereum Bridge.</p><p>This is not all some fantasy, this is all functional (the Verus-Ethereum Bridge is in testing), right now, on mainnet, on the Verus Protocol. As you now know, Verus is built fundamentally differently than any other protocol out there, and ushers in a new era for brands, communities, businesses, entrepreneurs and organizations to create value in a better and more secure way than ever&nbsp;before.</p><p>The next chapter explains the options to choose from when launching currencies.</p> Options to Launch Currencies <p>For ease of explaining, all PBaaS-chain launch options are omitted. Good to know — with Verus anyone can also launch fully interoperable, independent and customizable blockchains with all the same L1 features as the Verus blockchain. The focus of this article is on launching currencies only, on Verus or any other PBaaS-chain.</p><p>To launch a currency on Verus (and any other PBaaS-chain) a namespace is needed. That namespace is a VerusID. The namespace is the name of the currency (e.g. MyBrand@). That namespace can also have subIDs (e.g. product.MyBrand@, user.MyBrand@, more on this&nbsp;later).</p><p>On Verus a VerusID registration costs between 20 and 100 VRSC, and the launch of a currency costs 200 VRSC. These costs are always paid in the chain’s native coin (to the worldwide miners and stakers). On other PBaaS-chains these costs can differ since the chain launcher can define its own costs for VerusID registrations and currency launches.</p><p>To define a currency, choose options. Then combine these options to whatever the currency needs to be. Just add the numbers together in the currency definition. The currency options are listed&nbsp;below.</p>  options:1 — The currency has reserves, and can be converted to and from the reserves (option 32 needs to be added). Can have one currency as its reserves, or multiple with up to 10 currencies. Let’s call it a “Basket currency” — a currency with a basket of reserves. Such a currency can be launched centralized or decentralized.  options:2 — Only the controlling VerusID (the namespace of the currency, the rootID) can create&nbsp;subIDs.  options:8 — Referrals and discounts are enabled for subID creation.  options:16 — Referrals are required for subID creation.  options:32 — The currency is a simple token currency without any reserves. Such a currency can be launched centralized or decentralized. This option is also used for <a href="https://docs.verus.io/definecurrency/mapping-1:1-eth.html">Ethereum ERC-20 mapped&nbsp;tokens</a>.  options:2048 — A single satoshi (0.00000001) NFT token is created &amp; has tokenized control of the root VerusID. Which means you can send the single satoshi token to other addresses and then they have control of the root&nbsp;VerusID.  <p>Let’s give some examples of combined&nbsp;options:</p>  "options":33 — this launches a basket currency. It is options 1 + 32 combined.  "options":2080 — this launches a single satoshi token that has control of the root VerusID. It is options 32 + 2048 combined.  "options":35 — this launches a basket currency, and only the rootID can create subIDs. It is options 1 + 2 + 32 combined.  <p>And so on. More information on basket currencies, simple token currencies and subIDs in the next&nbsp;chapter.</p> Two Types of Currencies <p>There are two types of currencies that can be launched with the Verus Protocol. Basket currencies and simple token currencies. Both can be issued decentralized, or centralized (has minting and burning capabilities.)</p> Basket Currencies A simple example of a basket currency containing two reserve currencies.<p>Basket currencies are magical currencies that have reserves. Have a look at the simplified image. If anyone has currency X or Y, they can convert to the basket currency, or convert from reserve to reserve. If anyone has the basket currency, they can go to currency X or Y. A basket currency can have 1 and up to 10 reserve currencies.</p><p>The basket currency supply is dynamic, depending on how much is converted to the basket currency (supply minted), or back to its reserve(s) (supply&nbsp;burned).</p><p>A basket currency can be 100% backed by its reserves, 5%, or anything in between. This is called the reserve ratio, or the weight. The lower the reserve ratio, the more volatile the currency is when people are converting into or out of the basket currency. The value of the basket currency is directly linked to what is in the reserves and what the reserve ratio&nbsp;is.</p><p>When a centralized version of this currency is created, the owner of the rootID can mint currencies into existence, while automatically lowering the reserve ratio. Or they can burn currencies and automatically raise the reserve ratio. Anyone can also just burn the currency at will without raising the reserve&nbsp;ratio.</p><p>The conversion fees are incredibly low, 0.025% when converting to and from a basket currency, and 0.05% when converting from reserve to reserve currency. These fees go directly to the worldwide miners and stakers of the protocol, and/or they are accrued into the reserves making the basket currency worth&nbsp;more.</p><p>Because all currency conversions are solved simultaneously inside a block, giving all participants the same price, the protocol is MEV-free. The protocol doesn’t have any of the problems EVM-like account-based systems have. Verus DeFi is fair, cheap and has no rent-seekers.</p><p>Every(!) currency on the Verus network (also mapped ERC-20s!), can be used as reserves for basket currencies. As you might start to understand now — basket currencies are unique currencies that can not be found anywhere else and offer an enormous amount of opportunities for value creation. And anyone can launch them without needing any programming knowledge!</p> Simple Token Currencies <p>Simple token currencies are just currencies without any reserves. They are not as exciting as the basket currencies, yet still offer much value. With all the parameters that can be added, subIDs created and decentralized crowdfund mechanism, these currencies can support a lot of use cases that are difficult to do with alternative protocols. <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/unleash-the-power-of-verus-technological-showcase-of-centrally-issued-token-fully-backed-by-gold-dcc9fae7ca0f">A small example of a centralized currency&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>The supply of this type of currency is static when it’s a decentralized version. When it’s a centralized version, the owner of the rootID can mint tokens into existence, and anyone can burn&nbsp;them.</p><p>This option is also used to create currencies that are mapped to Ethereum ERC-20s. Which means you can send those ERC-20s over to Verus, or from Verus to the ERC-20. This is made possible with the non-custodial Verus-Ethereum Bridge. <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/get-ahead-of-the-game-with-verus-groundbreaking-1-1-decentralized-currency-mapping-for-erc-20-cc23584a7037">You can read more about it&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>And of course, a simple token currency can be one of the reserves in a basket currency.</p> What are&nbsp;SubIDs <p>SubIDs are powerful objects on the blockchain. They can be registered in an unlimited amount under any created currency (basket and simple token currency). A few examples are product.MyBrand@ or user.MyBrand@. The name MyBrand@ is a VerusID (a namespace) that is converted into a currency. The subIDs are ‘product’ and&nbsp;‘user’.</p><p>SubIDs can be bound digitally to many things. They can be bound to people and products. They can be bound to an unlimited amount of content, data, and provable information, both public and private. Including provable contracts and rights that can be bound to ownership of the subID&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Another powerful feature is that it has read, write and delete functions in what is called the “content multimap”. All kinds of information can be read and processed in the mempool of the blockchain.</p><p>It doesn’t stop there, it’s also a friendly name blockchain address that can receive, send, hold and stake funds, and can be used to login to services, password-free. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/verusid/">Read more about VerusID&nbsp;here.</a></p> Parameters to Launch Currencies This is all anyone needs to do to launch powerful currencies. Zero&nbsp;coding!<p>Next up are the parameters. Choose the parameters wisely to launch a currency that suits any need. Not all parameters are needed or combinable. There are many to go through, so let’s&nbsp;start.</p> “proofprotocol” <p>This parameter defines, among others, if the currency is centralized or decentralized. You can choose 1,2 or&nbsp;3.</p><p>1 is default, which launches a decentralized currency (no need to include this parameter when defining such a currency). When subIDs are created with this option, the registration fees are&nbsp;burned.</p><p>2 is for a centralized currency. If it’s a basket currency the rootID can mint and burn supply while automatically lowering and raising the reserve ratio (also anyone can burn supply without lowering the reserve ratio). Or when it’s a simple token currency they can just mint and burn supply. The subID registration fees go to the&nbsp;rootID.</p><p>3 is for Ethereum ERC-20 mapped tokens. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/definecurrency/mapping-1:1-eth.html">Read more&nbsp;here</a></p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"MyBrand", <br>  "options":32, <br>  "proofprotocol":2, <br>  "preallocations":[{"Klaus@":100}]<br>}' <p>🔍 A simple token currency called MyBrand, centralized (the controller of the rootID can mint and burn), and has a preallocation of 100 tokens to&nbsp;Klaus@.</p> “currencies” <p>Here you put the names of the currencies (or just one — it must have VRSC when launched on Verus) that will be in the reserves when it’s a basket currency (options:33).</p><p>Or when it’s a simple token currency (options:32), what people convert during the preconversion timeframe will go to the rootID of the currency, as a funding mechanism. In the case of a simple token currency, combine it with "conversions" to determine the preconversion price.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"CommunityX", <br>  "options":33, <br>  "currencies":["vrsctest","MyBrand"], <br>  "minpreconversion":[10,50],<br>  "initialsupply":100<br>}' <p>🔍 A basket currency called CommunityX. It needs to get a minimum of 10 VRSCTEST and 50 MyBrand into its reserves within the preconversion time frame to be launched. The initial supply of 100 CommunityX will be distributed among the preconverters.</p> “conversions” <p>Use this parameter when launching a simple token currency. Together with "currencies", it can be used as a funding mechanism for the rootID. It’s for the preconversion price. So when doing "conversions":[0.1], it means that for every VRSC the preconverter receives 10 CURRENCY after launch. The converted VRSC goes into the&nbsp;rootID.</p><p>People can preconvert to this currency within the preconversion time frame. Define a "startblock", or let the default and minimum time frame play out, which is 20&nbsp;blocks.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"CoolBrand",<br>  "options":32,<br>  "currencies":["vrsctest"],<br>  "conversions":[0.1],<br>  "minpreconversion":[1000]<br>}' <p>🔍 This simple token currency is called CoolBrand. During the preconversion time frame people need to convert 1000 VRSCTEST to the rootID. In exchange for that they receive 10.000 CoolBrand. If this minimum amount is not met, the currency will not launch, and everyone who did a preconvert will get their funds&nbsp;back.</p> “minpreconversion” <p>Use this parameter to set a minimum amount of preconversions. The minimum amount of preconversions needs to be met or the currency will not launch and everyone gets their conversions returned, minus the transaction and conversion fees. It works both with basket currencies and simple token currencies.</p><p>There is a 0.025% fee taken when preconverting. Take this into consideration when trying to meet the minimum amount of preconversions.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"CompanyX",<br>  "options":32,<br>  "currencies":["vrsctest"],<br>  "conversions":[2],<br>  "minpreconversion":[500]<br>}' <p>🔍 This simple token currency is called CompanyX. During the preconversion time frame people need to convert 500 VRSCTEST to the rootID. In exchange for that they receive 250 CompanyX. If this minimum amount is not met, the currency will not launch, and everyone who did a preconvert will get their funds&nbsp;back.</p> “maxpreconversions” <p>Use this parameter to set a maximum amount of preconversions. During the preconversion time frame the amount set can not be exceeded. Everything above this amount will be automatically refunded after the currency is launched.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"CoinCommunity", <br>  "options":33, <br>  "currencies":["vrsctest"], <br>  "maxpreconversion":[100], <br>  "initialsupply":100<br>}' <p>🔍 This is a basket currency called CoinCommunity. During the preconversion time frame people can convert VRSCTEST into its reserves for 100 CoinCommunity in return. During the preconversion time frame there can not be more than 100 VRSCTEST converted into its reserves. Whatever is preconverted more will be returned.</p> “initialcontributions” <p>The rootID can contribute some or all of the minimum preconversions directly as part of the currency definition. Use this parameter to make an initial contribution to either the reserves when it’s a basket currency (options:33), or to the rootID when it’s a simple token currency (options:32).</p><p>The funds to initially contribute need to be in the rootID when defining the currency. After the preconversion time frame is over and the currency launched, the rootID has received an amount of the launched currency.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"CommunityBasket", <br>  "options":33, <br>  "currencies":["vrsctest","CoinCommunity"], <br>  "initialcontributions":[10,200], <br>  "initialsupply":100, <br>  "preallocations":[{"Jane@":100},{"John@":50}]<br>}' <p>🔍 This is a basket currency called CommunityBasket. The launcher of the currency wanted to make initial contributions to its reserves. At the moment of broadcasting the currency to the network, there needed to be 210 VRSCTEST and 200 CoinCommunity in the rootID. The initial supply of 100 went to the rootID (if there weren’t any more preconverters). At the same time of the launch, 100 CoinCommunity was minted into Jane@ and 50 into John@, this lowered the reserve ratio of the currency.</p> “initialsupply” <p>A required parameter for basket currencies (options:33). Does not work with simple token currencies. This is the initial supply during the preconversion time frame, before the currency is launched. People preconverting into the reserves receive from this initial&nbsp;supply.</p><p>Immediately after the currency is launched, the supply can be larger due to "preallocations".</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"SocialBrand", <br>  "options":33, "currencies":["vrsctest"], <br>  "initialsupply":500, <br>  "preallocations":[{"Max@":1000}]<br>}' <p>🔍 This is a basket currency called SocialBrand. People can preconvert VRSCTEST into its reserves and in return they get 500 SocialBrand distributed among them. Immediately after launch Max@ receives 1000 SocialBrand, lowering the reserve ratio of the currency.</p> “preallocations” <p>Use this parameter to receive a chosen amount of funds after the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched. Funds can be directed to VerusIDs and R-addresses. Works with simple token currencies and basket currencies.</p><p>When using this parameter with basket currencies, after the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched, the reserve ratio is lowered. This is because new currency has been minted after the initial supply ("initialsupply") is distributed.</p> “prelaunchcarveout” <p>Only works with basket currencies (options:33). Use this to redirect a percentage of preconverted reserves to the&nbsp;rootID.</p><p>After the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched, a percentage of the reserves is taken and redirected to the rootID. This lowers the reserve ratio, making the currency more volatile.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"BusinessBrand", <br>  "options":33, <br>  "currencies":["vrsctest"], <br>  "initialsupply":100, <br>  "prelaunchcarveout":0.1<br>}' <p>🔍 This is a basket currency called BusinessBrand. People can preconvert VRSCTEST into its reserves in return for 100 BusinessBrand distributed among them. When the currency is launched, 10% VRSCTEST is taken out of the reserves, into the rootID. This lowers the reserve ratio by&nbsp;10%.</p> “prelaunchdiscount” <p>Only works with basket currencies (options:33). Use this to give people a discount during the preconversion time frame. After the preconversion time frame and the currency is launched, the conversion price will be higher, depending on what percentage the discount&nbsp;was.</p><p>When using this parameter, after the currency is launched, the reserve ratio will be lowered by the discounted percentage.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"DiscountBrand", <br>  "options":33, <br>  "currencies":["vrsctest"], <br>  "initialsupply":100, <br>  "prelaunchdiscount":0.5<br>}' <p>🔍 This is a basket currency called DiscountBrand. People can preconvert VRSCTEST into its reserves in return for 100 DiscountBrand distributed among them. Immediately after the launch of the currency, when people want to convert, the price is 50% higher. Also, the reserve ratio is 50% lower because of the prelaunchdiscount.</p> “weights” <p>Only works with basket currencies (options:33). Use this to change the respective weights of the reserves in a basket currency. The total of all weights must equal 1. With a minimum of 0.1, since there can’t be more than 10 reserve currencies in a basket currency.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"MyBusiness", <br>  "options":33, <br>  "currencies":["vrsctest","BusinessBrand","DiscountBrand"], <br>  "initialsupply":100, <br>  "weights":[0.5,0.25,0.25]<br>}' <p>🔍 This is a basket currency called MyBusiness. During the preconversion time frame there are various currencies that can be converted into its reserves. They have different weights to them. 0.5 for VRSCTEST, 0.25 for both BusinessBrand and DiscountBrand.</p> “startblock” <p>Use this parameter to define the block height when the currency is launched. There is a preconversion time frame before the currency is launched. When omitting this parameter it uses a 20 block preconversion time frame before the currency is launched.</p><p>The preconversion time frame is always 20 blocks, this can not be&nbsp;less.</p> “endblock” <p>Endblock can not be defined on basket currencies. It does nothing. It could be set as a signal to software that might use the basket currency.</p><p>It can be set on centralized (proofprotcol:2) simple token currencies. When the endblock is reached, it turns the centralized currency into a decentralized one.</p> “idregistrationfees” <p>Use this parameter to change the costs of registering subIDs under the rootID. The default registration fee is&nbsp;100.</p><p>When it’s a decentralized currency the fees are burned, when it’s centralized the fees go to the&nbsp;rootID.</p><p>To enable discounts when using referrals, add "options":8 to the currency definition.</p> “idreferrallevels” <p>Use this parameter to change the levels of referrals used when registering subIDs. The default is 3&nbsp;levels.</p> “nativecurrencyid” <p>Use this parameter for mapped ERC-20 tokens. The parameter includes the Ethereum contract address for the ERC-20. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/definecurrency/mapping-1:1-eth.html">Read here for more information</a>.</p><p>These were all the parameters to use when defining currencies. There are many, and combining them in the right ways make powerful currencies and tokens. The community is always ready to help when defining and launching currencies for your use cases! <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Please go to Discord and ask&nbsp;away.</a></p><p>The next chapter explains how to exactly launch these currencies.</p> How to Launch the Currencies <p>Launching these currencies is quite easy. Launch with the command-line interface, or Verus Desktop for Windows, Linux or macOS. <a href="https://verus.io/wallet">Download&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>In the chapter before many examples of currency definitions are given. Let’s use one and see how it is launched.</p><p>First of all let’s see the difference between launching with Verus Desktop and the command-line interface. Verus testnet is used for testing purposes.</p><p>⚠️ It is highly recommended to launch currencies on testnet first before going to mainnet!&nbsp;⚠️</p><p>Verus Desktop: go to “Settings” (cogwheel top-right) -&gt; “Coin Settings”. There you see an input&nbsp;field.</p>Here you can run commands in Verus&nbsp;Desktop<p>To use the input field and launch a currency on Verus Desktop (see run before the command):</p> run definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"MyBrand",<br>  "options":32, <br>  "proofprotocol":2, <br>  "preallocations":[{"Klaus@":100}]<br>}’ <p>Command-line interface: (this is for testnet, when on mainnet omit -chain=VRSCTEST or for any other PBaaS-chain, just edit VRSCTEST)</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency ‘{<br>  "name":"MyBrand",<br>  "options":32, <br>  "proofprotocol":2, <br>  "preallocations":[{"Klaus@":100}]<br>}' <p>Now, after doing these commands in either Verus Desktop or the command-line interface you get a HEX returned. It’s a very large array of letters and numbers. We need to use this HEX to broadcast the currency to the blockchain. Only then will the currency really start and the funds taken (distributed to the miners and stakers) for the&nbsp;launch.</p> Using the&nbsp;HEX <p>To start the currency use these commands:</p><p>Verus Desktop:</p> run sendrawtransaction "HEX" <p>Command-line interface: (this is for testnet, when on mainnet omit -chain=VRSCTEST or for any other PBaaS-chain, just edit VRSCTEST)</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendrawtransaction "HEX" <p>After doing these commands the currency has started, the funds from the rootID are taken, and it takes a minimum of 20 blocks to actually launch it (and if all preconversion goals are&nbsp;met).</p> Currency information <p>During the preconversion time frame and after the launch you can lookup all kinds of information on the currency.</p><p>Verus Desktop:</p> run getcurrency "MyBrand" <p>Command-line interface: (this is for testnet, when on mainnet omit -chain=VRSCTEST or for any other PBaaS-chain, just edit VRSCTEST)</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrency "MyBrand" <p>Now you know everything to launch currencies! 👉 <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">The worldwide community is happy to help on&nbsp;Discord</a>!</p> Start to&nbsp;Build <p>For all the builders out there, you can start to use the Verus Protocol right now for your Dapps or businesses.

  Partnering with Mach Industries: A New Generation of Defense Technology  <p>Ethan and his team are solving hypersonic defense and revolutionizing defense technology.</p>   
	By Stephanie Zhan and Shaun Maguire	 



Published June 15, 2023
  







 
<p>Defense technology plays a pivotal role in upholding national security and protecting the welfare of citizens. As industries experience a widespread technological revolution, the defense sector is undergoing a crucial transition. With aging defense systems and struggling supply chains, the opportunity for innovation has become increasingly compelling and is driving modernization initiatives aimed at advancing the US’ defense technology. One area of particular interest is hypersonics, defined as controlled flight at speeds greater than five times the speed of sound.</p>



<p>Shaun was in the command room at DARPA when they flew <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersonic_Technology_Vehicle_2">Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 (HTV-2)</a>. He was also deployed to Afghanistan in support of DARPA’s mission. Hypersonic defense has been underestimated by most civilians, but we had a front row seat to this development and had been looking for a technological solution. That experience led to the belief that it is essential the US develops hypersonic missile defenses.</p>



<p>This was top of mind for us when Stephanie first met Ethan Thornton, founder of <a href="https://www.machindustries.com/">Mach Industries</a>. Ethan has worked on hardware for much of his early life, and by age 16, was already prototyping defense applications in his garage. He continued prototyping while studying at MIT, and his work attracted interest from the Lincoln Laboratory, a research and development center funded by MIT and the Department of Defense.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ethan detailed his vision for Mach Industries: a hardware-first approach to defense, with cutting-edge hydrogen creation and combustion techniques. Central to Mach’s innovation is the use of a new generation of fuel: hydrogen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hydrogen offers many benefits: it’s a versatile fuel that can be easily manufactured in the field, it can be interchangeable across all Mach systems, and, most importantly, it enables major advancements in range and power for projectiles as well as unparalleled loiter time and speed for aerial systems. Leveraging this, Mach is focused on developing a suite of oxyhydrogen defense platforms, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and aerial protection devices. With this innovative approach, Mach ultimately aims to solve the challenging problem of hypersonic defense.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve long partnered with companies that support US national security interests, such as SpaceX, Cohesity and Palo Alto Networks, among others. Today, we’re proud to continue this work and lead Mach’s seed round, representing our first investment in a hardware defense technology company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mach is a step-function advancement to the state of the defense industry. We’re incredibly optimistic about the future the <a href="https://www.machindustries.com/team">growing Mach team</a> is building and the potential to revolutionize defense technology.</p>

    <p>Discord started as a place where video game fans and other enthusiasts could chat and bond. Over time, it’s grown into a popular social media platform for millions of people, used for everything from work to fun. Even though the safety measures on Discord have improved since it first started, there are still some major gaps. This has, unfortunately, made the site a magnet for scam artists and mischief-makers who want to make money or create confusion.<br><br>So to stay safe out there, we have put together these best practices for our community:</p>
 
 Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): This adds an additional layer of security to your account by requiring a second verification form.<br> 
 Beware of Phishing Attempts: Phishing scams attempt to trick you into providing your personal information, such as your username and password. Never provide your login credentials in response to an unsolicited request.<br> 
 Watch Out for Suspicious Links: If a link seems suspicious, don’t click it. Scammers often use malware links to gain access to your account or personal information.<br> 
 Monitor Your Account Activity: Regularly check your account activity. If you notice any unfamiliar activity, report it immediately.<br> 
 Privacy Settings: Only allow direct messages and friend requests from people you know. Adjust your security settings to avoid getting contacted by potential scammers.<br> 
 Maintain Vigilance with QR Codes: It’s crucial to stay alert when encountering QR codes from unknown senders. Refrain from scanning any QR codes through your Discord app, except when trying to log in. Nonetheless, avoiding this practice is generally recommended, unless you are entirely sure you are accessing Discord’s official login page. 
 
<p>For issues within our Discord, community members should immediately bring those to the attention of our moderators and support staff if they see any activity that seems suspicious.</p>
 Common Discord Scams 
<p>Here are some typical scams encountered in the Discord environment:</p>
 
 Free Game Scams: These types of scams often involve advertisements for free games or in-game rewards. The scammer provides a link to access the ‘free’ content, which redirects you to a fraudulent login page or downloads malware onto your device. 
 Friend Request Scams: In these instances, a scammer sends a friend request and initiates a conversation. They will eventually either send a malicious link or request personal information. 
 Bot Scams: These scams involve bots that can send bulk messages containing phishing links or deceptive claims. It’s important to be cautious of unanticipated messages or friend requests from bots. 
 Cryptocurrency Scams: Be on guard against those who might tempt you into ‘foolproof’ cryptocurrency investments with promises of astronomical returns. These are often duplicitous schemes, known as rug pulls, or they harbor other malign intentions. 
 Nitro Scams: Scammers may promise free Nitro subscriptions in exchange for your account details or other information. Discord Nitro is a premium service, and there’s no way to obtain it for free. 
 QR Code Scams: Scammers could send a QR code and ask you to scan it for various reasons, such as part of an alleged verification process. Upon scanning, it could reroute you to a deceptive, cloned website resembling the Discord login page, exploiting this to obtain your login credentials/token. 
 The bottom line: The underlying similarity among all these scams is their objective to steal personal information or deliver malware. Always remember, if something appears too good to be true, it probably is. 
 
<p>In conclusion, while Discord has evolved from its initial purpose to become a multifaceted social media platform utilized by millions, it remains a target for those with ill intentions. However, by taking a proactive approach to your safety, you can help to shield yourself from these threats. By implementing these best practices, you can enjoy a more secure experience on Discord. Always remember your digital safety is in your hands. Stay informed, stay vigilant, and most importantly, stay safe!</p>

<p></p>



<p>Today, we’re excited to announce the launch of a newly redesigned Zcash community website (<a href="https://z.cash">https://z.cash</a>). We’ve taken your feedback to heart and have reimagined the site to better serve as an educational and onboarding resource for the Zcash community, and to reintroduce Zcash for a new era.</p>



<p>The new z.cash offers an enhanced user experience and a wealth of resources for Zcash enthusiasts and newcomers, alike. Key features of the new site include:</p>



 
 Learn Hub (“Learn Zcash”): An easy-to-navigate, built-to-grow source of information about Zcash, privacy, and blockchain technology. 



 Ecosystem Hub: A directory of stakeholders, contributors, and tools that fuel the growth and vibrancy of the Zcash ecosystem. 



 Community Hub: A home for upcoming events, news, and developments in the Zcash community. 



 Network Information Hub: Information about the operations and governance of the Zcash protocol. 
 



<p>This website relaunch is a milestone, but it’s also simply a start — a patch of land to grow a garden. In the coming months, we’ll begin working toward fostering greater community involvement with the ultimate goal of transitioning this site and other Zcash digital properties into shared public goods. To stay up-to-date on this forthcoming proposal and other news, follow Electric Coin Co. on social media and keep an eye on the Zcash <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/">community forums</a>.</p>



<p>ECC’s goal is to help build a world where billions of people are empowered with economic freedom through a fair and open currency. To the Zcash community, we appreciate all your ongoing support and your contributions to the ecosystem. We look forward to working together toward a more equitable and decentralized future for all.</p>

 Verida Storage Node Tokenomics — Part 1: Storage Node Economic Model&nbsp;Overview Verida Storage Node Tokenomics — Part 1: Storage Node Economic Model&nbsp;Overview<p>This article is a high level summary of the proposed storage node economic model to support the Verida network self-sovereign database storage infrastructure.</p><p>The Verida network is a self-sovereign “user-pays” model, whereby users pay for their own storage needs. In this way, “access to user data” is not the product, rather the product is the “security and protection” of user&nbsp;data.</p><p>The design is still in draft form and subject to revision prior to launch. Verida will be working with the community and expert partners to refine the model prior to full implementation.</p><p>To progress that work Verida has issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) process for independent parties to bid to provide analysis, modeling, designs, and implementation recommendations for the economic aspects of its protocol.</p> What is the Verida Data&nbsp;Economy? <p>The Verida Token (VDA) creates a data economy enabling secure interactions between accounts to facilitate secure data storage, trusted sharing, fast querying and trusted messaging.</p> Network Participants  End Users <p>Users interact with Verida by interacting with applications and creating DIDs. If users share or create data, they can earn VDA tokens through interactions with the Verida Network applications.</p> Applications <p>Builders create applications that leverage the Verida Network. These applications can earn tokens through end users interacting with the app, through network growth rewards for onboarding users, community incentive grants, and by self-hosting a node on the&nbsp;network.</p> DBStore Node Operators <p>The storage provider market works similarly to a normal storage network. Node operators must bond (i.e. through single-sided staking) VDA tokens to make their nodes discoverable. It is intended that the storage market self regulates itself through competitive forces as providers set their own storage&nbsp;prices.</p>The Verida Token (VDA) creates a data economy enabling secure interactions between accounts to facilitate secure data storage, trusted sharing, fast querying and trusted messaging. Data Storage Economics <p>The Verida network has the following storage objectives:</p>  Create a sustainable economic “user-pays” model  Maximize the geographical distribution of storage&nbsp;nodes  Maximize the availability and security of data stored on and across the&nbsp;network  Incentivize early adoption to bootstrap the&nbsp;network  <p>Users pay a monthly fee to access storage on the network. There are currently no charges for bandwidth.</p><p>Storage node operators earn fees, in arrears, for the storage capacity they provide to the network that is utilized by&nbsp;users.</p><p>A small transaction fee, similar to gas fees on blockchain networks, is intended to be retained by the Verida network to support its ongoing development and&nbsp;growth.</p> Building a self-sovereign data&nbsp;network <p>Verida enables a “self-sovereign” data network, so it’s essential that all stakeholders have control and choice. Users can choose which storage nodes they want to use for storing their data, while storage node operators have the choice to not provide their service to a particular user.</p>A self-sovereign data network, where users can choose which storage nodes they want to use for storing their&nbsp;data<p>This creates a free market that can evolve as the Verida Protocol matures and the network grows. Storage node operators can differentiate themselves by offering service level agreements, geographical coverage and eventually pricing.</p><p>The Verida network requires end users to pay for storage, but they need to be supported by the network and applications to ensure a smooth onboarding experience. Storage of user data in web2 is supported by centralized platforms that pay for the storage on behalf of the user and then earn revenue from other sources (such as advertising).</p><p>We are seeking to replicate the web2 model where users can start for free, but then move to a more sustainable user pays model once the user discovers the value of the network and its applications.</p><p>The network will sponsor the initial storage of a user when they join the network and then reward the user with VDA tokens as they bring meaningful value and utility to the network. These end user rewards can then be used to pay for storage on the&nbsp;network.</p> Crypto Economic Modeling for the Verida&nbsp;Network <p>Verida has issued an RFP to find a qualified independent vendor to provide analysis, modeling, designs, and implementation recommendations for the economic aspects of the Verida protocol and token&nbsp;design.</p><p>The RFP process is being managed by Dave Costenaro at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/build-well-consulting/">Build Well</a>. Dave previously worked at the CryptoEconLab at Protocol Labs, focusing on token incentives, tokenomics, mechanism design, network monitoring for Filecoin.</p><p>If you are interested in submitting a proposal to be considered for the engagement please check the following <a href="https://docsend.com/view/4hy7rjyug4n8f369">document</a>. This document also contains detailed information about the RFP’s Evaluation Criteria, Timeline, and Submission Instructions. If you have questions about submitting a proposal please get in touch with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidcostenaro/">Dave</a>.</p> What’s next <p>We hope this article has given an insight into the design of Verida Network economics. In the following weeks, we’ll be publishing follow up articles which go into further details on the economic model, covering storage fees, payments, claims and storage node infrastructure.</p><p>If you have questions or feedback please chat with us in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/664594912460668960/1092274729328574464">#storage-nodes channel</a> in the Verida discord.

  The New Language Model Stack  <p>How companies are bringing AI applications to life</p>   
	By Michelle Fradin and Lauren Reeder	 



Published June 14, 2023
  







 
<p>ChatGPT unleashed a tidal wave of innovation with large language models (LLMs). More companies than ever before are bringing the power of natural language interaction to their products. The adoption of language model APIs is creating a new stack in its wake. To better understand the applications people are building and the stacks they are using to do so, we spoke with 33 companies across the Sequoia network, from seed stage startups to large public enterprises. We spoke with them two months ago and last week to capture the pace of change. As many founders and builders are in the midst of figuring out their AI strategies themselves, we wanted to share our findings even as this space is rapidly evolving.&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. Nearly every company in the Sequoia network is building language models into their products.&nbsp;<br>We’ve seen magical auto-complete features for everything from code (Sourcegraph, Warp, Github) to data science (Hex). We’ve seen better chatbots for everything from customer support to employee support to consumer entertainment. Others are reimagining entire workflows with an AI-first lens: visual art (Midjourney), marketing (Hubspot, Attentive, Drift, Jasper, Copy, Writer), sales (Gong), contact centers (Cresta), legal (Ironclad, Harvey), accounting (Pilot), productivity (Notion), data engineering (dbt), search (Glean, Neeva), grocery shopping (Instacart), consumer payments (Klarna), and travel planning (Airbnb). These are just a few examples and they’re only the beginning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. The new stack for these applications centers on language model APIs, retrieval, and orchestration, but open source usage is also growing.&nbsp;</p>







 
 65% had applications in production, up from 50% two months ago, while the remainder are still experimenting.&nbsp; 



 94% are using a foundation model API. OpenAI’s GPT was the clear favorite in our sample at 91%, however Anthropic interest grew over the last quarter to 15%. (Some companies are using multiple models).&nbsp; 



 88% believe a retrieval mechanism, such as a vector database, would remain a key part of their stack. Retrieving relevant context for a model to reason about helps increase the quality of results, reduce “hallucinations” (inaccuracies), and solve data freshness issues. Some use purpose-built vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, Qdrant, Milvus, and many more), while others use pgvector or AWS offerings. 



 38% were interested in an LLM orchestration and application development framework like LangChain. Some use it for prototyping, while others use it in production. Adoption increased in the last few months.&nbsp; 



 Sub-10% were looking for tools to monitor LLM outputs, cost, or performance and A/B test prompts. We think interest in these areas may increase as more large companies and regulated industries adopt language models.&nbsp; 



 A handful of companies are looking into complementary generative technologies, such as combining generative text and voice. We also believe this is an exciting growth area.&nbsp; 



 15% built custom language models from scratch or open source, often in addition to using LLM APIs. Custom model training increased meaningfully from a few months ago. This requires its own stack of compute, model hub, hosting, training frameworks, experiment tracking and more from beloved companies like Hugging Face, Replicate, Foundry, Tecton, Weights &amp; Biases, PyTorch, Scale, and more. 
 



<p>Every practitioner we spoke with said AI is moving too quickly to have high confidence in the end-state stack, but there was consensus that LLM APIs will remain a key pillar, followed in popularity by retrieval mechanisms and development frameworks like LangChain. Open source and custom model training and tuning also seem to be on the rise. Other areas of the stack are important, but earlier in maturity.</p>
 







 
<p>3. Companies want to customize language models to their unique context.&nbsp;<br>Generalized language models are powerful, but not differentiating or sufficient for many use cases. Companies want to enable natural language interactions on their data—their developer docs, product inventory, HR or IT rules, etc. In some cases, companies want to customize their models to their users’ data as well: your personal notes, design layouts, data metrics or code base.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right now, there are three main ways to customize language models (for a deeper technical explanation, see <a href="https://build.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/db3f4859-cd30-4445-a0cd-553c3304f8e2">Andrej’s recent State of GPT talk</a> at Microsoft Build):&nbsp;</p>



 
 Train a custom model from scratch. Highest degree of difficulty.&nbsp;<br>This is the classical and hardest way to solve this problem. It typically requires highly skilled ML scientists, lots of relevant data, training infrastructure and compute. This is one of the primary reasons why historically much natural language processing innovation occurred within mega-cap tech companies. BloombergGPT is a great example of a custom model effort outside of a mega-cap tech company, which used resources on Hugging Face and other open source tooling. As open source tooling improves and more companies innovate with LLMs, we expect to see more custom and pre-trained model usage.&nbsp; 



 Fine-tune a base model. Medium degree of difficulty.&nbsp;<br>This is updating the weights of a pre-trained model through additional training with further proprietary or domain-specific data. Open source innovation is also making this approach increasingly accessible, but it still often requires a sophisticated team. Some practitioners privately admit fine-tuning is much harder than it sounds and can have unintended consequences like model drift and “breaking” the model’s other skills without warning. While this approach has a greater chance of becoming more common, it is currently still out of reach for most companies. But again, this is changing quickly.&nbsp; 



 Use a pre-trained model and retrieve relevant context. Lowest degree of difficulty.&nbsp;<br>People often think they want a model fine-tuned just for them, when really they just want the model to reason about their information at the right time. There are many ways to provide the model the right information at the right time: make a structured query to a SQL database, search across a product catalog, call some external API or use embeddings retrieval. The benefit of embeddings retrieval is that it makes unstructured data easily searchable using natural language. Technically, this is done by taking data, turning it into embeddings, storing those in a vector database, and when a query occurs, searching those embeddings for the most relevant context, and providing that to the model. This approach helps you hack the model’s limited context window, is less expensive, solves the data freshness problem (e.g. ChatGPT doesn’t know about the world after September 2021), and it can be done by a solo developer without formal machine learning training. Vector databases are useful because at high scale they make storing, searching and updating embeddings easier. So far, we’ve observed larger companies stay within their enterprise cloud agreements and use tools from their cloud provider, while startups tend to use purpose-built vector databases. However, this space is highly dynamic. Context windows are growing (hot off the presses, OpenAI just expanded to 16K, and Anthropic has launched a 100K token context window). Foundational models and cloud databases may embed retrieval directly into their services. We’re watching closely as this market evolves.&nbsp; 
 



<p>4. Today, the stack for LLM APIs can feel separate from the custom model training stack, but these are blending together over time.<br>It can sometimes feel like we have a tale of two stacks: the stack to leverage LLM APIs (more closed source, and geared towards developers) versus the stack to train custom language models (more open source, and historically geared towards more sophisticated machine learning teams). Some have wondered whether LLMs being readily available via API meant companies would do less of their own custom training. So far, we’re seeing the opposite. As interest in AI grows and open source development accelerates, many companies become increasingly interested in training and fine-tuning their own models. We think the LLM API and custom model stacks will increasingly converge over time. For example, a company might train its own language model from open source, but supplement with retrieval via a vector database to solve data freshness issues. Smart startups building tools for the custom model stack are also working on extending their products to become more relevant to the LLM API revolution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>5. The stack is becoming increasingly developer-friendly.<br>Language model APIs put powerful ready-made models in the hands of the average developer, not just machine learning teams. Now that the population working with language models has meaningfully expanded to all developers, we believe we’ll see more developer-oriented tooling. For example, LangChain helps developers build LLM applications by abstracting away commonly occurring problems: combining models into higher-level systems, chaining together multiple calls to models, connecting models to tools and data sources, building agents that can operate those tools, and helping avoid vendor lock-in by making it easier to switch language models. Some use LangChain for prototyping, while others continue to use it in production.&nbsp;</p>



<p>6. Language models need to become more trustworthy (output quality, data privacy, security) for full adoption.&nbsp;<br>Before fully unleashing LLMs in their applications, many companies want better tools for handling data privacy, segregation, security, copyright, and monitoring model outputs. Companies in regulated industries from fintech to healthcare are especially focused on this and report having trouble finding software solutions to address it (a ripe area for founders). Ideally there would be software to alert, if not prevent, models from generating errors/hallucinations, discriminatory content, dangerous content, or other issues. Some companies are also concerned about how data shared with models is used for training: for instance, few understand that ChatGPT Consumer data is default used for training, while ChatGPT Business and the API data are not. As policies get clarified and more guardrails go into place, language models will be better trusted, and we may see another step change in adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>7. Language model applications will become increasingly <br>multi-modal.&nbsp;<br>Companies are already finding interesting ways to combine multiple generative models to great effect: Chatbots that combine text and speech generation unlock a new level of conversational experience. Text and voice models can be combined to help you to quickly overdub a video recording mistake instead of re-recording the whole thing. Models themselves are becoming increasingly multi-modal. We can imagine a future of rich consumer and enterprise AI applications that combine text, speech/audio, and image/video generation to create more engaging user experiences and accomplish more complex tasks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>8. It’s still early.&nbsp;<br>AI is just beginning to seep into every crevice of technology. Only 65% of those surveyed were in production today, and many of these are relatively simple applications. As more companies launch LLM applications, new hurdles will arise—creating more opportunities for founders. The infrastructure layer will continue to evolve rapidly for the next several years. If only half the demos we see make it to production, we’re in for an exciting ride ahead. It’s thrilling to see founders from our earliest-stage Arc investment to Zoom all laser focused on the same thing: delighting users with AI.</p>



<p>If you’re founding a company that will become a key pillar of the language model stack or an AI-first application, Sequoia would love to meet you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you to all the founders and builders who contributed to this work, and Sequoia Partners Charlie Curnin, Pat Grady, Sonya Huang, Andrew Reed, Bill Coughran and friends at OpenAI for their input and review.</p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of the first stable, audited version of Zebra, <a href="https://zfnd.org/zebra/download/">Zebra 1.0.0.</a></p>



 What Zebra Does and Why it Matters 



<p>Zebra, the first Zcash node to be written entirely in Rust, can be used to join the Zcash peer-to-peer network, validate and broadcast transactions, and maintain the Zcash blockchain state in a more distributed manner. This alternative node implementation has been written from the ground up and avoids any technical baggage from the bitcoin legacy code. Diversity in node implementations and platforms help to strengthen the resilience of the network from targeted attacks affecting a particular codebase, programming language or operating system.</p>



 Building Critical Privacy Infrastructure in Rust: Modern, Memory-Safe  



<p>Zebra is developed in Rust, which is a memory-safe language, and thus less likely to be affected by memory-safety security bugs that could compromise the environment where it is run. Rust emphasizes performance and concurrency and these are qualities we have aimed to achieve in Zebra as well.</p>



 A New Paradigm for Privacy Infrastructure Development  



<p>Unlike zcashd, which originated as a Bitcoin Core fork and inherited its monolithic architecture, Zebra has a modular, library-first design, with the intent that each component can be independently reused outside of the zebrad full node. For instance, the zebra-network crate containing the network stack can also be used to implement anonymous transaction relay, network crawlers, or other functionality, without requiring a full node. With Zebra, we have redesigned our network layer to be fully compatible with Zcash and at the same time easier to maintain, more secure, and have better performance.</p>



 Future Plans  



<p>While this is a major milestone for Zebra, it’s just the beginning! There is a lot more to do before Zebra can fulfill all the use cases that the zcashd node is currently used for. We want to hear from the Zcash community regarding which use cases and functionality they would like to see prioritized for integration into Zebra. Please share your feedback and ideas on the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zebra-1-0-0-stable-release/44867">Zcash Community Forum</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 



<p></p>



<p>We would like to thank the following current and past ZF team members for their contributions to Zebra. Without their work and support we would not have reached this milestone today:</p>



<p>Josh Cincinnati, Antonie Hodge, Deirdre Connolly, Teor, Pili Guerra, Alfredo Garcia, Marek Bielik, Conrado P. L. Gouvêa, Gustavo Valverde, Arya Solhi, George Tankersley, Henry de Valence, Jane Lusby, Janito, Vaqueiro Ferreira Filho, Fungai Matambanadzo</p>



<p>We’d also like to thank the ECC team for their contributions to Zebra in the form of both code and code reviews, as well as the advice and support they’ve provided to the ZF team, and those community members who have <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/graphs/contributors">contributed in various ways</a>, including code, fixes, and typo corrections.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are excited to announce our partnership with Auros, a global algorithmic trading and market-making firm, have entered a strategic partnership that will increase widespread access to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/horizen/">$ZEN</a> in preparation for the launch of the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io">EON</a> ecosystem, Horizen’s new EVM-compatible smart contracting platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The partnership is set to drive significant growth for the EON ecosystem. Enhanced liquidity for the $ZEN token across centralized and decentralized exchanges, underpinning many functionalities of the EON ecosystem, will increase opportunities for traders, DeFi users, and builders to participate in one of the fastest growing layer-0. Besides instant liquidity provision, this long-term partnership will extend beyond the $ZEN token to future projects building on EON, providing bespoke support based on the unique needs of each project.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Liquidity for any ecosystem token is not only essential for seamless trading, but also key to unlocking the utility and potential of innovative smart contract platforms, advancing the overall growth of digital assets. Bringing our proprietary trading technology and strategies to Horizen’s EON, we are proud to expand the availability of liquidity in both the platform and the $ZEN token, delivering more value for all of its users. Beyond liquidity provision, this partnership also represents a significant step and a new hope for the decentralised ecosystem as we jointly work towards a more resilient future for digital assets.”</p>
– Ben Roth, Chief Information Officer and Co-founder of Auros </blockquote>



<p>As a major market participant trading upwards of several billion dollars daily and integrated with dozens of venues, this partnership is underpinned by Auros’ algorithmic and high-frequency heritage. Their distinctive, partnership-oriented approach to liquidity provision is designed from the ground up, incentivizing Auros to ensure that the liquidity for the token matches the growth of Horizen EON.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We are thrilled to join forces with Auros, a market leader in algorithmic trading and market-making services. Their expertise in bespoke liquidity solutions will undoubtedly enhance the EON ecosystem. More importantly, the partnership deepens cornerstone liquidity in the ecosystem, delivering more value to our users and enabling seamless trading experiences that will drive the growth of EON as the premier platform for traders and DeFi enthusiasts alike. Together, we are committed to shaping the future of decentralized finance and setting new industry standards.”</p>
– Rob Viglione, Co-founder of Horizen and CEO of Horizen Labs</blockquote>



<p>Horizen’s EON is a fully EVM-compatible smart contracting platform and is the first of many smart contract sidechains on the Horizen ecosystem. The integration of Auros’ market-making services will serve to cement EON as an accessible yet valuable network for traders and DeFi users.</p>



<p>Horizen EON is currently live on its permanent public testnet, <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/status/gobi">Gobi</a>, and is supported by a network of products, integrations, and tools, including Auros. With the collaboration between Horizen and Auros, <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/ecosystem">the EON ecosystem</a> is set to welcome a wealth of dApps and services in the coming months.</p>

<p>A way forward for privacy in&nbsp;CBDC’s.</p><p>In a world where digital transactions are becoming increasingly prevalent, ensuring privacy and data protection has emerged as a critical&nbsp;concern.</p><p>As governments and financial institutions explore the development of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), we at Aztec Labs aim to stand at the forefront of educating decision makers on the privacy revolution in digital transactions.</p><p>We hope our cutting-edge approach to Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) will be considered by the Bank of England, particularly in response to the recent consultation on the digital&nbsp;pound.</p><p>In February, 2023 the Bank of England and His Majesty’s Treasury published a consultation paper titled “<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2023/the-digital-pound-consultation-paper">The digital pound: a new form of money for households and businesses?</a>”</p><blockquote>Read the Bank of England and Treasury’s consultation paper and accompanying technology working paper&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2023/the-digital-pound-consultation-paper">here</a>.</blockquote><p>In this blog post, we delve into the context of the consultation and highlight Aztec Labs’ responses that we hope have shift the digital pound’s design toward incorporating blockchain-based privacy.</p> Consultation on the Digital&nbsp;Pound <p>The digital pound, a proposed central bank digital currency (CBDC) by the Bank of England, has sparked considerable discussion about its design, functionality, and associated privacy implications.</p><p>The Bank of England has sought feedback and ideas through an open consultation process, and as a leading provider of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies, we at Aztec Labs are proud to present our vision for a privacy-enhancing digital pound that aligns with the highest standards of data protection.</p> Aztec: A Paradigm Shift in Privacy and Data Protection <p>Aztec Labs’ response to the consultation underscores our commitment to incorporating advanced PETs into the digital pound’s infrastructure.</p><p>Our privacy-centric approach centers around the use of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) — a powerful cryptographic tool that enables the verification of statements without revealing sensitive underlying data. At Aztec Labs we’re focused on researching at the forefront of ZKP’s, which have significant advantages over other PETs in terms of technical feasibility, production use, compliance, interoperability, and data protection.</p> ZKP Tooling: Empowering Practical Implementation <p>To facilitate the practical implementation of ZKPs within the digital pound, Aztec Labs is funding the development of Noir, an open-source programming language.</p><p>Noir streamlines the development of ZKP applications, making it accessible for developers to integrate compliant privacy solutions to blockchain applications without extensive knowledge of cryptography.</p><p>This user-friendly tooling eliminates the need for developers to focus on circuit-building complexities and empowers them to concentrate on designing the logic behind ZKP applications. Additionally, Noir’s compatibility with various proving systems ensures future-proof integration and scalability.</p> Applicability of ZKPs to the Digital Pound: Privacy and AML-CTF&nbsp;Measures <p>There is an inherent tension between ensuring Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) measures while safeguarding consumer data privacy. Previous solutions are either airtight, forgoing compliance, or involve installing data backdoors, compromising user&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>ZKPs offer a solution that allows the Bank to perform the necessary AML and CTF checks without compromising individuals’ privacy. By leveraging ZKPs, the digital pound can maintain robust compliance measures while protecting users’ personal data, surpassing the privacy levels of traditional digital money&nbsp;systems.</p> ZKPs for Compliance and User Privacy: A Win-Win&nbsp;Solution <p>We illustrate the practical application of ZKPs in verifying compliance with regulatory requirements. Through ZKPs, end consumers can provide proofs of fulfilling various conditions, such as valid Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, absence from sanctions lists, and adherence to transaction limits.</p><p>These proofs can be verified in milliseconds, ensuring efficient and secure transactions. Furthermore, ZKPs empower the Bank to oversee the digital pound’s operation while mitigating risks associated with relying solely on compliance from payment interface providers (PIP’s).</p> Tiered Access and User Control: Fostering Financial Inclusion <p>Aztec Labs recognizes the importance of tiered access to the digital pound based on user identity information. By implementing ZKPs, the digital pound can link the level of user identification with specific account features and transaction limits.</p><p>This approach enables financial inclusion, allowing users with limited identification documents or means to access the digital pound and enjoy its benefits. ZKPs’ role in tiered access ensures both privacy and compliance, providing users with control over their personal transaction data.</p> Privacy-Enhancing; Future-Proof <p>Without base-layer privacy protection, digital currencies risk headwinds to adoption, as they may be even more privacy exposing than current encrypted financial systems.</p><p>Aztec Labs firmly advocates for embedding privacy-enhancing techniques into the digital pound’s design to offer users greater control over their privacy preferences. We strongly believe zero-knowledge protocols as a category are the most effective technology for achieving the digital pound’s policy objectives while protecting privacy.</p><p>Furthermore, we believe deployment of the digital pound on the Ethereum blockchain harnesses its broadly recognized benefits of transparency, innovation, and global integration. This approach would not only bolster privacy and security but also position the pound as a prominent fiat currency in the digital&nbsp;economy.</p> Conclusion <p>Aztec Labs’ responses to the consultation on the digital pound present an innovative and transformative approach to privacy in digital transactions. By harnessing the power of Zero-Knowledge Proofs and their proprietary tooling, Noir, Aztec Labs offers a practical and efficient solution to address privacy concerns while ensuring compliance with AML, CTF, and KYC requirements. Our vision for a privacy-enhancing digital pound, coupled with potential deployment on the Ethereum blockchain, heralds a new era of secure, inclusive, and forward-looking digital currency.</p><p>As the world moves toward digitalization, we are leading the charge in protecting individual privacy and data security for digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Read our full response&nbsp;here:</p> Join the Conversation <p>Aztec is building at the cutting edge of blockchain privacy and encryption.

 Helpful changes to the Veil Core wallet code ready for a minor update (coming soon) 
 
   A reminder in the command line (or Debug Console) help that “dumpprivkey” and “dumpwallet” does not include private keys for stealth addresses. “Use wallet.dat file or seed words for complete backup”. This note is also now added to the output of dumpwallet, to be sure. 
   The “Overview” wallet page in the GUI wallet is where we normally see a list of transactions, but when someone starts the wallet without any transactions yet, it shows some information to help them get started! People can forget all about these things once a single transaction appears, and there was no way to see that page again! You might know it as the <a>“Looks like you are new here” page</a>! So a helpful contributor made a very neat way of displaying it again whenever you want, which also as a side-effect made the existing in-wallet FAQ much more accessible! The link to Veil.tools now works there too.

 The Veil official TWITTER promo for MAY 2023 has completed 
<p>A 10,000 Veil bounty was paid to the indefatigable Veil enthusiast “VEILionaire | @veilminer007”! “@C0nt1ng3nt” came in a very worthy second, and received a 500 Veil bounty, while “Alex mail | @Alex_m_here” is offering his third place prize of 50 Veil (which we will double) to someone else who retweets and includes their Veil stealth address and follows his Twitter account and ours! It’s presently the pinned post on <a href="https://twitter.com/ProjectVeil">@ProjectVeil on Twitter</a> — <a href="https://twitter.com/ProjectVeil/status/1663726287582642179?s=20">The exact tweet is here</a>! Our favorite Veil meme artists are therefore currently VEILionaire and C0nt1ng3nt, with “Alex mail” providing enthusiastic support! 😀</p>

 Reminder that miners on Veil are currently SOLO mining ProgPoW without a pool 
<p>With the Veil price still a bargain, there was not enough money in it for our appreciated former ProgPow pool WoolyPooly to keep supporting the coin. There was another pool that started not long ago for RandomX, <a href="https://fastpool.xyz/veil-rx/">fastpool.xyz/</a>, remind us if there are any others!
SHA256D is still solo CPU mining. No ASICs developed. This would and will change with a much better Veil price, as incentives would make it happen.</p>

 TWITTER alternatives 
<p>Results from Twitter have not been up to expectations, so we would like to encourage people (and this is a call to the Veil team also) to get active on other platforms such as:</p>

   TRUTH SOCIAL - Maybe try this too. <a href="https://truthsocial.com/">truthsocial.com</a> USA only? 
   Tried Parler.com but it doesn’t even load any more. 
   Please let us know (in our <a href="http://discord.veil-project.com">DISCORD</a>) about any other platforms worth trying! 
 

 Core development 
<p>More developers are coming in, but if you know of people who have an outstanding understanding of Applied Cryptography, ZK Proofs, zkSNARKs, and such things, like serious mathematicians, and have goals aligned with the Veil, cryptocurrency and Bitcoin community, they would be ideal candidates. We have a number of textbook PDFs for others who would like a refresher.</p>

<p>RingCT staking, while running on the development network is still awaiting some bug fixes and further rigorous testing.</p>

 The markets 
<p>The VEIL price and volume, last time checked on CoinGecko, there seems to be a bug in their data that suggests that not only there hasn’t been any volume for six days, (not true), that the price is $151.7 BILLION DOLLARS and the volume $207.6 million dollars! 🤪 Also NOT true!</p>

<p>On the other hand, on CoinMarketCap they are using PROBIT’s data, which in fact has days of zero volume, while TradeOgre’s price and volume is perfectly correct, just not what CoinGecko is currently showing you!</p>

<p><a>CoinGecko-priceError</a></p>

<p>Please check the Veil markets directly for the time being!</p>

 Verida Wallet — The Ultimate Guide to Getting&nbsp;Started <p>With the growing adoption of web3 and the emergence of wallets, Verida has built a digital wallet that holds and protects its users’ crypto as well as private encrypted data. In this article, we will take a closer look at Verida Wallet, its key features and benefits, and how it&nbsp;works.</p><p><a href="http://verida.io">Verida Wallet</a> is more than just a crypto wallet; it’s a gateway to a new world of decentralized identity, allowing users to control their personal data, manage digital credentials and securely communicate with other applications and&nbsp;users.</p><p>Data is now one of the most important assets for both individuals and corporations in the modern digital age. Data privacy and security have, however, grown to be very important issues for many people due to the rise in data breaches and the exploitation of personal information.</p><p>As a potential response to these issues, Verida has built a digital wallet that is capable of decentralized data management with evolved sharing systems that give users more control over their personal data and more effective methods of sharing it with others. You know the saying “Not your keys, not your crypto”; for Verida we extend that to data, “not your keys, not your&nbsp;data”.</p> Things you should know about the Verida&nbsp;Wallet <p>Verida Wallet is built on top of the <a href="http://verida.network">Verida Protocol</a>. It is a decentralized, user-centric wallet that allows users to securely store, manage, and share their data across multiple decentralized applications (dApps) and platforms.</p><p>The wallet uses the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">w3c decentralized identifier (DID) standard</a> for maximum compatibility. User identities can be found via a public address or a friendly username. Users can manage multiple identities to separate their anonymous work and even personal information. Each identity has a public profile, you can share as much or as little information as you like, you can also connect web2 accounts and crypto wallets to showcase who you are to the world. A built-in multi-chain crypto wallet supports Polygon, Ethereum, NEAR and Algorand.</p><p>Verida Wallet is a user-focused wallet for decentralized data management and helping you gain control over your personal&nbsp;data.</p> Core Features of the Verida&nbsp;Wallet <p>Verida Wallet is a mobile application with a comprehensive data management platform for end-users that provides private key management and a user-friendly interface for interacting with the <a href="http://verida.network">Verida network</a> and other supported networks. It consists of several components, such&nbsp;as:</p> Decentralized Identity <p>The Verida Wallet allows users to create new decentralized identities, create new blockchain wallets, manage private keys, and facilitate single sign-on which provides simple, consensual authentication and authorization across an ecosystem of decentralized applications.</p> Zero-Knowledge and Verifiable Credentials <p>The wallet also supports verifiable credentials that meet the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">w3c specification</a>, the wallet supports credentials on the <a href="https://cheqd.io/">Cheqd network</a>, Verida Network, as well as zero-knowledge credentials on the <a href="https://polygon.technology/polygon-id">Polygon ID network</a>. Users can connect and receive their credentials, store them on the Verida Network and then use them to prove information about themselves, either in a zero-knowledge way or using standard credentials</p> Crypto Tokens, NFTs and Transactions <p>Users earn incentives in the form of Verida token rewards by using the Verida network. You can perform transactions and manage crypto on your favourite blockchains. Verida Wallet allows users to interact with any supported blockchain by signing transactions, managing NFTs/Collectibles, and viewing or minting Soulbound Tokens/Badges.</p> User Data <p>With the Verida Wallet, you are in control of your personal data. You can apply a set of delegated permissions when sharing it with other users and services.</p><p>Users can take ownership of their data that exists on web2 platforms by storing the encrypted data on the Verida Network in the wallet, and this data is then available for web3 applications to request access. It also provides users with a secure and decentralized storage solution for managing their personal&nbsp;data.</p> Encrypted Inbox <p>The Inbox feature, a secure data inbox built into the Verida Wallet allows messages, requests, and data to be safely sent or received to other users or third-party services. The inbox can be used by to grant permission to requests for accessing user data or synchronize large amounts of data. Users can receive notifications and messages and respond to requests from their&nbsp;inbox.</p> Profiles <p>Profiles in the Verida Wallet allows users to create and manage both public and private profiles that can be shared with third parties. Users can manage their public profile, which contains information such as name (or pseudonym), avatar and profile description. The public profile is available for reuse across applications.</p> Single Sign&nbsp;On <p>The wallet also supports QR code single sign-on with rapid onboarding for users that don’t have a crypto wallet. You can easily and quickly sign-on to take advantage of the wallet features to manage and store your data securely.</p> WalletConnect <p>With the WalletConnect (v1 &amp; v2) integration, the Verida Wallet has enhanced security for crypto transactions and provide a secure, reliable connection to dapps on multiple&nbsp;chains.</p> How to Set Up Verida&nbsp;Wallet <p>Verida Wallet is a powerful and flexible platform for managing decentralized identity, personal data and crypto. Built on the Verida Network, Verida Wallet provides users with a decentralized and secure way to manage their data across multiple decentralized applications and platforms.</p><p>Let’s walk you through the steps of getting started with Verida Wallet, from creating a new DID to managing your profiles and&nbsp;data.</p> Step 1: Download and Install Verida&nbsp;Wallet <p>The first step in getting started with Verida Wallet is to download and install the app on your device. Verida Wallet is available for download on iOS and Android devices and can be found in the App Store and Google Play Store, respectively.</p><p>Use this QR code or visit verida.io to download the Verida&nbsp;Wallet</p>Scan to download the Verida&nbsp;Wallet Step 2: Create a New&nbsp;Identity <p>Once you have downloaded and installed Verida Wallet, the next step is to create a new DID/Identity. To create a new Identity, simply follow the on-screen prompts and provide the required information, such as your name and country. Then record your seed phrases in a secure&nbsp;place.</p> Step 3: Set Up Your&nbsp;Profiles <p>After creating a new Identity, the next step is to set up your profile. Profiles are a key feature of Verida Wallet and allow you to create and manage both public and private profiles that can be shared with third parties.

 Congratulations to all the selected Nym mix&nbsp;nodes <p>The Nym delegators program is commencing this week. The Nym treasury will delegate a stake of 200k NYM tokens to each of the selected mix nodes to boost their reputation in the mixnet. These delegations will remain until the nodes reach 70% saturation after which they will have built sufficient community reputation to independently continue providing high quality privacy services to the&nbsp;world.</p><p>After 6 weeks of application process, selection and interviews — and far far more very high quality submissions than expected! — 41 fantastic node operators from across the world have been selected for the program. This is <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/introducing-the-nym-delegations-program-c5ecf320ed12">nearly double</a> the number that was initially intended for the program, simply due to the high interest and quality of applications.</p><p>Throughout the program these mix node operators will also enjoy mentorship of two of Nym’s finest and most experienced mix node operators:</p>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UPkCCxVXXME">Cgi-bin from No Trust&nbsp;Verify</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWsAFN-h9rs">Wunderbaer from Hermes Stakepool</a>  <p>Cgi-bin and Wunderbear will support with best practices and know-how to run outstanding mix nodes and attract community delegations.</p> I got selected, what happens&nbsp;next? <p>If you were selected, make sure to join the designated Element space before EOD Friday, June 9th. You will have received instructions via&nbsp;email.</p><p>Your delegations will be staked by EOD Monday, June&nbsp;12th.</p><p>Over the next 2 weeks, you will get to know other operators in the program, your mentors, form teams and pitch contributions.</p> I applied but didn’t get selected — why? <p>Mix nodes were disqualified for the following reasons:</p>  Failing to meet one or more of the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/introducing-the-nym-delegations-program-c5ecf320ed12">selection criteria</a>. In most cases, this meant the mix node was not located in an <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">underrepresented region</a>.  The mix node operator was not reachable (incorrect email address, no response).  <p>This still left many eligible mix nodes! Which meant that 41 mix nodes were selected instead of the planned 25. When creating the shortlist, other factors were also considered, including:</p>  Testnet participation  Community activity  Shipyard Academy participation  <p>Don’t get discouraged though — this is just the first cohort of the Nym Delegations Program and there will be others in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>In the meantime, learn about the Nym mission, join the brand new <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#operators:nymtech.chat">Node Operator Element channel</a>, meet other community members — and make sure to apply again next&nbsp;time!</p> Final note <p>The overall goal is to improve quality and support further decentralisation of the Nym mixnet in terms of geography and VPS providers. The program is aimed at helping participants gain recognition in the community through their contributions.</p><p>This is the first iteration of the Nym Delegations Program. The impact on the mixnet and token economics will be monitored and changes will be made as necessary for any future cohorts (Such as the number of participants, delegation amounts, selection criteria, etc.)</p> Join Nym Community <p><a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">Twitter</a> // <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> // <a href="https://t.me/nymtech">Telegram</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dev:nymtech.chat">Element</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/welcome-to-the-nym-delegators-program-3cba7d955be7">Welcome to the Nym Delegators Program!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>It is strongly believed that blockchain technology can be the missing puzzle piece to explicate the crossing of digitalisation and sustainability. Blockchain technology gives the opportunity to focus on the complete triple bottom line, instead of on single pillars.</p>



<p>In today’s business landscape, sustainability has become a key differentiating factor for enterprises. The upcoming booms are rooted in digitalisation and sustainability. Still, there are problems with current sustainability approaches. One major problem is greenwashing, where organisations claim their initiative to be way more sustainable than it actually is. Additionally, sustainability strategies often only serve single sustainability pillars, instead of sustainability as a whole. More and more enterprises are now investing in digital technologies as a means to achieve their sustainability goals. </p>



 Three pillars of sustainability 



<p>This article is an introduction to a deeper explanation found in our ebook: <a href="https://zaisan.io/ebooks/using-blockchain-for-sustainability/">Using Blockchain for Sustainability.</a></p>







<p>Often, sustainability is solely associated with the environmental aspect, but it encompasses much more than that. In essence, sustainability is about achieving continuous growth within an enterprise. It is built upon three fundamental pillars that are often referred to as the “triple bottom line” (TBL).</p>



 
 Economic Sustainability (Profit): Includes all aspects within the business, which aim towards creating economic growth without colliding with environmental and social needs 



 Social Sustainability (People): Includes all social features a business should imply, in order to create a planet driven by equal and inclusive manners 



 Environmental Sustainability (Planet): Can be defined as the attention of a business to act and adjust in favor of the planet 
 



<p>All in all, it is the mixture of all three pillars that allow for a fitting plan of action. The idea of creating shared value is a good representation of what sustainability consists of. Whilst focusing on the triple bottom line, businesses simultaneously do such whilst still aiming for profitability, cost-effectiveness, and risk mitigation. So where can blockchain play a role, to cater to all those goals?</p>



 ESG 



<p>Another term that has gained popularity is ESG goals (Environmental, Social, and Governance). ESG goals primarily focus on monitoring and controlling business activities and business performance toward achieving sustainability. In contrast, the triple bottom line looks at the business from a wider perspective by taking into account sustainability beyond the four walls of the organisation.</p>



 A power couple: Blockchain technology driving sustainability 



<p>More and more have jumped on the blockchain bandwagon and the interest is assumed to only increase in the future. To keep it short and simple: the main function of blockchain technology is secure data storage and information sharing (transactions) across a wide network. The main reason, as to why blockchain can be a key to sustainability improvements are its characteristics of being:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Decentralised 



 Transparent 



 Accessible 



 Secure 
 



<p>All in all, blockchain technology’s transparent and decentralised nature allows for open communication and traceability of data. It can drive internal efficiency through automation and smart contracts and embraces financial and social inclusion. These are only a few of blockchain technology’s many advantages concerning sustainability.</p>



 Key takeaways 



 
 Businesses are investing in digital technologies to achieve their sustainability goals. 
 



 Economic insights 



 
 Blockchain technology’s transparent and decentralised nature allows for open communication, internal efficiency through automation and smart contracts, and financial and social inclusion, making it a key factor in achieving sustainability.&nbsp; 



 Using blockchain technology for supply chain management can help businesses achieve their sustainability goals by promoting a circular economy, increasing transparency, and improving efficiency through automation with smart contracts. 
 



 Social insights 



 
 Social sustainability is becoming increasingly important, and blockchain technology can help with financial and social inclusion by promoting trust and accountability and enabling equitable and sustainable development. 



 DAOs offer businesses an approach to decision-making that includes contributions from anyone in the community, promoting diversity and strengthening of community management. 



 Blockchain technology can be used for charity purposes to build trust with donors by providing a transparent ecosystem where donations can be tracked and verified. 
 



 Environmental insights 



 
 Decentralised waste management systems through blockchain can streamline coordination with waste removal organisations, incentivise environmentally friendly waste disposal practices, and engage consumers in businesses’ sustainability efforts. 



 Blockchain technology can help create a more efficient and sustainable renewable energy market, providing cost-effectiveness, regulatory compliance, and competitive advantage for organisations investing in renewable energy. 



 Carbon credits and offsets can be traded on the blockchain, creating an additional revenue stream for organisations and demonstrating their commitment to environmental sustainability. 



 Barriers to the adoption of blockchain include a lack of knowledge, a steep learning curve, data compliance, the conception of blockchain as a major energy consumer, and cost-efficiency.

 Privacy — what is it good&nbsp;for? <p>The concept of privacy in and of itself hardly means much. In fact, in some languages, the word doesn’t even exist! Instead, people use terms like dignity, security or integrity to describe what it means for people to be free from continuous observation. Let’s explore this a&nbsp;bit…</p> Ensuring dignity <p>Dignity implies having the peace and quiet to go about doing the things you need to do as a human without being observed, judged and attacked by others. For example, being able to work or study without your boss or teacher observing you and controlling your behaviour at all times. This implies that there is trust in you, respect for your abilities to explore, learn, create and develop and you are treated as a dignified person.</p><p>In a healthy workplace or school, the pressure of scrutiny, judgement and intervention is only applied during a review, project delivery or at an exam, not continuously. Online privacy protections enable you to maintain your dignity by ensuring you can work, create and explore online without being continuously monitored and monitized.</p> Ensuring security <p>Security is probably one of the most common associations with privacy. Privacy protections enable security by protecting the aspects of your person that might otherwise come under attack. Especially in the online world, in repressive regimes and high risk contexts. Ideas, values, backgrounds and perceptions of the world diverge to such a degree that people can quickly become threatened.</p><p>The security offered by strong privacy of communications is often undermined because it is thought that this is better for combating crime. But actually, criminals operate best when there is slack security. <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2021/04/a-digital-dystopia-how-calls-for-backdoors-to-encryption-would-ruin-the-internet-for-everyone/">Opening back doors</a> on everyone by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23409716/signal-encryption-messaging-sms-meredith-whittaker-imessage-whatsapp-china">compromising end-to-end encryption</a> or turning a <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/5-years-gdpr-national-authorities-let-down-european-legislator">blind eye to mass-surveillance</a> opens everyone up to targeting and manipulation by criminals and corporations. When mass surveillance is the norm, privacy protections become a luxury only the few (and often criminals) can afford. And this leaves the rest of society at their mercy without the same levels of protection.</p> Ensuring integrity <p>Integrity is a more abstract concept, but extremely important. It is best explained in reference to our physical body: our physical body is a single entity. The integrity of our body is generally protected by law, common practice and hippocratic oaths — a doctor needs your clear consent before intervening, organ trafficking is heavily penalised, and so on. We generally do not allow people to penetrate the integrity of our bodies without clear understanding and agreement on why and for what purpose (surgery for example).</p><p>Our mental and emotional processes are deserving of an equal level of <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/digital-integrity-disrupting-the-personal-data-economy-509642bc756b">integrity</a>. They are part of who we are as individuals. But the profiling and targeting enabled through mass surveillance has turned our mental and emotional processes into data points bought and sold on digital marketplaces, free to trade and exploited by the highest&nbsp;bidder.</p> Protecting the undefined parts of ourselves and&nbsp;society <p>Finally, every one of us have parts of our identities that are unformed and still figuring things out. In order for people and societies to develop and grow, there needs to be space for the undefined — the parts we are not sure about yet, that are still experimental, tentative where we can try new ways of being and doing. This is a sensitive condition. We are likely to make mistakes or do things we later regret. The freedom to make mistakes and try out risky things is essential for discovery, creativity and wonder. Privacy enables this by protecting against premature observation, calculation and judgement.</p><p>If privacy enables dignity, security and integrity, it is worth considering: what does surveillance enable? The primary aims of surveillance are control, targeting and intervention. Whether criminals or consumers, the technology is the same: mass surveillance to calculate who to target, how to control and intervene in their behaviour. Understanding this difference between the two gives an understanding of the type of society that emerges if privacy or in contrast, surveillance is the default of society: dignity, security and integrity versus control, targeting and intervention.</p><p>Lately, privacy tools have been increasingly met with fear and concerns. This has resulted in <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/feed/post/585415">regulations hostile to financial privacy</a> and the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption">undermining of protections</a>, with the argument being that privacy provides a cover for criminals. But the truth is that the inverse is the case: the lack of privacy and the dominance of mass surveillance makes us all vulnerable to targeting by criminals and corporations.</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunks_(book)">cypherpunks</a> have a saying: <a href="https://youtu.be/uwenC-zB1eo">transparency for the powerful, privacy for the rest of us</a>. A society that ensures privacy as a default and embeds this as a principle in our shared infrastructures is a society that ensures dignity, security and integrity.</p> Resources   <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/56OfL4SxtR05tiG8eShbag">Privacy in the age of interconnectivity</a> (podcast)  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/digital-integrity-disrupting-the-personal-data-economy-509642bc756b">Digital integrity</a> (blogpost)  <a href="https://youtu.be/Jv7-tJgVTks">Interview on digital integrity with Alexis Roussel</a> (video) FR with ENG subtitles  <a href="https://youtu.be/uwenC-zB1eo">Fireside with Chelsea Manning and Jaya Klara Brekke</a>&nbsp;(video)   Languages <p><a href="https://medium.com/@nymturkish/gizlilik-ne-i%C5%9Fe-yarar-424c7fb37f05">Turkish</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nym_ru/%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%84%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C-%D0%B4%D0%BB%D1%8F-%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%BE-%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%BD%D1%83%D0%B6%D0%BD%D0%B0-c0e070ffe4f2">Russian</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@nym_china/%E9%9A%90%E7%A7%81-%E5%AE%83%E6%9C%89%E4%BB%80%E4%B9%88%E7%94%A8%E5%A4%84-8f8c567e37b8">Chinese</a></p> Join Nym Community <p><a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">Twitter</a> // <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> // <a href="https://t.me/nymtech">Telegram</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dev:nymtech.chat">Element</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/privacy-what-is-it-good-for-7679d696e184">Privacy — what is it good for?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>It's the end of the month again. As such, it’s time to reflect on the progress we made in the last month.</p><p>Let’s start with our monthly update.</p> Tech Updates  v1 fees and rewards <p>Panther v1's fees and rewards are fully developed, now being tested using simulations to replicate real-world product activity cases. This is a milestone that will inform many decisions for Panther's release, as well as critical for the user experience throughout the product.</p><p>Furthermore, we have made significant progress on our relayers integration.</p> Gasless transactions and Relayers <p>Panther’s relayers are now also developed and interacting with external entities, enabling many testing use cases. Panther is also creating dApp nodes to support our activity in a decentralized way. Acting as intermediaries between Panther's privacy layer and the decentralized network, relayers support our privacy-preserving stack by obfuscating the origin of transactions, making it difficult for third parties to trace them.</p><p>Relayers can also be used to pay for gas in users’ name, adding an extra layer of anonymity to transactions. This integration is expected to significantly increase privacy by making it harder to link transactions to specific users.</p> v1 prototyping Panther’s v1 is underway!!<p>v1 is not an MVP for Panther. It is a self-contained, finalized DeFi product that will protect users’ data and open new possibilities for institutional and retail users.</p><p>With v1's visual components finalized, just a few features are pending definition. We're nearing a point where prototypes are complete and gearing up towards upcoming releases. Some key parameters are also finalized, and, as mentioned above, we’re completing the fees and rewards schemes that will support the protocol. The main goal is to present a system that balances flexibility with maximum utility for $ZKP.</p><p>More work is also focusing on the mechanisms through which users exchange PRPs for $zZKP and their associated rewards. The main goal of this system is to balance on-chain privacy's value with utility, empowering users to make the most out of protocol rewards.</p><p>Finally, progress is ongoing with compliance support through third-party Web3 integrations that leverage ZK tech.</p> Panther’s SNARK: PMONK <p>Our CTO and Chief Scientist, Anish Mohammed, presented a research paper on Panther’s SNARK: PMONK (Permutations over Monomial-bases for Oecumenical Noninteractive arguments of Knowledge), at the Leading Privacy Alliance’s summit in Istanbul, Turkey.</p><p>You can watch his presentation on Youtube:</p><p>Keep an eye out for more updates on PMONK and other advancements in the Panther Protocol ecosystem! The published paper by the Panther team <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/788.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">can also be found here.</a></p> Governance <p>We are thrilled to announce that the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/dao/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther DAO</a> has officially approved <a href="https://snapshot.org/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0xcb272ecdb9e9f820772c193ebbd3bb05b8d80c11d00735925c8d5e38355ef9a5">PIP-14</a>.

Governance framework The community’s framework for building a more robust and decentralized Panther Protocol.<p>A large part of PIP-14 involved the Panther community establishing a new governance framework and formalizing it.</p><p>This landmark development follows extensive discussions on our <a href="https://forum.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">community forum</a> about the need for a decentralized, high-level decision-making process, and accountability for non-team members. The governance framework also formalizes implicit rules and guidelines for the community and technology contributors to collaborate in a decentralized way where every community member can make their voice heard.</p><p>We <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-dao-approves-pip-14-a-milestone-in-project-decentralization/">wrote about the significance of PIP-14 here.</a></p> Ecosystem  Events <p>Co-founder Oliver Gale is scheduled to speak at the <a href="https://twitter.com/EBlockchainCon?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">European Blockchain Convention</a> 2023 in Barcelona!</p><p>Oliver will be sharing his perspectives on privacy with the Blockchain Conference's 5000 Web3 ecosystem attendees.</p><p>Let us know if you'd like to schedule a meet!</p>#EBC2023 with Oliver Gale<p>Oliver also participated in the <a href="https://familyofficesummit.co/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Global Family Office Summit 2023</a>, organized by GDA Capital &amp; SD - Global Markets.

<p>SAN FRANCISCO, CA, June 1st, 2023 — X Reality Safety Initiative (XRSI), a leading non-profit organization globally recognized for advocating safety, privacy, security, and inclusion in the domain of emerging technology, today unveils a significant brand evolution. This transformation reinforces its commitment to protecting emerging realities through intelligence gathering and rigorous research. Transitioning to X Reality Safety Intelligence (XRSI), the rebrand symbolizes an organizational pivot in its approach. The rebranding signifies that the initiative has transformed into a global movement, requiring the power of human intelligence and detailed research to guarantee a safe and inclusive technological evolution worldwide.</p>



<p>“Our transformation into XRSI – The Human Intelligence in the Loop, embodies our collective obligation and united strength in building trust and fortifying our digital landscapes,” states Kavya Pearlman, the founder &amp; CEO of XRSI. “We stand at a crucial crossroads where emerging technologies such as AI, VR/AR/MR, and BCI are redefining our world and increasingly automating it. It’s imperative that our network of human intelligence remains vigilant, informed, and actively involved. We are a passionate community deeply concerned about humanity, thoroughly studying the impacts of decisions being made to advance emerging technologies on both individuals and societies. We are the individuals who care deeply and comprehend the consequences of our choices. We are XRSI.”</p>



<p>Founded in 2019 by cybersecurity luminary Kavya Pearlman, XRSI has been a beacon of knowledge and guidance in the uncharted territories of immersive and emerging technologies. Today, with its 200+ global advisors, the organization advises over 60 governments and provides oversight to numerous Metaverse-related technology companies and open-source efforts.</p>



<p>In an era where trust is diminishing and the consultancy industry often falls short, XRSI’s commitment to promoting mutual understanding and collective intelligence has become increasingly crucial. By emphasizing the importance of a dedicated human intelligence network and empowering communities and governments with informed solutions, XRSI fortifies our digital future.</p>



<p>Valentino Megale, President of XRSI-Europe, the European counterpart headquartered in Italy, states, “For a well-balanced, secure, and inclusive technological advancement, we need the commitment and vision of XRSI. Innovation should not be solely driven by technology alone. It is the fusion of human values, such as European values or the human rights that must shape our advancements. XRSI recognizes this essential aspect, ensuring that our digital future is driven by the distinctive qualities and principles that define us as humans.”</p>



<p>This brand evolution marks a pivotal moment in XRSI’s journey towards embracing new realities. The evolving identity represents the organization’s unwavering dedication to remaining at the forefront of knowledge, safeguarding humans and societies in the immersive and emerging technology space, and fostering trust within our rapidly transforming tech ecosystem.</p>

      An outsider’s path to financial inclusion         
	By Michael Gold	 



Published June 2, 2023
        Sebastian Siemiatkowski has steered Klarna through waves of turmoil in buy now, pay later.      



 
<p>Burger King is the kind of company that rarely, if ever, tops lists of inspirational wellsprings for tech entrepreneurs. Yet Sebastian Siemiatkowski, founder and CEO of Swedish fintech insurgent Klarna, discovered plenty to admire when he worked at the fast-food giant as a teenager.</p>



<p>“These restaurant chains have incredibly meticulous processes,” Siemiatkowski enthuses. “They don’t have the advantages of a software firm; they are thin-margin businesses that are always squeezed. I realize now after running my own business for so long how well-engineered those kinds of systems are.”</p>



<p>If Siemiatkowski’s two years flipping burgers gave him a taste for the rigors of a well-oiled corporate machine, it also helped crystallize a relationship that would prove pivotal—that with his Klarna co-founder, Niklas Adalberth. Although Adalberth would eventually leave the company in 2015, the two boys’ formative experiences in the literal boiler room sparked a friendship that would evolve over the course of a round-the-world excursion, a failed entrepreneurship competition and the ultimate founding of Klarna in 2005.</p>



<p>“Niklas gave me a fantastic gift: in my youth, I was always convinced that I was right, while Niklas was always able to show me when I was wrong,” Siemiatkowski says. “He was this amazingly patient, focused, solid person, while I could be quite emotionally all over the place.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Niklas gave me a fantastic gift: in my youth, I was always convinced that I was right, while Niklas was always able to show me when I was wrong.”</p>
Sebastian Siemiatkowski</blockquote>



<p>Siemiatkowski chalks this characteristic up to his upbringing as a Polish immigrant in Sweden. His parents fled the Communist bloc in 1980, becoming a minor cause célèbre in Swedish media due to the daughter they had to leave in Poland as they worked to overcome immigration hurdles. Siemiatkowski’s older sister would not be able to join the family until a year later, when Siemiatkowski was a few months old.</p>



<p>The family settled in Uppsala, a medium-sized city on the outskirts of Stockholm. It was a time of considerably less pan-European integration than today, when even a place like Sweden could feel alien to people from a country separated by nothing more than a thin slice of the Baltic Sea. The family maintained strong ties to their Polish background, and Siemiatkowski grew up speaking Polish at home, eating Polish food and celebrating Polish Catholic holidays. Stories of the trials his ancestors endured during World War II, including relatives who suffered in German concentration camps, lingered in the background.</p>



<p>Overall, the immigration experience was hard on Siemiatkowski’s parents, especially his father Michal, who sacrificed his budding career as a veterinarian in Poland in exchange for a job driving a taxi. Siemiatkowski’s parents had little money in his youth and struggled to provide the basics.</p>



<p>“We would go a full week at a time eating meal after meal of Swedish pancakes, which are essentially nothing more than flour and milk,” Siemiatkowski says. “My parents couldn’t afford anything else.”</p>



<p>Although Siemiatkowski describes both his parents as attentive and loving, poverty, poor health—his mother suffered from scoliosis—and an on-again, off-again marriage that persisted for much of his youth meant that his early years were not as carefree as many of his Swedish peers’ childhoods were. “I don’t want to put myself on the same level as people who go through much worse, but there were definitely some tough times,” he recalls. “Where other kids spent their summers traveling, I would bike to the library with my father and read.”</p>



<p>It was there that he discovered novels that pushed his conception of the possible—classic science fiction tomes like Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and works by Isaac Asimov. Alongside books about corporate titans like IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad and Virgin founder Richard Branson, they helped nurture an interest in business as a means of changing the world.</p>



<p>Fulfilling that vision saw Siemiatkowski march a path strewn with a mix of adventure, discovery and disappointment over the course of his pre-Klarna life. Excelling at school proved a relatively easy task. “I was always the kind of pupil who went all-in on my work,” he says. “If our teachers assigned students to write a group report on 17th century French writers, say, I would convince my group to stage a play about Molière.”</p>



<p>Following his early Burger King stint at 15, Siemiatkowski dipped his toe into different areas of the job pool, working as a caretaker for elderly people with dementia, a school teacher—a role that Siemiatkowski says would have been his lifelong career in a parallel universe—and a telemarketer hawking internet subscriptions. It was this stint that gave him his first inkling of the hustle and grind of the workaday salesperson—a mode he says he connected with instantly.</p>



<p>“Sales is typically seen as this kind of sleazy, lowlife thing, but I find it beautiful” he says. “I always loved polishing and refining my sales script; eventually I knew I got it perfect one day when I closed 16 calls in a row. This kind of thing—the art of convincing—it’s just a fascinating skill.”</p>



<p>Siemiatkowski’s mix of academic smarts and on-the-ground experience would go on to gain him entry into the Stockholm School of Economics, one of Sweden’s top institutions of higher learning. Siemiatkowski studied business, a field that his father in particular questioned. “He had no idea what I would do with that kind of training,” he says. “He wanted me to be a doctor.”</p>



<p>Indeed, Siemiatkowski found himself adrift and unhappy during his first few years of business school. The ambition of many of his classmates to land cushy jobs in consulting or investment banking put him off, and amid the dot-com bust of the early 2000s there was little zeal for entrepreneurship.</p>



<p>“It’s funny—when you look at Swedish students now, something like 70% want to start their own business,” he says. “When I was in school it was more like 7%.”</p>

Sebastian Siemiatkowski</blockquote>



<p>This mismatch spurred Siemiatkowski to take a leave of absence after his first two years. Joined by Adalberth, his Burger King colleague who would go onto become a business-school classmate, the two embarked on a series of projects and trips emblematic of restless young adults on a quest to find themselves: a certification from bartending school, a trip to Florida to look for work on a cruise ship (“no one wanted us,” Siemiatkowski admits), and finally a return to Europe to wait tables at a ski resort in St. Moritz.</p>



<p>The money earned from that gig funded the pair’s next idea: a hitchhiking jaunt around the world, entirely overground. “We literally buried a bottle of champagne in the ground in St. Moritz.” That bottle would sit entombed for months, beckoning the pair back as a reward for finishing their journey. User-generated video was just taking off at the time, and Siemiatkowski and Adalberth decided to <a href="https://youtu.be/Tqu9ybkxMvA">document</a> their travels on YouTube. “You can still find our travelogue there, incredibly,” Siemiatkowski says.</p>



<p>Cut to a loading dock halfway around the world: the pair just missed hitching a ride on the last monthly cargo ship to Los Angeles from Sydney. Siemiatkowski says the experience “really taught us the value of resilience. We had to spend a full month in a foreign city, unsure what we would do or how we would support ourselves. We eventually found cheap hostel beds and jobs as furniture movers. We proved to ourselves that we could be resourceful. No matter how bad things looked, we proved to ourselves that we could find a way to survive.”</p>



<p>The timing also proved fortuitous in another way. Because the duo had vowed to avoid air travel throughout their journey, once they arrived in North America (a month later than planned), they hitchhiked their way through the continent and jumped a ship back to Europe. Upon returning to Stockholm (after exhuming and imbibing the St. Moritz champagne), they realized they had narrowly missed the annual cut-off for course re-registration.</p>



<p>“This left a full year entirely blank,” Siemiatkowski says. “Here I was, thin and poor after a year’s travel, no job, no school, no support whatsoever.”</p>



<p>Siemiatkowski survived on welfare checks and food stamps until landing a job as a salesperson at a factoring company—essentially, loaning money to small companies that need cash to cover unpaid invoices. Through this experience, he discovered a wealth of mom-and-pop shops struggling with payments, especially as the budding e-commerce boom of the time proved to be overwhelming to outlets used to a slower pace of transactions. To guarantee their income, these sellers would demand debit cards at checkout on each transaction. Siemiatkowski started to wonder whether someone could step in as an intermediary between the customer and the merchant, paying the seller at checkout and claiming the money from the shopper upon receipt. From the customer’s perspective, paying only when they felt satisfied with the item would surely be preferable to paying upfront. This was how many mail-order transactions—also known as cash on delivery—already took place in Sweden, a country where trust was baked into the social fabric. Why couldn’t buy now, pay later (BNPL) work as well in digital commerce as it did in the brick-and-mortar world?</p>



<p>When Siemiatkowski brought this idea back to school with him the following term, he enlisted Adalberth and another classmate, Victor Jacobsson, to start Kreditor, a company aiming to usher BNPL into the digital era. They tapped into a then-tiny angel network at their university and landed $60,000 in seed financing from tech investor Jane Walerud in exchange for 10% of the company. They used the cash to hire engineers to build the first iteration of the Kreditor platform, trading away nearly two-fifths of the remaining shares in a transaction that Siemiatkowski now realizes was a mistake.</p>



<p>“We thought these guys would stay on and help us build the company, but they left after only a year—taking their shares with them,” he says. “It was my first real learning as a founder: you have to make sure your employment contracts don’t leave any room for uncertainty.”</p>



<p>The company’s early growth was fueled by a blitz of one-to-one outreach that put Siemiatkowski’s sales instincts to the test, as he and his co-founders hopscotched across Sweden in an old Volvo, enlisting small firms to use Kreditor’s BNPL service. The intent was to feel simultaneously as well-established and trustworthy as a big bank and as nimble and fresh as a tech startup.</p>



<p>They wanted to be taken seriously, so they honed everything down to the last detail. They got a phone number with more zeros at the end, which in Sweden at the time made it look like there was a big switchboard with a lot of extensions. They put their name cards on thick stock paper. They put on starched suits and “acted as if,” to paraphrase the movie Boiler Room.</p>



<p>Kreditor started catching on, growing from 1.5 million Swedish krona in revenue to 270 million in its early years. Uniquely for a fast-growing company in the Silicon Valley mold, the company also turned profitable soon after founding and stayed profitable for its first 16 years. “This meant that we developed a well-balanced culture, where creating value for customers was clearly what was paying the bills and our salaries,” Siemiatkowski says. “It was not about things that would simply drive valuation of the company or its perception in the wider world.”</p>



<p>These early successes helped them recover from an earlier setback that came just as the company was getting off the ground: Siemiatkowski, Adalberth and Jacobsson had entered Kreditor into an entrepreneurship competition at their school presided over by Sweden’s corporate elite, including Stefan Persson, chairman of H&amp;M, and a member of the Wallenberg family, a prominent venture outfit. Even Sweden’s king was in attendance.</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, none of them was convinced,” Siemiatkowski says with a laugh. “‘It’ll never work…why can’t the banks just do it’…they had all kinds of arguments about why it wouldn’t pan out.”</p>



<p>Siemiatkowski describes their loss—they ranked last out of three startups—as an “emotional” blow that nevertheless provided spiritual fodder for the harder fight ahead. “My reaction wasn’t to give up and go home, it was to curl up my fist and say ‘I’ll show you’.”</p>



<blockquote>

<p>The fact that Klarna has since become one of the most well-known companies in Swedish history is as much a comeuppance as Siemiatkowski could have imagined. Securing an early lead in digital BNPL helped pave the company’s expansion across Scandinavia in subsequent years. By 2009, the company decided it wanted a fresher name to present to its international clientele. It hired a consultant, which presented a list of “1,000 candidates,” in Siemiatkowski’s telling. The company’s bosses wanted to lean harder into the startup image and away from banking. “It wasn’t a matter of trust at that point—people trusted us,” Siemiatkowski says. “We needed something that could draw attention.”</p>



<p>The name “Movondo” bubbled to the top of the list, but was shot down by staff. “They decided to go with ‘Klarna,’ which means ‘clear’ in Swedish,” Siemiatkowski says. “We ran with it and I think it helped us make our point. It really represented what we wanted to do with the entire financial services world.”</p>



<p>Klarna’s progress in tapping into growing consumer appetites for BNPL continued largely unabated, including through the financial crisis of 2008–09 and into 2010. By then, a new goal had emerged for the company: to become the go-to technological architecture for processing digital transactions across virtually any medium and pathway. Klarna was approaching unicorn status after a successful rollout in Germany. Siemiatkowski had established himself as a rising star in fintech and knew the landscape inside and out. He decided that the time was ripe to conquer an adjacent market that was also exploding in popularity: digital payments.</p>



<p>Siemiatkowski presented his vision to the board, which endorsed it wholeheartedly. “We went over the competitive landscape and I kind of glossed over these other players—this company ‘Stripe’ founded by these two Irish brothers, and this other one, Adyen, founded by a few Dutch guys,” Siemiatkowski recalls sheepishly. “I knew these firms were onto something, I knew we had to keep an eye on them, but I was a bit too cocky for my own good.”</p>



<p>This overconfidence included a failed pitch to Adyen’s founding team to acquire the company. “After they rebuffed my offer we set about building this payments system ourselves. And that became a slow burn of dashed expectations,” Siemiatkowski admits, contrasting Adyen’s proliferation across huge markets in Asia and elsewhere against Klarna’s struggles to launch a single payments product in Germany.</p>



<p>“The moment that clinched it was in 2015, when Spotify went with Adyen over us,” Siemiatkowski notes. “Here was our Swedish neighbor, our BFF, going with our biggest rival.”</p>



<p>This frustrating loss of a massive opportunity proved a major turning point for Klarna. Siemiatkowski saw two potential options: sell the company, earning a tidy return for himself and his shareholders, and call it a day. Or double down on Klarna’s core competencies, embedding BNPL deeper into the consumer finance landscape across Europe, and setting his sights on the biggest prize of all: the United States. He chose the latter—but not before making some significant changes at the company.</p>

<p>Siemiatkowski recounts harboring a fascination with Silicon Valley from an early age, of idle moments logging onto Google Maps, zooming in on a region halfway across the planet and thinking, this is the promised land. Unlike many founders, he did not physically move to the Bay Area to pursue his entrepreneurial dreams, instead latching onto the success story of Niklas Zennström, founder of Skype, as a model for what could be possible in his home continent.</p>



<p>When it came time to answer hard questions about Klarna’s future, however, he looked back to the highest flyers in his fabled promised land.</p>



<p>“We tried every startup tactic in the playbook” to reform Klarna’s corporate culture, he says. “Google let their engineers devote 20% of their time to pursue personal projects. We tried it and nothing changed. We put Legos, a ping pong table in our rec room. Big deal—nothing changed.”</p>



<p>Those strategies emerged in response to how Siemiatkowski and his leadership team diagnosed the problems that led up to Klarna’s failure to conquer payments. Put simply, Klarna was not set up in a way that permitted its employees to act fast and pivot quickly.</p>



<p>“The ideas were all solid—there was nothing wrong with the vision,” explains David Fock, a 13-year veteran of the company who now serves as its chief product officer. “It was our organization that hindered our ability to deliver on them.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The ideas were all solid—there was nothing wrong with the vision. It was our organization that hindered our ability to deliver on them.”</p>
David Fock</blockquote>



<p>Fock describes the problem as one that bedevils myriad companies looking for new direction: a siloed hierarchy that separated technical and business functions, excluding each from buy-in on the other’s success. “At that time, we had a sales department that was generally out selling stuff, but weren’t really that interested in what they were selling,” Fock says. “Simultaneously, we had an engineering department that was solving technical problems, but without any real investment in growing the company. In between we had product, which was supposed to bridge the gap but ended up remaining subservient to both verticals.”</p>



<p>The result was a lack of accountability that tossed the burden of failure back and forth. “It was just this endless, pointless game,” Fock recalls.</p>



<p>For the remedy, Siemiatkowski and his team reached back to Silicon Valley, but took away something much more substantive than the superficial fixes he’d toyed with earlier: a wholesale restructure of the company, from root to stem.</p>



<p>In Fock’s telling, “a company like Amazon is composed of small, cross-functional teams that look to solve a single overarching problem. You have a page-long mission statement and the team will draw on the company’s resources to accomplish it. This is how we realized we needed to transform Klarna in order to thrive.”</p>



<p>Siemiatkowski says the positive effects of the reorganization soon became apparent. “We started to feel a greater sense of momentum, to get products out at a higher pace, to launch more features. It wasn’t a daylong exercise, to be sure, and some employees weren’t sold on it, but in the end it was the best thing for the company.”</p>



<p>This shift would set the stage for Klarna’s entry into the American market. The company had already laid the groundwork by opening offices in Columbus, Ohio and New York City in 2015, and started making a serious push in 2018. Similar to Kreditor’s embryonic days, Siemiatkowski filled his calendar with sales meetings with potential clients, a slew of merchants that the company was courting as a means of overtaking its chief rival in BNPL, Australia’s Afterpay (which has since been acquired by Block).</p>



<p>As Fock describes it, “we recognized that Afterpay was ahead of us, but we made a concerted effort to enter that race and win. Sebastian got out there and stayed on the road nonstop—he must have delivered 1,000 pitches.”</p>



<p>The covid-19 pandemic put a halt to Siemiatkowski’s travels. Like virtually all companies, Klarna entered a wait-and-see mode as the virus spread and lockdowns ensued. “It was so hard to predict what was going on,” Fock recalls. “We couldn’t do anything except monitor and adjust on practically a minute-to-minute basis.”</p>



<p>The opportunities the outbreak afforded for much of the tech sector are well-documented. Nowhere was this more apparent than in e-commerce. In 2019 Klarna had launched its consumer-facing app in the US, following its initial European rollout in 2017. Usage volumes spiked over the course of the pandemic.</p>



<p>“I remember one investor calling me early on, fretting about the end of the world and insisting that I start downsizing,” Siemiatkowski recalls. “I’m always glad I didn’t take that advice, because COVID ended up being a major acceleration.”</p>



<blockquote>

Sebastian Siemiatkowski</blockquote>



<p>This acceleration would drive Klarna’s valuation to a peak of $45.6 billion by July 2021, a number that implied supernova-like growth ahead. The company harnessed this energy to push harder into the US market, incurring losses for the first time in the company’s history. Throughout this upward surge, Siemiatkowski remained wary about reading too much into valuation figures as a barometer for the company’s long-term health. “I was cautioning people that if your valuation grows faster than your revenue, there’s bound to be a correction.”</p>



<p>Siemiatkowski’s wife Nina says that Siemiatkowski has always tended toward circumspection. “During Klarna’s first half-decade or so, Sebastian would relay to me—on practically a weekly basis—that the company was on the brink of collapse, even when it was clearly growing at a phenomenal rate.”</p>



<p>As the froth built up on the entire tech sector, few expected that the bubble would deflate so sharply. By the time of Klarna’s mid-2022 investment round, its valuation had plummeted by 85%, in line with most of its peers. Despite drawing the largest funding infusion of any European startup that year, the urgency of job cuts became too pressing to ignore. The company ultimately reduced headcount by a little over 10% in 2022, drawing headlines amid this turbulent period for tech overall.</p>



<p>Siemiatkowski speaks frankly about “making mistakes” during this period, a stressful time marked by tears and sleepless nights and compounded by the difficulty of letting go of colleagues who had been on his team for years.</p>



<p>“It’s one of those balancing acts that I, as a boss, had never really encountered before,” Siemiatkowski admits. “Of course no one wants to lay people off, but it’s a matter of making sure I’m fulfilling my duty to every stakeholder—to shareholders, to customers and to current employees alike. And the fact that our first set of cuts preceded that of most of our peers meant that I didn’t have the opportunity to learn from their example. Unfortunately, we just had to ‘bite the sour apple’, as they say out here.”</p>



<p>Siemiatkowski’s wife Nina cites this confluence of unenviable factors—job cuts and a potentially make-or-break fundraise occurring against the backdrop of a savage market downturn—as pushing Siemiatkowski to his limit. “Every time I tried to get him to take a rest, he would just say to me, ‘I have to get this right, I have to do right by my colleagues’,” she recalls. “Another person might just lay back and give up, but he just worked around the clock for weeks.”</p>



<p>Despite the turmoil, Siemiatkowski sees silver linings in the need to make tough choices in order to right the ship.</p>



<p>“As you get older, you start to take a more measured view of these kinds of rollercoaster moments,” he says. “Startups are often propelled by the high of building, building, building, but at some point you need to take stock and ask tough questions. Am I really doing this in the most efficient way possible? Is there a way I can accomplish this goal with a bit more focus? This is the kind of test that can break a company, or it can help push it to emerge stronger and wiser. I know that’s where we are now.”</p>

<p>Klarna now occupies a major perch in a <a href="https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/buy-now-pay-later-market-analysis/">sector worth nearly a third of a trillion dollars</a>. The company’s vision for its growth lies in the opportunity to break the stranglehold of the credit card on consumer-finance. It hopes to shake up an ecosystem in which a large number of mostly low-income credit-card users spend beyond their means, paying high interest rates in order to prop up the perks and benefits of wealthier clientele who can typically afford to pay off balances in full.</p>



<p>Its efforts are playing out against flux in the global regulatory framework that permits this disparity. The EU is in the midst of <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/12/02/council-and-european-parliament-agree-to-improve-protection-for-consumers-applying-for-credit/">updating</a> its laws overseeing consumer credit of all kinds, while the UK recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/britain-sets-out-legislation-regulate-buy-now-pay-later-credit-2023-02-13/">proposed</a> new legislation to regulate BNPL. The U.S., meanwhile, is grappling with fallout from three high-profile bank failures this year which, although unrelated to consumer credit provision, may spur tighter regulation over the financial system more broadly. At the same time, regulatory trends that <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">increase competition</a> and prioritize <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/outcomes-focussed-regulation-measure-success">fair outcomes</a> for consumers over onerous processes could help the company maintain its edge.</p>



<p>Regardless of how BNPL regulations shape up in the coming years, they will likely inject some uncertainty into the landscape. The broader macroeconomic environment—including <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-09/buy-now-pay-later-unicorn-klarna-threatened-by-rising-rates#xj4y7vzkg">high interest rates</a>, which are squeezing finance across the board—could present another challenge. Still, Siemiatkowski has more than proved he can steer his company through choppy waters. Nina attributes this to a dogged work ethic he developed growing up as the child of a poor family. “He’s always had a bit of a chip on his shoulder,” Nina says. “He’s always craved the means to help his parents escape their own cycle of poverty, and he ended up mapping this aim onto the millions of consumers who use Klarna to buy things they wouldn’t be able to otherwise.”</p>



<p>The fact that his own father descended into depression and alcoholism during Siemiatkowski’s mid-20s and died when he was only 33 adds a level of poignancy to this description. “My father was a fantastic character,” Siemiatkowski muses. “I still think today about how little regard he had for my choice to go to business school. ‘What the hell would you learn there?’”</p>



<p>Although Siemiatkowski has achieved far more than his father could have wished for, the sense of living up to the hopes of others—of his parents and his heritage, of his shareholders and his employees, of the market and the wider world—lingers over both his personal and professional story. Expectations like these could easily overwhelm the person who bears them. To Siemiatkowski, they are the foundation of his resolve.</p>

<p>As crypto evolves, it becomes clearer that the future will be multi-chain. Presently, moving funds between different blockchains is frustrating...to say the least. The current bridging solutions are prohibitive from a UX perspective, mainly due to how finality is reached across different blockchains. This translates to long wait times and anxiety when interacting with new protocols, caused by the incertitude of funds arriving safely on the other side. Another major blockage consists of gas fees, particular to each blockchain, which often require an additional swap.

 Thank you for your feedback!  By Sudo, Nym Head of Community <p>The Nym community operates the largest decentralised mixnet in the world today, counting 500+ mix nodes across 60 countries and five continents. Now that the network is up and running, it is time for mass adoption! At this crucial moment, the Nym ship needs all hands on deck to steer and navigate, in order to bring strong network-level privacy to everyone, everywhere.</p><p>The Nym People Survey and Vibe Check Survey were recently sent out to our communities, partners and supporters. We thank you all for participating and sharing your thoughts! With over 500 submissions in eight languages, there is a lot of invaluable feedback to sift&nbsp;through.</p><p>But first, a commitment:</p><blockquote>Q: “ What would you like to see more of from&nbsp;Nym?”</blockquote><blockquote>A: “A Harry pin-up&nbsp;poster.”</blockquote><p>You got it, buddy. Stay tuned for a Harry Halpin pin-up&nbsp;poster!</p><p>In this first quick blogpost on dissecting the survey results, let’s explore some key takeaways from all your submissions. What is important to you, the Nym community?</p> Seamlessness <blockquote>“I would focus on enhancing user-friendliness and accessibility. While Nym’s mission and technology are highly commendable, ensuring a seamless user experience is essential for driving widespread adoption.”</blockquote><p>Many of you find ease of use, seamlessness and accessibility important, and rightfully so! These are all absolutely crucial for mass adoption of any technology. “Privacy by default” starts here. As you will see in the next section, integrations are top of mind for the project and the community alike. This is because integrations leverage a key feature of the mixnet: the fact that it is a layer-zero, infrastructure-level technology. Any application running over the Nym mixnet enjoys strong privacy protections at the network&nbsp;layer.</p> Integrations, partnerships, use-cases <blockquote>“Execution for real world problems — especially for mobile users, as android users are counted as 90% of total internet&nbsp;users.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Increase pace of development and diversity of service providers onboarded”</blockquote><p>One of the key themes in your answers across both surveys was use-cases of the mixnet. Usage for mobile came up a lot too, as a large majority of us use mobile devices for most of our apps and services these days. Strong privacy protection on Android and iOS is important.</p>What devices are you&nbsp;using?<p>Partnerships and mixnet integrations are top of mind for the Nym community: most of you want to see more of these in the future, and they are both key priorities for the project core&nbsp;team.</p>What would you like to see more of from&nbsp;Nym?<p>Some of the integrations you requested: Email providers, IronFish, Nym Wallet, YAMN Remailer Network, Twitter, Wasabi wallet, Bitcoin&nbsp;Core…</p><p>Importantly, besides application-specific integrations, general purpose use-cases of the mixnet are also important to the Nym community. Mixnet-based browsing and VPN services for both desktop and mobile were often mentioned in your responses. After adblockers, VPNs came out as the close second in the privacy-preserving technologies the Nym community is&nbsp;using.</p>Which privacy-preserving technologies are you&nbsp;using? Education and internationality <blockquote>“More multinational community marketing and activities are needed (Especially Education about privacy)”</blockquote><blockquote>“More internationality.”</blockquote><blockquote>“I think the mixnet is not well understood. I would like to spread this in a way that everyone can understand”</blockquote><blockquote>“Que todo está en inglés y el lenguaje que usan es muy técnico. Esto es una barrera para la adopción.”</blockquote><p>The Nym mixnet is a complex solution to mass surveillance, which is an even more complex problem. Written explainers, documentation and community support can only go so far to cut through the technical mumbo-jumbo. This is especially so for a non-technical audience, which is most people! This could be a barrier to mass adoption.</p><p>Back in 2022, <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/welcome-to-nym-shipyard-academy-ceb25ac8d3ff">Shipyard Academy</a> was the first effort from the Nym team to provide an interactive, zero-to-hero overview of both the problem, and Nym’s solution to it. We received great feedback from the community about the Academy, and it was often mentioned in your survey submissions as well. Stay tuned for more details on the next cohort of Shipyard&nbsp;Academy.</p><p>When it comes to international reach, there are <a href="https://t.me/nymchan/175530">Nym community channels</a> and blogs in various different languages to ensure ease of content consumption. However, the regular Nym community calls, AMAs, and other community activities are (mostly) in English due to it being the common language for most of our communities and speakers.</p><p>What would you like to see more of in your language? <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoc3wV2YJYwpMUTCM9MPAwB2bWGhVMqCa">Community calls</a>? Documentation? Something else? Come to the Nym <a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a> or <a href="http://discord.gg/nym">Discord</a> and share your thoughts!</p> Nym at a&nbsp;party <p>The team had a lot of fun reading through your responses to the question “You are at a party, and Nym is a person at that party, how would you describe this person?”. Here are some of our favorites:</p><p>“The reliable guy to whom everybody goes and tell their&nbsp;secrets”</p><p>“Indistinguishable from all the other party&nbsp;people.”</p><p>“Mysterious, wearing a mask. Likes to be a part of the crowd, because privacy loves company. Not standing alone, for sure. Dynamic, likes to change&nbsp;places.”</p><p>“Nerd. Lol.”</p><p>“Nym is a bouncer that prevents bad guys from having access to the&nbsp;party.”</p><p>“Secret Santa.”</p><p>“It’s Harry!”</p><p>“A guardian making sure no one is recording/photographing people without permission.”</p><p>“Does anybody know the guy in the corner? Who? Oh, he’s gone… never&nbsp;mind!”</p> Let’s keep the conversation going! <p>Although the surveys are over, the conversation has only just begun. Keep an eye on the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/">Nym blog</a>, <a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a> and <a href="http://discord.gg/nym">Discord</a> as more findings are shared and discussed over the coming weeks, and participate in the conversation! Let’s shape the future of the Nym decentralised infrastructure and ecosystem together.</p><p>Much love,<br>Sudo</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/in-your-own-words-where-should-we-head-next-7bf0706e7950">In your own words: where should we head next?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>by Deirdre Connolly, Conrado Gouvea</p>



<p>We optimized our implementation of FROST by upwards of 50% over the trivial implementation, without changing the protocol and therefore maintaining its existing security guarantees. We use a known trick to do so: multi-scalar multiplication, which is exactly designed to give this kind of performance speedup.</p>



<p>In the FROST threshold signing protocol, we perform many elliptic curve operations for key generation, signing, and signature verification. Because FROST is a Schnorr threshold signing scheme, the signature that is produced is compatible with single-party Schnorr signature verification. As such, there is no additional computation overhead to verifying signatures produced by FROST vs single-party.</p>



<p>However, when performing FROST signing, signers must perform a linear number of group element multiplications, proportionate to the number of signers, as shown below (see the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost/">FROST specification</a> for details).</p>


 
Group commitment computation algorithm from the FROST specification. 


<p></p>



<p>If implemented trivially, the computational overhead of FROST signing grows computationally more expensive as more parties are involved. When the number of parties is small, which is typically the case for threshold signing, (i.e. 2-out-of-3 or 3-out-of-5) this extra computational overhead is marginal. However, we would like to reduce the number of expensive elliptic curve operations wherever possible.</p>



<p></p>



 Multi-scalar Multiplication? 



<p>In the context of elliptic curves, a scalar multiplication is written as kP where k is an integer mod a prime p and P an elliptic curve point, an abelian group element; points can be added or subtracted. With only those operations it’s possible to compute kP. The naïve approach would be to simply add k copies of P together with k-1 additions, but there are more efficient approaches that take a number of additions in the order of log(k). These go through the bits of the scalar, doubling the point for every bit and adding the point P if the bit is 1. For example, 5P can be computed with 3 additions:</p>



<p>2P = P + P<br>4P = 2P + 2P<br>5P = 4P + P</p>



<p>In order to speed up FROST signing, we must do more efficient point multiplications with respect to multiple variable base points, which is called multi-scalar multiplication. It consists of computing the sum aP + bQ + … + dS for some number of points and scalars. It can be naïvely computed by doing each scalar multiplication and then summing them all up. Thankfully, we have several algorithms at our disposal that can do better.</p>



<p></p>



 Algorithms to Optimize Multi-scalar Multiplication 



<p>Most of the multi-scalar multiplication algorithms rely on the observation that you do some operations on all of the points at the same time. For example, you can compute 3P + 3Q with only 3 additions:</p>



<p>P + Q<br>2(P + Q)<br>2(P + Q) + (P + Q)</p>



 Interleaved wNAF 



<p>The NAF (non-adjacent form) is a way to encode the scalar with digits -1, 0, and 1 (instead of the regular bits 0 and 1). This is useful because point subtraction is as easy as a point addition, and the NAF has fewer non-zero elements, which speed up the point multiplication algorithm (recall that there is a point addition for every non-zero digit). The wNAF is a windowed version of the NAF (e.g. a 2NAF can have digits -3, -1, 0, 1, and 3). We have been using an interleaved width-w non-adjacent form in our scalar implementation to support multi-scalar multiplication. We pre-populate a lookup table of multiples of the points being multiplied (e.g. P, 3P and 5P for 3NAF), which are then used to add the non-zero terms of the scalar being multiplied in the non-adjacent form.</p>



<p>Interleaved wNAF is often used where part of the points are fixed, and then a larger window is used for those and their table can be precomputed in advance once, instead of being computed on-the-fly. However, that is not useful for FROST: we will describe an alternative solution later in this post.</p>



<p>Other algorithms such as Pippenger and Bos-Coster can be more efficient than the interleaved wNAF, but they are more complex to implement. We will eventually look into them. (We mostly went for interleaved wNAF because we already had an implementation of it used in batch verification!)</p>



<p></p>



 Optimizing FROST 



<p>In our FROST libraries, we have already used a variable-time multi-scalar multiplication implementation to verify batches of Schnorr signatures all in one go. We now describe how we used this multi-scalar multiplication implementation to speed up how signers generate the group commitment R when performing the second round of FROST signing.</p>



<p>As a reminder, during the second round of the FROST signing protocol, each party computes the group commitment based on the nonce commitments sent by each i-th signer in the first round of the signing protocol. This group commitment is also computed by the coordinator in the final aggregate step, after all signing participants have created and sent their signature shares.</p>


 
Baseline implementation computing the group commitment. 


<p>Computing this group commitment is a ripe opportunity to use multi-scalar multiplication, because we have to compute a multiplication of varying elliptic curve element bases (the nonce commitments from each participant) by a varying scalar (the binding factor). Previously, we would do a variable-base scalar multiplication for each participant, and then add the result to an accumulator elliptic curve group element. However, we can restructure our algorithm to accumulate the hiding commitments, and save the variable base multi-scalar multiplication of the binding commitments and the binding factor scalar to the end, in one shot. Then we add the result to the accumulator, to result in the full group commitment.</p>


 
Optimized implementation computing the group commitment. 


<p>Because we already had a variable time multi-scalar multiplication implementation in our code base, this change only touched a few lines of code, but <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost/pull/345">resulted in an over 50% speed up at the high values of threshold and max possible participants</a>. The speed up was seen in the second round computation and the final aggregate step, as both are computing the group commitment.</p>


 
FROST performance scaling after our multi-scalar multiplication optimizations. 


<p>This optimization is compliant with the FROST specification, as the change to use multi-scalar multiplication only involves a rearrangement of equation terms in the generation of the group commitment. The speed up is available with any multi-scalar multiplication implementation, variable-time or constant-time. The underlying elliptic curve group software implementation used by your FROST implementation might already have this optimization available.</p>



<p></p>



 Comparing Optimized FROST to FROST Variants 



<p>There are now several different variants of FROST in the literature, all that offer speedups with respect to the overhead of the group commitment. Notably, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1375.pdf">FROST2</a> allows for constant overhead when computing the nonce, and <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/550">another variant presented in the context of ROAST</a> improves on the bandwidth that is sent from the coordinator to each signing participant. However, FROST2 achieves <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/833">weaker security than FROST</a>, and the variant in the ROAST paper has not been demonstrated to have any stronger notion of security <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/833">(i.e. TS-UF-1 and higher)</a> other than unforgeability. As a result, we chose to keep the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost/">CFRG draft</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost">our implementation</a> pinned to the original FROST design.</p>



<p>Using multi-scalar multiplication to optimize computing the group commitment over the full execution of the FROST protocol is significant, because it brings the performance overhead of FROST closer to these alternatives, while retaining stronger security properties.</p>



<p>As opposed to making breaking changes to the protocol itself, we use known optimization tricks under the hood to speed up our implementation. Making protocol changes requires re-analysis and new security proofs, so such changes are not done lightly. Happily, in this case, we can get the best of both worlds: performance that is better than the trivial implementation of FROST (i.e. from linear overhead in the number of signers to close to constant), without having to compromise on the security or flexibility of the scheme.</p>



<p>These optimizations are now available in <a href="https://crates.io/crates/frost-core">frost-core</a>, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/frost-ed25519">frost-ed25519</a>, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/frost-ed448">frost-ed448</a>, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/frost-p256">frost-p256</a>, frost-<a href="https://crates.io/crates/frost-ristretto255">ristretto255</a>, and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/frost-secp256k1">frost-secp256k1</a> as of 0.3.0 on crates.io!</p>

<p>Transferring NYM tokens from Ethereum to Nyx just got a whole lot&nbsp;easier</p><p>It has been just over a year since the Nym mainnet called ‘Nyx’ went live, the native blockchain of the NYM token. Since then, the NYM token has been made available on other blockchains, namely Ethereum and BNB chain, ensuring that more people can use the token to secure Nym’s global privacy infrastructure.</p><p>There have been many exciting developments and improvements on this privacy infrastructure during this past year. But probably one of the most frequent requests by the community has been to improve the delegation process by making the transfer of NYM tokens across blockchains more accessible.</p><p>This article will briefly compare the “two sides” of the NYM token and provide a concise, beginner-friendly guide on how to transfer your NYMs with ease between the Ethereum blockchain and the native Nyx chain. More importantly, it will also provide guidance on how to stake your NYM by delegating it to mix nodes, enabling you to earn rewards while securing the Nym privacy infrastructure!</p><p>An overview of differences</p><p>As Nyx is the native blockchain of the Nym privacy infrastructure, when you have NYM tokens on the Nyx chain, you are able to unlock the full potential of the tokens, by bonding or delegating stake and earning a share of operator&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>The main difference between the NYM token on Nyx (Cosmos) and Ethereum (ERC20) is that native NYMs unlock the true potential and utility of the token. However it is easier to access ERC-20 NYM simply because these are listed on more exchanges. Once you bridge your NYM tokens from Ethereum to Nyx, and hold your tokens in the <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nym-wallet/">Nym Wallet</a>, you can then begin delegating stake on mix nodes of your choice to earn rewards. You can also bond your native NYMs if you want to start up your own mix&nbsp;node.</p><p>Tokens sold on Coinlist during ICO in 2022. Learn more about the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nym/">NYM token&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>How to transfer NYM from Ethereum to Nyx and stake for&nbsp;rewards</p><p>The 10 step process for adept&nbsp;users:</p>  Install prerequisites: <a href="https://metamask.io/download/">Metamask</a>, <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nym-wallet/">Nym wallet</a> and have some ETH for executing one transaction.  Transfer your ERC-20 NYMs to your Metamask&nbsp;wallet.  Visit <a href="https://bridge.blockscape.network/">Gravity Bridge&nbsp;Portal</a>.  Set the Gravity interface accordingly: From: Ethereum, To: Nyx. <br>Connect your Metamask on the Gravity interface, and load your&nbsp;address.  Select the Nym token in the “Amount” field and set the desired value for the transfer. Click on the small lock icon to enable pasting and paste your Nyx address from the Nym wallet. Lastly, authorize Gravity to perform the transaction in Metamask.  Execute the transfer. Attention: transaction fees are paid in&nbsp;ETH.  Note, that in order for the NYM to arrive in your wallet, you’ll need to wait for 96 block confirmations, which is approximately 20 minutes. <br>You might also need to reopen your Nym desktop wallet to see the tokens arrive on the interface.  To stake your NYM from your Nym wallet, you’ll first need to search for a mix node that you’d like to delegate to, using the <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/network-components/mixnodes/active">mixnet explorer</a>, <br>Here is an <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/want-to-stake-in-nym-here-is-how-to-choose-a-mix-node-to-delegate-nym-to-c3b862add165">article</a> that explains in more detail what you might want to look out for when selecting a mix node to delegate your stake&nbsp;to.  Once you’ve found a mix node that you want to support with your stake, click on the “Delegation” menu inside the Nym wallet, copy and paste the Identity Key of the chosen mix node, specify the amount you want to stake and finalize your delegation with the “Delegate Stake” button. <br>Attention: New delegations (similarly to un-delegations) will take place during the following full epoch of the mixnet. Every epoch is one hour long, so this is the maximum time you need to wait for your delegation to take&nbsp;place.  Congratulations, you’ve just started earning rewards by increasing the security of the&nbsp;mixnet!  <p>The detailed process for novice&nbsp;users:</p>  Switch to a browser that supports Metamask wallet extensions, like&nbsp;Firefox.  Install the <a href="https://metamask.io/download/">Metamask browser extension</a>. If you haven’t used it before, here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_9OLsfGW9Q">video guide</a> to help you get&nbsp;started.  Add the ERC-20 NYM token to your wallet, using the following steps.  Click on “Import tokens” at the bottom of Metamask Screen, then switch on top to “Custom token” tab. <br>Next, copy &amp; paste the following NYM ERC-20 token address, to the token address field: 0x525a8f6f3ba4752868cde25164382bfbae3990e1. This should automatically import the token ticker and set decimals. If this does not happen automatically, you can also do this manually by typing “NYM” and “6”. <br>Click “Add Custom Token” and confirm by clicking on “Import Token” if you see NYM appearing to finish the import. Here is an illustration showing the import details and how the end result should look&nbsp;like:  <p>5.

If you are less experienced with blockchain tools, it is recommended that you start with a smaller test-transfer, to make sure everything happens as it&nbsp;should.</p><p>11. To send the transaction, you will need to authorize the Gravity App in Metamask.</p><p>12. When Gravity shows “Permission Given”, you have your Nyx Account correctly and also see the NYM tokens with the desired amount showing up — just hit “Begin transfer”.</p><p>13. Note that in order for your NYM to arrive in your wallet, you’ll need to wait 96 block confirmations, which is approximately 20 minutes.

You can now delegate to Nym mix nodes and begin earning a share of their operator&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Delegate your NYM tokens to mix nodes — and earn a share of&nbsp;rewards!</p><p>Once your NYM is inside your Nym wallet, you can stake it on mix nodes to earn rewards for securing the&nbsp;mixnet.</p>  To stake your NYM, you will first need to search for a mix node that you would like to delegate to using the <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/network-components/mixnodes/active">mixnet explorer</a>. <br>Tip for first-time delegators: you should be looking for mix nodes which have close to, but less than 100% stake saturation and which are close to 100% routing score, in order to maximize your rewards. Also keep in mind that the higher the profit margin of the mix node operator is, the less reward is divided between stake delegators.  When you have found a mix node you want to support with your stake, just click on the “Delegation” menu inside the Nym wallet&nbsp;(1).  Inside this section, click on the “Delegate” button (2) and copy the Identity Key (3) of your chosen mix node from the <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/network-components/mixnodes/active">mixnet explorer</a>,  Define the amount you want to stake (4) and finalize your delegation with the “Delegate Stake” (5)&nbsp;button.  <p>Attention: New delegations (similarly to un-delegations) will take place during the following full epoch of the mixnet. Every epoch is one hour long, so this is the maximum time you need to wait for your delegation to take&nbsp;place.</p><p>Congratulations, you have just started earning rewards by increasing the security of the Nym&nbsp;mixnet!</p> Resources   <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nym-wallet/">Download Nym wallet</a> (to bond and delegate to&nbsp;nodes)  <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">Browse mixnet explorer</a> (to browse existing mixnodes)  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/staking-in-nym-introducing-mainnet-mixmining-f9bb1cbc7c36">Learn about mix&nbsp;mining</a>  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-token-economics-quarterly-parameter-update-e85b6c929b37">Nym token economics</a>   Join Nym Community! <p>Dev chats: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dev:nymtech.chat">Element</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a></p><p>Socials: <a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">Twitter</a> // <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/nymtech">Telegram</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/bridging-staking-and-earning-nym-tokens-8f19f42f171e">Bridging, staking and earning NYM tokens</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Brave's vertical tabs feature is now available for Windows, macOS, and Linux users to experience a new way to manage open tabs.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Brave’s vertical tabs feature is now available for users to experience a new way to manage open tabs. With today’s 1.52 desktop release, the vertical tabs setting is available to Brave users on Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>

 How do vertical tabs work? 
<p>Enabling the vertical tabs setting relocates your open tabs from the top of your browser window (i.e. above the address bar) to the left side of the window, where they’ll appear stacked vertically rather than horizontally. To do so, right-click an existing horizontal tab and select “use vertical tabs” from the menu.</p>
<p>With open tabs arranged vertically, you’ll be able to scroll through them as needed. To open a new tab, simply click the button to create a new tab at the bottom of the vertical tabs sidebar.</p>
<p>There are additional settings you can adjust to further customize your vertical tabs experience, which we’ll get to shortly.</p>


    


    

 
     
        
        
        
        
     
 

 The advantages of vertical tabs 
<p>Vertical tabs help to eliminate overcrowding your browser window, and to increase your on-screen real estate.</p>

 Identify open tabs more easily 
<p>The more horizontal tabs you have open, the smaller and more squished they become—often to the point of not being able to read any text on the tab. Vertical tabs, however, provide much-needed breathing room, allowing for more information to be displayed at a glance, so you can find the tab you’re looking for faster.&nbsp;</p>

 Use on-screen space more efficiently 
<p>Computer screens are almost always wider than they are tall, meaning you have more screen real estate left-to-right than you do top-to-bottom. By relocating tabs from the top of your window to the side, you maximize your available on-screen space.</p>

 Early feedback shows users love vertical tabs 
<p>While you may experience a short adjustment period as you become accustomed to vertical tabs, most users love the experience and don’t plan on going back.</p>
<p>“This, along with tab groups, should help me better organize my almost 300 tabs (!). Before, I used an extension called “Tab Manager Plus for Chrome” along with separating the tabs in multiple windows to keep things just enough organized to be usable. (yes I’m lazy I know). I was considering switching browsers, but thankfully now I won’t have to do that.”&nbsp; - Brave’s vertical tabs user</p>

 Customize your vertical tabs experience 
<p>By default, enabling vertical tabs will relocate your open tabs to the left side of your browser window. (This keeps the right side of your browser open to access Brave’s Sidebar feature, which provides quick access to your bookmarks, reading list, Brave Wallet, Brave Talk, and more. To enable Brave’s Sidebar, click on <code>brave://settings/appearance</code> in the Brave browser and enable / disable the Sidebar.)</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>You can also click the vertical tabs button  to collapse the vertical tabs panel. This way, you can maximize on-screen space by only opening the tabs panel when you need to access a different tab.</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    


 A new tab management experience with familiar functionality 
<p>Despite a few key organizational changes, vertical tabs work much like the horizontal tabs you’re used to.</p>
 
 Navigation and shortcut keys remain the same 
 Pinned tabs still function the same way, and are pinned at the top of the vertical tabs panel 
 Grouped tabs also still function the same way, letting you create, label, and color code groups. 
 


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>Vertical tabs give you an all-new, highly efficient system of tab management, without breaking anything you’ve come to love about tab management in Brave. Ready to try out vertical tabs? Make sure you’re on our latest desktop release (v1.52) and visit <code>brave://settings/appearance</code> to get started.</p>

<p>Today, Brave is excited to announce the release of the <a>Brave Search API</a>, making the backbone of Brave Search available to companies and developers worldwide as they build the next generation of apps that require Web search capabilities.</p>
<p>As the only privacy-preserving and independent search index in the West, Brave Search brings much-needed competition to Google and Microsoft Bing. The Brave Search <a>API</a> allows anyone to integrate billions of private, ad-free results from the Web with a simple API call.</p>
<p>The Brave Search API delivers great quality at an affordable cost. Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models developers in particular should benefit from the Search API, which offers access to high-quality, Web-scale data, with exhaustive coverage of recent events. It also brings a novel data set versus competitors who might be falling back to the standard Google / Bing options.</p>
<p>With a free plan and <a>affordable paid plans</a> starting from $3 per 1000 queries, the Brave Search API gives independent search access to all. Those interested can get started at <a href="https://api.search.brave.com/register/">api.search.brave.com</a>.</p>

 Brave Search, the Brave browser, and innovation 
<p>Since its initial launch in June 2021, Brave Search has grown to over 8 billion annualized queries, making it the fastest growing search engine since Bing. As the only global, independent alternative to Google and Bing, Brave Search is striving to make Web search more private and transparent. It’s also constantly innovating, with novel features like <a>Goggles</a>, <a>Discussions</a>, and the <a>AI Summarizer</a>, giving users more relevant results.</p>
<p>Brave Search is the default search engine in the Brave browser, which has nearly 60 million users worldwide. The browser’s opt-in <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409406835469-What-is-the-Web-Discovery-Project-">Web Discovery Project</a> adds millions of new webpages to the index every single day, and ensures the index is populated with real, useful data: no dead links, SEO spam, or other junk content. Together, this private browser / private search combo ensures a constant source of fresh data for the index, and for the Search API.</p>
<p><a>The Goggles feature</a> expands and customizes the ranking. Goggles allow any individual—or community of people—to alter the ranking of Brave Search by using a set of instructions (rules and filters). Anyone can create, apply, or extend a Goggle. Essentially Goggles act as a custom re-ranking on top of the Brave search index. This means that, instead of a single ranking, Brave Search can offer an almost limitless number of ranking options.</p>
<p>All Goggles will appear in the Brave Search API.</p>

 Pricing tiers, and getting started with the Brave Search API 
<p>Anyone can visit <a href="https://api.search.brave.com/register/">api.search.brave.com</a> and start testing in minutes. After creating an account, users can search the Web and get back every result the search engine has access to, in an easy, intuitive format. This includes Web results, enriched metadata, entity search, news, video results, and more.</p>
<p>All users can <a href="https://api.search.brave.com/register/">get started for free</a> for up to 1 query per second, and 2,000 queries per month. For users who need more, we offer a variety of paid plan options:</p>

<p>Dear Panther Community,<br></p><p>We are thrilled to announce that the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/dao/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther DAO</a> has officially approved <a href="https://snapshot.org/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0xcb272ecdb9e9f820772c193ebbd3bb05b8d80c11d00735925c8d5e38355ef9a5">PIP-14</a>. This proposal formalizes the project’s Governance Framework and introduces a DAO Council, marking a significant stride in the project's decentralization journey.<br></p><p>This landmark development follows extensive discussions on our <a href="https://forum.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">community forum</a> about the need for a decentralized, high-level decision-making process, and accountability for non-team members.<br></p> Significance<br> <p>The approval of PIP-14 puts us on the path to:<br></p>  The formation of a DAO Council, which will be entrusted with reviewing Panther Improvement Proposals (PIPs) from our Discourse forum. By verifying the alignment of proposals with Panther DAO’s mission, vision, and values, the Council will effectively weed out spam requests and proposals that are out of budget or misaligned with Panther's scope and <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/roadmap?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">roadmap</a>.<br>  Establishing a transparent Governance Framework, bringing implicit rules and guidelines into the light. These rules, which are now formalized, can be found in the following diagram:  All the above advancements will allow us to build a more robust and decentralized Panther Protocol. The Council<br> <p>The elected Council will consist of three respected community (non-team) members:<br></p>  Santiago Velez: Co-Founder &amp; Division Lead (R&amp;D) at <a href="https://blockdigitalcorp.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Block Digital Corporation</a>, VP of R&amp;D at Sindric Solutions, LLC.

Their tenure will be for 6 months, with the possibility of re-election.<br></p> Moving Forward<br> <p>The approval of PIP-14 marks an exciting chapter in Panther's roadmap. By installing a council to review PIPs and instating a transparent governance framework, we are becoming more open and democratic. Your trust and active participation have been instrumental in this success.<br></p><p>Let's continue to build and accelerate the development of <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/the-worlds-first-private-decentralized-protocol-launch-panther-dao-votes-to-launch-private-defi-e721df1364/">private</a>, scalable blockchain infrastructure for <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/web3/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Web3</a> together.

 Digital Integrity — disrupting the personal data&nbsp;economy  Five years in, it is clear the GDPR is not&nbsp;enough <p>By Alexis Roussel, co-author of <a href="https://www.slatkine.com/fr/editions-slatkine/74977-book-07211052-9782832110522.html">Our precious digital integrity</a> (Slatkine)</p><p>There is nothing natural, nor inevitable about the fact that our personal data is traded in open markets. And yet this has become the norm of the digital economy for billions of people’s data. This needs to&nbsp;change.</p><p>Today is the five-year anniversary of the <a href="https://gdpr.eu/">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> and while the regulatory framework managed to put the question of digital privacy on the global agenda, it has been <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/5-years-gdpr-national-authorities-let-down-european-legislator">a disappointment</a> when it comes to enforcement. Furthermore, the GDPR does nothing to challenge the fact that people have been subjected to information about them being produced and traded on open&nbsp;markets.</p><p>This week, we are at the <a href="https://www.cpdpconferences.org/">Computers, Privacy and Data Protection Conference (CPDP)</a> in Brussels. In addition to <a href="https://twitter.com/jayapapaya/status/1661313286120390656">opening the conference</a> with a discussion on the privacy implications of the cashless society, we conducted a workshop introducing the “Right to Digital Integrity”. This is currently being incorporated into the constitutions of several cantons in Switzerland. We were joined by Alexander Barclay, Delegate for digital policy of the State of Geneva, and Lusine Vardanyan, researcher at the Palacký University Olomouc, author of the paper <a href="https://sciendo.com/article/10.2478/bjes-2022-0008">Digital Integrity: A Foundation for Digital Rights and the New Manifestation of Human&nbsp;Dignity</a>.</p>Left to right: Alexander Barclay, Delegate for State of Geneva, Lusine Vardanyan of Palacký University Olomouc, Alexis Roussel, COO of Nym and Harry Halpin, CEO of&nbsp;Nym<p>The digital society has been in the making for half a century. From the beginning, developers and lawyers have pointed out the likely abuses of global information systems, all built without taking the rights of people into account. Sure enough, in recent times, an entire system and economy has emerged around the commodification and exploitation of personal data — namely surveillance capitalism as revealed by Edward Snowden and analysed by Shoshana&nbsp;Zuboff.</p><p>The societal response has been data protection laws, culminating with the adoption of the GDPR in Europe. It is now the most aggressive regulation vis-à-vis the private companies that participate in this surveillance economy. But the GDPR largely spares nation states themselves in its material scope and is really just a tool for market regulation, merely seeking to mitigate some of its negative effects. It does not manage to protect fundamental rights or challenge the underlying principles of the surveillance economy.</p><p>The foundation of the GDPR lies in the protection of privacy, a fundamental right that existed already long before the Internet appeared. But this is a limited approach that is not able to respond to the societal threats of the surveillance economy. Nor is it able to deal with the historical impact that our digital tools have on individuals and the organizations of our societies.</p><p>In the face of what can be described as a failed approach to data protection, there is now a call for a more fundamental digital right. The principle of informational self-determination is emerging in European case law and judges are seeking to extend protection beyond violations of privacy. However, they are trapped by the hierarchy of norms: the right to data protection as per Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union only offers a partial and limited form of protection. This article reaffirms the right to data protection, enshrines the importance of consent when processing data, but once again does not call into question the underlying model of a surveillance economy.</p> The Right to Digital Integrity <p>In 2018, the francophone data protection authorities, led by <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/home">Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL)</a>, declared that “personal data is constituent elements of the human person, who therefore has inalienable rights over them”. This statement is a frontal rebuttal to the notion of “personal data is a commodity”. Personal data is reframed as a constitutive element of a person, in the same way as their physical body. The proposal is a fundamental shift in understanding of data and yet this reframing largely goes unnoticed, with the CNIL itself not yet drawing the full conclusions of its proposal. If our data is indeed a constituent element of the human person, it is deserving of the same integrity and security protections as our bodies. And just like organ trade is highly illegal, personal data should not be traded in the open&nbsp;markets.</p><p>Since 2010, I have been exploring the extension of the concept of integrity of the person to their digital existence within political think-tanks in Switzerland working on digital rights issues. Grégoire Barbey and I co-authored a book “Our precious digital integrity” on the notion of a ‘right to digital integrity’. In this book, we explored how the emergence of such a right can lead to the emergence of a digital economy that is very different from the one we know. In fact, if implemented, it would necessarily lead to a revised security policy, protecting the integrity of the human being also in their digital&nbsp;sphere.</p><p>Shortly after we published our book, a symposium was organized by the Faculty of Law of the University of Neuchâtel discussing the ‘right to digital integrity’. The Valais Constituent Assembly, in charge of drafting the new Constitution of the Canton of Valais in Switzerland, then decided to integrate the ‘right to digital integrity’ in their draft. The vote is expected to take place next year in&nbsp;2024.</p> From “data protection” to the “digital&nbsp;life” <p>The primary contribution of the ‘right to digital integrity’ is that it takes a more comprehensive approach to what life in the digital age entails. What is at stake is not simply data protection, but the fact that much of humanity lives digital lives deserving of protection to safeguard their autonomy. This autonomy entails that their integrity is not violated.</p><p>The adoption of the ‘right to digital integrity’ in the constitutions of Swiss cantons is in full swing, and is already transforming the approach to data protection. For example, the Valais Constituent Assembly has moved away from the classic approach to data protection, which seeks to avoid the “abusive processing” of data, by proposing a prohibition of “data processing without consent” as a general rule. In contrast to the GDPR, this means the burden of proof is shifted from those who are the subject of the processing to those who carry out the processing. In the same draft, the ‘right to digital integrity’ is granted, including through the “ability to interact freely through digital technologies”. A right to open and non-discriminatory access to the Internet is recognized, as is the right to communicate with the authorities, without being required to exclusively use a specific technology.</p><p>In Geneva, a similar proposal is up for vote on the 18th of June 2023, a constitutional law submitted to the Geneva Grand Council. It proposes the introduction of a new article in the Constitution recognizing the ‘right to digital integrity’ with the following wording: “Digital integrity includes, in particular, the right to be protected against the abusive processing of data related to one’s digital life, the right to security in digital space, the right to an offline life as well as the right to be forgotten.” This is the first time the concept of “digital life” appears in a Constitution.</p><p>Furthermore, articulating a ‘right to security in the digital space’ allows for a profound paradigm shift in the security approach: the digital world can no longer be seen by the security authorities merely as a tool that can be compromised for some security scare. Instead, they have to actively contribute to securing the underlying infrastructures for digital life in order to allow citizens to lead their digital lives with serenity.</p><p>Following the trend of Valais and Geneva, the cantons of Jura, Neuchâtel and Vaud have also started debates on the ‘right to digital integrity’. And now, even the federal parliament.</p><p>Neuchâtel is the home of Nym, and here the ‘right to digital integrity’ is being advanced even further to include the ‘right to not to be monitored, analyzed and measured’. This recognises that the right to digital integrity in fact implies the right to remain anonymous, full stop. This is a radical step forward towards guaranteeing the autonomy and dignity of people in the digital&nbsp;age.</p> What next? <p>Our democracies are trapped in a paradox: our governments have rolled out privacy laws and mass-surveillance laws at the same time. But these two are fundamentally incompatible. The focus on privacy alone does not resolve this paradox.

<p>The current cloud and server architectures are vulnerable to hacking because of their centralised IT infrastructure. For applications that require a high level of data integrity, such as those that handle financial or privacy-sensitive data, exploring blockchain technology in a clean slate scenario can be highly interesting. </p>



<p>By leveraging a blockchain database, you can create a custom solution that meets your specific needs without having to conform to the limitations of pre-existing systems. This allows for greater flexibility and control over the database’s functionality and security.</p>



<p>In this article, we will address the much-debated topic of the difference between blockchain and a traditional database. So, without further ado, let us get to the point…</p>



 Key takeaways 



 
 Traditional database only stores the current state information 



 Blockchain stores a history of all transactions in the cryptographic signed database 



 On a blockchain, you can replay all transactions to reach the state information 



 Blockchain database provides a complete audit trail of all information flow 



 Blockchain databases offer an extra layer of security by creating an unalterable and tamper-resistant data record 



 On a blockchain, the historical record can be available and can be checked and verified by anyone with access to the blockchain database, in multiple locations 
 







 The fundamental difference 



<p>Blockchain databases differ from traditional databases in that they comprise a sequence of transactions that are securely anchored and immutable. In contrast, traditional databases are a collection of state information that can be mutated and lose logging history over time or in the case of a hack.</p>



<p>Blockchain databases store every transaction that has ever taken place. Consequently, creating a complete sequence of events that forms an unalterable record. So, in order to find the person’s state information, you can replay the whole chain of transactions.</p>



<p>To replay all transaction from the entire blockchain can be extensive and time-consuming. If you want to read a database state and don’t want to replay the complete history, you can also store it in a database next to the blockchain, or use a block explorer application. And then, it becomes a whole architecture that is highly secure, has high performance, and can not be changed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For quick recovery after an incident, block producers can take snapshots of the blockchain at regular intervals, decreasing replay time.</p>



 Significant improvements in security 



<p>Blockchain transactions are completely encrypted and usually decentralised on multiple servers. Because of this, you have highly available architecture with multiple operators across the globe to check and verify transactions. This makes the whole architecture cyber secure.</p>



<p>Imagine having 21 validators plus 5 standby who operate the blockchain. In a hypothetical scenario where one validator gets hacked and the hacker tries to change the information on the blockchain, the hacker would not succeed. This is because the other 20 validators have the original sequence of all transactions. Any new information added to the database needs to be approved by the majority of validators before being added on-chain.</p>



 Ideal use cases 



<p>In the current market landscape, blockchain databases offer a more tailored solution for addressing custom in-house applications. As an example, if you are an IT manager for a municipality, and you want to create a database specifically for administration purposes, building it on top of a <a href="https://zaisan.io/solutions/europechain/">blockchain (like Europechain) </a>is an option. This wouldn’t be feasible with an off-the-shelf application that is already built on an existing data architecture.</p>



<p>A blockchain database can be an ideal solution in situations where data security, transparency, and immutability are crucial. Among these industries are finance, healthcare, supply chain, and real estate, all of which require secure and reliable tracking of transactions.</p>

<p>Today, in order to better serve the Zcash mission, we are announcing a restructuring of ECC, including layoffs of valued team members. Going forward, ECC will focus our time and expertise on specific parts of the Zcash mission, and help transition other parts to other organizations in the Zcash community.</p>



<p>We at ECC have been trying to do too much with too few resources, especially in the last year and a half as the bear market began to impact our finances. It has become clear this was limiting our ability to execute on the things we’re best at.</p>



<p>Zcash has grown and changed, and today there are many organizations outside of ECC who are also committed to the Zcash mission, many of them funded by the Zcash Dev Fund, including the Zcash Community Grants committee, Zingo Labs, Nighthawk Apps, the Zcash Foundation, Zcash Media, the Zcash Global Ambassadors program, and many other individuals and organizations. There are also the promised contributions to Zcash by QEdit and Shielded Labs and by the Filecoin and Anoma projects. We are grateful to these people for their contributions to the Zcash movement, and by committing ECC to doing fewer things and doing them well, we hope to further empower them, making Zcash as a broad movement even more resilient and sustainable.</p>



<p>Restructuring ECC was a challenging decision. It required that we lay off 13 employees — about half of our team. Many of the people we let go today were instrumental in bringing to market groundbreaking technologies and ideas that no other team in the world has been able to deliver. We are sad to part ways with them and will always be grateful for the opportunity we had to work with these incredible individuals.</p>



<p>In the coming weeks, ECC will release a revised roadmap centered on empowering ZEC holders and giving them a voice. This includes:</p>



 
 Creating an excellent user experience for proof-of-stake ZEC 



 A wallet, built by and for Zcashers, that is easy to use and accessible for anyone 



 A mobile-wallet SDK that is useful to other Zcash builders 



 US-based policy work to ensure ZEC, self-custody, and staking remain viable in the USA 
 



<p>We will help transition ownership to the broader community of some functions ECC has undertaken in the past.</p>



 
 Support for zcashd outside of ECC’s Roadmap 



 Protocol review for Zcash core protocols outside of ECC’s roadmap 



 Alliances and exchange support 



 Global regulatory relations 



 Management of digital properties, including z.cash and the Zcash-specific social accounts 



 Product marketing 



 Zcash related PR and media engagement 
 



<p>Importantly, our immediate-term work on solving third-party wallet performance issues is still our highest priority at the moment, and we are committed to releasing zcashd 5.6.0, an updated lightwalletd, and new mobile SDKs for iOS and Android soon.</p>



<p>As with any transition, this restructuring of team and priorities will take some time to fully settle, and there are some other projects and initiatives that are nearing completion — such as the relaunch of z.cash and a proposal to foster community ownership of this and other Zcash digital properties — that we’ll be delivering to the community in the near term. We’re still engaging on important initiatives such as the Filecoin Foundation grants and other activities that will benefit the Zcash user.</p>



<p>This is hard. I asked all of the ECC team to join me in my work to serve human freedom. It became our collective mission, and something we’ve all fought for day-in and day-out. While we won’t all be able to continue on this particular path together, I am confident that in the scope of history, each one of us will look back proudly on what we did together for human freedom. I am grateful for all the team members to whom we said goodbye as employees today, and for the ones that will continue at ECC. We remain fully committed to our mission and believe ECC is now in a much stronger position to serve the Zcash mission, both today and into the future. </p>



<p>I’ll be joining an ECC-hosted Twitter Spaces on Friday, May 26th, to answer questions from the community. Please keep an eye on <a href="https://twitter.com/ElectricCoinCo">@electriccoinco</a> for details.</p>

    <p>Bringing decentralized oracle capabilities to the fast growing EON ecosystem and supporting a wide range of use cases&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are excited to announce a strategic partnership with <a href="http://bandprotocol.com">Band Protocol</a>, a cross-chain data oracle platform, to provide real-time price feeds and reliable data for <a href="https://eon.horizen.io">Horizen EON</a>, our EVM-compatible smart contracting platform. The partnership will bring decentralized oracle services to the growing EON ecosystem, supporting a wide range of use cases, including DeFi, gaming and NFTs.</p>
<p>Horizen’s EON is a fully EVM-compatible smart contracting platform and the first of many smart contract sidechains on the Horizen ecosystem. Band Protocol’s flagship oracle solution enables Horizen EON to gain access to real-time price feeds for tokens across different chains, providing a safe and reliable source of information for EON as it builds out its DeFi, gaming and NFT ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Starting in version 1.53, Brave will begin rolling out a new feature called “Request Off the Record (OTR).” This feature aims to help people who need to hide their browsing behavior from others who have access to their computer or phone. For example, a person who is the victim of intimate partner violence who needs to find support services without their partner knowing, or someone needing to find personal healthcare without others in their home finding out.</p>
<p>Request OTR allows websites to optionally describe their own content as “sensitive.” The browser can then ask if the user would like to visit the site in OTR mode, where the site is visited in a clean, temporary storage area. Sites visited in OTR mode are not saved to your browsing history, and any cookies, permissions, or other site data do not persist to disk. Meanwhile, other sites visited are stored and treated as normal, obscuring to anyone who may access the device later that any “unusual” behavior happened.</p>
<p>Request OTR is another in Brave’s suite of features that support the privacy needs of individual users, protecting far beyond the “standard” threats browsers typically watch out for. Brave intends to work with other browser vendors to standardize OTR, so that at-risk browser users can be private and safe, across the Web, regardless of which browser they’re using.</p>
<p>This feature has been designed with the input of, and in collaboration with, several civil society and victim advocacy groups. We agree with Mallory Knodel, the CTO at the Center for Democracy and Technology, in the following:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Brave Browser's attention to detail with OTR Mode—users can more easily choose which websites are recorded in their browsing history—is an important privacy innovation that can protect users in "attacker you know" situations or anyone who wants more control over what their browser remembers and what it doesn't. This feature empowers people who browse the web—all of us—and gives us more agency over content consumption.</p>
    <p>— Mallory Knodel, CTO at the Center for Democracy and Technology</p>
</blockquote>

 Some users need to hide their browsing from people who have access to their device 
<p>Most often, when people talk about Web privacy they’re talking about protecting personal data from websites (e.g. blocking Google from recording the sites you visit).</p>
<p>However, Web users have other privacy needs too, needs that are currently poorly served by most browsers. Consider “Sarah,” a hypothetical Web user who lives with “Stan,” a physically abusive partner. Sarah needs to use the Web to learn about legal, medical, and other support services in her area, so she can safely exit her relationship. Stan, though, suspects Sarah may be planning to leave, and begins monitoring Sarah’s phone, computer, and other devices to see if she’s contacting support services.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not only do browsers fail to protect users like Sarah, they actually make it easier for abusers like Stan to digitally surveil others. Browsers record a wealth of information about our browsing behavior and interests, both explicitly (e.g. browsing history, DOM storage, and cookies) and implicitly (e.g. cache state, saved credentials, URL autocomplete). Worse still, the tools browsers do include to protect people like Sarah are incomplete and / or difficult to use correctly.</p>

 Current browsers tools are insufficient for protecting against known abusers 
<p>Browsers currently provide some tools to help users hide their activity on sensitive sites. However, these tools are insufficient to protect people whose safety depends on hiding visits to specific sites from people who have access to their device. Existing tools either hide too much (thus inviting suspicion from abusers), too little (thus allowing abusers to recover browsing history), or are otherwise difficult to use successfully.</p>
<p>Private (also known as Incognito) windows allow users to browse the Web without their browsing activity being permanently recorded. Unfortunately, private windows do a poor job protecting users from on-device surveillance. It’s easy to forget to open a private window before visiting a site, especially under stress, thus causing the site visit to be permanently recorded. And it’s equally as easy to forget to close the private window, and thus continue browsing in the private window beyond just the target sensitive site. This can reveal to the abuser that private browsing modes have been used, which on its own may elicit suspicion or put the victim at further risk.</p>
<p>Similarly, some browsers include advanced browser controls that can be used to delete browser storage for specific sites. This approach has the drawback of needing to be performed after the site was visited, instead of protecting the user during the visit, which may put the user at risk if the browser needs to be closed quickly. Additionally, these controls are often difficult to find, and more difficult still to use correctly for non-technical users. And finally, these browser controls typically only allow the user to delete stored values for the site (e.g. cookies or permissions), but do not allow the user to delete other traces of the site (e.g. browsing history or caches).</p>
<p>Finally, some sensitive sites include quick-exit buttons in the site themselves, which allow a visitor to quickly navigate away from the site in a way that may be semi-difficult for an abuser to detect. While useful, this approach is also incomplete. Quick-exit buttons cannot delete many types of site data (e.g. permissions or caches), and are constrained in their ability to modify browsing history. Further, they depend completely on the correct implementation by the site; the browser is unable to protect the user.</p>

 Brave’s Request OTR provides a novel, powerful protection 
<p>Brave’s Request OTR approach provides a comprehensive way for sensitive sites to request to be omitted from a user’s browsing history and local storage. Any site can request to go OTR, and the user is prompted to see if the user would like to do so. If so, the Brave browser creates a temporary storage area for the site, and does not record the site visit in the user’s browsing history. The OTR session is tied to the site, and any other sites the user visits in the same tab (along with any sites visited in any other tabs) are recorded in browsing history as normal.</p>
<p>More specifically, Brave’s implementation of Request OTR protects the user in the following ways:</p>
 
 The user is protected the entire time they’re visiting a sensitive site; they don’t need to try and scrub their browsing history later. 
 Other, non-sensitive sites are recorded as normal, which prevents big gaps in browsing history that might look suspicious to an abuser. 
 All target site behaviors are prevented from persisting to disk, including cookies, caches, browsing history, permissions, etc. 
 OTR prevents sites from abusing the feature; a site cannot go off-the-record unless a user explicitly gives the site permission to do so. 
 

 How can sites request to be off the record 
<p>Brave has developed Request OTR specifically to help people suffering from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimate_partner_violence">intimate partner violence</a>, or people otherwise needing to hide visits to sensitive sites from their browsing history. However, OTR is intentionally a general browser feature, and is intended to be usable by any site on the Web.&nbsp;</p>

 Request-OTR header 
<p>Currently, there are two ways for a site to request to go off the record in Brave. The primary, intended way is for the site to include the header <code>Request-OTR: 1</code> in the response to the initial navigation request for a site. If the browser sees this header, the browser will halt the navigation and ask the user if they would like to visit the site off the record.</p>
<p>If the user says yes, then the browser does two things:</p>
 
 It does not record the site visit in the browser history 
 It creates a temporary storage area for caches, cookies, permissions, etc. 
 
<p>The browser continues using this temporary storage area for all subsequent pages visited within the same tab, within the same site. When the user closes the tab, or navigates away from the site, the temporary storage area is discarded, and browsing behaviors return to being recorded as normal.</p>

 Request-OTR preload list 
<p>The second way for a site to request to go off the record is to be included in Brave’s preloaded <a href="https://github.com/brave/adblock-lists/blob/master/brave-lists/request-otr.json">list of “request off the record” partner sites</a>. These are sites that serve victims of intimate partner violence, and have told Brave they’re interested in being considered a sensitive site by the browser. This list is intended as a bridge measure, until all sites can implement the previously mentioned header approach.</p>

 Limitations of Brave’s Request-OTR implementation&nbsp; 
<p>Brave’s Request OTR feature prevents visits to sensitive sites from being recorded in a user’s browser history, both overtly (browser history, cookies) and incidentally (caches, permissions, etc). Brave’s Request OTR feature is covered by <a href="https://hackerone.com/brave?view_policy=true">Brave’s security bug bounty program</a>, and we welcome any reports of data from an “off the record” session being incorrectly or incompletely cleared.</p>
<p>However, users should be aware that Brave’s Request OTR feature does not protect users from other software on their computer that might record information about what sites they visit. Examples of software the Brave browser cannot hide browsing history from include:</p>
 
 Browser extensions 
 Network spying 
 Malware or spyware installed on the device 
 Information saved by sites before or after you visit the “off the record” (such as if you have “Google Web History” enabled on Google Search or Gmail) 
 Operating-system level logging 
 Crash logs 
 
<p>Brave is exploring what additional protections can be provided against such threats, but users should be aware that (as with systems like private browsing mode) Brave’s Request OTR mode only prevents recording of core browsing behaviors and data.</p>

 Next steps in Request-OTR 



    


    


<p>We’re excited to release Request Off the Record in upcoming version 1.53 of our desktop browser, with an Android version coming in the 1.54 release. We’ll be rolling it out to users shortly, though people interested in testing the feature now can enable it by visiting <code>brave://flags</code> and enabling <code>#brave-request-otr-tab</code>. Please note that this should only be done if you understand the risks of testing experimental browser features. We welcome all feedback on the feature.</p>
<p>We’re also excited about the next steps we’re taking to further improve the Request OTR feature. First, we’re working with experts and researchers at <a href="https://gwusec.seas.gwu.edu/">George Washington University</a> and <a href="https://cs.uni-paderborn.de/en/">Paderborn University</a> to evaluate how Request-OTR is understood by users, and how we can further convey to users exactly what protections the feature does (and does not) provide. We will both share the research that results from this collaboration on this blog, and incorporate it into future versions of Request-OTR in Brave.</p>
<p>Second, we’re interested in working with other browsers, organizations, and Web companies to potentially standardize Request-OTR, so that users of other websites and browsers can benefit from the protection. Our current implementation is the result of working with a wide range of abuse advocates, technologists, browser specialists, and NGOs, and we’re eager to continue working with similar organizations to best support Web users.</p>

<p>Today, we’re excited to announce a new Web3 feature for Brave Talk, our privacy-preserving video calling product: token-gating. Web3 Brave Talk calls allow hosts to use <a>NFTs</a> and POAPs <a>1</a> to token-gate access, configure avatars, assign moderator permissions, and more. Web3 calling also expands utility for Brave’s browser-native Brave Wallet: Together, they create the first-ever fully integrated Web3 live event platform, combining browser, wallet, and video.</p>
<p>Whereas with other video calling solutions (like Zoom or Google Meet) the host can only control access to a call using a password, Brave’s new Web3 calls enable new functionality regarding user authentication and authorization. Since NFTs can be sold and traded, using NFTs as the gating system creates a video calling system that mimics real life events: You can enter if you have a ticket.</p>
<p>Token-gating is a key development in Brave Talk, allowing hosts to use NFTs and POAPs as access passes to live events. For example, communities can hold members-only calls for token holders. Creators can reward select fans who hold their tokens with exclusive access to them. Businesses can use the open NFT marketplaces to sell and resell tickets to events.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Web3 calls are available to all Brave Talk users on any browser with any Web3 wallet. Hosts can start a Web3 call with a Premium Talk subscription.</p>

 How to get started with Web3 calling 
<p>To get started with Web3 Brave Talk calls, follow these steps:</p>
 
 Open the Brave browser, and visit <a href="https://talk.brave.com/">talk.brave.com</a>. 
 Click Host a Web3 Call (you’ll need a Premium Talk subscription to see this option). 
 When you create (or join) a Web3 room, your wallet will ask to authenticate, and allow access to one of your accounts. 
 Choose an NFT as an avatar. 
 Specify whether participants have to own an NFT or be a member of a POAP group to enter. 
 Share the link to the call with those you’d like to attend. 
 
<p>Note: You don’t have to use <a>Brave Wallet</a> to start or join a Web3 Talk call. Any browser-based or hardware wallet will work.</p>

 What is token-gating? 
<p>Token-gating is one of the main ways you can control access in Web3, and it generally has two parts: authentication and authorization.</p>
<p>Authentication</p>
<p>Web3 authentication starts with a blockchain wallet address that you own. Ownership is verified using the unique signature of your wallet, which only the holder of the wallet can generate:&nbsp;</p>
 
 A service sends a message to you. 
 You sign the message using your crypto address. 
 You send the message back to the server. 
 The service verifies the signature, and then knows you “own” that address. <a>2</a> 
 
<p>Brave Talk uses the <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361">SIWE</a> (Sign-In with Ethereum) protocol for Web3 authentication.</p>
<p>Authorization</p>
<p>For token-gating, authorization consists of specifying a token that an address must have to be authorized.</p>
 
 NFT ownership: You select one or more NFT collections, and if someone wants to join the Web3 room, their authenticated address must have an NFT from at least one of these collections. 
 POAP membership: You select one or more POAP events, and if someone wants to join the Web3 room, their authenticated address must be a member of one of those groups. 
 
<p>There are of course other authorization options, and we may expand to include these options in the future. For now, we’ve selected the two most common methods of NFTs and POAPs.</p>

 What’s next for Web3 Brave Talk? 
<p>While we’re excited to bring Web3 Talk calls to all Brave users, we’re already investigating several enhancements. These include:</p>
 
 Support for non-Ethereum NFTs: At present, only Ethereum NFTs (ERC-721) are supported. We hope to extend token-gating to NFTs on other platforms soon. 
 Token-gating for owners of a particular token: In this case, a participant has to have a specific balance of a particular token to gain entry. 
 Token-gating based on past ownership: this is a variation of the first two possibilities, but instead of looking at the current state of the blockchain, past activity is considered (e.g. if the user address ever owned an NFT from a particular collection). 
 Sending crypto to a participant: Since each participant has authenticated themselves, a “Send crypto” menu option could open a wallet widget with the recipient address already filled-in (with the user then having to enter an amount and approve the transaction). 
 
<p>These are just possibilities. We’d love your feedback and thoughts on other useful Web3 features you’d like to see come to Brave Talk. Feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/brave">tweet at us</a> or <a href="https://github.com/brave">submit an issue on Github</a> to share your ideas.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>A POAP—which stands for Proof of Attendance Protocol—is a type of NFT that signifies real-life attendance or participation in an event like a concert or conference. <a href="https://poap.xyz/about-the-protocol">Learn more at poap.xyz</a>.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>
 
 
<p>Ownership is defined as the wallet has access to the private key that generated the address.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

<p>Brave Wallet users can now shop with crypto at thousands of top merchants online and in-store, including Newegg, APMEX, PacSun, AMC Theatres, and airBaltic. Crypto payments are seamlessly made from the Brave Wallet to pay for everyday purchases, travel, and large ticket items. BitPay supports the top cryptocurrencies, ensuring Brave Wallet users can use their preferred coin to make payments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First launched in 2017, BitPay Protocol ensures accurate payments by eliminating payment exceptions including overpayments, underpayments, late payments, unconfirmed payments, and potential double-spends. As the crypto industry continues to evolve and attract a significant number of new customers, payment accuracy is imperative. The BitPay Protocol sets the industry bar for crypto payment quality enabling more accurate and reliable blockchain payments in-store and online.</p>
<p>“BitPay applauds Brave’s adoption of the BitPay Protocol,” said Stephen Pair, BitPay CEO. “With the hard work and dedication of the Brave team, we are able to promote payment quality online and in-store for both customers and merchants wanting to leverage the benefits of crypto payments.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“With this new integration from BitPay, we’re expanding the utility of Brave Wallet and making it easier than ever for our users to spend their crypto on real world goods and services,” said James Mudgett, VP of Web3 products at Brave.</p>
<p>The Brave Wallet is a secure, multi-chain cryptocurrency wallet built directly into the Brave web browser. In addition to paying with crypto, Brave Wallet users can buy, receive and send crypto assets across multiple chains. They can also import non-custodial wallets, track live crypto prices, swap coins and interact with Web3 DApps. Brave Wallet is available on desktop and mobile as a core feature of the Brave web browser. Download it today for Android, iOS, Linux and PC devices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new version ZEN 4.0.0 is <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zen/releases/tag/v4.0.0">available to download on GitHub</a>, in the APT Repository and via Docker.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This release includes new key features and introduces a hard fork</p>
 
 A hard fork to support V2 sidechains (See V2 Sidechain New Features) will activate at&nbsp; block #1363115, which will occur on June 7th, 2023 at approximately 13:00 UTC. 
 ZEN 4.0.0 sets the upcoming deprecation date to block #1422426, which will occur on September 19th, 2023 at approximately 12:00 PM UTC. 
 
<p>Note: Zend 4.0.0 is the last version of Zend supporting Ubuntu Bionic. Future releases of Zend will only support Ubuntu Focal or newer, as Ubuntu Bionic is End of Life starting May 31, 2023.</p>     
 

 
         
     Main V2 Sidechain New Features: 
 
 Non-ceasable Sidechains: The Horizen mainchain verifies each sidechain and ensures its integrity. Unlike traditional sidechains that have a limited time to produce a valid proof to keep exchanging information with the Horizen mainchain, sidechains declared as V2 and non-ceasable don’t share this constraint. The certificate can arrive at any time. Non-ceasing sidechains makes the verification process more flexible and frictionless without compromising the security of the system. 
 Key Rotation: A security enhancement that gives the ability to sign transactions and certificates using keys that are not stored locally, that are instead in a separate trusted execution environment 
 One Version: Starting from this version, Bitcore versions of Zen binaries will no longer be released. There will be only one version, which includes the AddressIndexing features (previously included in bitcore version). 
 
<p>Meanwhile, the EON sidechain <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-eon-is-now-live-on-gobi-testnet-with-bug-bounties/">is already live on testnet</a> check it out! We take this opportunity to also thank everyone for the continued support.</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any questions or you need further support. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a> (ZCG) program funds independent teams to perform major ongoing development (or other work) that benefits the Zcash ecosystem. Grants are chosen by a five-person committee whose members are elected by the<a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/"> Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP)</a>. </p>



<p>Of the current members, Cody Burns’ term expires at the end of June, and Wobbzz has announced that they are resigning their seat and will stand for re-election, in order to facilitate a move to staggered elections (i.e. where two committee members are elected in June, and three in December). </p>



<p>Therefore, we are inviting nominations for an election to be held in June.</p>



 How to Stand for Election to the Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) Committee 



<p>Anyone can stand for election to the ZCG committee. Existing members may stand for re-election, and there are no term limits. </p>



<p>Candidates should submit a forum post (ideally five paragraphs or less) in the&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/governance/zcg-elections/38">governance zcg-elections category of the Zcash Community Forum</a>, announcing their candidacy, and outlining their priorities and vision for Zcash. Community members will have an opportunity to ask candidates questions directly as replies to their respective posts.</p>



<p>The deadline for nominations is 09:00 UTC on Monday 12th June 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We cannot prevent anyone from talking about their candidacy in other media, but we encourage candidates to use the forum threads as their primary method of “campaigning.” Doing so will make it easier for Zcash community members to interact with and assess candidates.</p>



<p>During the week commencing 12th June, the Zcash Foundation will host a community call, during which the candidates will have an opportunity to introduce themselves, and answer questions from the Zcash community. </p>



<p>After the community call, ZF will open a Helios poll of <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">ZCAP</a> to select two candidates to join the ZCG Committee. The poll will close at 09:00 UTC on 1st July 2023.&nbsp;As with previous polls, the election will be decided by approval voting. The two candidates with the most approval votes will become the new ZCG Committee members. They will serve a one-year term, ending on 30th June 2024. </p>



<p>Prospective candidates should familiarize themselves with the Conflict of Interest policy (see below). </p>



 About the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>The largest slice of the&nbsp;<a href="https://zfnd.org/how-the-zcash-foundation-is-funded/">Zcash Dev Fund</a>&nbsp;is earmarked for major grants “<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">to fund independent teams entering the Zcash ecosystem, to perform major ongoing development work (or other word) for the public good of the Zcash ecosystem</a>”. While the funds are administered and disbursed by the Zcash Foundation (ZF), applications for major grants are subject to approval by a five-seat Major Grant Review Committee, which is elected by the <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/"></a><a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP)</a>.</p>



<p>The Committee reviews, assesses and approves or rejects grant applications. Committee members currently meet for brainstorming sessions every week, with formal committee meetings held every two weeks.</p>



<p>The first Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/fd30d13c-e010-11ea-88f3-4a6a23563c24/view">September 2020</a>, and adopted the moniker Zcash Open Major Grants (ZOMG). The second Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/2d0787fc-61de-11ec-8619-8ee85a8a1b8a/view">December 2021</a>, and re-branded itself&nbsp;<a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a>&nbsp;(ZCG).&nbsp;Hudson Jameson stepped down from the committee in <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/hudson-jameson-leaving-zcg/41941">June 2022</a>, triggering the election of Cody Burns, whose term expires at the end of June 2023. Wobbzz has <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/wobbzz-for-zcg-june-2023/44665">announced</a> that they are resigning their seat, effective June 30th, and will stand for re-election, thus facilitating a move to a staggered election cycle, where two seats are up for election in June, and three in December. </p>



<p>Committee members currently receive a stipend of $1,650 per calendar month (paid as shielded ZEC) from the Zcash Foundation (ZF).&nbsp;However, given the budgetary constraints that ZF currently faces, this stipend  may be subject to review over the coming year. </p>



 Conflict of Interest Policy 



<p>As a 501(c)(3) non-profit, the Zcash Foundation is subject to rules regarding private benefit and inurement. </p>



<p>To avoid conflicts of interest, the following policy applies to the ZCG Committee:</p>



 
 Serving ZCG Committee members, and entities in which a serving ZCG Committee member is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest, are ineligible to submit a new grant application to ZCG. 



 A person who has submitted a grant application (or who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that has submitted a grant application) on which the ZCG Committee has not yet rendered a decision is ineligible to serve as a ZCG Committee member (unless the grant application is withdrawn). 



 A person who is a current grant recipient (or a person who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that is a current grant recipient) is eligible to serve on the ZCG Committee so long as the decision to accept their grant application was made before they began serving as a member of the ZCG Committee. 



 Milestone payout decisions that relate to a serving ZCG Committee member’s grant (or a grant awarded to an entity in which a serving ZCG Committee member has a financial interest) will be taken by the executive director or other officer of ZF. 



 Before taking their seat on ZCG Committee, newly-elected Committee members will be required to undergo the ZF’s KYC process, complete a conflict of interest questionnaire, and sign an independent contractor agreement with ZF (to ensure that their status and relationship with ZF is clearly-defined). Additionally, serving ZCG Committee members are required to notify ZF of any new conflicts of interest that develop or emerge during their tenure. 
 



<p></p>



<p>If prospective candidates have any questions about the role, they should post them to <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zcg-committee-election-june-2023/44668">this topic on the Zcash Community Forums</a>.</p>

 🛠️ Deep dive: On new sources of competitive advantage &amp; moats in web3  <p>Scott Duke Kominers et al</p><p>A deep dive and tour through key business concepts from theory to practice, the latest episode of our podcast ‘web3 with a16z’ covers the tricky nuances of business strategy in a new world of open source. The discussion — which features a16z crypto research partner and Harvard Business School professor Scott Kominers in conversation with editor in chief Sonal Chokshi — covers foundational business frameworks yet also what changes in web3, as well as guidance for builders. </p><p>For decades, Michael Porter’s Five Forces model on the competitive forces that shape strategy helped companies understand the structure of their industry to “stake out a position that is more profitable and less vulnerable to attack” — but how do those assumptions change in web3? Where do so-called vampire attacks come in? And what even IS competition in web3, where so much is publicly available on blockchains?</p><p>The question throughout is basically how to compete when you're building in public… So we also go into the new moats of “community cohesion” and software “embeddedness” — and how network effects really work, beyond common misconceptions. Finally: since web3 changes the game altogether, what’s ahead for the evolution of business strategy overall?</p><p><a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/network-effects-moats-competitive-advantage-business-strategy-web3">listen to the discussion</a><br><a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1658516258579685376?s=46&amp;t=m_MyW3EHf_hr6YPWeAdbGA">share on Twitter</a> | <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0x050fe5">share on Farcaster</a></p><p>related:</p>  <p>Vampire attacks: A theory (and thread) on 'blood sucking' platform competition by John William Hatfield and Scott Duke Kominers (2023) — on <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/vampire-attacks-competition/">a16zcrypto.com</a></p>  <p>Can web3 bring back competition to digital platforms? by Christian Catalini and Scott Duke Kominers (2022) — in <a href="https://www.competitionpolicyinternational.com/can-web3-bring-back-competition-to-digital-platforms/">Competition Policy International</a></p>  <p>Why build in web3 by Jad Esber and Scott Duke Kominers (2022) — in <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/05/why-build-in-web3">Harvard Business Review</a></p><p></p>   ▶️ Builder resources: On protocol to product, design, security, &amp; decision making  <p>Taking an idea, and turning it into a real product for people to use, is nothing short of alchemy. So it’s not easy… but several expert speakers at this year’s Crypto Startup School (our accelerator that connects builders with the resources, expertise, and networks they need) distilled their hard-earned experience, and journey through the idea maze, into guidance and frameworks for founders. </p><p>We shared the first batch of talks in our last <a href="https://a16zcrypto.substack.com/p/how-to-build-and-scale-in-web3">edition</a> (be sure to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@a16zcrypto">subscribe to our channel</a> for the next releases), but subsequent batches cover the themes of “from whitepaper to reality”; product and design; leading and decision-making — as well as infrastructure, smart contracts, and security.

While the intention is to reduce any negative impact from cryptocurrency mining on local electricity prices and global pollution, it is far from obvious — from an economics perspective — that the other goals will follow.

<p>Public transaction history in blockchains represents one of their key features which, alongside immutability, aim to provide an alternative to CeFi. However, this transparency comes at a price: privacy. As a result, different solutions have been proposed, that preserve privacy while maintaining all the other benefits of blockchain technology, but there currently isn't a one-size-fits-all answer to this problem. For example, zero knowledge proofs convey the validity of a transaction batch without sharing any other details, but the underlying arithmetic circuits are both complex as well as computational intensive. Umbra proposes a system that relies completely on elliptic curve cryptography, employing multiple private-public key pairs to achieve stealth payments.</p><p>We were joined by Ben DiFrancesco, founder &amp; CEO of ScopeLift, to talk about Umbra's privacy preserving stealth token transfer system and if the need for privacy on blockchains outweighs any implicit UX frictions.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Ben’s background  Umbra's mission  How Umbra works  Non-interactive key distribution  Potential solutions (&amp; trade-offs) for Umbra's computational intensity  Generating private-public key pairs by the Umbra smart contract  User experience (UX) for senders and receivers  Fee structure for deterring griefing attacks  How Umbra works for ERC20 tokens &amp; NFTs  Privacy preserving withdrawals from stealth addresses  Privacy vs. UX friction  Smart wallets &amp; account abstraction  Prioritising privacy  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/BenDiFrancesco">Ben DiFrancesco on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/UmbraCash">Umbra on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ScopeLift">ScopeLift on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Friederike Ernst.

 Sweating the details— part&nbsp;2 <p>At <a href="http://privy.io/">Privy</a>, we build simple tools to help you onboard and engage your users in web3. In this series, we break down some of the work it takes to create simple experiences with state of the art tooling in web3. <a href="https://blog.privy.io/sweating-the-details-6250f167638c">See part&nbsp;1</a>.</p><p>Multiplayer journeys make web3 products unique. By leveraging assets that can be used across apps and ecosystems, web3 powers novel experiences that can build on one another, where anyone can openly contribute to a protocol or support its assets, thereby adding to the ecosystem’s value.</p><p>The launch of our <a href="https://blog.privy.io/web3-for-users-not-experts-52c692c25bb1">embedded wallets</a> raises some key questions for developers about interoperability:</p>  Can I ensure that my users have access to their assets across apps, even as they use embedded&nbsp;wallets?  If a user creates a wallet in my app, can they use this wallet, or its assets in another app like&nbsp;OpenSea?  <p>These questions apply to all wallets, but are particularly important for embedded wallets. Embedded wallets shift us from a wallet-centric mindset (where the user takes their assets with them using third-party software) to an app-centric mindset (where asset ownership is deeply integrated into the app experience).</p> Why interopability matters <p>Interoperability is the ability for data or assets to be freely moved from one system to another. It is essential to building rich experiences in web3 and helps unlock novel use cases beyond what any single company could&nbsp;build.</p><p>Practically speaking it boils down to two pragmatic concerns:</p>  Assets out — Will assets generated in your app have value elsewhere? Can your user take them to trade/spend/use?  Assets in — Can your app benefit from the assets your user has accumulated elsewhere? Do they need to buy crypto again (for gas, eg) if they have done it&nbsp;before?  <p>Historically, interoperability in web3 has been made possible by consumer crypto wallets. Users bring their own key management software (the wallet) to every app. The wallet acts as a bridge across apps and ecosystems, enabling the user to carry their assets with them, unlocking new value for the ecosystem.</p><p>However, <a href="https://blog.privy.io/web3s-coming-of-age-c588af57c94d">wallets can cause quite a bit of friction for newcomers</a> who are not used to the self-custodial UX in&nbsp;web3.</p> Enter embedded&nbsp;wallets <p>Embedded wallets are tightly integrated into a given product — no third party extension or app download required. They give a user all of the benefits of a self-custodial system without requiring them to BYOW (bring your own wallet — download an extension, secure a 12-word mnemonic, etc).</p><p>But how does interoperability figure into this? Wallets must remain usable across apps. If I generate a wallet as part of my journey in app A, I must be able to take my assets to app B and&nbsp;beyond.</p> Embedded wallet interoperability, a story in three&nbsp;parts <p>Let’s put ourselves in the shoes of a user. Alice is new to crypto and may not even know the product she is using runs on decentralized rails. She signs up for MadRealities using her phone number (and gets a Privy embedded wallet), <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/mad-realities-genesis-membership-pass">earning a rose</a> (NFT) in the process. Months later, Bob (her crypto-curious friend) tells her this rose is valuable and she should trade it on OpenSea. How can her embedded wallet enable this&nbsp;easily?</p><p>Option 1: Native wallet support across&nbsp;apps.</p><p>In this option, our embedded wallet system is supported across both apps, the asset originator and destination. That is both MadRealities and OpenSea integrate Privy natively so Alice can bring her wallet across both&nbsp;sites.</p><p>In this scenario, we must account for certain considerations:</p>  UX — embedded wallets can reduce user friction by integrating deeply into an app flow, and giving users an option to pre-approve certain transactions, for example. However, massive UX upside here carries real risk of a potential rogue app tricking a user into taking unwanted&nbsp;action.  Privacy — Automatically connecting a wallet across apps when a user logs in reveals a lot of information about the user. The wallet may be tied to sensitive on-chain information, and users must stay in control of whether they link accounts across apps like&nbsp;this.  <p>The prospects of embedded wallet integrations bringing self-custodial asset control across apps is exciting. But obviously it’s unrealistic to expect all apps to support the same wallet infrastructure in the near-term. This cannot be the end of the story. What if the app your user is going to (OpenSea in this instance) doesn’t support your user’s embedded&nbsp;wallet?</p><p>You really have two practical options:</p>  A WalletConnect integration  Provisioning a consumer wallet to go alongside the embedded&nbsp;wallet  <p>Option 2: the WalletConnect integration</p><p>WalletConnect was created in 2018 to make it easier for developers to integrate the long tail of wallets, and ensure users can connect to their app with any wallet. In fact, WalletConnect is an invaluable part of the <a href="https://www.privy.io/features/connectors">connector infrastructure Privy has built</a> for native users. While WalletConnect is fantastic for web3 users, it’s UX is very native to consumer self-custodial wallets and accordingly, some of its flows confuse web3 newcomers.</p><p>Back to Alice…<br>Using WalletConnect, Privy would appear as one of the available wallets in the WalletConnect interface and Alice could simply use this to connect her embedded wallet to any site that supports WalletConnect. But we must keep in mind where Alice is coming from as part of her&nbsp;journey.</p><p>The Newcomer Experience — New to web3, Alice thinks in terms of apps, not wallets. She is thinking about her assets (her MadRealities rose) not in terms of software (what wallet is securing these assets). This implicit change of frame is hard to pull&nbsp;off.</p>  Alice expects to log into OpenSea with her MadRealities account. Instead she sees WalletConnect, but may not know what that&nbsp;is.    From there Alice, if she knows to click it, she will be shown a list of available wallets in the market (or worse: a QR code). This is very intimidating for a newcomer. Now, she must pick Privy, which she may not know about. Expecting to access her MadRealities rose from OpenSea, Alice gets a crash course in the wallet&nbsp;market.  <p>Accordingly, our view of the landscape today is this: rather than let the user learn about wallets on their own, let’s proactively onboard them to a consumer wallet once they are ready.As your user is ready to leave their first app experience and head into the wider world of digital ownership, we want to give them the right tool for the&nbsp;journey.</p> The right tool at the right&nbsp;time <p>By the time Alice is ready to leave MadRealities for OpenSea to sell her NFT, she has a real incentive to deal with the friction of getting a&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Out of the box, <a href="https://docs.privy.io/guide/frontend/embedded/export">Privy supports simple key export</a> so you can easily prompt your user to copy their keys to an external wallet at the appropriate time. From there, they can use their embedded wallet in other apps, as well as continue to use it in your&nbsp;app.</p> The way&nbsp;ahead <p>Our work does not stop here. We are working with a number of wallet providers to develop one-click wallet migrations, enabling users to export their embedded wallet into an external wallet with a single click. Interoperability is a core part of the web3 user experience and we’re excited to see many builders in the space pushing to make assets usable across apps for all&nbsp;users.</p><p>We’re excited to share more on this front&nbsp;soon!</p> Some Lessons   Remember who your user is and how they got to your app. Knowing what they know and what they expect is powerful information. Make use of it to pick the best flows at a given&nbsp;moment.  Size the carrot and the stick. Through their journey through your app, consider your users’ incentives and motivations. By the time a user has a material reason to take assets from your ecosystem elsewhere, they are much more engaged than when they first came into your&nbsp;app.  <p>By supporting both external wallets and internal wallets, Privy is designed for all of your users, newcomers and experts alike, as they evolve through their web3 journey.

<p>The Whitepaper, developed with support from the Australian Commonwealth Government, explores the opportunities and risks stemming from the Metaverse, its potential impact on society and the economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>More importantly, it addresses measures that must be put in place to mitigate these risks and the need for, and role of, standards.&nbsp;With the potential to generate up to US$5 trillion by 2030, the Metaverse refers to interconnected virtual worlds that enable users to explore new places, interact with other consumers and experience new things in an immersive digital environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deemed the next iteration of the internet, it is set to change the way in which individuals interact with the world around them.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Whitepaper highlights Australia’s potential to be a global leader in the safe deployment of the Metaverse, paving the way for innovation and shaping industries, while setting a benchmark for the world in this space.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors suggest that to meet its potential and prevent targeted influence and manipulation in the Metaverse, Australia must build upon existing work in the areas of Online Safety and Safety by Design.&nbsp;</p>

  Exploring Autonomous Agents: A Semi-Technical Dive  <p>Agents are all the rage, but their planning capabilities currently outpace their ability to act reliably. How do we make them truly autonomous?</p>   
	By Dan Chen	 



Published May 11, 2023
  







 
<p>Over the past several weeks, autonomous AI agents have taken the world by storm. AutoGPT is one of the fastest growing Github repos in history, rocketing past PyTorch, every major Python web framework, and Python itself (sorry Guido) in number of stars. It’s led to some pretty sweet—albeit cherry-picked— demos and has captured the imagination of Twitter thought leaders and AI doomers alike. In a weird twist of fate, the popularity of agents has probably accelerated AI doomerism more than it has accelerated progress towards the superintelligence doomers fear.</p>



<p>An agent’s primary distinction from LLMs is that they run in a self-directed loop, largely augmented by a lightweight prompting layer and some kind of persistence or memory. The architecture varies from agent to agent, with some focused on task prioritization and others taking a more conversational roleplaying approach. The use cases are far reaching, from personal assistants to automated GTM teams. If you’re looking for an excellent primer and thesis on agents, look no further than my colleague Lauren Reeder’s <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-agents-perspective/">post</a>. And if you’re looking for the cutting edge for this family of agents, there’s LangChain’s recent <a href="https://blog.langchain.dev/plan-and-execute-agents/">post</a> on Plan-and-Execute Agents.</p>



<p>Pretty exciting, but how far are we from this reality? In order to truly understand, I am a strong believer in getting to the nuts and bolts. This means getting your hands dirty with the code. So I sat down for an afternoon and took a quick look at the codebases for some popular agents. Here are some observations.</p>



 Implementation 



<p>The core autonomous agent loops are pretty straightforward. For instance, for AutoGPT, each agent has access to an initial prompt, a set of actions to execute, a history of messages, and a workspace where it can write executable code and files on the fly. An initial prompt might be something like “plan my daughter’s birthday—she really likes unicorns.” The agent then runs on a modified <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629.pdf">ReAct</a> loop and is able to critique its own action through a second chat completion call with a <a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/blob/1d26f6b69720a561237f4d94d08bd9fae232aebb/autogpt/agent/agent.py#L292">special prompt</a> that roughly boils down to: “review the proposed action and tell me whether it’s good or bad and why.” The agent calls the OpenAI chat completion endpoint with the following context: the original directive describing the goal of the agent (“plan a sweet unicorn-themed party”), some commands that represent procedural code the agent can run, as well as some short-term memory (the historical context of the agent’s prior reasoning and actions, up to the token limit). The text completion is formatted to a <a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/blob/ecf2ba12db11ff19bce359b842f810f0e2d09d6a/autogpt/json_utils/llm_response_format_1.json">JSON dict</a> of “thoughts” reasoning through the next action to take as well as the next selected action—potentially through another chat completion call. The agent pauses after each loop and waits for user input, which will be included in future context. The context and history can be persisted in storage: Pinecone, Redis, or more recently, Milvus or Weaviate—but honestly a JSON dump works just fine.</p>



<p>Some immediate observations: Although the demos can be astounding, agent implementations are pretty straightforward under the hood. AutoGPT is in essence a light prompting layer running on a recursive loop with persistent memory and which can write executable code on the fly. LangChain has a partial <a href="https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/tree/master/langchain/experimental/autonomous_agents/autogpt">implementation</a> of AutoGPT where they augmented their base agent with the optional human feedback component. It’s important to note: LangChain is a framework that allows for the implementation of various agents, including not just AutoGPT, but also BabyAGI and direct translations of existing research (e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629.pdf">ReAct</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.00445.pdf">MRKL</a> – <a href="https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/tree/master/langchain/agents">here</a>). AutoGPT is an agent implementation that has made specific decisions on overall architecture and prompting strategy.</p>



 <code>    def generate_prompt_string(self) -&gt; str:
        """Generate a prompt string.
        Returns:
            str: The generated prompt string.
        """
        formatted_response_format = json.dumps(self.response_format, indent=4)
        prompt_string = (
            f"Constraints:\n{self._generate_numbered_list(self.constraints)}\n\n"
            f"Commands:\n"
            f"{self._generate_numbered_list(self.commands, item_type='command')}\n\n"
            f"Resources:\n{self._generate_numbered_list(self.resources)}\n\n"
            f"Performance Evaluation:\n"
            f"{self._generate_numbered_list(self.performance_evaluation)}\n\n"
            f"You should only respond in JSON format as described below "
            f"\nResponse Format: \n{formatted_response_format} "
            f"\nEnsure the response can be parsed by Python json.loads"
        )

        return prompt_string

// Prompting strategy in the LangChain AutoGPT <a href="https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/423f497168e3a8982a4cdc4155b15fbfaa089b38/langchain/experimental/autonomous_agents/autogpt/prompt_generator.py">implementation</a></code> 



<p>An immediately achievable next step to making these agents useful in practice is expanding their action space: <a href="https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/tree/master/langchain/tools">LangChain tools</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugins">AutoGPT plugins</a>. These modules define the extended set of commands that an agent can perform. Examples include searching Google or writing some code on the fly. The open source community might expand this finite set of actions with, for instance, Twitter integrations to let the agent read and post tweets, or payments integrations to navigate checkout flows. This is where LangChain and AutoGPT excel: due to recent attention, developers flock to these projects to build plugins. It’s a really interesting moat where, similar to proof-of-work consensus in blockchains, developers are incentivized to build on the most complete plugin ecosystem—the longest chain, so to speak. The hard part is that the set of actions a user can take on the internet is near infinite. To get agents that can do everything humans can do online the long term solution is to have agents reliably write their own procedural code to gracefully handle novel cases, but we need a step function improvement in models before this future is within reach.</p>



LangChain <a href="https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/tree/423f497168e3a8982a4cdc4155b15fbfaa089b38/langchain/tools">tools</a>



<p>Currently, agents run like your run-of-the-mill MBA graduate or entry level consultant: they are very good at describing plausible solutions but very poor at executing on them. Put another way, the Act component of ReAct performs poorly in unconstrained environments (ReAct is constrained to a predefined action space), and it is clear that the agent isn’t able to reason at a deeper level about novel situations or problem solve on the fly. A concrete example of this is that agents often hit a wall when the output of an action isn’t what they expect: they try to pull up a tweet, hit a 403: Unauthorized error, and are not quite sure what to do next as they have no notion that calling Twitter might give a different response if the user is not logged in. Practically speaking, the current generation of agents still need quite a bit of human intervention and direction to be effective.</p>



 So what’s next? 



<p>Building a working autonomous agent in an unconstrained environment is an open research problem. We are still far from this reality. That said, models are improving at an accelerating clip. AutoGPT-like agents represent an interesting practical experiment on agents in an unconstrained environment. Through experimentation and iteration on architecture and prompting strategy and enough open source contributions in the action space (plugins), this approach could plausibly start to bridge the gap between AI doomer fantasy and reality. Here is my agent wishlist to try to get us there:<br></p>



 
 A better headless browser. The kinds of agent directives that work best are the ones that involve researching things on the internet. This works well when the agent starts with a <a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/blob/1d26f6b69720a561237f4d94d08bd9fae232aebb/autogpt/commands/google_search.py">Google search</a>. It works less well when the agent then visits an arbitrary web page. Not only do agents need to understand and gracefully handle various HTTP errors, but also parse an arbitrarily large webpage and potentially execute Javascript to fully mimic a human user experience. Then, the agent would have to map the perceived UX to a limited context window. This is a very hard problem, but if you have a potential solution, <a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/blob/1d26f6b69720a561237f4d94d08bd9fae232aebb/autogpt/commands/web_selenium.py">here</a> <a href="https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/tree/423f497168e3a8982a4cdc4155b15fbfaa089b38/langchain/tools/requests">are</a> some places to start. 
 



 
 Better command selection. Currently, chat completion is responsible for command selection (“<a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/blob/3b74d2150e26ec9387e40cf65a75d8a995d8c9f3/autogpt/prompts/prompt.py#L13">determine which command to use…</a>”). This leads to some pretty crazy hallucinations: for instance, the birthday planning agent shown below tries to reference as an argument a file that doesn’t actually exist. There is probably some clever combination of prompting and procedural code that can minimize hallucinations and help guide the agent in the right direction. For instance, you could try cosine similarity between the embedding vectors across more descriptive versions of current commands and the chat completion response. Or you could try to craft the prompt in a way to minimize edge cases or restrict the creativity of completion outputs. It’s unclear what the right solution is, but there is a lot of room for improvement here. As an aside, this a great opportunity to explore <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.04761.pdf">toolformers</a> at the model level. 
 



 <code>    {
      ...
      "speak": "Let's start by analyzing any previous conversations or notes we have about the daughter's interests and preferences for her birthday party. This will help us come up with creative and unique ideas for themes, decorations, activities, and entertainment that align with her incentives and preferences. Then we can move on to managing the logistics of the party, including venue selection, guest list management, catering, and budgeting. Finally, we should anticipate and address potential issues or challenges that may arise during the planning and execution of the party to minimize stress and maximize satisfaction."
    },
    "command": {
      "name": "read_file",
      "args": { "filename": "daughter_preferences.txt" }
    }

// Example hallucination (no such file exists!)
</code> 



 
 Optimizations around the action space. While the LangChain agent is parameterized by default (you decide which tools to pass on instantiation), AutoGPT defaults to a set of out of the box <a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/tree/master/autogpt/commands">actions</a>. Some of these actions give agents a ton of functionality: they can read, write and execute arbitrary code and files. In the best case, this will make agents truly autonomous and self-improving. However, agents are not yet able to generate code and files in productive ways more reliably than they are to fail or hallucinate in doing so. This leads agents to get stuck more often than it leads to novel and working outcomes. The suggestion here is threefold: 1) do a bit of “hyperparameter optimization” around which subset of actions lead to the best agents—and for LangChain, include this as the default set of tools; 2) allow agents to change the action set on the fly, either automatically once they have hit an edge case and run into a loop (should be easy to detect) or manually on user input; 3) build out guardrails, input validation, and better failure mode handling for existing actions (similar to the suggestion for a better headless browser). Also, for AutoGPT, potentially remove some of the more powerful “out there” commands until the models get better. 
 



 
 A discriminator to rank actions. The recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf">Generative Agents</a> paper described a strategy that ranked observations in memory by some linear combination of “recency,” “importance,” and “relevance.” We could try implementing something like this for both memory context and task selection/action prioritization. The devil is in the details. For instance, the paper suggested a separate prompt to rank importance (“on a scale of 1 to 10…”); however, depending on the use case, “importance” could be better estimated by a numerical model (e.g. likelihood estimator) depending on the objective. There is likely no one size fits all solution, and the best approach is likely to start with a simple prompt and go from there. 
 



<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf">Ranking actions</a> from the Generative Agents paper



 
 More tools and plugins. Over the past two weeks, the number of approved plugins on AutoGPT has ballooned from 2 to almost 20—from Telegram to Wikipedia to crypto. LangChain <a href="https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/tree/423f497168e3a8982a4cdc4155b15fbfaa089b38/langchain/tools">tools</a> are just as comprehensive. Each additional working plugin expands an agent’s action space and gets it that much closer to mimicking a human on the internet. 



 Agent-to-agent messaging. As agents are deployed in the wild, they can start communicating with each other in novel ways. These ideas are explored in multi-agent simulation environments, but AutoGPT and other unconstrained agents currently operate in single player mode. Messaging could introduce the possibility of more complex relationships between agents with different directives, such as student-coach or competitive peer-peer. This would require a persistence layer for agents, the ability for agents to query all other agents, and a messaging layer, potentially with a discriminator to rank messages by importance that are received between each iteration of the agent (h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/nicktindle">@nicktindle</a> for this observation). 



 Better models. This is a must-have for the frequent gaps in logic the agent exhibits. We don’t quite get there with GPT-4—maybe the next generation of models? In addition, current autonomous agents are slow and expensive. Perhaps it is worth exploring fine-tuning on agent trajectories to make them faster, cheaper and effective for a subset of tasks. Toolformers remain underexplored but promising. 
 



<p>If there is one takeaway from all of this, agents’ reasoning ability is pretty good but their action-taking aspect is still pretty rudimentary. In research, agents largely run in constrained environments with limited abilities to act, like toddlers playing with toy cars in a sandbox. With autonomous commercial agents, we are seeing the first experimental attempts to have agents run in the wild unconstrained. We are giving these toddlers actual cars, so to speak. This is exciting and unprecedented, and would represent a zero-to-one improvement in agents once they work reliably. However, these toddlers don’t know how to drive and are currently crashing into most obstacles that come their way. Do we replace the cars with Tonkas or do we hope that the toddlers grow up? I have made some suggestions on the toy car side in the hopes of making some surprisingly competent toddlers, but if we want truly working autonomous agents, we also need to wait for better models.</p>

<p>Tokenisation and real estate are a match made in heaven. Thus, it is important to understand what goes into tokenising real estate before embarking on your tokenisation journey. In this article, we will discuss how to tokenise real estate, in addition to all the things you need to consider when tokenising real estate, as well as the possible challenges that are out there when it comes to tokenising real estate! Let’s first start with a brief introduction to the process of tokenisation.</p>



 Key takeaways  



 
 Tokenising real estate consists of 3 main steps, namely the pre-tokenisation, tokenisation, and post-tokenisation step. 



 The pre-tokenisation step consists of formalising the value of the asset, verifying ownership, establishing property management and maintenance processes, establishing various legal requirements, and researching regulatory requirements. 



 The tokenisation step consists of selecting the right blockchain, determining the token standard, determining the token structure, setting up the legal framework, selecting the right platform for tokenisation, minting the tokens, and integrating off-chain data. 



 The post-tokenisation step consists of selling the tokens, managing the property, monitoring the regulatory environment, and providing investor updates. 



 The tokenisation of real estate comes with many legal and regulatory considerations and technical challenges. 



 The tokenisation of real estate opens up many new opportunities such as new ways of funding, fractional ownership, unlocking liquidity, new investment avenues, and more. 
 



 Brief intro to the tokenisation process 



<p>Tokenisation is the process of creating a (blockchain-enabled) digital twin of a real world asset. This process has gained significant attention in recent times, as it allows for the fractional ownership and trading of assets that were previously illiquid, such as real estate, art, or even intellectual property. As explained more in-depth in our “<a href="https://zaisan.io/tokenisation-real-world-assets-explained/">tokenisation of real world assets explained</a>” article, the process of tokenisation can be broken down into three main steps: pre-tokenisation, tokenisation, and post-tokenisation.</p>



<p>The pre-tokenisation step involves formalising the value of the asset, verifying ownership, and ensuring the proper processes are in place for maintenance, management, and legal compliance. The tokenisation step involves creating a digital representation of the asset in the form of tokens and ensuring that all relevant information about the asset is accurately represented on the blockchain. Oracles are a common solution to enable the connection between traditional databases and the blockchain. Finally, the post-tokenisation step involves the perpetual management of both the physical asset and the tokens. This includes their distribution and sale through specialised marketplaces or offerings.</p>



<p>Tokenisation has numerous benefits for the real estate industry. Firstly, it allows for fractional ownership, which enables investors to purchase and trade smaller portions of a property. This creates opportunities for smaller investors to enter the market and diversify their portfolios with real estate assets. Tokenisation also provides liquidity to real estate assets, allowing investors to buy and sell their tokens on secondary markets. This means that investors can realise their returns without waiting for the property to be sold. Finally, tokenisation can provide increased transparency and traceability of ownership. Tracking each token on the blockchain reduces the potential for fraud and disputes.</p>



<p>However, it also comes with its own set of challenges, including regulatory compliance, data privacy, and the potential for fraudulent activities. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the risks and benefits associated with tokenising a particular asset before embarking on the process. We will discuss the potential challenges more in-depth later in this article. Let’s first take a more in-depth look at what you need to consider when tokenising real estate.</p>



Watch it<a href="https://zaisan.webinargeek.com/tokenising-rwa-on-demand"> here</a> 



 What to consider when tokenising real estate  



<p>Tokenising real estate is a complex process that requires careful consideration of various aspects. So before delving into the actual tokenisation process, let’s take a look at the following essential aspects to consider when tokenising real estate:</p>



 
 Regulatory compliance  



 Legal structure  



 Fractionalisation  



 Alternative financing options  



 Liquidity &amp; trading  
 



 Regulatory compliance  



<p>Let’s start with regulatory compliance. One of the key regulatory requirements to consider when tokenising real estate is compliance with securities laws. Most jurisdictions consider the tokenisation of real estate as a security offering and subject it to the same regulatory requirements as traditional securities offerings. This also includes complying with securities laws related to registration, disclosure, and anti-fraud measures.</p>



<p>Additionally, anti-money laundering (AML) laws and regulations must be carefully considered and complied with when tokenising real estate. This is particularly important when dealing with cross-border transactions, as different countries have different AML regulations and requirements. Ensuring a clear definition of the ownership of the real estate is crucial.  Also, there should be proper legal agreements in place to govern the rights and obligations of all parties involved.</p>



<p>Moreover, it is important to note that the regulatory framework for tokenisation of real estate is still developing. The legal requirements can vary widely depending on the country or region in question. Therefore, one should seek legal advice and guidance to ensure that they meet all legal and regulatory requirements. Additionally, as the regulatory framework develops it is important to monitor any changes to prevent non-compliance with new regulations.</p>



<p>Lastly, while it is a key aspect to consider when tokenising real estate, regulatory complexity can be reduced by offering the tokenised real estate in smaller and more specific regions, as well as by tokenising real estate in jurisdictions which have more clear regulations surrounding tokenising real estate.</p>



 Legal structure  



<p>Another important aspect to consider when tokenising real estate is the legal structure. While the legal structure for tokenising retail and residential buildings is relatively similar, it is necessary to take into account the ownership structure and protection of underlying assets. This entails selecting the appropriate legal entity for holding the real estate. Namely, a limited liability company (LLC) or a real estate investment trust (REIT), defining ownership rights and obligations, as well as setting up appropriate governance structures and auditing measures.</p>



<p>In addition to selecting the right legal entity for holding the real estate, it is also crucial to establish ownership agreements that clearly define the rights and obligations of all parties involved in the tokenisation process. This includes establishing clear rules for how the real estate will be managed, maintained, and potentially sold in the future. It is important to consult with legal and financial experts to ensure that the ownership agreements are comprehensive and cover all necessary aspects of the tokenisation process.</p>



 Fractionalisation 



<p>As mentioned in our previous article about tokenising real world assets, fractionalisation of real estate through tokenisation allows for more flexible ownership structures. This makes it more appealing to a wider range of investors. It also enables investors to purchase smaller portions of an asset, making real estate investments accessible to those who may not have the capital to purchase an entire property.</p>



<p>However, it is important to also consider the potential downside of fractionalisation, as it can lead to the fragmentation of ownership. As more investors become involved in the ownership of the asset, it becomes increasingly difficult to reach consensus on decisions related to the asset. This can result in conflicts between token holders, which can ultimately impact the value of the asset. Therefore, it is crucial to have a clear governance structure in place to manage decision-making and conflict resolution among token holders.</p>



<p>Lastly, it is essential to ensure that the real estate asset being tokenised is properly evaluated and accurately reflected in the tokenised value. This includes conducting a thorough assessment of the property’s physical condition, location, and market value. Accurately evaluating the property can help prevent overvaluation or undervaluation of the asset. Consequently,  which can have negative implications for both the issuer and investors.</p>



 Alternative financing options  



<p>As more investors are able to invest in real estate projects through tokenisation, it can provide alternative financing options for projects that may not have been possible before. Tokenisation can open up access to a broader range of investors. Including those who may not have been able to invest in traditional real estate investments. This can provide more flexibility for project financing. Furthermore, it may lead to increased competition for funding, potentially lowering the cost of capital for real estate projects.</p>



<p>However, it is important to carefully consider the potential impact on the financial structure of the real estate asset. Tokenisation can lead to changes in ownership rights, cash flow distribution, and financing arrangements. It is important to evaluate the potential risks and benefits of tokenisation to ensure that it aligns with the project’s financing goals and objectives. Additionally, it is also important to ensure that token holders have a clear understanding of the financial structure of the asset. This includes any potential risks, limitations, and liabilities associated with token ownership. Proper due diligence and risk assessment should be conducted to ensure that the tokenisation of real estate projects is done in a responsible and effective manner.</p>



 Liquidity &amp; trading  



<p>The final aspect to consider is the liquidity and trading aspect of tokenising real estate. As also discussed in some of the other aspects of tokenising real estate, tokenisation has the potential to increase the liquidity of real estate assets. It allows for the creation of digital assets that can be traded quickly and efficiently. This can be beneficial for investors who are looking for an easy way to exit their investments. However, it is important to consider the potential impact on the trading of the real estate asset. For instance, tokenisation can result in changes to the underlying value of the asset, market demand, and price volatility.</p>



<p>One of the advantages of tokenisation is that it allows for the creation of smoother secondary markets, which can increase liquidity and trading volume. This can also benefit investors who are looking to sell their tokens and exit their investments quickly. However, it is important to ensure that there is adequate market demand for the tokenised asset. The market cannot be too illiquid. Investors should also consider the potential risks associated with market volatility. The value of the tokenised asset can fluctuate rapidly in response to changes in market conditions. Therefore, it is crucial to have a well-defined exit strategy in place that takes into account these potential risks and benefits of tokenisation.</p>







<p>All in all, tokenising real estate requires careful consideration of various aspects such as regulatory compliance, the legal structure, fractionalisation, alternative financing options, and liquidity and trading. By addressing these key considerations, tokenisation can offer significant benefits for both investors and issuers. However, before embarking on a tokenisation project it is crucial to do a thorough assessment of the potential risks and benefits involved.</p>



 How to tokenise real estate 



<p>Now you are aware of the things you need to consider when tokenising real estate. Let’s take a deeper look at the exact steps involved in every stage of tokenising real estate.</p>



 Pre-tokenisation steps for real estate  



 
 Formalising the value of the real estate asset 



 Verifying ownership of the real estate asset 



 Ensuring the right processes are in place for maintenance and management of the property 



 Establishing legal requirements for liquidations, dispute resolutions, and enforcement 



 Review of the regulatory requirements 
 



<p>During the pre-tokenisation step there are various things to do in the real, non-digital, world before the asset can get tokenised. One of these steps is formalising the value of the real estate. This involves assessing the value of the property based on various factors such as location, size, condition, and potential for income or appreciation. Valuation is typically done by a licensed appraiser who provides an appraisal report that outlines the value of the property. Determining the value of the tokens that will be created and sold on the blockchain is crucial at this step.</p>



<p>The verification of ownership is also critical in the pre-tokenisation process for real estate assets. This involves conducting title searches, surveys, and reviewing legal documentation to ensure that the person or entity claiming ownership of the property has a legitimate claim to it. This step helps to avoid disputes over ownership of the asset in the future.</p>



<p>In addition to verifying ownership, it is important to have processes in place for the maintenance and management of the physical property. This includes tasks such as property management, repairs, and maintenance of the property. Establishing a maintenance plan and budget is crucial to ensuring that the physical asset remains in good condition and retains its value over time. Furthermore, in this stage, it is also important to establish how the property can be used.</p>



<p>Another part of this step is establishing the legal requirements for liquidations, dispute resolutions, and rule enforcement. Establishing these is a prerequisite for tokenisation to occur. This includes creating contracts, deeds, and insurance policies that cover the ownership and use of the property. Having these legal requirements in place helps to mitigate risk and provides a framework for addressing any disputes or issues that may arise during or after the tokenisation process.</p>



<p>Lastly, it is important to do a careful analysis of the regulatory requirements before you start the tokenisation process. This analysis should look at the regulatory requirements for tokenising real estate, as well as the regulatory requirements for offering tokenised assets in the specific jurisdiction(s) in which you plan on tokenising the property as well as the specific jurisdiction(s) in which you plan on distributing the tokenised asset.</p>



 Tokenisation steps for real estate  



 
 Selecting the right blockchain for the tokenisation 



 Identify the type of token standard that will be used 



 Determine the token structure 



 Prepare the legal framework for the issuance of the tokens 



 Choose a platform to use for the tokenisation 



 Minting the tokens 



 Ensure all relevant information about the asset is represented on-chain 
 



<p>After all pre-tokenisation steps are completed you can move on to the actual tokenisation. The tokenisation process for real estate starts with selecting a blockchain on which you will tokenise your asset. This part is critical, as it determines the type of token standards, marketplaces, and technical abilities at your disposal. It is important to research these areas and make an informed decision about the blockchain you plan to use for the tokenisation process.</p>



<p>Once you have found a blockchain that matches your needs, you can select the specific token standard that you will use for your token. The token standard determines whether a token is fungible or non-fungible.  Also, what kind of other properties it has, or can have. Generally speaking, a common token standard such as the commonly used ERC-20 token standard on Ethereum can be used for this. But with various purpose-built real estate token standards on the rise on various protocols, it’s worth keeping an eye out for more specific token standards that better suit the needs of tokenised real estate.</p>



<p>Determining the token structure follows the selection of the token standard. This refers to the number of tokens to be issued and their value. This is based on the value of the underlying real estate asset. Then, the legal framework for the issuance of the tokens is prepared, including documentation of ownership and the legal rights associated with the tokens.</p>



<p>The next crucial decision is to choose a suitable platform for the tokenisation process. In order to ensure that the chosen platform aligns with the requirements of the real estate asset being tokenised, one must carefully consider factors such as scalability, security, and cost. And while offering the tokens on a marketplace is typically part of the post-tokenisation process, it is worth noting that certain marketplaces offer an integrated tokenisation solution. These platforms provide the ability to carry out the tokenisation process and mint the tokens directly on their marketplace. This is a more streamlined approach that can make everything more efficient by eliminating the need for separate token minting procedures.</p>



<p>However, if the chosen marketplace or platform does not have built-in token minting capabilities, alternative options are available. In this case, you can either mint the tokens independently or collaborate with a technology partner. Regardless of the decisions in this part of the tokenisation step, it is important to ensure your tokens are ready for sale and/or distribution before the post-tokenisation step.</p>



<p>Lastly, in order to ensure that all relevant information about the asset is accurately represented on the blockchain, including the property’s location, size, ownership, and legal rights associated with the tokens, it is essential to utilise oracles to integrate relevant off-chain data with the blockchain. These oracles collect data from traditional databases and broadcast it to the blockchain. Information that would have to get updated regularly would be any information regarding expenses and (rental) income, maintenance and repairs, etc. Another option for managing this information would be pointing to a regular database from the blockchain. Although, generally speaking, the use of oracles to put this off-chain information on-chain is preferred. It is more transparent and prevents the loss of data in case anything happens with the regular database.</p>



 Post-tokenisation steps for real estate  



 
 Distribute/sell the tokenised assets through specialised marketplaces or offerings 



 Perpetual management of the property and the tokens based on the rules previously set 



 Continuous monitoring of the regulatory environment 



 Providing ongoing investor updates 
 



<p>Once someone creates tokenised real estate assets, the next step is to distribute or sell them through specialised marketplaces or offerings. These marketplaces typically enable buyers to access assets either directly from the seller or through a secondary market. Additionally, these marketplaces can provide investors with an opportunity to invest in a diversified portfolio of real estate assets, which can be particularly attractive for those who do not have the financial resources to purchase an entire property, or want easier access to foreign real estate.</p>



<p>Once the tokenised real estate asset has been sold/distributed (or is being sold/distributed), the perpetual management of both the physical asset and the tokens is key. This includes managing things such as repairs, insurance, leasing, etc. of the physical property, as well as the ongoing management of information about the token on-chain. The perpetual management of the physical asset may involve hiring a property manager to handle day-to-day operations such as maintenance and leasing. Meanwhile, the management of the tokens may require the ongoing monitoring of the blockchain platform used for the tokenisation to ensure that the tokens continue to function properly and that all relevant information is accurately represented.</p>



<p>In this part of the tokenisation process it is also important to continuously monitor the regulatory environment to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Changes in laws and regulations could impact the ability to distribute or sell the tokenised assets, as well as the ongoing management of the asset.</p>



<p>Finally, providing ongoing investor updates is crucial for maintaining investor confidence and trust. This could include regular financial reporting, updates on property management activities, and other relevant information. Communication with investors can also help to build relationships and foster a sense of community among token holders.</p>







 The challenges of tokenising real estate  



<p>While there are clear benefits to tokenising real estate, there is also a multitude of challenges that need to be considered in order to prevent issues down the line. These challenges can be summarised as follows:</p>



 
 Legal complexity  



 Technical challenges  



 Adoption and education  
 



 Legal complexity  



<p>The legal complexity of tokenising real estate is one of the biggest challenges in this field. There are many legal and regulatory hurdles that need to be overcome before a property can be tokenised. In particular, the ownership and transfer of real estate is subject to a variety of laws and regulations that can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Creating a standardised tokenisation process that can be applied globally can be difficult due to this.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the legal framework for tokenisation is still in its infancy. This means that there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the legality of the process in many countries. This can create significant barriers to adoption. Investors and issuers alike may be hesitant to get involved with a technology that is not yet fully understood from a legal perspective.</p>



<p>Another legal challenge associated with tokenising real estate is the issue of cross-border transactions. Securities laws and regulations differ significantly across different jurisdictions, which can create difficulties when selling security tokens across borders. In particular, issuers and investors may need to comply with complex rules around cross-border offerings and sales, which can be a significant barrier to entry for smaller investors.</p>



<p>Additionally, different countries may have different rules around the transfer of real estate, which can further complicate the legal picture. As a result, it is important to carefully consider which jurisdictions to target when offering tokenised real estate.</p>



 Technical challenges  



<p>Tokenising real estate also brings technical challenges. It requires a secure and scalable blockchain infrastructure capable of handling large transactions of high value assets. The blockchain platform must ensure that the tokens can be easily traded, while also providing transparency and security for investors. While most modern blockchains are perfectly capable of these tasks, it is also important that the marketplaces on top of these blockchains have the required capabilities, such as the ability to oversee the perpetual management of the physical property and the tokens, managing the distribution of profits, the opportunity to resolve disputes, and more. While more and more marketplaces and platforms with these capabilities are being developed, it is important to tackle this challenge by monitoring what is out there and bringing technically proficient members or partners on board to assist you with the process in the meantime.</p>



<p>Another technical challenge is the integration of off-chain information with the blockchain. As discussed earlier, tokenising real estate requires the sharing of various off-chain information, including property valuations, surveys, and legal documentation. Either through oracles or other mechanisms, the information must be accurately represented on the blockchain. Ensuring the accuracy of this information is critical to the functioning of the tokens and the transparency of the investment. Moreover, the integration of off-chain information with the blockchain raises additional technical challenges, such as data privacy and security, which also vary per jurisdiction.</p>



 Adoption and education challenges  



<p>Another challenge of tokenising real estate is the need for education and adoption. Tokenisation is a relatively new concept with many investors being unfamiliar with the benefits and risks associated with this type of investment. In this stage, education is crucial to ensure that investors understand the technology, the risks and opportunities involved, as well as the legal and regulatory framework. Moreover, real estate professionals, such as property managers and developers, will also need to be educated about tokenisation and how it can benefit their businesses.</p>



<p>Adoption of tokenisation may also face difficulties due to the conservative nature of the real estate industry. Real estate has traditionally been a relatively stable and conservative investment. Many investors and professionals may be hesitant to adopt new technologies or investment structures. Convincing these individuals and professionals of the benefits of tokenisation, as well as assisting them with actually tokenising their real estate, will require significant effort and time.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>In conclusion, tokenising real estate opens up many new opportunities such as new ways of funding, fractional ownership, unlocking liquidity, new investment avenues, and more. However, it is crucial to carefully consider the complex legal landscape and to address the various considerations in order to ensure a successful tokenisation process.</p>



<p>Working with a <a href="https://zaisan.io/services/tokenisation/">knowledgeable tokenisation partner</a> can prove invaluable in navigating these challenges, providing expert guidance on both the technical and legal aspects of the tokenisation process. All in all, tokenising real estate can be a complex, yet very rewarding process if done correctly.</p>

<p>This is the 25th post in an <a>ongoing, series</a> describing new privacy features in Brave browsers. This post describes work done by Staff Engineer Aleksey Khoroshilov and was written by VP of Privacy Engineering Peter Snyder.</p>
<p>Most Web browsers are finally getting serious about limiting third-party tracking on the Web and—while no browser is as aggressive as Brave—third-party trackers are taking notice of the trend. In response, third-parties are increasingly relying on first-party storage to continue tracking users. Forgetful Browsing is the first in a series of upcoming tools Brave has planned to continue protecting Brave users and address first-party reidentification.</p>
<p>Starting with desktop version 1.53, and Android version 1.54 <a>1</a>, Brave browsers will include a new feature called “Forgetful Browsing,” which allows users to always clear cookies and other storage when the site is closed. Forgetful Browsing can help you:</p>
 
 Be automatically logged out of a site when it’s closed 
 Avoid being rate limited by a site (e.g., “you have X remaining articles to view”) 
 Generally prevent sites from reidentifying you across visits 
 
<p>Forgetful Browsing is similar to, but more powerful and protective than, popular browsing extensions and private browsing modes. It’s another example of Brave offering the most powerful privacy features of any popular browser.</p>

 The Web has the wrong defaults for privacy 
<p>Many privacy problems on the Web have a common root cause: by default, browsers let sites reidentify users indefinitely, but users only benefit from reidentification on a fraction of sites they visit.</p>
<p>In some cases, it’s very useful for a site to remember you (e.g. so you don’t have to log back into your email every day, or so you can easily use a social media account). But such sites are the exception, not the rule. Most often, you won’t benefit from being remembered by every news site you read an article on, or every shopping site you briefly browsed, or every image hosting site that showed you a cute cat picture.</p>
<p>In this way, all Web browsers get the defaults backwards: they assume you want to be identifiable by every site you visit. And this causes both annoyance (e.g. rate limiting or paywalls) and privacy harm (e.g. being profiled by untrustworthy sites). This problem is called “unwanted first-party reidentification.”</p>
<p>The Forgetful Browsing feature—the next step in Brave’s ongoing project to improve how browsers manage first-party storage—addresses the reidentification problem head-on.</p>

 Browsers lack good protections against unwanted first-party reidentification 
<p>Browsers are getting better at protecting users against third-party tracking, but generally do a poor job of protecting against unwanted first-party identification. Brave already provides <a href="https://privacytests.org/">best-in-class protections against third-party tracking</a>; Forgetful Browsing is one of several upcoming features in Brave that will provide similarly robust protections against first-party tracking.</p>
<p>Browsers provide some tools to help users prevent unwanted first-party reidentification, but these tools are clumsy, inconvenient, and scoped either too broadly or too narrowly, all of which invite unwanted–and irreversible–reidentification.</p>
<p>Consider this scenario: Khen has two email accounts, <code>dolphinfan4ever@example.com</code> and <code>serious.guy@example.com</code>, both of which Khen accesses through his Web browser. Khen doesn’t want the email provider to know both accounts are owned by the same person. Unfortunately, Web browsers make this kind of privacy very difficult.</p>
<p>This is because of how browsers manage first-party storage. Browsers prevent sites from reading another site’s cookies (e.g. yahoo.com can’t read your login cookies for outlook.com), but browsers generally don’t restrict how the same site can read cookies across visits (if you visited chicagotribune.com yesterday, the site can re-read the same cookies next time you visit). Even when you tell a site to log you out, it can’t easily clear some kinds of first-party storage <a>2</a>. This gives even well meaning sites the ability to reidentify users across visits. Worse, browsers provide few protections against sites that intentionally aim to re-identify you across logins (as in Khen’s situation in the previous paragraph).</p>
<p>Browsers provide some tools you can use to be certain there are no identifying values persisting across site visits. Unfortunately, these tools are difficult to use and/or require user perfection; in many cases a single error can allow a tracker to permanently, irreversibly link to different accounts together.</p>
 
 
<p>Private browsing modes: Allow users to visit a site with a clean storage area, but require perfection to prevent unwanted first-party reidentification. If Khen (from the previous example) forgets to use a private window just once, and mistakenly logs into his second email account in a normal window, the email provider will be able to link the two email accounts, indefinitely and irreversibly.</p>
 
 
<p>Browser extensions: Can clear first-party storage whenever a user closes a site, but extensions are limited in their ability to clear cached values, or values in nested documents.</p>
 
 
<p>Clear all storage: Most browsers contain a feature like this, which clears first-party storage for all sites when closing the browser. However, this feature is, for most users, very inconvenient, since it will log a user out of all their sites, even those the user trusts and wants to stay authenticated with. The feature also does not provide much help for people who tend to leave their browser open for long periods of time. This feature is a sledgehammer when what’s needed is a scalpel.</p>
 
 
<p>Advanced site controls: Some browsers include this feature, which advanced users can use to manually clear, or otherwise micro-manage first-party storage for sites. These features are useful, but can be (depending on the browser) difficult to discover, need perfect use to prevent identification, or otherwise can be unsuitable for non-advanced users.</p>
 
 

 Forgetful Browsing prevents unwanted first-party reidentification 
<p>Forgetful Browsing, by contrast, allows Brave users to easily prevent unwanted first-party reidentification, in a way that’s convenient and does not require constant vigilance to get right. Using <a>Brave Shields</a>, users can indicate that they want to be forgotten when a site is closed. When this option is set, Brave will clear first-party storage for the site a few seconds after there are no more open tabs for the site. Forgetful Browsing clears both explicitly stored values (e.g. cookies, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage">localStorage</a>, or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API">indexedDB</a>) and indirectly stored values (e.g. HTTP cache or DNS cache).</p>
<p>Users can enable Forgetful Browsing in one of two ways.</p>

 Set Forgetful Browsing for a single site 
<p>Users can indicate that a specific site should be forgotten when it’s closed. To do so:</p>
 
 Navigate to the site. 
 Click the shields icon in the URL bar. 
 Click Advanced controls. 
 Click Forget me when I close this site. 
 



    


    



 Set Forgetful Browsing as a global default 
<p>Users can also make Forgetful Browsing the default setting for all sites. To do so:</p>
 
 Visit <code>brave://settings/shields</code> from the Brave browser. 
 Click Forget me when I close a site. 
 



    


    


<p>Note that users can set this as the global default, and then use the steps outlined above (in the “Set Forgetful Browsing for a single site” section of this post) to create exceptions (i.e. to indicate that particular sites should not be forgotten). This allows you to configure Brave to clear storage everytime a site is closed except for your email site, a social media site you log into often, etc.</p>

 Forgetful Browsing applies to entire sites, not domains 
<p>Forgetful Browsing differs from other settings in Brave Shields in its scope. Most settings in Brave Shields are set per domain; Forgetful Browsing, meanwhile, is set per site. For example, you can configure first.site.example to use aggressive fingerprinting protections and second.site.example to use standard fingerprinting protections, but all subdomains on site.example will share the same Forgetful Browsing setting. This is necessary to align the Forgetful Browsing setting with how Brave (and most other browsers) enforce storage boundaries.</p>

 More coming to prevent unwanted first-party reidentification 
<p>Forgetful Browsing is one of several existing ways Brave protects against unwanted first-party reidentification on the Web. Brave’s <a>Unlinkable Bouncing</a> feature automatically clears first-party storage whenever the browser is bounced through known tracking domains. And Brave’s <a>CNAME uncloaking</a> feature allows Brave to block trackers even when they try to look like first-party resources. Brave also limits the lifetime of cookies set in JavaScript to seven days to prevent some forms of first-party tracking.</p>
<p>Forgetful Browsing is the first of several upcoming features related to further managing and improving privacy around first-party storage on the Web. Together, these features will address a range of ways first-party storage can be abused to harm users. We look forward to sharing more about these features in the coming weeks and months.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Brave will incrementally enable Forgetful Browsing for users during the 1.53 and 1.54 release processes. Users who want to test the feature now can visit <code>brave://flags</code> and manually enable the “Enable First Party Storage Cleanup support” flag. Note that Forgetful Browsing is still experimental, and should only be enabled by users who understand the risks of enabling such features.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>
 
 
<p>HTTP cached values, storage for embedded third-party iframes (in browsers other than Brave), etc.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

 🛠️ Builder resources: *New* talks from our 2023 Crypto Startup School, now available! <p>The next generation of startups isn’t just advancing web3; it’s laying the groundwork for a more open, decentralized internet. But the industry know-how, shifting trends, and emerging tools in the space can be difficult for builders to navigate — whether they’re new to crypto, coming from other domains, or are more seasoned founders. That’s why we started Crypto Startup School in 2020, and recently relaunched it with a new cohort: to connect builders with the resources, expertise, and networks they need. </p><p>Over the past ten weeks (and counting), we’ve covered topics like go-to-market, community, product-market fit, technical &amp; research deep dives, policy, and much more. And now, we’re publicly sharing the curriculum with everyone, starting with 5 videos on: strategies for pricing; the basics of cryptography for blockchains; protocol design; the big picture; and lessons learned in strategy, growth, &amp; operations in the business of open source (with Uniswap Labs). We’ll continue to share 25+ more talks through near-weekly “drops”, so be sure to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@a16zcrypto">subscribe to our channel</a> for updates. <br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjQ9HCQMu_8ywq3VUso7i_-TOx6RKXQeQ">watch the first batch of talks here</a><br>share: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1654512284335734784">on Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7060282013236277251/">on LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0x2d7531">on Farcaster</a> </p> 🔗🧩 Deep dive: On data availability sampling  <p>Data availability sampling — which is applicable to advances in computing, networking generally, and especially blockchains — helps ensure that all necessary blockchain data has been made available to nodes without straining the network. It is therefore important for scaling blockchains.</p><p>Data availability sampling also features heavily in “danksharding”, a series of planned upgrades to Ethereum; and also paves the way for more advanced blockchain networks and user applications (including future stateless clients). The next danksharding milestone is EIP-4844, the Ethereum upgrade known as “protodanksharding”, which is planned for later this year. [Both “danksharding” and “protodanksharding” were named to reference Ethereum Foundation researchers, Dankrad Feist and protolambda (now at OP Labs).]</p><p>a16z crypto researcher &amp; cryptographer Valeria Nikolaenko, with Stanford cryptography professor and a16z crypto research advisor Dan Boneh, survey how data availability in danksharding works. They also propose modifications to the underlying technique that may improve data recovery (e.g., requiring not 75% but 25% of shares to recover a block). Finally, both of them explain the concepts (and some of the math) involved in our latest podcast episode, hosted by a16z crypto’s Robert Hackett. </p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/an-overview-of-danksharding-and-a-proposal-for-improvement-of-das/">read their piece</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/lera_banda/status/1651665339363520513">share</a><br><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/podcast/data-availability-danksharding-web3-with-a16z-podcast/">listen to the discussion</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1654618547321208832">share</a></p><p>related readings:</p>  <p><a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/proto_danksharding_faq">FAQs on danksharding &amp; protodanksharding</a> - Vitalik Buterin</p>  <p><a href="https://grizzly-answer-991.notion.site/Proto-Danksharding-0b148da2c6a54ca5838716b481a5ead3">a technical analysis of protodanksharding</a> - Michael/ grizzly-answer-991<br></p>  <p>see/ hear also:</p>  <p>📖 read about why the major Ethereum upgrade <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/content/article/what-the-merge-means/">The Merge</a> (2022) mattered - by Ali Yahya</p>  <p>🎧 listen to “<a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/ethereum-the-merge-pos-security-decentralization-process-community-people">Ethereum, the Merge and beyond</a>” - with Tim Beiko, Tim Roughgarden, Ali Yahya, and Sonal Chokshi</p><p></p>  <p><a href="https://api.a16zcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/a16z-crypto_HMT-crypto-consultation-response-April-2023-.pdf">👑🔓🌐</a></p><p>--Sonal Chokshi, Stephanie Zinn, Tim Sullivan, Robert Hackett / a16z crypto  <br></p><p>You’re receiving this newsletter because you signed up for it on our websites, at an event, or elsewhere (you can opt out any time using the ‘unsubscribe’ link below).

A <a href="https://github.com/verida/blockchain-contracts">collection of smart contracts</a>, deployed on Polygon, that decentralize the critical components of identity, discoverability and network infrastructure for the Verida&nbsp;network.  An incredibly powerful <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/client-sdk/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incentivizedtestnet">client SDK library for developers</a> that enables web, mobile and server applications to leverage identities and self-sovereign storage on the Verida&nbsp;network.

A <a href="https://news.verida.io/announcing-the-verida-credentials-incubator-the-inspiring-first-projects-coming-to-market-9ad8f1856e6b">credentials incubator program</a>, launched almost twelve months ago, and now helping multiple projects bring their credentials ecosystems to&nbsp;market.  <p>We are now preparing for our mainnet, so it’s time to reward our community members for helping put the Verida testnet through its&nbsp;paces.</p> Bringing the Verida testnet to&nbsp;you <p>The incentivized testnet will rollout over several phases, each with their own campaigns. Our first phase will be focusing on end users, allowing them to install the <a href="http://www.verida.io/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incentivizedtestnet&amp;utm_content=install">Verida Wallet</a> and progress through different campaigns designed to battle test the Verida&nbsp;network.</p><p>In future phases, the team will work closely with storage node operators and application developers to further decentralize the <a href="https://www.verida.network/">Verida network</a> and build a world leading onboarding experience for web3 builders.</p> Why participate in the Verida incentivized testnet? <p>Verida’s mainnet launch is slated for mid 2023. In the leadup, the team plans to accelerate growth to onboard users, application developers and node providers onto the network. Early participants who contribute to the incentivized testnet will be rewarded with Verida’s native protocol token, VDA — redeemable for mainnet tokens upon&nbsp;launch.</p><p>More than 60% of the Verida token supply is dedicated to rewarding ecosystem participants for supporting the network rollout. A portion of this token supply will be set aside for the incentivized testnet.</p> What can you&nbsp;do? <p>As a user during the incentivized testnet, you can explore the many features of the Verida network and applications. You will create decentralized identities, reclaim your personal data stored in centralized platforms and unlock early access to new applications. You will download the <a href="https://www.verida.io/">Verida Wallet</a> and experiment with the decentralized social platform, <a href="https://www.verida.one/">Verida&nbsp;One.</a></p><p>We will provide more details over the coming weeks as each campaign is announced.</p> What is the VDA&nbsp;token? <p>The native token of the Verida network (VDA) creates a data economy enabling secure interactions between accounts to facilitate secure data storage, trusted sharing, fast querying and secure messaging.</p><p>The Verida network is a self-sovereign “user-pays” model, whereby users pay for their own storage needs. In this way, “access to user data” is not the product, rather the product is the “security and protection” of user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Storage node operators must stake VDA tokens in order for their nodes to be discoverable on the network and be available for selection by end&nbsp;users.</p><p>The Verida token plays an important role in bootstrapping the network by incentivizing and rewarding users for connecting their identities and data, while rewarding storage node operators for providing storage infrastructure to end&nbsp;users.</p>The Verida Data&nbsp;Economy<p>VDA has a fixed total supply of 1 billion tokens. Creating a native token allows for the design of economic incentives in the Verida network that provides control over the setting of monetary policy and equitable rewards for all network participants.</p> How can you participate? <p>Every individual has personal data to reclaim. Verida’s infrastructure will impact millions of lives. For this reason, we should all have a say. The incentivized testnet is open to everyone and all, interested in privacy-focused data management on&nbsp;web3.</p><p>More information will be posted on our blog in the following weeks as the Verida team prepares to launch the first user campaign. <a href="http://www.verida.io/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=incentivizedtestnet&amp;utm_content=subscribe">Subscribe to receive updates</a> and <a href="http://discord.verida.io">join our self-sovereign community</a> today.</p><p>This is an opportunity to contribute to a solution expected to change the nature of data on the internet.

We had live music at the event, featured an interactive photo booth, and it was a great opportunity for Consensus attendees to network and unwind, during a busy event week, welcoming over 300 attendees throughout the evening!</p>     
 

 
         
		    	
		 
	
    
    	 

 
         
		    	
		 
	
    
    	 
	 
	    			 
		             
                                                         
                        
 
         
		    	
		 
	
    
    	 
                     
                             
                         
                                                         
                        
 
         
		    	
		 
	
    
    	 
                     
                             
            	     
	 
		 
	    			 
		             
                                                         
                        
 
         
		    	
		 
	
    
    	 
                     
                             
                         
                                                         
                        
 
         
		    	
		 
	
    
    	 
                     
                             
            	     
	 
		 
	    			 
		             
                                                         
                        
 
         
		    	
		 
	
    
    	 
                     
                             
                         
                                                         
                        
 
         
		    	
		 
	
    
    	 
                     
                             
            	     
	 
	
 
         
     <br>Final Thoughts 
<p>Consensus was a great opportunity for the team to catch up with our community, learn more about what the latest in Web3 was, meet our new ecosystem partners, and more. We look forward to seeing everyone again next year. </p>

<p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>Just like every month, it’s time for a monthly update. As we start May at full speed, let's take a moment to recap April’s developments!</p> Tech updates  v0.5 updates PIP-13 succeeded!<p>Earlier this month, a series of updates and upgrades for v0.5 was presented by the Panther community. This elaborate proposal aimed to introduce updates to v0.5 needed for v1’s development and launch a new Advanced Staking round.</p><p>Formalizing this proposal, <a href="https://snapshot.org/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x0825de3b9289d3e04e8f9f3607d1145923f482104fecabc9d02634b3f7d6f521">PIP-13</a> succeeded with an overwhelming majority vote on our Snapshot page. Among other things, this meant that the community decided on:</p>  Prolonging the "Advanced Staking" program, conserving the original staking APR, until Aug 22, 2023  Implementing UI upgrades, effectively elevating v0.5 to Panther Protocol’s v0.5.3.  <p>After the vote, the proposal was successfully executed. With all contracts deployed by Panther community members, this is officially our third decentralized deployment to date!</p> v1 updates  Testing for v1 <p>We keep working on Panther's v1 mechanism to issue rewards, with complex mathematical models running to test this. Work on rewards and fees is now unblocked due to advancements in Shielded Pools' development and the deployment of v0.5.3, a significant step forward.</p><p>General product testing for v1 is also progressing according to plan. This month witnessed the internal release of the first prototype for the full product. Exciting times are near as we polish and prepare to develop it towards Testnet!</p>Get ready for v1! Diving into zSwap and DeFi Adaptors Panther will enable private DEX swaps with zSwap.<p>We also just published an article featuring an <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zswap-and-defi-adaptors-unlocking-private-defi-usage/">in-depth look at zSwap &amp; DeFi Adaptors</a>.</p><p>Discover how this concept will link Panther with leading DeFi dApps like <a href="https://twitter.com/Uniswap?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Uniswap</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/QuickswapDEX?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">QuickswapDEX</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/CurveFinance?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Curve Finance</a>, enabling seamless &amp; private swaps on DEXs. The article also explains how having DeFi Adaptors makes Panther’s privacy stronger.</p> Relayer integration <p>For v1, we are also progressing in the integration of relayers, an essential component of Panther’s privacy.</p><p>Relayers are responsible for forwarding transactions to the blockchain, thus acting as intermediaries between Panther’s privacy layer and the decentralized network. They can do so, for example, by paying for gas in users’ name. By integrating relayers, we aim to significantly increase privacy by obfuscating the origin of transactions, making it more difficult for third parties to trace and link them to specific users.</p><p>Another crucial aspect of our ongoing work is the exploration of gasless transactions. Gas fees are a well-known pain point for users in the blockchain ecosystem, often causing frustration due to their volatility and unpredictability. By evaluating gasless transactions, we hope to provide users with a more convenient and cost-effective way to interact with the Panther Protocol network.</p><p>Lastly, we are in the process of exploring Account Abstraction Paymaster logic. Account abstraction is a cutting-edge technique that aims to simplify the user experience by allowing smart contracts to pay gas fees on behalf of users. The Paymaster logic plays a crucial role in this process, as it is responsible for determining which transactions should be paid for and ensuring the appropriate gas fees are covered.</p> Panther’s PMONK zero-knowledge scheme makes its debut Last weekend, at the ETH Privacy event in Istanbul, Turkey, CTO and Chief Scientist Anish Mohammed presented a paper for PMONK, Panther’s original zk-SNARK scheme.<p>This presentation, which will be soon published on Youtube, represents a significant milestone in the history of our project. There is still quite some way to go before we can tell you more about PMONK’s applications, but right now seemed like a good time to share the excitement!</p> Documentation review, compliance work, and website continue to progress <p>Last but not least, our technical contributors are fact-checking and screening our improved documentation for it to go live.</p><p>Expect the site’s launch soon, as well as a first release of documentation followed by an ongoing process of updates and upgrades.</p><p>Finally, we continue engaging with industry leaders in the Web3 compliance realm to determine the best approach for Panther's solution. Stay tuned!</p> Ecosystem  Community-driven exchange listings Another mission successfully completed by the Panther DAO!<p>This month, our decentralized community reached a notable milestone as $ZKP was listed on <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther/status/1643557579900035072?s=20&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">MEXC Global</a> in a community-driven operation, enhancing our token’s accessibility in the crypto ecosystem.</p><p>Following this, Hotbit.io also took the initiative to list $ZKP, so we had two centralized exchange listings this month.</p> ZKPanthers NFT giveaway Cool cats.<p>Another notable event this was the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ZKPanthers?src=hashtag_click&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">#ZKPanthers</a> NFT giveaway organized by community merch providers <a href="https://twitter.com/SubvertedN?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Subverted Norms</a>!</p><p>Subverted Norms designed the beautiful artwork, minting only 25 tokens, giving away 15 of them, and listing the rest for sale at OpenSea.

  New Fellowship: How Sequoia is Supporting Open Source  <p>FastAPI creator Sebastián Ramírez is the first recipient of the Sequoia Open Source Fellowship.</p>   
	By Bogomil Balkansky and Lauren Reeder	 



Published May 4, 2023
  



 
<p>Open source is the lifeblood of software. Downloads of the most popular open source packages&nbsp;are measured in the trillions and <a href="https://www.sonatype.com/state-of-the-software-supply-chain/open-source-supply-demand-security?utm_campaign=pr&amp;utm_source=pressrelease&amp;utm_medium=organic">growing fast</a>, and most commercial software today features libraries and programs made better and more reliable by open source contributors around the world. At Sequoia, we have a long history of partnering with companies that pioneered the commercialization of open source software, such as MongoDB and Confluent, and the pace of our partnerships with open source companies&nbsp; is also on the rise, including Chainguard, Deno, dbt labs, Infracost and Temporal Technologies in recent years. But we also recognize that open source projects that don’t become businesses are still critical tools for our portfolio companies and the broader community.</p>



<p>Last year, we were fortunate enough to meet Sebastián Ramírez, creator of the wildly popular open source Python framework <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a>, which is used everywhere from Fortune Global 500 corporations such as BMW, American Express and Roche, to academia, to nonprofits such as NASA and the Red Cross. Sebastián was overflowing with ideas to improve on what he’d built—but because even the most beloved open source projects rarely pay the bills, he was forced to split his time between FastAPI and part-time work.</p>



<p>His situation inspired us to think about how we might support his work and that of other open source creators who give so much to the broader tech ecosystem. Today, we are thrilled to share that Sebastián is the first Sequoia Open Source Fellow.</p>



<p>Each year, we’ll invite a small number of leading open source contributors to this new fellowship program and will provide a stipend to cover their living expenses for 6 to 12 months, so they can dedicate themselves to their open source work full-time. They’ll also become members of the Sequoia community, connecting with and mentoring founders. (Sebastián recently helped us host the closing event for our seed-stage catalyst, <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/arc/">Arc</a>.) In short, we will support each other. We believe Sequoia can benefit greatly from fellows’ expertise to help us better understand the open source ecosystem, but there are no other strings attached. Our goal is to give Sebastián and builders like him the time and space to innovate, whatever that means for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We recently sat down with Sebastián to talk about FastAPI, his fellowship experience so far, and what’s next.</p>



 



<p>For those who aren’t familiar, what is FastAPI and why did you build it?</p>



<p>Sebastián: FastAPI makes life easier for developers working in applications in the cloud using Python, which is one of the most popular programming languages—it’s often used for machine learning, data science and AI. You can use FastAPI to take advantage of all the features of code editors, like auto completion and inline errors, while getting application best practices by default with simple code, all in one place, so you can be super efficient and still get the best possible quality and performance.</p>



<p>I was working on teams building data and machine learning products, and we kept seeing the same problems and mistakes. I tried every tool I could find, but nothing ticked all the boxes—so eventually, I decided to try to put all the things I liked about other frameworks into one project. I didn’t expect it to work, but it did! I released the first public version of FastAPI on December 24, 2018, two years after the version of Python that enabled FastAPI, and it’s been downloaded more than 800,000 times since. It was even used to <a href="https://twitter.com/benjamin_falk/status/1546947039363305472">share data</a> captured by the James Webb Space Telescope—that was a highlight.</p>



Data captured by the James Webb telescope was shared via FastAPI.



<p>Why did you decide this fellowship was right for you?</p>



<p>Sebastián: Ever since I started FastAPI, I’d been trying to optimize to work more on it and my other open source projects, like Typer and SQLModel. But because they were growing so quickly, it took a lot of time just to maintain them, and even more to improve them. I quit my job and worked part-time, but it still wasn’t enough. So doing open source exclusively was super appealing—not just the hours, but the continuity of those hours. I knew being able to focus deeply would drive a lot more progress.</p>



<p>I was also interested in learning about how businesses are built, because I think for FastAPI, a self-sustaining model will probably make sense at some point. It can help a lot of people and organizations be more efficient, and there’s value in that. But I wanted to focus first on just making it the best tool possible.</p>



<p>What has the experience been like so far?</p>



<p>Amazing. Honestly, I didn’t expect it to be this nice. We had calls before we started, and those were good. It was good on paper. But it’s been just as it was on those calls. We talk about companies and projects, but otherwise, I get to just work like crazy.</p>



<p>One thing that’s really valuable but less obvious is that I can focus on what I know will have the biggest impact, even if it’s invisible to most users—like the underlying building blocks of FastAPI, or even other open source projects it uses. I’ve even been working on improving the way internal code (reference) APIs are documented in Python itself recently, which is the kind of thing it’s usually very difficult to allocate time and resources for. But it will be super valuable, for FastAPI users and everyone else.</p>



<p>What are you most looking forward to—during the rest of your fellowship and beyond?</p>



<p>A bunch of things! The most obvious one is integration for the new version of <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/">Pydantic</a>, which is <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/partnering-with-pydantic-no-more-steel-seats-for-developers/">now</a> part of the Sequoia community, too. It’s going to mean a big boost in performance for FastAPI and the other tools, plus better support for edge cases. I’m also working on more documentation of FastAPI’s internal code—I have lots of tutorials, but there isn’t a dictionary-like code API reference, which is one of the things people request the most. And I’m making improvements to FastAPI itself, and to Typer, SQLModel, Asyncer, and others, which will simplify building the whole stack in FastAPI applications.</p>



<p>I’m also looking forward to continuing all the relationships I’ve built, including with you two! I was always scared of VCs. The idea of raising capital and building a company wasn’t super intuitive to me. But this has been a mindset shift—seeing that it can actually be good. We’re friends! It feels like, “Okay, this really can work.”</p>



 



<p>Consideration for the Sequoia Open Source Fellowship is by invitation only; we aim to support established creators and enable them to chart the paths of their projects as they continue to grow.

<p>Ethereum-style smart contracts meet encrypted execution in a single zkRollup.</p><p>At Aztec Labs, our mission has been driving toward an encrypted zkRollup supporting generalized private&nbsp;compute.</p><p>Today we’re excited to announce the end-game — an entirely new zkRollup with the samename that started it all:&nbsp;Aztec.</p><blockquote>Aztec is our vision for a trustless, scalable, and decentralized Layer 2 zkRollup enabling private smart contract execution.</blockquote><p>Imagine all the things you love about Ethereum smart contracts, plus the ability to protect your data with programmable anonymity, data privacy, and confidential contracts.</p><p>That’s it. That’s the&nbsp;pitch.</p><p>Ethereum, encrypted.</p><p>Aztec explodes the design space of what you can do on blockchains by allowing public-private composability, and today, we’re proud to announce the roadmap for delivering Aztec to&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>We are well on our way to completing basic contract deployment (Milestone 1.0), with significant progress across all components needed for a local developer environment.</p><p>Developers can expect a local testnet by the third quarter of 2023, and users and network stakeholders can expect to access a full-fledged public testnet by early&nbsp;2024.</p> Aztec: it’s not a&nbsp;zkEVM <p>Ethereum is, at its heart, a state machine. It takes a starting state, ingests transactions (sequenced into blocks), and transitions state deterministically.</p><p>Aztec takes the original promise of a global state machine and extends it to private&nbsp;state.</p><p>This hybrid public-private state machine processes both public and private execution of smart contract logic. Simultaneously, it no longer executes transactions like a conventional blockchain, instead proving the correctness of transactions that have already been computed.</p><p>In other words, Aztec is a zero-knowledge execution environment, but it’s not a&nbsp;zkEVM.</p><p>Why? Isn’t zkEVM the end-game?</p><p>In Aztec Labs’ search for private smart contract capability, we came to an early conclusion: privacy isn’t EVM compatible.</p><p>The beauty of rollups goes beyond mimicking Ethereum but extending its utility. Aztec is an opportunity to enshrine privacy at the base layer with the benefit of Ethereum’s security guarantees.</p><p>At the time of its invention, Ethereum traded privacy for public consensus. Trustless, private execution enabled by advanced zero knowledge cryptography had yet to be invented. After all, it wasn’t until 2018 that Zac Williamson and Ariel Gabizon published Plonk, the first zkSNARK that was practical for widespread use in blockchain applications.</p><p>But while public account-based blockchain models like Ethereum can’t support native privacy, UTXO-based privacy solutions can’t support the robust ecosystem of applications and tools that have been created for public smart contract platforms.</p><blockquote>That’s why Aztec is&nbsp;both.</blockquote><p>Aztec combines public and private execution into a single zkRollup, providing seamless composability across encrypted and unencrypted transactions. If Ethereum’s innovation was allowing read and write to public state, Aztec’s is the ability to read and write to both public and private&nbsp;state.</p><p>The combination of public and private into a single hybrid roll-up enables confidentiality and auditability:</p>  Private voting for public&nbsp;DAOs  Private sessions of public&nbsp;games  Private trades on public&nbsp;AMM’s  <p>Aztec goes beyond unauditable private transactions, enabling smart contracts that allow for flexible compliance and view permissions.</p> How does it&nbsp;work? <p>Aztec takes the prior work achieved with our Connect architecture and massively extends its scope and functionality.</p><p>Connect leveraged an encrypted UTXO architecture in which value notes represented money.</p><p>In Aztec, we’ve carried on with the same design with one key difference: UTXOs can represent not only “the value of a token”, but any data you&nbsp;like.</p><p>UTXO’s now store entire smart contracts.</p><p>Connect supported just 3 custom-built circuits. Aztec can support arbitrary smart contract logic over both public and private state. That means developers can access the full set of Ethereum use-cases, plus entirely new encryption-enabled applications.</p><p>Where Connect was designed for and limited to DeFi, Aztec is limited only by your imagination.</p> Public-private composability <p>Aztec’s public and private state environments are fully composable–meaning any function can call any other function.</p><p>This leads to completely new blockchain paradigms like private-to-private function calls: smart contracts whose logic is invisible to blockchain observers can call other contracts with invisible logic.</p><p>Aztec is building a true privacy ecosystem–a network of smart contracts that can draw from and write to whichever ledger is most convenient:</p>  a visible, public one to support primitives requiring transparency like AMMs and lending protocols  an invisible private one enabling the creation of private decentralized governance, finance, identity, and&nbsp;gaming.   View permissions and compliance <p>Aztec maintains the same segregation between viewing and spending keys as Connect, while extending viewing key permissions to each contract for fine-grained control on data&nbsp;access.</p><p>Because Aztec allows for permissioning on a contract-by-contract basis, compliance can be implemented flexibly with new blockchain primitives: decentralized identity, third-party verification, and view key&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>Applications no longer have to think about all-or-nothing approaches: Aztec supports the full spectrum of programmably private permissions.</p> Noir: Write Code, not&nbsp;Circuits <p>In order to enable private smart contract computation, Aztec Labs is contributing to core development of Noir, the universal language of zero knowledge.</p><p>Noir is an open-source, generalized zero knowledge circuit writing language compatible with any proving back-end and verifiable on any blockchain with customizable smart contract verifiers.</p><p>Where lower-level zk programming languages like Circom require knowledge of cryptographic concepts, Noir lets you write code, not circuits.</p><p>Zero-knowledge programs can have familiar syntax and abstracted cryptographic safety. An open-source library of crypto primitives means you can rely on a cache of audited crypto code and a community of cryptographers and open-source contributors.</p><p>Noir’s vision is to be the LLVM for zkSNARKs. Just as programming languages compile to an intermediate representation rather than machine language, Noir compiles to an abstract circuit intermediate representation (ACIR), which can then compile to any cryptographic backend.</p><p>Proofs can then be verified on any chain with a Solidity verifier.</p><blockquote>That means devs from Solana to Cosmos can integrate ZK proofs with&nbsp;Noir.</blockquote><p>In addition to its use as a generalizable zk programming language, Noir also serves as the smart contract language for Aztec: it retains traditional smart contract semantics, replete with state variables, functions, and cross-contract composability (even across the public-private barrier!).</p> Scalability <p>Our belief has always been that the largest barrier to blockchain adoption isn’t blockspace–it’s utility. Thankfully, zkSNARKs unlock both flexible encryption and scalability for&nbsp;Aztec.</p><p>The recursion enabled by Aztec’s kernel circuits is so powerful that we have achieved a massive scalability improvement over Connect. Aztec will target 100+ TPS and single-digit cent transactions by mainnet launch, approximately 5x more throughput than Ethereum and 50-100x more than&nbsp;Connect.</p><p>We expect Aztec’s primary cost input–posting call data to Layer 1–to drop significantly via the use of blob transactions facilitated by EIP-4844.</p><p>Our long-term roadmap includes custom data availability, state sharding, FHE-enabled state syncing, hardware acceleration, and parallelized execution — all of which will allow us to access another order of magnitude of&nbsp;scale.</p> Next-level Privacy&nbsp;UX <p>Outside of core infrastructure, privacy UX has been a major bottleneck to the adoption of blockchain encryption tools.</p><p>We see the problem as&nbsp;3-fold:</p>  It’s hard to reason about&nbsp;privacy  Inflexible view permissions make compliance difficult or impossible  The wallet experience is confusing and non-standard  <p>Aztec tackles all three issues&nbsp;head-on.</p> Privacy guarantees <p>Our goal with Aztec was to have significantly stronger privacy guarantees than Connect, while making them easier to reason about. Simultaneously, Aztec improves generalizability and reduces cost–meaning better privacy comes with no trade-offs.</p><p>The simple&nbsp;tl;dr?</p><p>Private transactions are private. Full&nbsp;stop.</p><p>With previous-generation privacy solutions, users were concerned with privacy sets. In Aztec, private transaction execution is fully private–not only is the transaction private but the contract being executed is also private. That means private token transfers, private loans, private order book exchanges, and private game state are all totally inscrutable to blockchain observers.</p><p>There is simply no way to leak information other than the raw number of private state updates triggered, nor is it possible to interrogate the origin or nature of those state updates. The only way an observer gains information about the nature of the transaction is if there is a call to a public function.</p><p>Public execution is default anonymous–observers can’t tell who invoked the transaction but can see the results of the transaction publicly.</p><p>While public transactions are still reliant on privacy sets for their guarantees, the composability of Noir contracts means privacy sets are shared across the entire&nbsp;network.</p><p>A stablecoin like Dai will have a privacy set encompassing payments, DeFi, and usage as an in-game currency.</p> Wallet Experience and Account Abstraction <p>To make Aztec accounts as compatible as possible with existing wallets, user spending keys will utilize the same spending keys as Ethereum&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>In addition, native account abstraction will allow users to deploy custom Noir contracts to their account addresses instead of utilizing existing ECDSA signature flows. Aztec account abstraction facilitated by Noir circuits will&nbsp;support:</p>  Smart contract&nbsp;wallets  M of N multisigs  Schnorr Signatures  ECDSA over the 25519 curve (the same signature scheme as Apple’s&nbsp;TouchID)  Social recovery  <p>The future of blockchains is in programmable wallets, not manually signing transactions and granting permissions. Smart contract wallets will be a core feature of Aztec’s architecture, enabling future-proof blockchain UX.</p> Build <p>Are you an independent or protocol dev wondering whether Aztec is right for&nbsp;you?</p><p>Aztec is purely additive to Ethereum. Because it supports both public and private smart contracts, anything that can be built on Ethereum can be built on&nbsp;Aztec.</p><p>And while Aztec’s public transactions look broadly similar to Ethereum (since they’re both public state machines), developers will be granted new opportunities unlocked by private&nbsp;compute:</p>  Hiding confidential information  Anonymity  Hiding the terms and conditions of confidential contracts  Hiding which contract has even been&nbsp;executed  Programming in zero-knowledge  <p>Because Aztec’s core execution engine verifies rather than executes compute, private transactions can have arbitrary runtime. Unlike Ethereum, which has a block resource limit of 30 million gas, there is no hard limit to the compute intensity for an Aztec&nbsp;block.</p><p>After all, users run programs and generate proofs on their own devices. That means programs can have arbitrary runtime and still be proved&nbsp;locally.</p><p>Aztec therefore allows for the concept of private micro-rollups: programs that are executed and proven locally and sent onward for verification.</p><blockquote>Entire rollup instances and applications can be run like Layer 3’s on&nbsp;Aztec.</blockquote><p>We’re excited for the new paradigms that are possible when users are empowered to run and prove programs on their own&nbsp;devices.</p> Open Vision, Open&nbsp;Source <p>Aztec’s vision is wildly ambitious. As a result, we are opening Aztec’s codebase, protocol design, and documentation to the broader zk and blockchain communities to&nbsp;discuss.</p><p>We are starting by building in the open at discourse.aztec.network–our new home for protocol-level discussion and debate, and the future home of Aztec’s decentralized governance.</p><blockquote>Join the conversation about Aztec’s specification and roadmap at <a href="http://discourse.aztec.network">discourse.aztec.network</a></blockquote><p>In the spirit of radical openness, Aztec is being built under the open-source and permissive Apache 2.0 License, and Aztec’s repos are updated on a regular basis.

Sequencers then send blocks to a federated network of&nbsp;provers.</p><p>Provers then break up the 16,348 individual transactions that comprise an Aztec block into trees of proofs 14 deep. They then “split up” the work of proving individual transactions, working together to construct the full Merkle tree that makes up a finalized Aztec&nbsp;block.</p><p>Finally, Aztec nodes provide chain data, syncing chain state, answering RPC requests, and propagating transactions.</p><p>Aztec is designed with decentralization and the sustainability of all stakeholders in mind–not just users and applications, but node providers, sequencers, and provers. All components of the stack will use commodity hardware with requirements as low or lower than their Ethereum equivalents.

<p>Aztec’s response to HMT’s consultation for cryptoasset regulation</p> Answering HM Treasury’s Call <p>In February of this year, His Majesty’s Treasury (HMT) published a consultation and call for evidence titled “future financial services regulatory regime for cryptoassets”.</p><p>The consultation follows an April 2022 call for a new unified regulatory framework for cryptoassets in the&nbsp;UK.</p><p>The primary view expressed by the UK government is that “cryptoassets and the activities underpinning their use should follow the standards expected of other similar financial services activities.”</p> DeFi ≠&nbsp;CeFi <p>We support the need for clear, affirmative, and proportionate regulation as a step toward jurisdictional clarity, and believe the UK’s stance that the prime objective should be on growth and innovation is the correct&nbsp;one.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are two nuanced distinctions within crypto that must be&nbsp;drawn:</p>  Firstly, between centralized or intermediated financial entities and peer-to-peer decentralized financial protocols;  And secondly, between credibly neutral protocols and consumer-facing applications  <p>The government’s core design principle equating “same risk, same outcome” threatens to throw centralized financial entities (CeFi), decentralized financial protocols (DeFi), and decentralized applications (dApps) into the same regulatory bucket.</p> Our Response <p>It’s our belief that the unique non-intermediated nature of DeFi is not only consumer protective but non-analogous to existing forms of financial services. Therefore, applying regulation derived from that applying to traditional financial services may both harm consumers and hinder industry innovation.</p><p>Consumers may be at risk of being misled into believing CeFi custodians are trustless, when in fact some of the biggest failures in the entire crypto-asset industry were in fact due to malfeasance on the part of CeFi entities and custodians.</p><p>In reality, there are vast differences in custody, trust, and permissioning between centralized financial services (CeFi) and decentralized protocols (DeFi), and as a result we recommend that HMT create a bespoke and progressive regulatory regime that is suited to DeFi’s unique benefit to the consumer.</p><p>We seek to clarify some of these nuances in our response to HMT’s consultation, with a specific focus on decentralized finance (DeFi), while underscoring the need for encryption to protect user privacy and security.</p><p>Read our full response&nbsp;here:</p><p>And read HMT’s full consultation here:</p> Join the Conversation <p>Aztec is building at the cutting edge of blockchain privacy and encryption.
