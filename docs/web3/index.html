  Partnering with PartyKit: Everything is Better with Friends  <p>Sunil and his team are turning lonely online tasks into collaborative multiplayer experiences.</p>

<p>I am a student of antiquity. At age 10, while many of my peers in the tech industry were learning how to code, I was buried somewhere between the sixth and fifth centuries BC, learning Latin and ancient Greek. (To this day I have some highly marketable skills—like reciting Virgil in the original.) One lesson that stuck with me from those studies is something Aristotle said many centuries ago: that we humans are “social animals.” As markets and technologies have come and gone, this part of our nature has been slow to change; <a href="https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/this-study-of-300000-people-reveals-1-secret-to-living-a-longer-healthier-life.html">dozens of studies</a> on health and longevity show that no matter what we do in life, it is better with friends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By that measure, the Internet is not an ideal environment for us—because our digital experiences are so often lonely. We spend 8-10 hrs a day in front of our screens largely alone. Collaborative editing in Google Docs, collaborative design in Figma, and multiplayer video games are the rare exceptions that give us a taste of what the good life on the internet could be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The view that all business apps require multiplayer collaboration is not necessarily universally held. The skeptic might ask how many Google Docs and Figmas there can be, i.e., how many apps truly require real-time, multiplayer collaboration?</p>



<p>Such skepticism is a failure of imagination, anchored in how things have been rather than how things can be. The fact is very few business processes are truly single-player; even something as mundane as expense reports requires collaboration, as does every other workflow that involves approvals. But these naturally multiplayer experiences have been artificially constrained into sequential, asynchronous workflows that can take weeks to complete.</p>



<p>Imagine instead you could just tag your manager or colleague in finance—or your friendly AI-driven finance copilot—to review your expense report, and they could flag anything that needs fixing on the spot. Historically, creating that kind of collaborative experience required a lot of hard work and technical sophistication. The likes of Google could do it, but your average SaaS startup could not. And while some new technologies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">CRDT</a> libraries have been inching us closer to multiplayer experiences, they still require a lot of technology integration and many hours of engineering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enter <a href="https://www.partykit.io/">PartyKit</a>, a developer-friendly platform for real-time human-to-human and human-to-AI collaboration. PartyKit does the heavy lifting for you, enabling multiplayer experiences with a few lines of Javascript code. It is easy to customize; it includes all the analytics, and other tools you need to build production apps; and because it is open source, it can run on your organization’s own infrastructure—or even your own laptop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we first met PartyKit founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunil-pai-a47732253/">Sunil Pai</a> earlier this year, we fell in love with his velocity and can-do attitude. Case in point is the way he got hired at Cloudflare: after he complained on X (formerly known as Twitter) about certain aspects of the developer experience, they invited him to join the team and fix it—which he did. During <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/sequoia-arc/">Sequoia Arc</a>, we got to know Sunil very well, and were impressed with his contagious enthusiasm for his creation; he was quick to show anyone who was interested a demo on his phone. As they say, ABC—always be closing!</p>



<p>During the beta period, we were also impressed with the diversity of applications users found for PartyKit, from a <a href="https://www.tldraw.com/">drawing app</a> to a <a href="http://v/">state machine</a> to an <a href="https://sitegpt.ai/">LLM-based customer service agent</a>. And those are just small hints of what’s to come; as we celebrate the general availability of the platform, we will no doubt be surprised in the weeks and months ahead by the multitude of use cases PartyKit enables! We are proud to support Sunil and his team as they continue to grow, and we look forward to the better, less lonely internet we’ll all enjoy as they work to make collaborative multiplayer experiences the norm.</p>

 Faster, better, stronger, Smooshier — improving mixnet coverage with Project&nbsp;Smoosh <p>Ahead of the NymVPN launch there’s been a tonne of work behind the scenes to build and grow what will be the VPN’s nervous system: the global Nym&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Since the mainnet launch, the Nym mixnet had deliberately been kept small to maximise rewards for early node operators in the early days while adoption was low. However, for the NymVPN to run smoothly, the mixnet needs to grow, especially gateways.</p><p>Enter project Smoosh — an initiative which will simplify components, boost redundancy, and significantly grow geographic coverage for users and rewards for operators.</p> WTF is Project&nbsp;Smoosh? <p>The clue’s in the name: Nym CTO Dave Hrycyszyn and Nym Chief Scientist Claudia Diaz have led this initiative to ‘smoosh’ Nym nodes together, so that the same operator can alternately serve as a mix node, a gateway, or a VPN&nbsp;node.</p><p>This is designed to simplify components with minimal changes to the underlying code, while also building in the redundancy and coverage required for the upcoming&nbsp;VPN.</p><p>The token economics will be modified to reflect these changes. The token economics for mix node reward, reputation and selection will remain the same. But nodes with a high reputation score that flag they are available to run gateways will have the chance to be selected as gateways to earn higher&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>The global privacy bootcamp <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-shipyard-privacy-academy-preview-91a545a2c31f">Nym Shipyard</a>, due to kick off this October, will also support project Smoosh by onboarding new operators, growing the Nym community, and offering guidelines on best practice for maximising node efficiency and&nbsp;rewards.</p> Three steps of project&nbsp;Smoosh <p>Project Smoosh will proceed in three&nbsp;stages:</p>  Combining the gateway and network requester. This stage is complete.  Combining all the nodes in the Nym mixnet into one binary — so the mix node, the entry and exit gateways, and network requester are all bundled into one. Operators will be able to select and flag which functions they wish to offer — for example, not everyone will be able to, or want to, run an exit gateway. This stage is in progress.  Updating the Nym smart contract with a new token economic mechanism for the directory authority. In simple language: the economics and reputation behind how nodes are selected in the network. This stage is in&nbsp;design.  <p>All three steps will be performed incrementally over the coming months, and with enough time to incorporate feedback from Nym node operators and debug if necessary.</p><p>Operator software will essentially remain unchanged except now, all binaries will be packaged into just the one Nym node binary rather than multiple binaries.</p><p>The mix node reputation and delegation will remain the same, but rewards will look a little different to ensure higher rewards for those carrying the additional weight of running gateways and the&nbsp;VPN.</p><p>The previous setup did not offer incentives for running gateways and network requesters. These are the hops to the external internet — a vital component of the mixnet that facilitates anonymised requests to public web services outside of the Nym network. Being the interface to the external world entails additional risks, which is why rewards for running these components will be&nbsp;higher.</p><p>On that risk — there is one very important change that Nym is seeking feedback&nbsp;on:</p> Exit gateways: from an ‘allow list’ to a ‘deny&nbsp;list’ <p>Operators running gateways will have to open their nodes to a wider range of online services, similarly to Tor exit&nbsp;relays.</p><p>Right now,<a href="https://nymtech.net/.wellknown/network-requester/standard-allowed-list.txt"> the gateway allow list</a> is extremely contained and limited to a very small number of online services, where network requesters act as a proxy and can only connect to permitted domains like Telegram or Matrix and some crypto&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>Nym is committed to ensuring privacy for all users for the broadest possible range of online services. To achieve this, the mixnet needs to switch from allowing connections to only a handful of services to instead allow any service with the exception of those on a ‘deny list’. By doing so, Nym is building on the best practices already established by the Tor community.</p><p>As a result, the envisioned gateway setup would be much more permissive, and enabling privacy as the default for the internet.</p><p>Gateways would act both as SOCKS5 Network Requesters and exit nodes for IP traffic from the mixnet clients and the Nym&nbsp;VPN.</p><p>Switching from the current, limited ‘allow’ list to a ‘deny’ list would enhance the usage and appeal of Nym products for end users, and this increased usage would also lead to higher revenues for operators.</p><p>This ‘deny’ list will include protections for operators, likely along the lines of <a href="https://tornull.org/">Tor Null</a>, or the<a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/ReducedExitPolicy"> Tor Reduced Exit Policy</a>, other lists, or a combination of all of the&nbsp;above.</p><p>Operators are encouraged to join the<a href="https://t.me/nymchan_help_chat"> Telegram</a>,<a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym"> Discord</a>, and<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23operators:nymtech.chat"> Element (Matrix)</a> channels to discuss with the Nym core&nbsp;team.</p><p>Nym core is currently consulting legal advisors and has run a survey with operators to determine feeling, best practice, legal implications, and the most appropriate way&nbsp;forward.</p><p>It isn’t possible for Nym to provide comprehensive legal advice across all jurisdictions, but a legal best practice document will soon be published on the <a href="https://github.com/nymtech">Nym GitHub</a> covering the United States and Switzerland, with advice for Germany, Ukraine, and Russia to&nbsp;come.</p><p>Operators!</p><p>Please join the Nym community channels on <a href="https://t.me/nymchan_help_chat">Telegram</a>,<a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym"> Discord</a>, and<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23operators:nymtech.chat"> Element (Matrix)</a>.

 📖 Deep dive: How Machiavellian principles could help fix decentralized governance <p>Miles Jennings</p><p>Whatever you make of Renaissance-era Italian philosopher and political operator Niccolo Machiavelli (who inspired the word “Machiavellian” for better or worse), many of the principles he explored in his writings remain relevant today. For instance, we can see echoes of such principles -- on leadership and the preservation of political liberty -- in both the Federalist Papers and design of the U.S. Constitution.&nbsp;</p><p>But several Machiavellian principles can also be applied to fix decentralized governance, particularly issues with DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) in web3. How? Because Machiavelli’s philosophy during that time was developed with a very pragmatic understanding of the struggle for social power, as well as the premise that no mechanism exists to guarantee virtuous actions.&nbsp;And while most DAOs have developed, as a first step, simplified models of governance based on direct democracy, indirect democracy, and corporate governance -- these approaches have failed to overcome the complex sociopolitical realities involved in decentralized governance. </p><p>So in this set of articles, Jennings examines issues facing DAOs today; and outlines current solutions such as subDAOs, delegate programs, governance minimization, and others, as well as their limitations. Jennings then shares how 4 Machiavellian principles can help design more effective DAOs and better decentralized governance, including minimizing governance and checking-and-balancing the leadership class.</p><p>read more on Machiavelli for DAOs:<br>…<a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/machiavelli-principles-dao-decentralized-governance/">Principles for Fixing Decentralized Governance</a> (part 1)<br>…<a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/machiavelli-daos-designing-effective-decentralized-governance/">Designing Effective Decentralized Governance</a> (part 2)</p><p>share on: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1705276359831060654?s=20">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0x22ba35">Farcaster</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7111042659175059456">LinkedIn</a><br><br>see also: </p>  <p>“a16z suggests Machiavelli to fix decentralized governance”, by Ana Paula Pereira in <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/a16z-machiavelli-fix-decentralized-governance">Cointelegraph</a>&nbsp;</p>  <p>“Lightspeed Democracy: What web3 organizations can learn from the history of governance”, by Andrew Hall and Porter Smith on <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/lightspeed-democracy-what-web3-organizations-can-learn-from-the-history-of-governance/">a16zcrypto.com</a></p>   🇬🇧 Announcing: Crypto Startup School goes to London <p>Jason Rosenthal&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/crypto-startup-school/">Crypto Startup School</a> (CSS) is our popular accelerator program for early-stage companies, providing expert guidance, capital, and resources tailored for crypto founders.

<p>Protecting users from total transparency is crucial for addressing one of the main hurdles facing DeFi adoption: data privacy.</p><p>In a system where blockchain transparency can be maliciously exploited, alpha decay and surveillance are inevitable, making the current state of decentralized finance incompatible with traditional services. As such, addressing our networks’ inherent concerns can only be done with robust controls and proactive strategies in place to prevent the misuse of decentralized tools.</p><p>To this end, and in an ecosystem milestone, <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther Protocol</a> and its DAO are debuting a suite of zero-knowledge compliance solutions. This initial release integrates <a href="https://purefi.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">PureFi</a>'s services to create a path to compliance and data privacy in DeFi. </p> Panther Protocol’s approach to compliance <p>Panther Protocol’s goal is to create a cross-chain architecture that enables seamless access to DeFi while preserving the privacy of users’ data and activity. The protocol leverages the security and liquidity of existing networks while integrating zero-knowledge technology for users to have full control over their data. The protocol’s v1 also integrates these features into a solution that DeFi enthusiasts can use to access their favorite protocols.</p><p>In a first-of-its-kind approach that complements its decentralized structure, Panther introduces an innovative method to manage compliance risks. Panther integrates third-party<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/"> compliance providers</a>, operating autonomously from the protocol, to authenticate users, offering them a unique set of credentials after users complete a series of verifications. These credentials then serve the dual purposes of:</p>  Crafting zero-knowledge proofs directly within their browsers.  Seamlessly integrating with blockchain-based <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">DIDs </a>and similar platforms.  <p>Due to the flexibility of this design, Panther users can access the protocol without being bound to a single compliance provider, being able to choose from a variety of them. Once verified, users can then present these credentials as an irrefutable attestation to their authenticity, granting them unhindered access to the protocol. As a result, Panther can retain its neutrality while giving users a path to complying with regulations.</p> Integrating PureFi<br> <p>In the process of selecting a compliance vendor suitable for Panther’s compliance flow and willing to support the proposed architecture, the Panther DAO elected PureFi.</p><p>PureFi has gained recognition in the Web3 space by pioneering the use of technologies such as decentralized verifiable credentials. The protocol’s goal is to become a one-stop decentralized compliance solution that onboards institutional money to DeFi. PureFi also actively participated in the Panther DAO’s discussions surrounding compliance integrations.</p><p>For Panther’s v1 release, the integration will fulfill the following functions (with all zero-knowledge capabilities built by the Panther team and PureFi in charge of compliance procedures):</p>  Capturing users’ data (email, name, birth date, and nationality) upon their first attempt to access the protocol.  Issuing a signed zk-friendly attestation of the user sharing their data, tied to the user’s wallet (which the user can use as a “Master” account to identify themselves).  Running KYT checks (aka “wallet screening”) to analyze AML/CTF risks of a deposit/withdrawal, both on the receiver’s and sender’s end, and issuing zk-friendly KYT attestations upon passing.  Maintaining an on-chain list of valid cryptographic keys (i.e., certificates) of compliance providers, including the EdDSA public key available on Polygon.  Escrowing the compliance provider’s backup keys with a reliable 3rd party, e.g., a law firm, to be used in case PureFi goes offline.  <p>Importantly, the integration is designed to be compatible with any compliance provider or multiple of them simultaneously.</p> In Summary <p>Zero-knowledge, decentralized compliance, and self-sovereign identity solutions create a technology stack that, for the first time ever, opens a seamless path to compliance while protecting users’ privacy. Panther and PureFi are proud to announce a collaboration that will set the foundation for greater adoption of these solutions and Decentralized Finance as a whole.</p><p>Panther’s <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/">compliance integrations</a> can already be tested by ZK technology and DeFi enthusiasts at <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet/testnet-stages?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther’s Testnet Stage 1</a>, released earlier this month.

<p>The foundation models we use today aren’t just beating humans at Jeopardy, or <a href="https://a16z.com/podcast/a16z-podcast-the-dream-of-ai-is-alive-in-go/">playing Go</a> at a supernatural level, or powering better recommendation engines—they’re changing and creating new user behavior across art, design, games, medicine, coding, and even human relationships. And the broad impact of this wave of AI is already creating the sort of massive value we’ve seen with other platform shifts, like the internet, mobile, cloud.</p>
<p>Given we’re still at the beginning of this paradigm shift, however, it can be tough to envision where these initial breakthroughs will lead and how they’ll transform our world. We brought together some of the best AI founders and leaders—from those scaling the underlying foundation models to those building products that could transform entire industries—for a series of conversations on where we are, where we’re going, and the big open questions in the field.</p>
<p>Here are the top 16 things we learned.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Full conversations on <a href="http://www.a16z.com/AIRevolution">a16z.com/AIRevolution</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM4u6XbiXf5rBS3ZoELEGmSS-iDK_XWR_">YouTube</a>.</p>
 AI today 
  1. We’re at the beginning of the third epoch of compute 
<p>The most common refrain across those building AI is that AI is emerging as the next computing platform, and we are still very, very early in that process. Previous platform shifts show it can take decades of compounding innovations for a technological breakthrough to turn into a society-wide shift. The light bulb was invented in 1879, but it wasn’t until 1930 that 70% of US houses had electricity. The microchip was invented in 1958, but it took almost 50 years for us to get the iPhone.</p>
<p>While a lot of the focus today is on the development of foundational large language models (LLMs), the transformer architecture was invented only 6 years ago, and ChatGPT was released less than a year ago. It will likely take years, or even decades, before we have a full tech stack for generative AI and LLMs and a host of transformative applications—though we have reason to believe the impact is <a href="https://a16z.com/the-economic-case-for-generative-ai-and-foundation-models/">accelerated</a> this time around.</p>
<blockquote><p>I really think that we could be entering a third epoch of computing. The microchip brought the marginal cost of compute to 0. The internet brought the marginal cost of distribution to 0. These large models actually bring the marginal cost of creation to 0. When those previous epochs happened, you had no idea what new companies were going to be created. Nobody predicted Amazon. Nobody predicted Yahoo. We should all get ready for a new wave of iconic companies.<br>
—Martin Casado, a16z</p>
<p>We’re really at a “Wright-Brothers-first-airplane” moment. We’ve got something that works and is useful now for some large number of use cases. It looks like it’s scaling very, very well, and without any breakthroughs, it’s going to get massively better. But there will be more breakthroughs because now all the AI scientists in the world are working on making the stuff better.<br>
—Noam Shazeer, Character.AI</p>
<p>Particularly over the past couple of years and maybe the past 12 months in particular, with the launch of ChatGPT and GPT-4, you can really see the potential of the platform in the same light as the personal computer or the smartphone. A bundle of technologies are going to make a whole bunch of new things possible that lots of people are going to be building things on top of.<br>
—Kevin Scott, Microsoft</p></blockquote>
  2. This wave of generative AI has the sort of economics that drive market transformations 
<p>For a technological innovation to spur a market transformation, the <a href="https://a16z.com/the-economic-case-for-generative-ai-and-foundation-models/">economics need to be compelling</a>. While previous AI cycles had plenty of technological advances, they lacked transformative economics. In the current AI wave, we have already seen early signs of economics that are 10,000x (or higher) better for some use cases, and the resulting adoption and development of AI appears to be happening much faster than any previous shift.</p>
<blockquote><p>Market transformations aren’t created with economics that are 10x better. They get created when they’re 10,000x better.</p>
<p>Let’s say that I wanted to create an image of myself as a Pixar character. If I’m using one of these image models, the inference costs a 10th of a penny, and let’s say it takes 1 second. If you compare that to hiring a graphic artist, let’s say that was $100 in an hour. You’ve got 4 to 5 orders of magnitude difference in cost and time.These are the types of inflections you look for certainly as an economist when there’s going to be actually a massive market dislocation.</p>
<p>And if you want to have an example of how extremely nutty that this can get, I see no reason why you can’t generate an entire game—the 3D models, the characters, the voices, the music, the stories, etc. There are companies that are doing all of these things. If you compare the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars and years versus a few dollars, we now have internet and microchip level asymmetries in economics.<br>
—Martin Casado, a16z</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
  3. For some early use cases, creativity &gt; correctness 
<p>Hallucinations are a known aspect of today’s LLMs, but for some use cases, the ability to make things up is a feature rather than a bug. In contrast to earlier applied use cases of machine learning where the nth degree of correctness is critical (e.g., self-driving cars), many of the early use cases for LLMs—virtual friends and companions, brainstorming concepts, or building online games—have focused on areas where creativity is more important than correctness..</p>
<blockquote><p>Entertainment is this $2T a year industry. And the dirty secret is that entertainment is imaginary friends that don’t know you exist. It’s a cool first use case for AGI. Like, you want to launch something that’s a doctor, it’s going to be a lot slower because you wanna be really, really, really careful about not providing false information. But friends you can do really fast, it’s just entertainment, it makes things up, that’s a feature.<br>
—Noam Shazeer, Character.AI</p>
<p>Of the 65M people on Roblox, most of them are not creating at the level they would want to. For a long time, we imagined a simulation of Project Runway where you have sewing machines and fabrics and it’s all 3D simulated, but even that’s kind of complex for most of us. I think now when Project Runway shows up on Roblox, it will be a text prompt, image prompt, voice prompt. If I was helping you make that shirt, I’d say: I want a blue denim shirt, I want some buttons, make it a little more trim, fitted. I actually think we’re going to see an acceleration of creation.<br>
—David Baszucki, Roblox</p>
<p>Right now, we’re at a place where AI might be doing the first draft, but getting from first draft to final product is kind of hard and usually takes a team. But if you could get AI to suggest interface elements to people and do that in a way that actually makes sense, I think that could unlock a whole new era of design in terms of creating contextual designs that are responsive to what the user’s intent is at that moment. And I think that’d be a fascinating era for all designers to be working in collaboration with these AI systems.<br>
—Dylan Field, Figma</p></blockquote>
  4. For others, like a coding “copilot,” correctness improves as humans use it 
<p>While AI has the potential to augment human work across many disciplines, coding “copilots” have been the first AI assistants to see widespread adoption for a few reasons.</p>
<p>First, developers are generally early adopters of new technology—an analysis of ChatGPT prompts from May/June 2023 found that <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/we-analyzed-millions-of-chatgpt-user-sessions-visits-are-down-29-since-may-programming-assistance-is-30-of-use/">30% of ChatGPT prompts</a> were coding-related. Secondly, the biggest LLMs have been trained on datasets (e.g., the internet) that contain a lot of code, which makes them particularly good at responding to coding-related queries. Finally, the human in the loop is the user. As a result, while accuracy matters, human developers with an AI copilot can more quickly iterate to correctness than human developers alone.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you have to be correct and you’ve got a very long and fat tail of use cases, either you do all of the work technically or you hire people. Often, we hire people. That’s a variable cost. Second, because the tails of the solutions tend to be so long—think something like self-driving where there are so many exceptions that could possibly happen—the amount of investment to stay ahead increases and the value decreases. You have this perverse economy of scale. That human in the loop that used to be in a central company is now the user, so it’s not a variable cost to the business anymore and the economics for that work. The human in the loop has moved out, and as a result, you can do things where correctness is important, like, for example, developing code, because it’s iterative, so the amount of error that accrues gets less because you’re constantly getting feedback and correction from the user.<br>
—Martin Casado, a16z</p></blockquote>
<p>When a developer can query an AI chatbot to help them write and troubleshoot code, it changes how development happens in two notable ways: 1) it makes it easier for more people to collaborate in development because it happens through a natural language interface and 2) human developers produce more and stay in a state of flow for longer.</p>
<blockquote><p>Programming is becoming less abstract. We can actually talk to computers in high bandwidth in natural language. We’re using the technology and the technology is helping us understand how to collaborate with it versus ‘program’ it.<br>
—Mira Murati, OpenAI</p>
<p>GitHub is the first illustration of this copilot pattern that we are trying to build out, which is: how can you take the knowledge work that someone is doing and use AI to help them be dramatically more productive at doing that particular flavor of cognitive work? In our observation with developers, more than anything else, AI helps keep them in flow state longer than they otherwise would. Rather than hitting a blocker when you’re writing a chunk of code and thinking, “I don’t know how to go get the next thing done. I’ve got to go consult documentation. I’ve got to go ask another engineer who might be busy with something.” Being able to get yourself unblocked in the moment before you’re out of flow state is just extraordinarily valuable. For folks who are thinking about the utility of these generative AI tools that you’re building for things other than software development, this notion of flow state is a useful thing to consider.<br>
—Kevin Scott, Microsoft</p>
<p>The best designers are starting to think much more about code, and the best developers are thinking much more about design. Beyond designers and developers, if you think about a product person, for example, they might have been working on a spec before, but now they’re going much more into mockups to communicate their ideas more effectively. Basically, this will allow anyone in the organization to go from idea to design and possibly to production much faster. But you’ll still need to hone each of those steps. You’ll need someone to really think through, “Okay, what ideas are we going to explore? How are we going to explore them?” You’ll want to tweak the designs, you’ll want to finesse them properly to go from first draft to final product.<br>
—Dylan Field, Figma</p></blockquote>
 What comes next? 
  5. Integrating AI with biology could accelerate new approaches to treating disease and have a profound impact on human health 
<p>Biology is incredibly complex—maybe even beyond the ability of the human mind to fully comprehend. The intersection of AI and biology, however, could accelerate our understanding of biology and bring some of the most exciting and transformative technological advances of our time. AI-powered platforms in biology have the potential to unlock previously unknown biological insights, leading to new medical breakthroughs, new diagnostics, and the ability to detect and treat diseases earlier—potentially even stopping a disease before it begins.</p>
<blockquote><p>At certain times in our history, there have been eras where a particular scientific discipline has made incredible amounts of progress in a relatively short amount of time. In the 1950s, that discipline was computing, where we got these machines that performed calculations that, up until that point, only a human was able to perform. And then in the 1990s, there was this interesting bifurcation. On the one side, there was data science and statistics, which ultimately gave us modern-day machine learning and AI. And then the other side was what I think of as quantitative biology, which was the first time where we started to measure biology on a scale that was more than tracking 3 genes across an experiment that took 5 years.</p>
<p>Now, this era of 2020 is the time when those last 2 disciplines are actually going to merge and give us an era of digital biology, which is the ability to measure biology at unprecedented fidelity and scale; interpret the unbelievable masses of data, different biological scales and different systems using the tools of machine learning and data science; and then bring that understanding back to engineer biology using tools like CRISPR genome editing so we can make biology do things that it would otherwise not want to do.</p>
<p>We can now, finally, for the first time, measure biology at scale, both at the cellular level—sometimes at subcellular level—and at the organism level.That gives us, for the very first time, the ability to deploy machine learning in ways where it is truly meaningful.</p>
<p>We built a language model for biology. It’s just like GPT, but for cells. We have the language of cells and what cells look like. You measure hundreds of millions of cells in different states, and then just like the large language models for natural language, with a small amount of data, you can start asking, “Okay, how does disease move a disease-causing gene from one place to the other? How does a treatment move you hopefully back in the opposite direction from the disease state back to the healthy state?” And that’s super powerful. Like other language models, it keeps getting better the more data you feed it.<br>
—Daphne Koller, insitro</p></blockquote>
  6. Getting models into the hands of users will help us discover new use cases 
<p>Whereas previous iterations of AI models were designed to outperform humans at certain tasks, transformer-based LLMs excel at general reasoning. But just because we’ve created a good general model doesn’t mean we’ve cracked how to apply it to specific use cases. Just as having humans in the loop in the form of RLHF, was critical to improving the performance of today’s AI models, getting the new technology into the hands of users and understanding how they use it will be key to figuring out what applications to build on top of those base foundation models.</p>
<blockquote><p>We have to remember: the model is not the product. Your understanding as an entrepreneur of: who is your user? What is their problem? What can you do to help them? And then determining whether or not AI is actually a useful piece of infrastructure to go solve that user problem—that is something that is unchanged. AI is just like a new and interesting piece of infrastructure that lets you solve a new category of problems or solve an old category of problems in better ways.<br>
—Kevin Scott, Microsoft</p>
<p>We don’t know exactly what the future looks like, and so we are trying to make these tools available and the technology available to a lot of other people so they can experiment and we can see what happens. It’s a strategy that we’ve been using from the beginning. The week before we launched ChatGPT, we were worried that it wasn’t good enough. We all saw what happened: we put it out there and then people told us it is good enough to discover new use cases, and you see all these emergent use cases.<br>
—Mira Murati, OpenAI</p></blockquote>
  7. Your AI friend’s memory is about to get much better 
<p>While data, compute, and model parameters power the general reasoning of LLMs, context windows power their short-term memory. Context windows are typically measured by the number of tokens that they can process. Today, most context windows are around 32K, but <a href="https://a16z.com/the-next-token-of-progress-4-unlocks-on-the-generative-ai-horizon/">bigger context windows</a> are coming—and with them, the ability to run larger documents with more context through LLMs.</p>
<blockquote><p>Right now, the model we’re serving uses a context window of a few thousand tokens, which means your lifelong friend remembers what happened for the last half hour. It will make things way better if you can just dump in massive amounts of information. It should be able to know a billion things about you. The HBM bandwidth is there.<br>
—Noam Shazeer, Character.AI</p>
<p>One thing that I think is still underappreciated is the longer context and the things that come with that. I think people have this picture in mind of, “There’s this chatbot. I ask it a question and it answers the question.” But the idea that you can upload a legal contract and say, “what are the 5 most unusual terms in this legal contract?” Or upload a financial statement and say, “summarize the position of this company. What is surprising relative to what this analyst said 2 weeks ago?” All this knowledge manipulation and processing large bodies of data that take hours for people to read. I think much more is possible with that than what people are doing. We’re just at the beginning of it.<br>
—Dario Amodei, Anthropic</p></blockquote>
  8. Voice chatbots, robots, and other ways of interacting with AI are a big area of research 
<p>Today, most people interact with AI in the form of chatbots, but that’s because chatbots are generally easy to build—not because they’re the best interface for every use case.</p>
<p>Many builders are focused on developing new ways for users to interact with AI models through multimodal AI. Users will be able to interact with multimodal models the way they interact with the rest of the world: through images, text, voice, and other media. A step beyond this: embodied AI focuses on AI that can interact with the physical world, like self-driving cars.</p>
<blockquote><p>I think that the foundation models today have this great representation of the world in text. We’re adding other modalities, like images and video, so these models can get a more comprehensive sense of the world, similar to how we understand and observe the world.<br>
—Mira Murati, OpenAI</p>
<p>Maybe you want to hear a voice and see a face, or just be able to interact with multiple people. It’s like you got elected president, you get the earpiece, and you get the whole cabinet of friends or advisers. Or it’s like you walk into Cheers and everyone knows your name, and they’re glad you came.<br>
—Noam Shazeer, Character.AI</p>
<p>The next frontier of the impacts that AI can have is when AI starts to touch the physical world. And we’ve all seen just how much harder that is. We’ve all seen how hard it is astonishingly to build a self-driving car compared to building a chatbot, right? We’ve made so much progress on building chatbots, and self-driving cars are still blocking fire trucks in San Francisco. Having an appreciation for that complexity, but also an appreciation for the magnitude of the impact, is important.<br>
—Daphne Koller, insitro</p></blockquote>
 Open Questions 
  9. Will we have a handful of general models, a bunch of specialized models, or both? 
<p>Which use cases are best served by the bigger, “higher IQ” foundation models or smaller, specialized models and datasets? Like the cloud and edge architectural debates of a decade ago, the answer depends on how much you’re willing to pay, how accurate you need the output to be, and how much latency you can tolerate. And the answers to those questions may change over time as researchers develop more compute-efficient methods for fine-tuning big foundation models for specific use cases.</p>
<p>In the long run, we may be over rotating on the question of which models are used for which use case because we are still in the early stages of building the infrastructure and architecture that will support the wave of AI applications to come.</p>
<blockquote><p>Right now, it’s a bit like 2000 and the internet is about to take over everything, and the most important thing is whoever can build the best router. Cisco in 2000 was worth half a trillion dollars at its peak. It was worth more than Microsoft at the time. So, who has the largest LLM? Obviously, whoever can build the largest one and train it the most will own all of AI and all future humanity. But just like the internet, someone will show up later and think about something like Uber and cab driving. Someone else showed up and thought, “hey, I wanna check out my friends on Facebook.” Those end up being huge businesses, and it’s not just going to be one model that OpenAI or Databricks or Anthropic or someone builds, and that model will dominate all these use cases. A lot of things will need to go into building the doctor that you trust.<br>
—Ali Ghodsi, Databricks</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The biggest factor is simply that more money is being poured into it. The most expensive models made today cost about $100M, say, plus or minus a factor of 2. Next year we’re probably going to see, from multiple players, models on the order of $1B, and in 2025, we’re going to see models on the order of several billion, perhaps even $10B. That factor of 100, plus the compute inherently getting faster with the H100s—that’s a particularly big jump because of the move to lower precision. You put all those things together, and if the scaling laws continue, there’s going to be a huge increase in capabilities.<br>
—Dario Amodei, Anthropic</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>It depends on what you’re trying to do. Obviously, the trajectory is these AI systems will be doing more and more of the work that we’re doing. In terms of how this works out with the OpenAI platform, you can see even today that we make a lot of models available through our API, from the very small models to our frontier models. People don’t always need to use the most powerful or the most capable models. Sometimes they just need the model that actually fits for their specific use case and it’s far more economical. We want people to build on top of our models and we want to give them tools to make that easy. We want to give them more and more access and control, so you can bring your data and customize these models. And you can really focus on the layer beyond the model and defining the products.<br>
—Mira Murati, OpenAI</p>
<p>In any company like Roblox, there’s probably 20 or 30 ultimately end-user vertical applications that are very bespoke—natural language filtering is very different from generative 3D—and at the end user point, we want all of those running. As we go down [the stack], there’s probably a natural 2 or 3 clustering of general bigger, fatter type models in a company like ours. We’re very fine-tuned for the disciplines we want with the ability to train and run massive inferences for these.<br>
—David Baszucki, Roblox</p></blockquote>
  10. When will AI gain traction in the enterprise, and what will happen to those datasets? 
<p>The impact of generative AI on the enterprise is still in its infancy – in part because enterprises tend to move slower generally, and in part because they have realized the value of their proprietary datasets and don’t necessarily want to hand their data over to another company, no matter how powerful their model might be. Most enterprise use cases require a high degree of accuracy, and enterprises have 3 options for choosing an LLM: build their own, use an LLM service provider (e.g., Mosaic) to build it for them, or fine tune a foundation model – and building your own LLM is not easy</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the things that’s happened in the brains of the CEOs and the boards is that they realize: maybe I can beat my competition. Maybe this is the kryptonite to kill my enemy. I have the data with generative AI, so then they’re thinking, ‘I have to build it myself.’ I have to own the IP. You want to build your own LLM from scratch? It’s not for the faint of heart, still requires a lot of GPUs, costs a lot of money, and depends on your datasets and your use cases.<br>
—Ali Ghosdi, Databricks</p>
<p>We have lots and lots of customers who want to have specialized models that are cheaper, smaller, and have really high accuracy and performance. They’re saying, “Hey, this is what I want to do. I want to classify this particular defect in the manufacturing process from these pictures really well.” And there, the accuracy matters. Every ounce of accuracy that you can give me matters. And there, you’re better off if you have a good dataset to train and can train a smaller model. The latency will be faster, it will be cheaper, and yes, you can absolutely have accuracy that beats the really large model. But that model that you built can’t also entertain you on the weekend and help your kids do their homework.<br>
—Ali Ghodsi, Databricks</p></blockquote>
  11. Will scaling laws take us all the way to AGI? 
<p>LLMs currently follow a scaling law: model performance improves as you add more data and compute, even if the architecture and algorithms remain constant. But how long will this scaling law hold? Will it continue indefinitely, or will it hit a natural limit before we develop AGI?</p>
<blockquote><p>There isn’t any evidence that we will not get much better and much more capable models as we continue to scale them across the access of data and compute. Whether that takes you all the way to AGI or not—that’s a different question. There are probably some other breakthroughs and advancements needed along the way, but I think there’s still a long way to go in the scaling laws and to really gather a lot of benefits from these larger models. —Mira Murati, OpenAI</p>
<p>Even if there were no algorithmic improvements from here and we just scaled up what we had so far, the scaling laws are going to continue. —Dario Amodei, Anthropic</p>
<p>Our goal is to be an AGI company and a product-first company, and the way to do that is by picking the right product that forces us to work on things that generalize, make the model smarter, make it what people want, and serve it cheaply at a massive scale. The scaling laws are going to take us a pretty long way. At the core, the computation isn’t that expensive. Operations cost something like 10-18 dollars these days. If you can do this stuff efficiently, the cost of that should be way, way lower than the value of your time. There’s the capacity there to scale these things up by orders of magnitude. —Noam Shazeer, Character.AI</p></blockquote>
  12. What are the emergent capabilities? 
<p>While some people are quick to write off generative AI’s capabilities, AI is already much better than humans at performing certain tasks and will continue to improve. The best builders have been able to identify AI’s most promising emerging capabilities and build models and companies to scale those capabilities into reliable features. They recognize that scale has tended to increase the reliability of emergent abilities.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>It’s important to pay attention to these emergent capabilities even if they’re highly unreliable. Especially for people that are building companies today, you really want to think about, “Okay, what’s somewhat possible today? What do you see glimpses of today?” Because very quickly, these models could become reliable.<br>
—Mira Murati, OpenAI</p>
<p>When we put out GPT-2, some of the stuff that was considered most impressive at the time was, “You put these 5 examples of English to French translation straight into the language model, and then you put a sixth sentence in English and it actually translates into French. Like, oh, my God, it actually understands the pattern.” That was crazy to us, even though the translation was terrible. But our view was that, “Look, this is the beginning of something amazing because there’s no limit and you can continue to scale it up.” There’s no reason why the patterns we’ve seen before won’t continue to hold. The objective of predicting the next word is so rich, and there’s so much you can push against that it just absolutely has to work. And then some people looked at it and they were like, “You made a bot that translates really badly.”<br>
—Dario Amodei, Anthropic</p></blockquote>
  13. Will the cost of serving these models come down? 
<p>The cost of compute is one of the major constraints to scaling these models, and the current chip shortages drive that cost up by constraining supply. However, if Nvidia produces more H100s next year, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c7e9cfa9-3f68-47d3-92fc-7cf85bcb73b3">as some have reported</a>, that should ease the GPU shortage and, with it, potentially the cost of compute.</p>
<blockquote><p>The model we’re serving now cost us about $2M worth of compute cycles to train last year, and we could probably repeat it for half a million now. So we’re going to launch something tens of IQ points smarter, hopefully, by the end of the year. I see this stuff massively scaling up. It’s just not that expensive. I think I saw an article yesterday that NVIDIA is going to build another 1.5M H100s next year. That’s 2M H100s, so that’s 2 x 106 x 1015 operations per second. So, 2 x 1021 / [8 x 109] people on Earth.</p>
<p>So that’s roughly a quarter of a trillion operations per second, per person. Which means it could be processing on the order of 1 word per second on a 100B parameter model for everyone on Earth. But really it’s not going to be everyone on Earth because some people are blocked in China, and some people are sleeping… It’s not that expensive. This thing is massively scalable if you do it right, and we’re working on that.<br>
—Noam Shazeer, Character.AI</p>
<p>My basic view is that inference will not get that much more expensive. The basic logic of the scaling laws is that if you increase compute by a factor of n, you need to increase data by a factor of the square root of n and the size of the model by a factor of square root of n. That square root basically means that the model itself does not get that much bigger, and the hardware is getting faster while you’re doing it. I think these things are going to continue to be serve-able for the next 3 or 4 years. If there’s no architectural innovation, they’ll get a little bit more expensive. If there’s architectural innovation, which I expect there to be, they’ll get somewhat cheaper.<br>
—Dario Amodei, Anthropic</p></blockquote>
<p>But even if the cost of compute remains the same, efficiency gains at the model level seem inevitable, especially with so much talent flooding the space—and AI itself is likely to be the most powerful tool we have to improve how AI works.</p>
<blockquote><p>As AI gets more powerful, it gets better at most cognitive tasks. One of the relevant cognitive tasks is judging the safety of AI systems, eventually doing safety research. There’s this self-referential component to it. We see it with areas like interpretability, looking inside the neural nets. Powerful AI systems can help us interpret the neurons of weaker AI systems. And those interpretability insights often tell us a bit about how models work. And when they tell us how models work, they often suggest ways that those models could be better or more efficient. —Dario Amodei, Anthropic</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the most promising areas of research is fine-tuning a big model for a specific use case without needing to run the entire model.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you made a thousand versions of an LLM, that’s good at a thousand different things, and you have to load each of those into the GPUs and serve them, it becomes very expensive. The big holy grail right now that everybody’s looking for is: are there techniques, where you can just do small modifications where you can get really good results? There are lots of techniques, like prefix tuning, LoRA, CUBE LoRA, etc. But jury’s out, none of them really are a slam dunk, awesome, we found it. But someone will.</p>
<p>Once you have that, then it seems the ideal would be a really big foundation model that’s pretty smart and that you can stack on these additional brains that are really good at, say, this specific classification task for manufacturing errors.<br>
—Ali Ghodsi, Databricks</p></blockquote>
  14. How do we measure progress towards AGI? 
<p>As we scale these models, how will we know when AI becomes AGI? As often as we hear the term AGI, it can be a tricky thing to define, perhaps in part because it’s difficult to measure.</p>
<p>Quantitative benchmarks like <a href="https://a16z.com/newsletter/introducing-the-enterprise-newsletter/#what-it-means-when-computers-can-understand-language">GLUE and SUPERGLUE</a> have long been used as standardized measures of AI model performance. But as with the standardized tests we give to humans, AI benchmarks raise the question: to what extent are you measuring an LLM’s reasoning capabilities and to what extent are you measuring its ability to take a test?</p>
<blockquote><p>I kind of think all the benchmarks are bullshit. Imagine if all our universities said, “we’re going give you the exam the night before and you can look at the answers. And then the next day, we’re going to bring you in and you answer them, and then we’ll score how you did.” Suddenly, everybody would be acing their exams.</p>
<p>For instance, MMLU is what a lot of people benchmark these models on. MMLU is just a multi-choice question that’s on the web. Ask a question, and is the answer A, B, C, D, E? And then it says what the right answer is. It’s on the web. You can train on it and create an LLM that crushes it on that.<br>
—Ali Ghodsi, Databricks</p></blockquote>
<p>The original qualitative test for AGI was the Turing Test, but convincing humans that an AI is a human is not the hard problem. Getting an AI to do what humans do in the real world is the hard problem. So, what tests can we use to understand what these systems are capable of?</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re now seeing from these systems that it’s easy to convince a human that you’re human, but it’s hard to actually make good things. I could have GPT-4 create a business plan and come pitch to you, but that doesn’t mean you’re going to invest. When you actually have 2 competing businesses side-by-side—one of them is run by AI and the other is run by a human—and you invest in the AI business, then I’m worried.<br>
—Dylan Field, Figma</p>
<p>I have a Turing test question for AI: if we took AI in 1633 and trained on all the available information at that time, would it predict that the Earth or the sun is the center of the solar system—even though 99.9% of the information is saying the Earth is the center of the solar system? I think 5 years is right at the fringe, but if we were to run that AI Turing test 10 years from now, it would say the sun.<br>
—David Baszucki, Roblox</p></blockquote>
  15. Will we even need humans in the loop? 
<p>New technologies have typically replaced some human work and jobs, but they’ve also opened entirely new fields, improved productivity, and made more types of work accessible to more people. While it’s easy to imagine AI automating existing jobs, it’s far more difficult to imagine the next order problems and possibilities unlocked by AI.</p>
<blockquote><p>Very simply, Jevons Paradox states: if the demand is elastic and the price drops, the demand will more than make up for it. Normally, far more than make up for it. This is absolutely the case of the internet. You get more value and more productivity. I personally believe when it comes to any creative asset or work automation, the demand is elastic. The more that we make, the more people consume. We’re very much looking forward to a massive expansion in productivity, a lot of new jobs, a lot of new things, just like we saw with the microchip and the internet.<br>
—Martin Casado, a16z</p>
<p>I grew up in rural Central Virginia, in a place where the economy was powered by tobacco farming, furniture manufacturing, and textiles. By the time I was graduating from high school, all 3 of those industries had just collapsed. When folks in these communities have access to very powerful tools, they tend to do remarkable things that create economic opportunities for themselves, their families, and their communities. They solve problems that you or I are not going to solve just because we don’t see the whole problem landscape of the world. We don’t have their point of view. These tools of AI are becoming more accessible now than they have been by a dramatic wide margin. You can do interesting things with these tools right now and can be an entrepreneur in small-town Virginia without having a PhD in computer science or expertise in classical AI. You just need to be curious and entrepreneurial.<br>
—Kevin Scott, Microsoft</p>
<p>If you look at every technological shift or platform shift so far, it’s resulted in more things to design. You got the printing press, and then you have to figure out what you put on a page. More recently, mobile. You would think, “Okay. Less pixels, less designers.” But no, that’s when we saw the biggest explosion of designers.<br>
—Dylan Field, Figma</p></blockquote>
 Calling all builders 
  16. There’s never been a more exciting time to build an AI startup (especially if you’re a physicist or mathematician) 
<p>It’s a uniquely exciting time to build in AI: foundation models are rapidly scaling, the economics are finally tilting in startups’ favor, and there are plenty of problems to solve. These problems will require a lot of patience and tenacity to crack, and to date, physicists and mathematicians have been particularly well suited to working on them. But as a young field that’s also advancing quickly, AI is wide open—and there’s never been a better time to build in AI.</p>
<blockquote><p>There’s two kinds of fields at any given point in time. There’s fields where an enormous amount of experience and accumulated knowledge has been built up and you need many years to become an expert. The canonical example of that would be biology—it’s very hard to contribute groundbreaking or Nobel Prize-level work in biology if you’ve only been a biologist for 6 months… Then there are fields that are very young or that are moving very fast. AI was, and still is to some extent, very young and is definitely moving very fast. Really talented generalists can often outperform those who have been in the field for a long time because things are being shaken up so much. If anything, having a lot of prior knowledge can be a disadvantage.<br>
—Dario Amodei, Anthropic</p>
<p>One thing to draw on from the theoretical space of math is that you need to sit with a problem for a really long time. Sometimes you sleep and you wake up and you have a new idea, and over the course of a few days or weeks, you get to the final solution. It’s not a quick reward, and sometimes it’s not this iterative thing. It’s almost a different way of thinking where you’re building the intuition and discipline to sit with a problem and have faith that you’re going to solve it. Over time, you build an intuition on what problem is the right problem to actually work on.<br>
—Mira Murati, OpenAI</p>
<p>It’s not only machine learning that moves forward over time, it’s also the biological tools that we’re relying on. It used to be that there wasn’t any CRISPR. There was just siRNA. And then there’s CRISPR base editing and now there’s CRISPR prime that replaces entire regions of the genome. So the tools that we’re building on also get better and better over time, which unlocks more and more diseases that we could tackle in a meaningful way. There’s so many opportunities at this intersection of AI/ML and biology and medicine. This convergence is a moment in time for us to make a really big difference in the world that we live in using tools that exist today that did not exist even five years ago.<br>
—Daphne Koller, insitro</p>
<p>If you think about some of these big platform shifts that we’ve had in the past, the most valuable things that get done on the platforms are not the things that got deployed in the first year or two of the platform change. If you think about where you spend most of your time on your smartphone, it’s not the SMS app, it’s not the web browser, it’s not the mail client. It’s the new things that got created on top of the platform in the years following the availability of the platform.</p>
<p>What are the difficult things that have now become possible that were impossible before? That’s the thing that people ought to be thinking about. Don’t chase the trivial things.<br>

<p>To date, a handful of large companies have captured the value created by advances in AI. In this keynote presentation from AI Revolution, a16z general partner Martin Casado explains why with generative AI, that’s changing.</p>

  AI economics before 
<p>Martin: I think we should all get ready for a new wave of iconic companies. I don’t think we know what they’re going to look like, but the economics are just too compelling What has the narrative been for AI over the last 50 years? The narrative is this episodic thing with summers and winters and all of these false promises.</p>
<p>I remember when I joined Ph.D. in 2003. From my cohort, I would say 50% of the people were doing AI. This was when Bayesian stuff was super popular. Then within 3 years, everybody was like, “AI is dead.”</p>
<p>We’ve had this love-hate relationship with AI for a very long time, but if you look at all of the graphs, we’ve made a tremendous amount of progress for the last 70 years. Along the way, we’ve solved a lot of very real problems. Way back in the 60s we were doing expert systems, which are still used for diagnosis. We’re very good at beating Russians at chess. We’re doing self-driving cars, we’re doing vision. There’s a lot that we’ve solved, so much so it’s become a cliche. Every time we solve a problem, we’re like, “That wasn’t really AI.” We just keep moving the goalposts.</p>
<p>Not only that, it’s been a while now that we’ve been better at humans for some very important things. For example, perception or handwriting detection. It’s been about 10 years since we’ve been better than humans at entity identification. Not only that, we’ve actually gotten very good at monetizing this, particularly for large companies. As we all know, there’s been a ton of market cap that’s been added to companies like Meta and Google and Netflix by using AI.</p>
<p>I think the question we should all ask ourselves is why hasn’t this resulted in an actual platform shift? By platform shift, I mean, why has the value accrued to the incumbents and why hasn’t there been a new set of AI-native companies that have come up and displaced them? We saw that in mobile and with the internet and the microchip.</p>
<p>For the first part of this talk, I’m going to argue that the capabilities have all been there, but the economics just haven’t for startups.</p>
  The AI mediocrity spiral 
<p>If you step back and you look at the standalone case for AI economics—not what a big company can extract from it, but a startup—it’s actually not been great. A lot of the sexier use cases are pretty niche markets. It’s great to beat Russians at chess, but that’s not a market. Maybe it’s a useful tool that you can apply to solving bigger problems, but that is not, in itself, a market.</p>
<p>I actually think the second point is the most important and it’s pretty subtle. Many of the traditional AI use cases require correctness in the tail of the solution space, and that’s a very hard thing for a startup to do for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>One of the reasons is if you have to be correct and you’ve got a very long and fat tail. Either you do all of the work technically or you hire people, so often, we hire people. For startups to start hiring people to provide solutions, there’s a variable cost. The second is because the tails of the solutions tend to be so long, think something like self-driving where there are so many exceptions that could possibly happen, the amount of investment to stay ahead increases and the value decreases. You have this perverse economy of scale.</p>
<p>We’ve actually done studies on this and it turns out many startups that try to do this end up with non-software margins. They have lower margins and they’re much harder to scale. With robotics comes the curse of hardware, classically a very difficult thing for startups to do.</p>
<p>If you think about the competition for most AI use cases, not traditional machine learning, but AI, it tends to be the human. Traditionally, the human brain is really good at perception. The brains that we have evolved over 100M years to do things like pick berries and evade lions—and they’re incredibly efficient at doing that. This leads to something that most investors know, which we call the dreaded AI mediocrity spiral.</p>
<p>What is it? It’s very simple. Let’s say a founder comes in and they want to build an AI company to automate a bunch of stuff. Of course, correctness is really important and they want it to look good first, so they hire people to do it instead of the AI. Then they come to us, we invest in them, and I join the board. Then I say, “Listen, this is great, you need to grow.” And they’re like, “Oh, man, we need to grow, this AI is hard, the tail is very long. I’m going to hire more people.”</p>
<p>Now you’re on this treadmill of continuing to invest and hiring people. Automation doesn’t often happen, and if it does, it’s only part of the solution. This is one of the reasons why so many startups that have tried to do this haven’t had breakaway economics. The value accrues to large companies that can actually seek these perverse economies of scale.</p>
<p>I think one of the great examples, just because it’s illustrative of so many of these things, is Robotaxi. Robotaxi is fantastic, but we’ve been working at this for decades. We’ve invested $75B and the unit economics are still not on par with a human Uber driver, so it’s remained in the domain of large companies.</p>
<p>If you actually look at the slide that I had previously, other than the niche markets, all of these problems apply. There’s hardware, there’s an incredibly long tail with Robotaxi. If you strip away everything and go to, “Here’s the processing unit that does self-driving today on the high-end systems,” with the amount of power that they consume and hardware that’s required, even then it’s only maybe a factor of 10x better than a human being–and the power is much, much higher.</p>
<p>The economics aren’t that compelling and they’re certainly not the type of economics you see in the case of market transformations. Market transformations aren’t created with economics that are 10 times better; they get created when they’re 10,000 times better.</p>
<p>What is the learning from the last 70 years? It’s not that the technology doesn’t work. It’s not that we can’t solve the problems. All of that has always been the case. It’s not even that we can’t monetize it. Big companies are great at monetizing it. It’s that it’s very, very hard for startups to break away. If startups can’t break away, you don’t get a transformation.</p>
  The economics of Generative AI 
<p>So why are we all here? This wave is very, very different. You have a model and that model will take in a natural language, like English, and will output something. It can be a conversation, an image—it can use whatever.</p>
<p>As we know, this has been pushed into many different areas where we’re already seeing productive viable businesses. I like to call them the 3Cs. There’s creativity, like any component of a video game, that you can automatically generate. There’s companionship, which is more of an emotional connection so you have characters to talk to, so it fills a social role. Then there’s a class that we call co-pilot, which is effectively that it will help you with work or personal tasks. These are already emerging as independent classes.</p>
<p>Remember the slide that I showed you before of the properties of AI that made it difficult to build a startup company? None of these really apply to this current model. Let’s go through them.</p>
<p>The first is large markets that this has been applied to, like arguably all of white-collar work. Even video games and movies are like a $300 billion market. These are massive, massive markets.</p>
<p>The second is the most important point and maybe the most subtle. In this domain, correctness isn’t as much of an issue for 2 reasons. One of them is when you’re talking about creativity, the first C, there is no formal notion of correctness. What does it mean to be incorrect for a fiction story or a video game? You want to make sure they have all their fingers, but even then, do you really in sci-fi? We have absolutely adapted to use cases where correctness is not a huge issue. The second is a little more subtle, which is that the behavior developed around these things is iterative. The human in the loop that used to be in a central company is now the user. It’s not a variable cost to the business anymore, the human in the loop has moved out. As a result, you can do things where correctness is important, like developing code because it’s iterative. The amount of error that accrues gets less because it’s a smaller subset, but you’re also constantly getting feedback and correction from the user.</p>
<p>The primary use cases that we talked about are clearly mostly software-based, at least for now. This does apply to robotics, but that’s not what’s really taking off.</p>
<p>I want to talk to you about this brain portion. I’m not a neuroscientist, but I think this is very interesting. For these types of tasks, the silicon stack is way better than the carbon stack. If you think about traditional AI, a lot of it is doing stuff like the 100M-year-old brain—the one that’s fleeing predators or picking strawberries. That’s very, very hard to compete with.</p>
<p>If you have the CPU-GPU set up as a self-driving car, some of these kits are 1.3 kilowatts, when the human brain is 15 watts, economically, that’s very tough to compete with. The new-gen AI wave is competing with the creative language center of the brain. It’s 50,000 years old and is much less evolved. It turns out it’s incredibly competitive, so much so that you actually have the economic inflection we look for for a market transformation.</p>
<p>Let’s break down the numbers. Let’s say that I, Martin, wanted to create an image of myself as a Pixar character. If I’m using one of these image models, let’s say the inference cost is 1/10th of a penny and it takes one second. If you compare that to hiring a graphic artist for 100 bucks in an hour—I’ve actually hired graphic artists to do things like this and it tends to be a lot more money than that, but let’s conservatively say that—you’ve got 4 to 5 orders of magnitude difference in cost and time. These are the type of inflections you look for as an economist when there’s actually going to be a massive market dislocation.</p>
<p>I’ll give you another example from Instabase. Let’s assume that you have a legal brief in a PDF. You throw it into an unstructured document LLM and then you ask questions for that legal brief. Again, the inference cost is 1/10th of a penny, more or less, and time to complete, maybe one second. But again, it’s cheap relative to the cost of a lawyer.</p>
<p>As someone who has actually spent a lot of money on lawyers, I want to point out a couple of things. The first is it takes more than one hour to iterate on this. The second is they’re not always correct. In fact, built-in for any interaction I have with a lawyer is cross-checking and double-checking the work. Again, we have 4 to 5 orders of magnitude difference in cost and time.</p>
<p>If you want an example of how extremely nutty that this can get, I see no reason why you can’t generate an entire game. There are companies today working on it, the 3D models, the characters, the voices, the music, the stories. If you compare the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars and years versus a few dollars of inferences, now we have current internet and microchip level asymmetries in economics.</p>
<p>Now, I’m not saying this is going to happen. I’m not saying this will happen soon—we’re not there yet. What I am saying is this is the path that we’re on and these types of paths are what you look for with big transformations.</p>
<p>It’s little wonder why we’re seeing so much takeoff the way that we have. These are the fastest-growing open-source projects and products and some of the fastest-growing companies we’ve seen in the history of the industry. It’s because, again, it’s less a capability, which we always focus on the capabilities, and it’s much more that the economics work. Whenever the marginal cost of something drops this much, the industry changes. By marginal cost, I mean for whatever good you’re producing, to produce more of that good, that price converges on $0.</p>
  The third epoch of compute: AI 
<p>This may sound hyperbolic, but I really think that we could be entering a third epoch of computers. I think that the first epoch is the microchip. Before the advent of the computer, you actually had people calculating logarithm tables by hand. That’s where the word comes from. They were computers, they would compute. Then we created ENIAC along with other machines.</p>
<p>Let’s look at ENIAC. ENIAC was 5,000 times faster than a human being doing it. There’s your 3 to 4 orders of magnitude and that ushered in the compute revolution. This gave us a number of companies that were either totally transformed, like IBM, or totally net new.</p>
<p>The microchip brought the marginal cost of compute to $0 and the internet brought the marginal cost of distribution to $0. In the 90s, when I wanted to get a new video game I would go to a store and buy a box. If you look at the full cycle from that box leaving whoever sells it, this is weeks. I don’t have the math up here, but if you actually calculate the price per bit relative to DSL in the late 90s, it’s about 4 or 5 orders of magnitude again relative to actually shipping it.</p>
<p>I think there’s a pretty good analog where you say these large models actually bring the marginal cost of creation to $0. That’s some very fuzzy, vague notion of what creation means. Like the previous epochs, you had no idea what new companies were going to be created. You just knew something was going to happen. Nobody predicted Amazon, nobody predicted Yahoo. I remember when this happened. I think we should all get ready for a new wave of iconic companies. I don’t think we know what they’re going to look like, but the economics are just too compelling.</p>
  Jevon’s Paradox and expanding productivity 
<p>I have one final point: There’s always questions when you have market dislocations. They’re staring you in the face. What happens to the jobs? What happens to people? Because this is an economic talk, I’m going to give an economic answer.</p>
<p>There’s something called Jevons Paradox. Very simply, Jevons Paradox is if the demand is elastic, even if you drop the price, the demand will more than make up for it. Normally, far more than make up for it. This is absolutely the case of the internet. You get more value and more productivity.</p>
<p>I personally believe when it comes to creating, any creative asset or any sort of work automation, the demand is elastic. I think the more that we make, the more people consume. We’re very much looking forward to a massive expansion in productivity, a lot of new jobs, a lot of new things. I think it’s going to follow just like the microchip and just like the internet.</p>
<p>With that, I welcome you all here today. I think there’s a lot of work for all of us to do, and thank you so much for taking the time.</p>

  Mira’s background 
<p>Martin: I would love it if you gave us more about your background and what brought you to OpenAI. Bring us up to speed and we’ll go from there.</p>
<p>Mira: I was born in Albania, just after the fall of communism. Very interesting times in this very isolated country. It’s similar to North Korea today. I bring that up because it was very central to my education and focus in math and sciences because there was a lot of focus on math and physics in post-communist Albania. The humanities, like history and sociology, were a bit questionable. The source of information and truthfulness was hard. It was ambiguous, so I got very interested in math and sciences. That’s what I pursued relentlessly. I’m still working fundamentally in mathematics.</p>
<p>Over time, my interests grew more from the theoretical space into actually building things and figuring out how to apply that knowledge to build stuff. I studied mechanical engineering and went on to work in aerospace as an engineer. I joined Tesla shortly after, where I spent a few years. Initially, I joined to work on the Model S dual motor. Then I went on to Model X from the early days of the initial design and eventually led the whole program to launch.</p>
<p>This is when I got very interested in applications of AI, specifically with autopilot. I started thinking more about different applications of AI. What happens when you’re using AI and computer vision in a different domain instead of autopilot?</p>
<p>After Tesla, I went on to work on augmented reality and virtual reality because I just wanted to get experience with different domains. I thought that it was the right time to work on spatial computing. Obviously, in retrospect, it was too early back then. But I learned a lot about the limitations of pushing this technology to the practicality of using it every day.</p>
<p>At this point, I started thinking more about what happens if you just focus on the generality. Forget the competence in different domains and just focus on generality. There were 2 places at the time that were laser-focused on this issue: OpenAI and DeepMind. I was very drawn to OpenAI because of its mission.</p>
<p>I felt like there’s not going to be a more important technology that we all build than AGI. I certainly did not have the same conviction about it as I do now. But I thought that, fundamentally, if you’re building intelligence as such a core unit, universally, it affects everything. What else is more inspiring than elevating and increasing the collective intelligence of humanity?</p>
  Why so many AI leaders come from math and physics 
<p>Martin: Whenever I meet somebody that’s a real influencer and has made major contributions to the space, they almost invariably have a physics or math background. This is actually very different than it was 15 years ago. Fifteen years ago, it was engineers and they came from electrical engineering or mechanical engineering. But it does feel like there’s something…and I don’t know if it’s some quirk in the network or it’s more fundamental, systemic. Do you think that this is the time for the physicist to step up and contribute to computer science, or do you think it’s just more of a coincidence?</p>
<p>Mira: I think one thing to draw on from the theoretical space of math, but also the nature of problems with math, is that you need to sit with a problem for a really long time and you have to think about it. Sometimes you sleep and you wake up and you have a new idea. Over the course of a few days or weeks, you get to the final solution. It’s not a quick reward and sometimes it’s not iterative. It’s almost like a different way of thinking where you’re building an intuition, but also the discipline to sit with a problem and have faith that you’re going to solve it. Over time, you build an intuition on what problem is the right problem to actually work on.</p>
<p>Martin: Do you think it’s now more of a systems problem or more of an engineering problem? Or do you think that we still have a lot of pretty real science to unlock?</p>
<p>Mira: Both. I think the systems and the engineering problem is massive as we’re deploying these technologies and trying to scale them, make them more efficient, and make them easily accessible so you don’t need to know the intricacies of ML in order to use them.</p>
<p>Actually, you can see the contrast between making these models available through an API and making the technology available through ChatGPT. It’s fundamentally the same technology, maybe with a small difference, with reinforcement learning with human feedback for ChatGPT. The reaction and the ability to grab people’s imagination and to get them to just use the technology every day is totally different.</p>
  Natural language interfaces 
<p>Martin: I also think that the API for ChatGPT is such an interesting thing. I program against these things myself for fun. It always feels like, whenever I’m using one of these models in a program, I’m wrapping a supercomputer with an abacus. The code itself just seems so flimsy compared to the model that it’s wrapping. Sometimes I’m like, “I’m just going to give the model a keyboard and a mouse and let it do the programming.” Then the API is going to be English and I’ll just tell it what to do and it’ll do all the programming. I’m curious, as you designed stuff like ChatGPT, do you view that over time the actual interface is going to be natural languages, or do you think that there’s still a big role for programs?</p>
<p>Mira: The programming is becoming less abstract where we can actually talk to computers in high bandwidth in natural language. But maybe another vector is the technology is helping us understand how to actually collaborate with it, versus program it. I think the layer of programming is becoming easier and more accessible because you can program things in natural language. But then there is also this other side, which we’ve seen with ChatGPT, that you can actually collaborate with the model as if it was a companion, a partner, or a co-worker.</p>
<p>Martin: It will be very interesting to see what happens over time. You’ve made the decision to have an API, but you don’t have an API as a co-worker. You talk to a coworker. It could be the case that, over time, these things evolve into speaking natural languages. Or do you think there will always be a component of a finite state machine, a traditional computer?</p>
<p>Mira: Right now is an inflection point where we’re redefining how we interact with digital information and it’s through the form of these AI systems that we collaborate with. Maybe we have several of them and maybe they all have different competencies. Maybe we have a general one that follows us around everywhere that knows everything about my context, what I’ve been up to today, what my goals are in life, at work, and guides me through and coaches me and so on. You can imagine that being super, super powerful.</p>
<p>Right now we are at this inflection point of redefining what this looks like. We don’t know exactly what the future looks like and we are trying to make these tools and the technology available to a lot of other people so they can experiment and we can see what happens. It’s a strategy that we’ve been using from the beginning.</p>
<p>With ChatGPT, the week before, we were worried that it wasn’t good enough. We all saw what happened. We put it out there and then people told us it is good enough to discover new use cases, and you see all these emergent use cases that I know you’ve written about. That’s what happens when you make this stuff accessible and easy to use and put it in the hands of everyone.</p>
  OpenAI Roadmap 
<p>Martin: This leads to my next question. You invent cold fusion and then you’re like, “I’ll just give people electrical outlets and they’ll use the energy.” But when it comes to AI, people don’t really know how to think about it yet. There has to be some guidance, you have to make some choices. You’re at OpenAI and you have to decide what to work on next. If you could walk through that decision process: How do you decide what to work on, what to focus on, what to release, or how to position it?</p>
<p>Mira: If you consider how ChatGPT was born, it was not born as a product that we wanted to put out. In fact, the real roots of it go back to more than 5 years ago when we were thinking about how to make a safe AI system. You don’t necessarily want humans to actually write the goal functions because you don’t want to use proxies for complex goal functions or you don’t want to get it wrong because it could be very dangerous.</p>
<p>This is where reinforcement learning with human feedback was developed. What we were trying to really achieve was to align the AI system to human values and get it to receive human feedback. Based on that human feedback, it would be more likely to do the right thing and less likely to do the thing that you don’t want it to do. Then, after we developed GPT-3 and we put it out there in the API, this was the first time that we actually had safety research become practical into the real world. This happened through instruction-following models.</p>
<p>We used this method to take prompts from customers using the API and then we had contractors generate feedback for the model to learn from. We fine-tuned the model on this data and built instruction-following models. They were much more likely to follow the intent of the user and to do the thing that you actually want it to do. This was very powerful because AI safety was not just this theoretical concept that you sit around and you talk about. It actually became: we’re going into AI safety systems now, how do you integrate this into the real world?</p>
<p>Obviously, with large language models, we see a great representation of concepts, ideas of the real world. But on the output front, there are a lot of issues. One of the biggest is obviously hallucinations. We have been studying the issue of hallucinations, truthfulness. How do you get these models to express uncertainty?</p>
<p>The precursor to ChatGPT was actually another project that we called WebGPT, and it used retrieval to get information and cite sources. This project then eventually turned into ChatGPT because we thought the dialogue was really special. It allows you to ask questions, correct the other person, and express uncertainty.</p>
<p>Martin: And keep finding the error because you’re interacting, and so…</p>
<p>Mira: Exactly, there is this interaction and you can get to a deeper truth. We started going down this path and, at the time, we were doing this with GPT-3 and then GPT-3.5. We were very excited about this from a safety perspective. But one thing that people forget is that, at this time, we had already trained GPT-4. Internally at OpenAI, we were very excited about GPT-4 and put ChatGPT in the rearview mirror. Then we realized, “Okay, we’re going to take 6 months to focus on alignment and safety of GPT-4,” and we started thinking about things that we could do. One of the main things was actually to put ChatGPT in the hands of researchers that could give us feedback since we had this dialogue modality. The original intent was to actually get feedback from researchers and use it to make GPT-4 more aligned and safer and more robust, more reliable.</p>
<p>Martin: Just for clarity, when you say alignment and safety, do you include in that it is correct and does what it wants? Or do you mean safety, actually protecting from some sort of harm?</p>
<p>Mira: By alignment, I generally mean that it aligns with the user’s intent, so it does exactly the thing that you want it to do. But safety includes other things as well, like misuse, where the user is intentionally trying to use the model to create harmful outputs. With ChatGPT, we’re actually trying to make the model more likely to do the thing that you want it to do to make it more aligned. We also wanted to figure out the issue of hallucinations, which is obviously an extremely hard problem.</p>
<p>I do think that with this method of reinforcement learning with human feedback, maybe that is all we need if we push this hard.</p>
<p>Martin: So, there was no grand plan? It was literally, “What do we need to do to get to AGI?” And it’s just one step after the other.</p>
<p>Mira: That’s right, yes—and all the little decisions that you make along the way. Maybe what made it more likely to happen is the fact that we did make a strategic decision a couple of years ago to pursue a product. We did this because we thought it would not be possible to just sit in a lab and develop these things in a vacuum without feedback from users from the real world. That was the hypothesis. I think that helped us along the way to make some of these decisions and build the underlying infrastructure so we could eventually deploy things like ChatGPT.</p>
  Scaling laws 
<p>Martin: I would love it if you riffed on scaling laws. I think this is the big question that everybody has. The pace of progress has been phenomenal and you would love to think that the graph always does this. [gestures up and to the right] But the history of AI seems to be that you hit diminishing returns at some point and it’s not parametric. It kind of tapers off. From your standpoint—which is probably the most informed vantage point of the entire industry—do you think the scaling laws are going to hold and we’re going to continue to see advancements, or do you think we’re heading to diminishing returns?</p>
<p>Mira: There isn’t any evidence that we will not get much better and much more capable models as we continue to scale them across the axes of data and compute. Whether that takes you all the way to AGI, that’s a different question. There are probably some other breakthroughs and advancements needed along the way. There’s still a long way to go in the scaling laws and to really gather a lot of benefits from these larger models.</p>
<p>Martin: How do you define AGI?</p>
<p>Mira: In our OpenAI charter. We define it as a computer system that is able to autonomously perform the majority of intellectual work.</p>
<p>Martin: I was at lunch and Robert Nishihara from Anyscale was there. He asked what I called a Robert Nishihara question, which I thought was actually a very good characterization. He said, “You’ve got a continuum between a computer and Einstein. You go from a computer to a cat, from a cat to an average human, and from an average human to Einstein.” Then he asked the question, “Where are we on the continuum? What problem will be solved?”</p>
<p>The consensus was we know how to go from a cat to an average human. We don’t know how to go from a computer to a cat because that’s the general perception problem. We’re very close, but we’re not quite there yet, and we don’t really know how to do Einstein, which is set-to-set reasoning.</p>
<p>Mira: With fine-tuning, you can get a lot, but in general, I think, at most tasks, we’re at intern level. The issue is reliability. You can’t fully rely on the system to do the thing that you want it to do all the time. Sometimes, in a lot of tasks, it’s never. How do you increase that reliability over time and then, obviously, expand the emergent capabilities, the new things that these models can do?</p>
<p>I think that it’s important to pay attention to these emergent capabilities, even if they’re highly unreliable. Especially for people that are building companies today, you really want to think about, “What’s somewhat possible today? What do you see glimpses of today?” Very quickly these models could become reliable.</p>
  One model to rule them all? 
<p>Martin: I’m going to ask in just a second to prognosticate on what that looks like. But before, very selfishly, I’ve got a question about how you think the economics of this are going to pencil out. I’ll tell you what it reminds me of. It reminds me very much of the silicon industry. I remember in the 90s, when you bought a computer, there were all these weird co-processors. “Here’s string matching, here’s a floating point, here’s crypto,” and all of them got consumed into the CPU.</p>
<p>It turns out generality was very powerful, and that created a certain type of economy, one where you had Intel and AMD and it all went in there. Of course, it costs a lot of money to build these chips.</p>
<p>So you can imagine 2 futures. There’s one future where, generality is so powerful that over time, the large models basically consume all functionality. Then there’s another future where there’s going to be a whole bunch of models, things fragment, and there are different points on design space. Do you have a sense of: is it OpenAI and nobody, or is it everybody?</p>
<p>Mira: It depends on what you’re trying to do. Obviously, the trajectory is these AI systems will be doing more and more of the work that we’re doing. They’ll be able to operate autonomously, but we will need to provide direction and guidance and oversight. But I don’t want to do a lot of the repetitive work that I have to do every day. I want to focus on other things. Maybe we don’t have to work 10, 12 hours a day, and maybe we can work less and achieve even higher output. That’s what I’m hoping for. In terms of how this works out with the platform, you can see even today that we make a lot of models available through our API, from the very small models to our frontier models.</p>
<p>People don’t always need to use the most powerful, the most capable models. Sometimes they just need the model that actually fits for their specific use case and it’s far more economical. I think there’s going to be a range. But, yes, in terms of how we’re imagining the platform play, we definitely want people to build on top of our models and we want to give them tools to make that easy and give them more and more access and control. You can bring your data, you can customize these models. You can really focus on the layer beyond the model and defining the products, which is actually really, really hard. There is a lot of focus right now on building more models, but building good products on top of these models is incredibly difficult.</p>
  The next 5-10 years 
<p>Martin: We only have a couple more minutes, sadly. I would love for you to prognosticate a little bit on where you think this is all going in 3, 5, or 10 years.</p>
<p>Mira: I think that the foundation models today have this great representation of the world in text. We’re adding other modalities, like images and video and various other things, so these models can get a more comprehensive sense of the world around us, similar to how we understand and observe the world. The world is not just in text, it’s also in images. I think we will certainly expand in that direction and we’ll have these bigger models that will have all these modalities in the pre-training part of the work. We really want to get these pre-trained models to understand the world like we do.</p>
<p>Then there is the output part of the model where we introduce reinforcement learning with human feedback. We want the model to actually do the thing that we asked it to do and we want that to be reliable. There is a ton of work that needs to happen here and maybe introducing browsing so you can get fresh information and you can cite information and solve hallucinations. I don’t think that’s impossible. I think that’s achievable.</p>
<p>On the product side, I think we want to put this all together in this collection of agents that people collaborate with and provide a platform that people can build on top of. If you extrapolate really far out, these models are going to be incredibly, incredibly powerful. With that, obviously, comes the fear of having these very powerful models that are misaligned with our intentions. A huge challenge is super alignment, which is a difficult technical challenge. We’ve assembled an entire team at OpenAI to just focus on this problem.</p>
<p>Martin: So, very, very, very last question. Are you a doomer, an accelerationist, or something else?</p>
<p>Mira: Let me say something else. [laughs]</p>
<p>Martin: All right, perfect. Thank you so much, Mira. Fantastic. Thank you, everybody.</p>
<p>Mira: Thank you.</p>

 [19:30] Why Ali isn’t afraid of today’s AI 
 
  Why is it so hard for enterprise to adopt AI? 
<p>Ben: Going to generative AI, 1 of the things that’s been interesting for us as a VC, is we see all kinds of companies. Some have amazing traction, but every company that has traction is in a category like selling to developers or consumers, or maybe selling to small law firms. But we haven’t seen anybody with any traction in enterprise. As the AI infrastructure for enterprise, why is it so hard for enterprises to adopt generative AI?</p>
<p>Ali: Enterprises move slow. The beauty of it is if you crack the code and you get in, it’s harder for them to throw you out. So that’s 1, they just move slower. Second, they’re super freaked out about the privacy and security of their data. Everybody’s been talking about data for 10, 15, 20 years. I just realized how valuable my data actually is. I’m sitting on a treasure trove and I’m going be super successful. But now that I finally realize how valuable this dataset I have is, I definitely don’t want to give it to you, or you, or you. I should be careful about this. Then there’s reports about data leakage. Suddenly, the LLM is spitting out your code or your source. They’re freaked out about that as well. All of these things are slowing it down and they’re thinking through it.</p>
<p>The second challenge enterprises have is that, for a lot of the use cases, we need the data to be accurate, we need it to be exact.</p>
<p>Ben: Are they right about that? Do they really need it to be accurate?</p>
<p>Ali: I think it depends on the use case. They’re just being cautious and they’re being slow, as they are in the big enterprise. There’s the last aspect, which people don’t talk about, which is there’s a food fight internally at the large enterprise.</p>
<p>Ben: Who’s fighting?</p>
<p>Ali: I own generative AI, not Ben. Then you go around and say, “Hey, I own generative AI.” There’s this food fight internally of who owns it, and they slow each other down. Then they say, “Hey, don’t trust Ben because he’s not handling data the right way.” But I’m building my GenAI and it’s unclear who owns GenAI. Is it IT? Is it the product line? Is it the business line?</p>
<p>There is huge politics going on inside the large enterprise. They want to do it, but there are all these hurdles in the way and the price is huge. Whoever can crack the code on that is going to create an amazing company.</p>
  Enterprise data wars 
<p>Ben: Are the enterprises right about not wanting to give their data to OpenAI, or Anthropic, or Bard, or whoever? Is that a correct fear or are they being silly and they could get so much value by putting their data in a big model?</p>
<p>Ali: They can. I get to talk to the CEOs of these big companies who previously were not interested in what I’m doing. I would be talking to the CIO, but now suddenly, they want to talk. They’re like, “I want this generative AI, I want to talk about strategy at my company. We have this dataset, it’s super valuable, and we have to do something with it. This generative AI seems interesting.”</p>
<p>One of the things that’s really interesting that’s happened in the brains of the CEOs and the boards is that they realize, “Maybe I can beat my competition. Maybe this is the kryptonite that will help me kill my enemy. I have the data with generative AI, I can actually go ahead and do that.”</p>
<p>Then they’re thinking, “But then I have to build it myself, I have to own that. I have to own the IP. I can’t just give away that IP to Anthropic or OpenAI. It has to be completely propriety. We have a whole bunch of people who are lined up outside of my office from different departments who are saying they actually will do it—and they can do it. We’re trying to figure out which of them I should give it to.” This is what’s happening internally right now.</p>
  Big vs. small LLMs 
<p>Ben: Interesting. From a strategy standpoint, let’s say you had a big dataset like a healthcare dataset, some kind of security dataset, or Nielsen’s dataset. Can they build a better model themselves for that with their data? Or if they took their data and put it in 1 of the large models, would that always beat what they’re doing?</p>
<p>Ali: This is why we did the acquisition of Mosaic. You can. It’s hard and requires a lot of GPUs. The Mosaic guys just figured out how to do that at scale for others. “You want to build your own LLM from scratch? Come to me, I know all the landmines. It will just work, trust me.”</p>
<p>They can do it; they’ve done it for large customers. It’s not for the faint of heart. It requires a lot of GPUs, costs a lot of money, and depends on your datasets and your use cases. They’re having a lot of success doing it for really large enterprises. They’ll train it from scratch for them and it just works.</p>
<p>Ben: The good news is it’s all my data and nobody can touch it. But is the bigger model such a bigger brain that I could get a better answer if I put that same data in the big model? Or is the Mosaic-tuned, enterprise specific, dataset specific model going to perform better? How do you think about that?</p>
<p>Ali: For specific use cases, you don’t need the big 1. First of all, you can build the big 1 with Mosaic and Databricks. Just how much money do you have? We’re happy to train a 100 Boolean parameter model if you want. Even if you have all the money to train it, it’ll cost you a lot to use it. When you’re using it and you’re doing inference, as it’s called, is going to cost you more.</p>
<p>Ben: How do you think about the diminishing returns on a dataset against how many parameters versus how much data do you have? Does a bigger model just start to be diminishing returns, both in terms of latency expense, everything?</p>
<p>Ali: There’s a scaling law. If you’re scaling the parameters up, you have to scale the data with it. If you don’t have that, you’re not going to get the bang for the buck from scaling. You still get improvement if you increase the parameters or if you increase just the data in any 1 of these dimensions. But…</p>
<p>Ben: But you’re going to pay.</p>
<p>Ali: You’re going to pay, it becomes inefficient. It’s no longer Pareto optimal. For enterprises that have specific use cases, which they all have, when they come to us, they don’t say, “Hey, I would love to have an LLM that could answer anything under the sun.” They’re saying, “This is what I want to do. I want to classify this particular defect in the manufacturing process from these pictures.” There the accuracy matters. There you’re better off if you have a good dataset to train. You can train a smaller model—the latency will be faster and it’s cheaper to use later. You absolutely can have accuracy that beats the really large model, but the model you built can’t also entertain you on the weekend, answer physics questions, and help your kids do their homework.</p>
<p>Ben: Why do you think it’s important for you, Databricks, to build a very large model?</p>
<p>Ali: The bigger models, if you follow the scaling laws, are more intelligent if you’re okay with paying the price, you have the GPUs, and if you can crack the code on how to fine-tune the bigger model. This is the holy grail right now that everybody’s looking at in the research community, in the field, and in companies.</p>
  Finetuning 
<p>Ben: When you say finetune, can you get more specific?</p>
<p>Ali: Take an existing really awesome model, the foundation model that exists, and just modify it a little bit to be able to become really good at some other tasks. There are many different techniques to use to do that, but right now nobody has really cracked the code on how you can do that without modifying the whole model itself. This is pretty costly, especially when you want to use it later.</p>
<p>Ben: Because you have to go through all the nodes.</p>
<p>Ali: Yes. If you made a thousand versions that are good at a thousand different things and you load each of those into the GPUs, serving them becomes very expensive. The holy grail that everybody’s looking for are there techniques where you can just do small modifications where you can get really good results.</p>
<p>Ben: Just that part of the brain.</p>
<p>Ali: Exactly. Just add this thing. There are lots of techniques, prefix tuning, LoRA, CUBE LoRA, and so on. Jury’s out and none of them really are slam dunk—but someone will.</p>
<p>Once you have that, in a few years, the ideal would be a really big foundation model that’s pretty smart. Then you can stack on these additional tuned sorts of brains that are really good at this specific classification task for manufacturing errors or translation paths.</p>
<p>Ben: They will be compute efficient, energy efficient for just dealing with that task at that point.</p>
<p>Ali: Exactly. Then you could also load up your GPUs with that 1 intelligent brain, that 1 giant model, and then specialize it. But to be clear, no one’s really done this yet.</p>
<p>Ben: That’s to do.</p>
<p>Ali: That’s what I think a lot of people are hoping to do, and it might not be easy. Meanwhile, we’re having lots of customers who want to have specialized models that are cheaper, smaller, and that have really high accuracy and performance on that task.</p>
<p>At Databricks, we bought Mosaic. I did not unleash our sales force and go to a market of 3000 people to sell the thing we bought because we just can’t satisfy the demand. There are not enough GPUs.</p>
<p>Ben: So you won’t even let all your guys sell it?</p>
<p>Ali: No, I’m not even letting all the customers buy this thing because we don’t have the GPUs. Every company wants to do this. “I have a thousand things I want to build, can you help me do that?”</p>
<p>Ben: In this context, how much do you think these use cases will fragment in that? You talked about how I want it to be good at doing my kids’ homework, I want it to be my girlfriend. How much do you think the very specific use cases will fragment? Within that, 1 of the things that we’re finding is getting the model to do what you want is where the data advantage is from the users. If I want it to draw me a certain kind of picture, there are a lot of conversations to do that. Whoever is drawing those kinds of pictures will be good at that. But then there may be another model that wants to draw memes, but the thing that’s drawing the pretty pictures can’t draw the memes because that involves words and other stuff that it just hasn’t learned to get out of the humans and map it into its model.</p>
<p>How much do you think we’re going to get tons of specialization versus no, once the brain gets big enough and we do these fine tunings, that’s going to be it. It will be like AWS, GCP, and Azure.</p>
<p>Ali: I think the answer is closer to the latter. It’s going to have lots of specialization. Having said that, it’s not a dichotomy in the sense that maybe they’re all using some base models that are underneath common to many of them. You’re not starting from scratch every time as you develop…</p>
<p>Ben: But you’re tuning it up a certain way.</p>
<p>Ali: Yes. I think in some sense, the industry and people are looking at the wrong thing. Right now, it’s a little bit like 2000 and the internet is about to take over everything and everybody’s super excited. There is 1 company called Cisco and they build these routers. Whoever can build the best routers is going to dominate all of the internet forever and determine the future of mankind. Cisco is the best 1, by far. Cisco in 2000, I think was worth half a trillion dollars at its peak. People were talking about how it’s going to be a trillion dollar company. It was worth more than Microsoft.</p>
<p>Right now I think it’s a little bit like that. Who has the largest LLM? Obviously whoever can build the largest 1 obviously will own all of AI and all the future of humanity. But just like the internet, someone will show up later and think about Uber rides and cab drivers. There ended up being these applications, many of which are obvious. Mark talked about it in Why AI will save the world. It’s not just going to be 1 model that OpenAI or Databricks or Anthropic builds, and that model will dominate all of these use cases. No, a lot of things will need to go into building the doctor that you trust to cure you.</p>
<p>Those are the companies that we’ll build in the future, and I think there’s going to be a lot of value in those. There’s a place for the Cisco routers and for LLM and so on. Cisco still is a pretty valuable company, but I think that’s there’s over-focus right now.</p>
  Open source AI 
<p>Ben: Interesting. How do you think about open source because a lot of the large model providers are literally going in and saying, “Stop open source now you’ve got to outlaw it.” Why are they saying that? Do they have a legitimate gripe?</p>
<p>Coming from Databricks’ perspective, how are you all thinking about open source with respect to Mosaic and then with the other things, like LLaMA?</p>
<p>Ali: If the original LLaMA was never released, what would the state of the world and our view of AI be right now? We would be way further behind. It was a big model that existed in open source. And it was open-sourced. Both of those things completely changed everything that’s happening in AI right now. So size kind of mattered, and the fact that it was open source also kind of mattered. It doesn’t stop there, it’s going to continue. It’s also really hard to block any of this because if you check out the source code for LLaMA, it’s like a couple pages.</p>
<p>Ben: Yeah, but you have to have the weights, too.</p>
<p>Ali: Yeah, but the weights leaked. People will leak the weights and they will get out and people will keep tuning them. There are also distillation techniques where you can take the weights from a continuous output of a model and train smaller ones and train other ones, and so on.</p>
<p>I think open source will continue to do better and better and better and I think more and more techniques. Because there’s scarcity—they don’t have GPUs—they’ll come up with techniques in which they can do things more efficiently, like the fast transformer.</p>
<p>At the same time, I also think that anyone that trains a really gigantic model that’s really, really good, typically will not have the incentive to release it.</p>
<p>The usual thing we see is that open source lags the proprietary ones. The proprietary thing is way ahead and it’s way better. In some rare cases like Linux, it bypasses. In that case it would be game-changing.</p>
<p>Ben: Will that happen?</p>
<p>Ali: It’s hard to predict. Right now it just seems that you need a lot of GPUs to do this.</p>
<p>Ben: How about when GPUs become abundant? That’s going to almost certainly happen.</p>
<p>Ali: GPUs become abundant, or certain tweaks to the transformer that lets you train at a higher learning rate, and you have less issues with it…</p>
<p>Ben: Right, because they’re super inefficient now. They couldn’t be more inefficient.</p>
<p>Ali: Yes. Then they will be released. The universities are just chomping at the bit because what has happened right now is that the universities feel a little bit…</p>
<p>Ben: They’re aced out, they’re not really even in the game anymore because they need to make changes.</p>
<p>Ali: This was my game. I was playing it. I was inventing. Now you threw me out and I can’t even participate because I don’t have GPUs and I don’t have the funding. Universities are having a huge crisis internally with the researchers.</p>
<p>Ben: I see you hired all my guys.</p>
<p>Ali: Their people are leaving because they want to work close to where they can train the models and do this kind of stuff where the data is. At the universities, there’s none of this. So then what are universities doing? They’re looking at how we could crack the code on this. How could we make it much easier, cheaper, and how can we release it? So there’s going to be innovation there.</p>
<p>I think this sort of race will continue between open source and proprietary. Eventually, open source catches up so there’s going to be diminishing returns. I think we’re going to hit walls with scaling laws. You go to the right on the x-axis and move the curve to the right and eventually you get AGI. It’s happening, it’s guaranteed. I think we’re going to hit diminishing returns on walls.</p>
  Benchmarks are bullshit 
<p>Ben: You think we’ll get stuck before we get to AGI and we’ll need an actual breakthrough as opposed to just more size.</p>
<p>Ali: That and I also think that in almost all the use cases where you seriously try to use this for medicine or lawyers, and so on, it quickly becomes clear that you need to augment it with a human in the loop. There’s no way you can just let this thing loose right now. It’s stupid, it makes mistakes. Maybe that can get better.</p>
<p>Ben: But it does better on the medical exams than doctors do.</p>
<p>Ali: This is a funny thing. I kinda think all the benchmarks are bullshit. All the LLM benchmarks, here’s how it works: Imagine in all our universities we said, “We’re going to give you the exam the night before and you can look at the answers. Then the next day we’re going to bring you in and you answer them. Then we’ll score how you did.” Suddenly, everybody would be acing their exams.</p>
<p>For instance, MMLU is what a lot of people benchmark these models on. MMLU is just a multi-choice question that’s on the web. Ask a question, “Is the answer ABCDE?” Then it says what the right answer is. It’s on the web, you can deliberately train on it and create an LLM that crushes it on that. Or you can inadvertently, by mistake in the pile or whatever you use to train your model, happen to see some of those questions that happen to be elsewhere, So the benchmarks are a little bit BS.</p>
<p>Ben: Well, they’re benchmarks for taking the test, but presumably, the test correlates with being able to make a medical diagnosis decision.</p>
<p>Ali: Yes. But they memorized all these.<br>
Ben: But there’s no transfer learning from memorizing the exam to actually diagnosing…</p>
<p>Ali: No one really knows the answer to this. Everybody’s playing the benchmarking game this way right now. I would love it if a whole bunch of researchers that do…</p>
<p>Ben: It’s like the old fake database benchmarks when it’s like “look how fast our database is.” But it’s only good at the actual benchmark.</p>
<p>Ali: I would love it if there were a bunch of doctors that get together and come up with a benchmark that’s super secretive and they don’t show it to you. You give your model to them and they’ll run their questions on that. Then they’ll come back and tell you how you scored. But that’s not how it works right now.</p>
<p>So my point just is that I think right now you need a human in the loop. And I think we’ll need a phase shift in improvement to completely be able to eliminate human in the loop for most of these important tasks.</p>
  Why Ali isn’t afraid of today’s AI 
<p>Ben: Let me go to the question that you dodged, which is what are the ethics of the large models versus open source? Or, in general, what is the responsibility? How big is the threat? Is open source an ethical threat?</p>
<p>Ali: I don’t have all the answers. There are different categories. There’s the “jobs are going to go away” category. We’ve been doing that for 300 years, and the nations that are doing the highest GDP are the ones that automated the most.</p>
<p>Ben: And they have the most jobs and the highest employment.</p>
<p>Ali: There are ways to deal with that problem, and the way to deal with it is not to just stop all progress. That’s stupid. The nations that win are the ones that are doing well on automation, not just AI in general, efficiency improvements. Economics is about efficiency.</p>
<p>Then there are bad things that humans can do deliberately because they’re malicious, which is the 1 I think Marc was the most worried about. But ever since the invention of the hammer we started misusing technology in a bad way.</p>
<p>Ben: When you have a hammer, your head looks like a nail.</p>
<p>Ali: That’s happening all the time with every technological improvement, especially the internet. The really big question that I think Marc dodged a bit in his essay is: are we going to get this super AGI that decides to destroy us? And I don’t…</p>
<p>Ben: The “decide” part is the part where I get a little lost. Free will is not something we’re on the path for for machines. Machines are doing many, many, many computations. We’ve never had machines do this many computations in the history of humanity. That is amazing, but it’s very different than…no LLM has ever decided to do anything. That’s not what they do. So it does seem like now that they’ve got free will, what do we do?</p>
<p>Ali: I do think those hypotheticals…if you have a thing that has that level of intelligence and can control things and so on, then I do think that’s a big risk. I just don’t think that’s going to happen very soon. Here’s why: there’s several things that people are kind of not looking at. So I don’t agree with Marc when he says, “Oh, it’s just like a toaster. Your toaster will not decide to kill you.” I don’t believe that, that’s not true. This thing is pretty smart, it has reasoning capability and if you connect it to robots it can start doing things.</p>
<p>Ben: And let it run free with no safety.</p>
<p>Ali: Run free and say go do it, then it can do a lot of damage. The reason I’m not too worried about the scenario is the following: it’s very costly and hard to get your hands on GPUs and have the money to train a new model.</p>
<p>If that comes down and it takes 10 minutes to train a new model that’s as good as the largest, best models that we have, then we’re kind of fucked. Because then some asshole will say auto GPT, connect it, write a bunch of versions of yourself. Try it out in parallel, do a million of these in parallel, and then figure out if you’re getting smarter and smarter and smarter.</p>
<p>Then before you know it, after maybe 12 months, we find a slightly better version of the transformer that is a little bit more efficient. Now that 10 minutes goes to 2 minutes and then you’re on this race where eventually you will get into this loop where it can create itself.</p>
<p>Right now it’s extremely expensive and really hard to train a new large giant model—much harder than just asking questions from it, unlike the human brain where I can memorize new things and update my brain quickly. I can also read things from my memory and tell you things. Right now it’s a huge asymmetry.</p>
<p>Secondly, we really haven’t cracked the code on machines reproducing themselves biologically, like humans do. Once you have reproductions and the building of new ones automatically… once you crack the code on that loop, yes, then I think we’re fucked. But we’re very far away from that. Nobody’s really doing that. Just moving the scaling laws and getting these things to be better and better at reasoning doesn’t solve the problems that I mentioned. I think that’s what is saving us right now.</p>
<p>Ben: Well, on that happy note, we’ll conclude. I’d like to thank Ali for joining us today. And thank you all. Thank you.</p>

  Generative AI in games 
<p>Jon: We just had a session talking about how generative AI is potentially transforming all types of media. Tell us a bit about how AI is transforming the way folks are building games on Roblox.</p>
<p>Dave: We expansively go beyond gaming and we think about the ultimate form of the way humans communicate at a distance. What we see a lot on our platform, in addition to playing, is how do kids connect with their friends in the middle of COVID? How do people go to a concert with their friends when they can’t go together in person? How do we, in our own office, simulate serendipity when some of us are remote? We have a simulation for the Roblox office that we’re playing around with inside of Roblox.</p>
<p>If we take a step back and say immersive 3D will, with market forces, follow the phone system, video communication, and SMS, then the influences are just massive. I think there are 3 categories. There is one category where people on our platform don’t even think of it as AI, even though it’s been going on for 2 or 3 or 4 years, which is quality of personalized discovery, quality of safety and civility, voice and text monitoring, asset monitoring, and quality of real-time natural translation. How good is our translation versus others—that’s the one that people don’t notice.</p>
<p>The next one that is really exciting right now is generative. Code generative, 3D object generative, avatar generative, game generative, which is very interesting. The future one, which is really exciting, is how far do we get to a virtual doppelganger or a general intelligence agent inside of a virtual environment that’s very easy to create by a user? You want George Washington in your 12-year-old’s school project? I’m not on Tinder, but if someday Tinder has a Roblox app, can I send my virtual doppelganger for the first 3D meeting? I think going all the way from the things we don’t notice to the things that are exciting around generative, to future then general intelligence, these are all going to change the way this works.</p>
<p>Jon: When you think about the parts that go into building the game? There are just so many pieces—concepting, the storyboarding, writing, the creation of the 2D images, the 3D assets, and there’s the code and the physics engine. Roblox has built many of these pieces into its own studio and its platform. What parts do you think will be most affected by this new generation of generative models that you just spoke about?</p>
<p>Dave: It’s almost worth saying the antithesis, which is what will not be affected. Ultimately, there will be acceleration on all of these. We have a bit of an optimistic viewpoint right now because of the 65M people on Roblox, most of them are not creating at the level they would want to. For a long time, we imagined a simulation of Project Runway where, in the early days of Roblox, Project Runway is just skeuomorphic. You have sewing machines and fabrics and it’s all 3D simulated.</p>
<p>But when we think about it, even that’s kind of complex for most of us. I think now when Project Runway shows up on Roblox, it will be text prompt, image prompt, voice prompt, whatever you want as if you’re sitting there. If I was helping you make that, I’d say, “I want a blue denim shirt, I want some cool things, I want some buttons, make it a little more trim, fitted.” I actually think we’re going to see an acceleration of creation.</p>
  Fully personalized playthroughs 
<p>Jon: One of the things you might have mentioned earlier in a podcast is the idea that people can create experiences inside of other experiences. Even when they’re inside the game they have a fully personalized avatar or cosmetic.</p>
<p>Dave: That’s right. The classic 3D creation uses these heavyweight blenders, 3D Studio or Maya. Roblox Studio uses these things. For a while, at Roblox, we were thinking, “How do we make Roblox Studio easier to use? Two million people use it.” But there is another level above that. We saw early signs of this as our users tried to build “Tycoon Builder” and “Roller Coaster Builder.”</p>
<p>The more access they have to the 3D objects and the more persistence, all of a sudden, you get better creation. As AI starts being a service available within any experience, we would like Project Runway to make the ultimate Project Runway experience. Dynamic, persistent 3D clothing, not in Maya or 3D Studio, but in the experience itself, accelerated by cloud AI tools. Then there’s so much leverage. We’re not making Roblox Studio better. We’re providing a lot of facilities for them in that very vertical integration experience, and we would see the same for cars and and all kinds of other things.</p>
<p>Jon: One of the things you’re getting at here is just the power of the concept of a personalized playthrough. The idea is that maybe every user on Roblox in the future has a fully unique experience that’s tailored to their preferences and the choices they made.</p>
<p>Dave: I think you’re touching on an even further extension, which takes a lot of compute horsepower. It’s completely personalized generation in real-time backed by massive inference. You can imagine, “I’m making the super Dungeons and Dragons thing,” but as it watches you play and knows your history, you’ll be playing a 3D experience that’s no one’s ever seen before. I think we will see, in certain types of play, real-time procedural where you need enough inference in real time to generate what you would like.</p>
<p>One of the good things we’ve done, and I can see some Roblox people in the audience here, is for a long time, we’ve really focused on building our own infrastructure. We have hundreds of thousands of servers, we have many, many edge data centers, and terabytes of connectivity that we’ve traditionally used for 3D simulation. The more we can run inference jobs on these, the more we can run super high volume inference that’s high quality at a low cost—and make this freely available so the creators don’t worry about it.</p>
  Roblox’s generative model 
<p>Jon: That makes a lot of sense. On the topic of infrastructure, in your latest shareholder letter, you mentioned that Roblox is working on your own multimodal generative model that will encompass many of the things that we just chatted about. Can you tell us a bit more about what you’re building there?</p>
<p>Dave: In any company like Roblox, there’s probably 20 or 30 end-user vertical applications that are very bespoke. Natural language filtering is very different than generative 3D. At the end user point, we want all of those running. We want to use all of the data in an opt-in fashion to help make these better. As we go down, there’s probably a natural 2 or 3 clustering of general bigger, fatter type models in a company like ours. There’s definitely one around safety and civility, natural language processing, natural language translation, and generally, one more multimodal thing around 3D creation. Just like in Project Runway, some combination of text, image, and generated avatar.</p>
<p>There’s probably a third area, which gets into the virtual human area, which is how would we take the 5B hours of human opted-in data: what we’re saying, how we’re moving, where we go together, how we work in a 3D environment. Could we use that to inform a better 3D simulation of a human? I would say yes, looking at large models in those 3 areas. Then there’s going to be these super big massive LLM-type companies. I think we are probably a layer below that. We’re very fine-tuned for the disciplines we want with the ability to train and run massive inferences for these.</p>
<p>Jon: There’s a massive proprietary data set that you guys are working off of. All of the 3D assets that have been created in Roblox over the years…</p>
<p>Dave: There’s a lot of data in any kind of 3D immersive environment. The communication from people can inform safety and civility, 3D, motion eye tracking, and how humans interact. One area we’re really watching that’s a very difficult problem right now is true high-quality 3D generation as opposed to 2D generation. There’s lots of wonderful 2D generation stuff out there. We really double down on 3D generation.</p>
<p>Jon: How do you think about which parts of the tech stack where you want to partner with external partners versus building yourself in-house, with all of the data and the compute resources that you have available?</p>
<p>Dave: Areas that we’re interested in are: there are companies exploring the future of training cheaply at mega-volume. What’s the future of running inference cheaply at mega-volume? What types of technology abstract away different hardware devices? How can you run a mix CPU/GPU environment over time? We’re very interested in that. We’re watching those types of tech stacks a lot.</p>
  Future of interfaces 
<p>Jon: Do you think you’ll need to have a new user interface or discovery mechanism just as the sheer quantity of games and experiences, if we’re moving towards the metaverse?</p>
<p>Dave: Whether it’s Amazon or Netflix or TikTok or YouTube, I think for us, the difficult discovery problem is you’re trying to optimize 10-year enterprise value along with your stock price every year that you get there. A lot of short-term discovery mechanisms do not optimize long-term value if some amazing creation gets suppressed, where it could have added 5% to the platform.</p>
<p>There are a lot of opportunities in discovery and it’s not a solved problem, although many companies are solving it in really interesting ways right now. I think there are ways the user interface can change as well. There’s a lot of opportunity in addition to thinking of this just as content and as your real-time social graph and thinking through what other people are doing.</p>
<p>Jon: It’s fascinating because one of the examples of AI being used by big companies that my team just talked about was Netflix, TikTok as well, with their very personalized feeds and recommendations. You could imagine a future where a user that onboards into Roblox doesn’t actually see a library or a catalog of games, but it’s just presented with a feed and it’s almost like you’re just going from one end to another…</p>
<p>Dave: This is really right. We are constantly testing the new user experience. Should that be 2D? Should that be 3D? What’s the weighting between creating your digital identity versus discovery? What’s the weighting between connecting with your friends and optimizing all that? We may find that has to be personalized.</p>
  Impact on creators 
<p>Jon: I want to shift briefly to the player perspective. Now that you have a couple of AI tools, things like the code assist and the material generator, what has been the reception from the creators or the players that have encountered this? Any feedback?</p>
<p>Dave: Whenever we give more capabilities to the user or the player base, we have historically seen a lot of acceleration, even if it’s very early. I think it’s still super early. The things we have launched right now are just a very light layer. Code generation and material generation, super exciting. Potentially prompt-driven avatar creation, even more exciting. Potentially, general-purpose 3D asset creation, even more exciting.</p>
<p>Jon: Do you think the types of games that leverage these sorts of technologies might change themselves in terms of the gameplay mechanics, like the genres that you might see emerge?</p>
<p>Dave: Yes. I’m optimistic that more people will have control of in-experience creation. For example, going back to the Project Runway or Karlie Kloss-type example, experiences where creation amongst 65M to 70M people as just part of the way it goes have not been possible. But, an experience where there’s millions of people acting as fashion designers and voting and picking who’s got the best stuff, then possibly imagining some of that going off and being produced in real life, or some of them being plucked up by Parsons and saying, “The future designer.”</p>
<p>Imagine there’s a racecar driver that got picked because they were so good at a simulator, or other genres like this, fashion design, other types of creation, where you actually create on the platform and then get identified as a future star.</p>
<p>Jon: I’m just really excited about the notion of taking the creativity that you find in kids doing imaginative play and then turbocharging that with AI tools. What if this would happen? What if there was a natural disaster in the middle of the room? Right now, it’s very difficult for those creators to make those experiences. But with a text prompt, you could imagine that there’s games that just materialize and just the diversity and the wildness of those experiences could be…</p>
<p>Dave: I think having a text prompt that’s generative not at the developer level building the big heavy game, but having text or voice prompt as just something that’s naturally part of any experience wherever you go. Rather than the traditional ways with either voxels or building things in 3D experiences, it just becomes natural to use a text prompt just like in a traditional avatar editor. Rather than sliders and radio buttons, that will move to a more interactive type text prompt.</p>
  NPCs as copilots 
<p>Jon: Something we’ve been excited about is the notion of NPCs as teachers and co-pilots. Let’s say the first time that you’re onboarding the Roblox, you could have a guide that basically shows you where to go next. Then if you’re interested in building it helps you lay your first few experiences together, and so on. That feels like it’s potentially very powerful as the concept of NPCs as copilots instead of co-players.</p>
<p>Dave: I think there’s a lot of interesting stuff going on in various ecosystems around this copilot notion. There’s one copilot where we’re all wearing our little earbuds all day long and that copilot is talking to us. That’s maybe more consumer real-time copilot. But there’s obviously many companies trying to build a copilot that you hook up to your email, your texts, your Slack, your web browser, and whatever, and it starts acting for you. I’m really interested in the notion that copilots will talk to other copilots using natural English, which I think will be the universal interface of copilots.</p>
<p>You could imagine NPCs being created by prompts. “Hey, I’m building a historical constitutional thing. I want George Washington there, but I want George Washington to act at the highest level of civility and usher new users through the experience, tell them a little about constitutional history, and go away when they’re done.” I actually do think you will see those kind of assistance.</p>
<p>Jon: That’s an incredible example because what better way to learn history than actually talking to the folks who were a part of that historical scene or time period? You could actually see how this advances the educational…</p>
<p>Dave: We’ve been talking a lot about the communication aspect of going to Ancient Rome with your friends. You’ll go to ancient Rome and most of the people you’ll interact with will be historically, as good as we can create, representations to enrich that experience. It’ll be pretty fascinating.</p>
  VR &amp; spatial computing 
<p>Jon: That’s pretty powerful. A couple of weeks ago, you tweeted that the Roblox app on Meta Quest had actually hit 1M downloads in just the first 5 days in its beta form. It wasn’t even out on the actual Oculus Store. What are your thoughts on VR and spatial computing?</p>
<p>Dave: Our thesis has been that, when the iPhone shipped and all of a sudden, we had 2D HTML consumable on a small screen rather than a large screen with the pinch and zoom—and now we take it for granted. My kids probably don’t realize there was some cheesy mobile web thing 10 years ago pre-iPhone, where browsers were large-screen things. Now we just assume 2D HMTL is everywhere. I think 3D is the same. It’s immersive multiplayer in the cloud, simulated 3D. Because of that, every device is optimal for the device camera and device user interaction and has different levels of immersiveness. Your phone is not as immersive as your VR headset, but your phone is more spontaneous.</p>
<p>We think the market ultimately figures out which device you consume this with. We’re not trying to move the market, but we do want to be in every place so we can watch the market move with our players.</p>
<p>I would say one of the historical things we’ve done is all of our 3D engineers are working on crappy Android devices as their primary test device, which helped with Oculus. I’m not saying it’s a crappy Android device, but I’m saying it’s rendering 2 eyes rather than 1, which is technically challenging. Having a foundation of we’re working at high performance rather than harvesting 16 cores helped us to do that.</p>
<p>Jon: It’s exciting to think about potentially different types of experiences being optimized for different devices. Maybe you play the Tycoon game on your PC where you have a mouse and keyboard and then you play a first-person shooter in the VR headset. You’re picking the right device.</p>
<p>Dave: That’s exactly right. It’s impossible to abstract all the way across hand controllers down to a phone.<br>
Jon: Make sense. So, a quick lightning round of fun questions to close. What is your favorite book?</p>
<p>Dave: “Infinite Game.”</p>
<p>Jon: What is your favorite game?</p>
<p>Dave: Chess.</p>
<p>Jon: What is the best advice that you have received as a young person from a mentor or a friend or someone?</p>
<p>Dave: I feel I didn’t get much good advice when I was young, actually. The worst advice I got from my dad was, “You should go into accounting and business.” My general advice to everyone would be: I thought my first 2 jobs were a disaster, but life is long. If you find something you’re really good at and you love at the same time, that’s obviously the optimal Venn diagram. It’s not to follow your passion; it’s not follow what you’re good at. If you can you overlap those Venn diagrams, that is the sweet spot.</p>
<p>Jon: What is one wild prediction for how you think the world will evolve over the next 5 years?</p>
<p>Dave: I have a Turing test question for AI. If we took AI in 1633 and trained on all the available information at that time, would it predict the earth or the sun is the center of the solar system even though 99.9% of the information is saying the earth is the center of the solar system? I think 5 years is right at the fringe, but if we were to run that AI Turing test, it might say the sun.</p>
<p>Jon: Do you have a different answer if it was 10 years?</p>
<p>Dave: 10 years, I think it’ll say the sun.</p>
<p>Jon: Awesome. Thank you, Dave. This has been a pleasure.</p>

<p>Will AI take all the design jobs? Dylan Field, founder and CEO of Figma, looks at the relationship between designers, developers, and AI, in conversation with a16z’s David George.</p>
 
 [00:36] Will AI replace designers? 
 [4:03] Jambot demo 
 [7:02] Human vs. AI creativity 
 [13:37] Applying AI to design 
 [14:31] Startups vs. incumbents 
 
  Will AI replace designers? 
<p>David: To start, fiery question. Is AI actually going to take the job of the designer in the future?</p>
<p>Dylan: I don’t think so. Implicit in the question is, “Well, there’d be less things to design, or is AI going to do all the design work?” You’re on one of those paths. The first one, “Will there be less things to design?” If you look at every technological shift or platform shift so far, it’s resulted in more things to design. You have the printing press and then you have to figure out what you put on a page. Even more recently, you have mobile. You would think, “Less pixels, less designers,” right? But no. That’s when we saw the biggest explosion of designers.</p>
<p>If you’d asked me this at the beginning of the year, you might have said, “We’ll all have these chat boxes and people will be asking questions in them and that’s going to be our interface for everything.” Look at OpenAI. They’re on a hiring acquisition spree trying to get product people and designers right now so they can make great consumer products. It turns out design matters.</p>
<p>The second path, “Will AI be doing the design?” is pretty interesting. So far, we’re not there. Right now, we’re at a place where AI might be doing the first draft. Getting from first draft to final product, it turns out that’s kind of hard and usually takes a team. If you could get AI to start to suggest interface elements to people and do that in a way that actually makes sense, I think that could unlock a whole new era of design in terms of creating contextual designs, designs that are responsive to what the user’s intent is at that moment. That’d be a fascinating era for all designers to be working in, but I don’t think it replaces the need for human designers.</p>
<p>David: You started to go into this in the second part, and I totally agree with you on the first part. This is a shift of abundance, just like the other technology shifts we’ve had in the past. Maybe go deeper on how AI is actually going to change the work itself that the designer does.</p>
<p>Dylan: I think AI will make it so that all of us are able to do more design work in the first place. It will lower the floor for who’s able to participate in the design process, but also raise the ceiling of what you can actually do.</p>
<p>As a designer, it will help you move across this ladder of abstraction that we’re all inherently working on. Everything from high-level prompting or ideation to pixel work to, “How exactly should this motion curve look?” Right now, if you’re trying to be the ultimate craftsperson, it takes a long time to learn all the necessary skills. But, again, if you’re able to get to that first draft with the help of AI, perhaps it makes it so that you’re able to more easily iterate on things and jump between the solution space and see more of the solution space. Then you can dive in and figure out, “In the solution space, what do I want to iterate on further?” On that topic, we actually have been exploring how AI should manifest in FigJam. I have a demo and I can show off some stuff.</p>
<p>David: Yes, yes, yes.</p>
  Jambot demo 
<p>Dylan: If you haven’t seen FigJam, this is our whiteboarding and brainstorming product. The idea for FigJam is that you do ideation in FigJam, design in Figma Design, and then we now have something called Dev Mode, too, where you’re able to go from design to code and production.</p>
<p>Here in this FigJam we’ve been doing this brainstorm, “What topic should I talk about at a16z? We’ve got some sticky notes. It’s like, “Figma’s vision for AI and future roadmap, how is Gen AI different for design versus text, etc.”</p>
<p>One thing we’re introducing today is this new thing called Jambot. Jambot makes it so you can create a diagram and wire something from a sticky or a section, which contains elements in your screen, to a prompt agent. For example, we’ve got this section here of the brainstorm and I’ve wired up to a custom prompt. The input contains the topics I’m going to cover in a presentation at the conference. Please suggest a list of ideas for a fun and novel title for this presentation.</p>
<p>I’ll press run and it’ll give me a bunch of different titles. I can now select “haiku” and now it’ll give me a haiku for each of these titles.</p>
<p>Nothing that we haven’t seen before from ChatGPT. Obviously, we’re running this off the backend of these systems. What I think is neat is that then you can start to explore your prompting in a more non-linear way. You’re also able to do it in a way where you can see the history of what you’ve done as a graph on the screen. For example, maybe I want to say, “What are the startups to watch working on AI?” Based on the prompt for startups to watch working on AI, it will suggest a list of options.” If I select “companies,” it’ll give me a list of companies.</p>
<p>Perhaps I want a rabbit hole on something. I can press “rabbit hole.” It selects the default, the first sticky, which is OpenAI. I’ll press that.</p>
<p>Now it’s going to give me some different options for things to look into. I could keep going there, or perhaps, based on Figma’s huge vision for AI and future roadmap, I could try to ideate there. Based on that, it will give me a bunch of stickies. Here it says different ways we could implement AI features in the Figma roadmap.The first one is to develop an AI-power design assistant.</p>
<p>Perhaps now we’re getting to the point where we want to explore how we launch this. If I press “rewrite” this as a tweet in the style of @zoink, that’s my Twitter username. Maybe make it shorter and less emojis.</p>
<p>What’s been really fun about this is it gives you a way to explore these topics. To me, this feels different than your typical chat session. It came out of a hackathon, actually.</p>
  Human vs. AI creativity 
<p>David: Going back to the conversation before you did the demo, I absolutely love what you said about raising the ceiling, and especially lowering the floor. When we actually originally made our investment in Figma, Peter, my partner, wrote in our thesis, “We are moving into the decade of design where design, not just code, is at the center of product development and successful organizations. The interface no longer reflects the code, but the code reflects the design.” Talk a little bit more about the relationship between designers, developers, and AI. And then: loaded topic—how would you differentiate the creativity of a machine or an AI versus that of a human?</p>
<p>Dylan: I think that’s just a sub-question of what’s the modern-day Turing test? This question comes up everywhere now. We’re now seeing from these systems that it’s easy to convince a human that you’re human. It’s hard to actually make good things. I could have GPT-4 create a business plan and come pitch to you. That doesn’t mean you’re going to invest. When you have 2 competing businesses side by side and one of them is run by AI and the other one is run by a human—and you invest in the AI business, then I’m worried. We’re not there yet.</p>
<p>David: That’s a good test.</p>
<p>Dylan: For Figma, again, getting to that first draft, I hope we’ll make it much easier. If we’re able to lower the floor and make it so more people in the organization can contribute to the design process, I suspect that we’ll get better results and more people will be able to explore the option space of what the company can do.</p>
<p>I also think that we’re all biased here. Our vision for Figma is to make design accessible to all. That’s been our vision for a long time now. Before that, it was to eliminate the gap between imagination and reality. Both of those work pretty well with this new world. We’ve actually seen that through design systems creating kits and systems of parts, anyone in the organization can use and bring into the design. That has unlocked a lot for designers and for everyone in the organization to be able to contribute to the design process. It’s made results better for everybody. Now most companies that are at scale have design systems teams so more people are able to contribute to that process. I think this will be welcomed by designers.</p>
<p>David: Talk about the actual elements of design itself and the tools that you provide. One, collaboration, and two, the ease with which you can create. With AI, you massively open up the opportunity for creation. Talk about the actual tasks and some of the upleveling that you envision now that we have AI.</p>
<p>Dylan: What’s interesting is that even before this moment in time, we’ve already been seeing roles collapse. Designers and developers, for example, the line is getting a lot more blurry than it was in the past. The best designers are starting to think much more about code; the best developers are thinking much more about design. Beyond designers and developers, if you think about a product person, for example, before they were working on a spec but now they’re going much more into mockups. It’s not because they’re trying to take the job of a designer. It’s because they’re trying to communicate their ideas more effectively.</p>
<p>This will eventually allow anyone in the organization to go from idea to design and possibly to production as well, much faster. I think you’ll still need to hone each of those steps. You’ll need someone to really think through, “What ideas are we going to explore? How are we going to explore them?” You’ll want to tweak the designs and finesse them properly to go from first draft to final product. And on the code side, we’re not at full self-driving for code yet. Perhaps one day we will get there, but I think we’re still a long way out. Right now I can’t really generate a ReadMe for an open source project.</p>
  Applying AI to design 
<p>David: Earlier, you mentioned the printing press and revolutionizing the way that we communicate and distribute content. I think AI is doing something similar, or maybe even more powerful. The question I have is about the format. Most of the LLMs today that we’re accessing are just text-based or image generation-based. How is applying generative AI to design actually different from just text or images?</p>
<p>Dylan: On a technical level, if you look at the actual internal structure of a Figma document, it’s much more similar to an abstract syntax tree and less similar to some image. Because of that, one outcome might be that we find more success with models that are similar to copilot than you do with a diffusion model, for example, when you’re trying to figure out how you actually create designs using AI systems.</p>
<p>That said, some of the foundational models are really good. If you ask GPT-4, “I want to have this dog sitter app. Can you give me the basic XML structure for that?” It’ll give you that. It’ll give you some very simplistic layout that maybe is going to spark something for you.</p>
<p>The other day I was creating a birthday card for my friend, Ari. He’s really into retro computer stuff, so I asked GPT-4, “What would be a good structure for a program called Ari Online?” just to see what it would say. It gave me a pretty good structure of jokes. I selected a few of them and I made a birthday card and HyperCard out of it because I was trying to be really retro in terms of those emulators available. I’m getting a little off-topic, but the point being that you can get some basic structure from these foundational models too, but they don’t take you all the way there. A lot of our job right now as we think about text design in Figma is figuring out, “How do we leverage all the different tools available in order to make good progress?”</p>
<p>David: What do you think are the big breakthroughs that need to happen in order to actually take this next level? Then where do you think that gets you from a product standpoint? I’m talking technical, arms and legs, memory, etc.</p>
<p>Dylan: The way we’re approaching it from Figma’s perspective is not putting all of our eggs in one basket. The demo is a good example of that. We have done a lot to try to make sure that everyone in the company knows how important it is to take this technology and use it across our entire product. As we’ve done that, there have been a bunch of different areas that I wouldn’t have predicted where it seems like AI might be very useful. Now, the next question will be, “Where does the cost make sense and where is the usability predictable?” It’s going to be more helpful than not, usually, versus once in a while it gives you something good. It usually gives you something good.</p>
  Startups vs. incumbents 
<p>David: I want to shift gears just a little bit and move towards the business and market structure side of things. We’re all very excited about AI. We think it’s the biggest thing since the microchip. We’re very confident in that. Where we potentially have very low confidence is who will be the winners and where in the value chain will value accrue on the business side. In the question of startups versus incumbents, I think there’s a case to be made that a company like Figma is perfectly positioned to take advantage of this because you actually have some distribution, you have customer relationships, but you also are a young company. You ship fast, you move fast, you can disrupt yourself. I’m curious about your take on who is best positioned given that dynamic, and then if you have any view of where in the value chain you think value will accrue.</p>
<p>Dylan: On the question of startups versus incumbents, it’s hard to believe that foundational models won’t get commoditized, but I’m definitely willing to be proven wrong there. I understand the arguments for why incumbents may benefit in a disproportionate way. In every platform shift that’s happened, people have claimed that, and then it hasn’t been the case. I think if you’re a startup, this is a pretty good time to pick the area that you think could really benefit from the technology and go after it and try to find ways to make innovation there. I wouldn’t bet against startups in a general sense there. It’s so early. Most of what I see coming right now is still at the foundational/base model area and, if it’s not that, it’s infrastructure or dev tools. It’s not at all, “How do we use this all the way up the stack?” I think that that’s coming. Enterprise is coming. There’s a lot of stuff that will show up in all these areas, but it’s going to take some time.</p>
<p>David: The concept on the enterprise side, which is interesting to think about, is software. People always talk about their systems of record, and that’s the powerful moat of a software company. Over the last handful of years, systems of record have been pretty good at becoming systems of prediction. But there’s still a bunch of workflow and windows that people click around in. The promise of AI—and I’m curious for your take on this—is that we’ll actually create a system of action. We’ll actually do the action on your behalf, and that completely transforms what interface you need. With the foundational models, it probably changes the way that your data is organized underneath and accessed, too.</p>
<p>Dylan: I still believe that there will probably be a human in the loop for quite a while. I do like the idea of a system of action and how you actually help people get through the tasks that are really obvious so that they can focus on higher-level work. I suspect that if we’re able to do that effectively, then the way work will happen will be fundamentally transformed, which is pretty exciting.</p>
<p>David: On this topic, and we danced around it before, when you originally built the product, one of your biggest unlocks was actually building in the browser. That enabled collaboration, which was entirely new in the design space. Famously, it took you many years to actually ship your product because the build was so complex architecturally. Now you can access an API and immediately get the model and the value to the end user. Do you think this time is different and the use cases and the winners will be determined much faster? Or do you think we’re still steps away and they just are either technological, business, or good idea unlocks?</p>
<p>Dylan: Everyone that talks to me and says, “We’re trying to build our startup like Figma. We’re going to take years to develop it, and we’ll go talk to our first user.” I’m like, “First of all, it’s not what we did. And second of all, don’t do that.” I would encourage anyone who’s starting a company or trying to ship a software product to try to get it out to market as fast as you can. At the same time, if you look at the arc of machine learning and what might be coming, there might be a lull between where we’re at now with LLMs and where folks say we’re going with AGI.</p>
<p>David: In closing, most of the audience here is a room full of builders. If you were starting another company or giving advice to someone who’s thinking about starting another company, where would you go build given this big shift? What do you want to see get built?</p>
<p>Dylan: Well, that’s a different question than what would I build. I’ll just answer, “What do I want to see?” because I think it’s the one I like the most. When it comes to science, the applications of all this technology that’s happening right now are still completely underexplored. Whether it’s using deep learning to get approximations of systems faster or figuring out how we can just accelerate human progress in general, I get really excited about what could happen there.</p>
<p>David: Then what would you build?</p>
<p>Dylan: Figma!</p>
<p>David: Yes! Exactly. Exactly. It’s clear that AI has got just massive potential for you, for Figma, for the design space, and for the individuals who are actually building a design. Thank you so much for being here with us. We’re excited to see what you guys ship next.</p>
<p>Dylan: Thank you.</p>

<p>Cofounder and CEO of Anthropic Dario Amodei unpacks how far can scaling laws take us and how AI can be used to improve AI.</p>

 [18:10] Anthropic’s Roadmap 
 
  Dario’s background 
<p>Anj: I’m going to take you all back in time to about 3 years ago. You and Tom, one of your cofounders, gave me a call, and said, “Hey, we think we’re going to start Anthropic.” I asked you, “What do you think we need to get going?” You said, “Well, I think we can get by with like $500.” I said, “I think we can find $500K somewhere.” I remember you, deadpan, saying, “Dude, I’m talking about $500M.” That’s when I realized things were going to be a little bit different.</p>
<p>Most people here know you as the founder of Anthropic. I think it would be helpful to hear how you got there.</p>
<p>Dario: I started in a very different field. I was initially an undergrad in physics. I just wanted to understand the universe. AI wasn’t even on my radar. It seemed like science fiction. Near the end of my undergrad, I started looking very carefully at Moore’s Law. I read the works of Ray Kurzweil and felt like there was something there and that AI was really going to go somewhere. But I didn’t really know how to work on it.</p>
<p>The big thing in those days was support vector machines. It wasn’t anything that seemed very exciting. So, I decided to go to grad school in neuroscience because that was the closest thing to an intelligence that I could actually study. Near the end of grad school, I started to see all this stuff about AlexNet and Quark. Back then it was actually starting to work, so I ended up joining Andrew Ng’s group at Baidu that worked on speech recognition. Then I was at Google Brain for a year and then I was one of the first folks to join OpenAI. I was there for about 5 years, and that takes us to the founding of Anthropic.</p>
<p>Anj: What was it at that moment—when you and the team at OpenAI had started publishing your first experiments towards the end of that 5-year period—you just talked about around scaling laws that gave you so much confidence that this was going to hold when everybody else thought that was crazy talk?</p>
  GPT-2’s emergent capabilities 
<p>Dario: For me, the moment was actually GPT-2 in 2019. There were 2 different perspectives on it. When we put out GPT-2, some of the stuff that was considered most impressive at the time was, “Oh, my God. You give these 5 examples of English to French translation. Just offer it straight into the language model. Then you put in a sixth sentence in English and it actually translates into French. It actually understands the pattern.” That was crazy to us, even though the translation was terrible. It was almost worse than if you were to just take a dictionary and substitute word for word.</p>
<p>Our view is that this is the beginning of something amazing because there’s no limit and you can continue to scale it up. There’s no reason why the patterns we’ve seen before won’t continue to hold. The objective of predicting the next word is so rich and there’s so much you can push against that it just absolutely has to work. Some people looked at it and were like, “You made a bot that translates really badly.” It was 2 very different perspectives on the same thing. We just really, really believed in the first perspective.</p>
<p>Anj: Famously, what happened then was you saw a reason to continue down that line of inquiry, which resulted in GPT-3. What do you think was the most dramatic difference between GPT-3 and the previous efforts?</p>
<p>Dario: I think it was much larger and scaled up to a substantial extent. The thing that really surprised me was the Python programming, the conventional wisdom, these models couldn’t reason at all. When I saw the Python programming, even though it was very simple, even though a lot of it was stuff you could memorize, you could put it in new situations and come up with something that isn’t going to be anywhere in GitHub. It was just showing the beginning of being able to do it. I felt that that ultimately meant that we could keep scaling the models and they would get very good at reasoning.</p>
<p>Anj: What was the moment at which you realized, “It’s sort of working to a prototypical level with reasoning, but we think, with the Python program, this is actually going to generalize much broader than we expect.” What were some of the signals there that gave you that conviction?</p>
<p>Dario: I think one of the signals was that we hadn’t actually done any work. We just scraped the web and there was enough Python data in the web to get these good results. When we looked through it, maybe 0.1% to 1% of the data that we scraped was Python data. So, the conclusion was, “Well, if it does so well with so little of our data and so little effort to curate it on our part, it must be that we can enormously amplify this.” That just made me think, “We’re getting more compute, we can scale up the models more, and we can greatly increase the amount of data that is programming.” We have so many ways that we can amplify this, so of course it’s going to work. It’s just a matter of time.</p>
<p>Anj: You and the team acted very strongly on that impulse to pursue scaling laws. We fast forward 2 years and it’s hard to fathom the sheer amount of progress that’s happened in 24 months. When we start looking out to the next 24 to 36 months, what do you think the biggest bottlenecks are in demonstrating that the scaling laws continue holding?</p>
  Scaling laws 
<p>Dario: I think there’s 3 elements. There’s data, there’s compute, and there’s algorithmic improvements. I think we are on track. Even if there were no algorithmic improvements from here, even if we just scaled up what we had so far, I think the scaling laws are going to continue. I think that’s going to lead to amazing improvements that everyone, including me, is prone to underestimate. The biggest factor is simply more money is being poured into it. By all accounts—I won’t give exact numbers—the most expensive models made today cost about $100M, plus or minus a factor of 2. I think that next year we’re probably going to see, from multiple players, models on the order of $1B. And in 2025, we’re going to see models on the order of several billion, perhaps even $10B. That factor of 100 plus the compute inherently getting faster with the H100s, that’s been a particularly big jump because of the move to lower precision. If you put all those things together, and if the scaling laws continue, there’s going to be a huge increase in capabilities.</p>
<p>Anj: You’ve pointed out consistently that if we just scale our current architectures, we get there. What do you think will end up unlocking performance while allowing for these models to be more efficient from an architectural perspective? Do you think we need a fundamentally new approach?</p>
<p>Dario: My basic view is that inference will not get that much more expensive. The basic logic of the scaling laws is that if you increase compute by a factor of n, you need to increase data by a factor of square root of n and size the model by a factor of square root of n. That square root basically means the model itself does not get that much bigger and the hardware is getting faster while you’re doing it. I think these things are going to continue to be servable for the next 3 or 4 years. If there’s no architectural innovation, they’ll get a little bit more expensive. If there’s architectural innovation, which I expect there to be, they’ll get somewhat cheaper.</p>
  Physicists in AI 
<p>Anj: What is the skill set and the talent required to unlock those architectural innovations? For a long time, this was not well understood, but you had this physicist-only leaning. What is it about the training of physicists that made you so convinced? The early 4 out of the first 7 cofounders had physics backgrounds, not traditional AI or machine learning backgrounds.</p>
<p>Dario: There are 2 kinds of fields at any given point in time. There are fields where an enormous edifice of experience and accumulated knowledge has been built up and you need many years to become an expert in that field. The canonical example of that would be biology. It’s very hard to contribute groundbreaking or Nobel Prize work in biology if you’ve only been a biologist for 6 months.</p>
<p>Then there are fields that are very young or that are moving very fast. AI was, and still is to some extent, very young and is definitely moving very fast. When that’s the case, really talented generalists can often outperform those who have been in the field for a long time because things are being shaken up so much. If anything, having a lot of prior knowledge can be a disadvantage. Because several of our cofounders were physicists, we thought that was at least one pool of people where there’s a lot of raw talent without necessarily experience in the field. That’s generally borne out, we’ve hired a number of them, and we have statistics on it. It works.</p>
<p>Anj: I remember in the early days of building the company there was this very strong belief you had that, if we got enough physicists and a few infrastructure engineers in the same room, we could scale the quality of the output much, much faster than teams that might be bigger and better resourced. Fast forward to now where you’re starting to become a fairly well-resourced company and a team. What is the hardest part of your talent pool to maintain as you start scaling beyond that 100-person full-time employee mark?</p>
<p>Dario: As companies get larger, everything gets harder. Our general view is that talent density beats talent mass every time. On the commercial side, maybe less so on the research side, you just need to do things. You have a list of customers. You need one person to serve this customer and one person to serve that customer. You have a list of features and you need one person to implement this feature and one person to implement that feature. Those numbers add up. The challenge is to maintain that very high level of talent density as you scale. We’ve done very, very well at that so far. We always have debates among the leadership team. “Oh, my God, we’re growing too fast. We can’t possibly maintain the talent bar.” We’ve always managed to do it in the past, but it’s a constant tension.</p>
<p>Anj: It would be helpful to take a few minutes to hear your belief about constitutional AI, which is the regime you proposed earlier this year. Then we can talk a little bit about the implications of what that means for the safety and future of these models.</p>
  Constitutional AI 
<p>Dario: The method that’s been dominant for steering the values and the outputs of AI systems, up until recently, has been RL from human feedback. I was one of the coinventors of that at OpenAI. Since then, it’s been improved to power ChatGPT. The way that method works is that humans give feedback on model outputs, such as which model outputs they like better. Over time, the model learns what the humans want and learns to emulate that. Constitutional AI, you can think of it as the AI itself giving the feedback. Instead of human raters, you have a set of principles, and our set of principles is in our constitution. It’s very short; 5 pages. We’re constantly updating it. There could be different constitutions for different use cases, but this is where we’re starting from. Whenever you train the model, you simply have the AI system read the constitution, look at some task, summarize this content, or give your opinion on X. It will say, “The AI system will complete the task.” Then you have another copy of the AI system say, “Was this in line with the constitution or was it not?” At the end of this, if you train it, the hope is that the model acts in line with this guide star set of principles.</p>
<p>Anj: As a result of that approach, the seed of the constitution captures some set of values of the constitutional authors. How are you grappling with the debate that you are imposing your values on the constitutional system?</p>
<p>Dario: There are a couple of directions in that. First, when we took the original constitution, we tried to add as little of our own content as possible. We added things from the UN Declaration on Human Rights, generally agreed upon deliberative principles, and some principles from Apple’s terms of service. They’re very vanilla, like, “produce content that would be acceptable if shown to children.” Or, “don’t violate fundamental human rights.” From there, we’re going in 2 directions. One is that different use cases demand different operating principles and maybe even different values. A psychotherapist probably behaves in a very different way from a lawyer. The idea of having a very simple core and then specializing in different directions from there is a way not to have this “mono-constitution” that applies to everyone. Second, we’re looking into the idea of some kind of deliberative democratic process whereby people can design constitutions.</p>
<p>Anj: To folks who aren’t privy to what’s going on inside of Anthropic, you can often seem paradoxical because you’ve found a way to efficiently scale and keep the scaling laws proceeding. At the same time, you’re big advocates of making sure that this doesn’t happen very fast. What is the thinking behind that paradox?</p>
<p>Dario: One of the things that most drives the trade-offs is—and you see it a bit in constitutional AI—that the best solutions to a lot of the safety problems almost always involve AI itself. There’s a community of very theoretically-oriented people that tries to work on AI safety, separate from the development of AI. My assessment of this—I don’t know if others would say it was fair—is that it hasn’t been that successful. The things that have been successful, even though there’s much more to do, are areas where AI has helped us to make AI safe.</p>
<p>Now, why would that happen? As AI gets more powerful, it gets better at most cognitive tasks. One of the relevant cognitive tasks is judging the safety of AI systems, eventually doing safety research. There’s a self-referential component to it. We even see it with areas like interpretability, looking inside the neural nets. We thought at the beginning—we’ve had a team on that since the beginning—it would be very separate, but it converged in 2 ways.</p>
<p>One is that powerful AI systems can help us to interpret the neurons of weaker AI systems. Again, there’s that recursive process. Second, interpretability insights often tell us a bit about how models work. When they tell us how models work, they often suggest ways that those models could be better or more efficient. These things are very intertwined with each other. We’re still working on frameworks for this, both regulatory and following it ourselves, but one broad way that we’ve been thinking about it from the beginning and are probably going to work more on formalizing it over the coming months and years, is this idea of safe scaling or checkpointing.</p>
<p>There could be an alternating step where you advance the level in capability, and then there’s a gate where you have to show, “If you want to get to the next level, you have to show that your model has certain safe properties.”</p>
<p>Anj: What do you think is the biggest trade-off by taking the path of “let’s implement the gates?”</p>
<p>Dario: We need to be careful to not put in a bunch of red tape that isn’t necessary. If you have to fill out 1000 pages of paperwork and get 15 different licenses from different bodies to make an AI system, that’s never going to work. That’s going to slow things down. Other adversaries, authoritarian countries, will get ahead of us. I don’t think we can do that. If you look at things like airplane safety or auto safety, to the extent that regulations have ever done a good job of balancing allowing things to move forward with “people could die if we get this wrong,” I think those are examples of getting it at least relatively right.</p>
  Anthropic’s roadmap 
<p>Anj: We only have a couple of minutes left, so I’m going to shift. You had a very busy summer of Anthropic drops, a 100K context window, and you released Claude 2. You’re being pretty vocal about scaling the models and then exposing them to real-world interactions. You’re building a whole ecosystem. There’s a room full of founders here who are trying to understand whether they can build on top of the Anthropic platform. What’s the advice you’d offer folks because who are trying to figure out where Claude, Anthropic, and the roadmap go?</p>
<p>Dario: One thing that people are starting to realize, but is still underappreciated, is the longer context and things that come along with what we’re working on. Retrieval or search really open up the ability of the models to talk to very large databases. One thing we say is, “You can talk to a book, a legal document, or a financial statement.” People have this picture in their minds of, “There’s this chatbot. I ask it a question and it answers the question.” But the idea that you can upload a legal contract and say, “What are the 5 most unusual terms in this legal contract?” Or upload a financial statement and say, “Summarize the position of this company. What is surprising relative to what this analyst said 2 weeks ago?” All this knowledge manipulation and processing large bodies of data that take hours for people to read—I think much more is possible with that than what people are doing. We’re just at the beginning. That’s an area I’m particularly excited about because there are a lot of benefits and all the costs that we’ve talked about, for this generation of models, I’m not too worried.</p>
<p>Anj: How long until infinite context windows?</p>
<p>Dario: The main thing holding back infinite context windows is, as you make the context window longer and longer, the majority of the compute starts to be in the context window. At some point, it just becomes too expensive in terms of compute. We’ll never have literally infinite context windows, but we are interested in continuing to extend the context windows and to provide other means of interfacing with large amounts of data.</p>
<p>Anj: Well, we are out of time. Thank you, Dario.</p>
<p>Dario: Thank you for having me.</p>

<p>Daphne Koller is the founder and CEO of insitro, a company using AI and machine learning to engineer drug discovery. In this conversation with a16z’ Vijay Pande, she discusses how an LLM for cells could revolutionize drug discovery and how to bridge the technological and cultural divide between building with atoms and building with bits.</p>

 [03:23] AI in the life sciences 
 [07:02] LLM for cells 
 [11:37] Engineering disease and drug discovery 
 [13:33] Bits vs. atoms 
 [17:36] The opportunity ahead 
 
  Why life sciences? 
<p>Vijay: Daphne is the OG’s OG in AI. She was a pioneer at Stanford in different areas of AI, especially in PGMs. She left Stanford to cofound Coursera with Andrew Ng and is now the founder and CEO of Insitro, a tech bio company using AI to develop drugs in life sciences. Daphne, given all the things you could be doing, why life sciences?</p>
<p>Daphne: I think there are 3 parts to the question: why life sciences, why now, and why me? I’m going to answer all 3 parts. Life sciences is one of the really hard and really important problems, and there are very few things that are as challenging and exciting as intervening in human health in a safe and effective way. It’s just a thing that absolutely needs to be done if we are going to use AI for good, which is one of the things I really strive to do.</p>
<p>The second part of the question is why now? What brought me back to this field back in 2016, post-Coursera, was the realization that we can now, finally, for the first time, measure biology at scale, both at the cellular level—sometimes at subcellular level—and at the organism level via ways of quantitating human biology. For the very first time, that gives us the ability to deploy machine learning in ways where it is truly meaningful because the data sets are large enough for really interesting machine learning methods to be deployed.</p>
<p>I am a big believer in leverage, or places where you can have a disproportionately large impact. I spent a large part of my Stanford career working in these 2 spaces simultaneously—core machine learning and machine learning in service of biomedical data—I actually have the ability to bridge the chasm between these 2 very disparate disciplines.</p>
<p>When I was leaving Coursera in 2016 I saw even at that time, which is tiny compared to where we are today, that while machine learning was changing the world, it wasn’t having much of an impact in the life sciences. I believe one of the main reasons is because there are so very few people who actually have the language of both disciplines and are able to bring them together. I felt like I could have an impact in AI across many things, but here I could have disproportionate impact.</p>
  AI in the life sciences 
<p>Vijay: You spoke about the why now. What’s your take on AI for life sciences? What’s the “why now” there? What’s different now than even what we could do even just 5 years ago?</p>
<p>Daphne: I think it comes back to this ability to collect, but even more than collect, generate data at scale. One of the truly unique things that we have at Insitro is a data factory. We have put together the tools that have been developed by people who are taking pluripotent stem cells which are cells from you, or me, or anyone in this audience, and turning them into this pluripotent status—which can make a Daphne neuron in a dish or a Daphne hepatocyte. That condition is going to be different from the Vijay neuron and the Vijay hepatocyte because we have different genetics. That’s going to manifest in how these cells look and behave, and different measurements.</p>
<p>We can engineer those to introduce a disease-causing mutation and ask, “What does that disease-causing mutation do to a Daphne neuron versus what does it do to a Vijay neuron? What does this mutation do versus that mutation?” We’re able to do data generation on spec. That is a truly unique capability, which, frankly, is not that easy to do, even in other areas where AI is being deployed. You don’t get to make your own data in many cases, but here we do. That creates really important discovery opportunities for life sciences, but also really cool and interesting machine learning problems. You could start doing active learning or do experimental design, and it’s a really exciting technical discipline at this point.</p>
<p>Vijay: Could you dive a little deeper and give an example? Your paper on the POSH approach came out on Archive. Could you double-click on that? Tell people what you did there, especially why AI in life science is a big deal. What could you hope to get?</p>
<p>Daphne: First of all, let me tell you a little bit about that platform which is called POSH, or Pooled Optical Screening in Humans. You take a bunch of cells, they can be cancer cells or whatever, and you put them with a pool of CRISPR guides that edit them. Each cell gets a different guide. Now you have a bunch of cells, each with a genetically diverse mutation, that are all sitting there in a pool. You can measure them with a microscope as they move around and do their thing. You can basically fix them and sequence the barcode that came with a guide. So now you can say, “This cell that got this guide behaved this way and this other cell behaves that way.”</p>
<p>I can tell you that 1 of the really challenging things about cells is because they’re alive, if you put different cells in different wells, then they each have a slightly different environment and you get subtle differences and it’s really hard to reconcile. When they’re all in a pool, you eliminate all of those artifacts, and all of a sudden you have the ability to measure a genome-wide CRISPR screen. You have 20,000 genes in the genome all modifying the same cellular background in the same dish with a different genetic intervention—and you’re measuring that on a genome-wide scale in 10 or 12 plates in 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Imagine doing that, rinse, repeat, and doing genome-wide scale on this genetic background or in this cell type. You can really start to decipher the genotype-phenotype connection and the effect in which individual genetics makes a difference on cellular phenotypes, which we then translate to what we believe they will have in terms of clinical impact. That is the beginning of an understanding of what we want to modify to have meaningful therapeutic interventions. This is a truly engineered approach to discovery.</p>
  Developing an LLM for cells 
<p>Vijay: The biology part is really critical because now you get the data, and we all know how important that is. One of the things I found intriguing is the creation of a latent space for human biology, and especially being able to tell the difference between disease and non-disease, or even different disease phenotype. How does that come about and how is AI driving that?</p>
<p>Daphne: I’m going to go back a step because you said one of the things we need to do is get the data. I should have mentioned that it’s impossible to run this instrument without AI being built into it because you can’t even segment the cells; you can’t call the barcodes. All of it is an AI-enabled architecture.</p>
<p>Every part of our technology stack is intrinsically AI-enabled. To your point, Vijay, now you have a whole bunch of cellular images, what do you do with them? The first thing we do is we built this latent space. We built a language model for biology, but you’d have to explain this to people. No one knew what I was talking about. Now I’m just saying, “It’s just like GPT, but for cells.”</p>
<p>We have the language of cells and what cells look like, or the transcriptional, or gene expression profiles of cells. You measure hundreds of millions of cells in different states. With a much more limited amount of data—because we have this latent space—then just like the large language models for natural language with a small amount of data, you can start asking, “How does a disease-causing gene move you from one place to the other? How does a treatment move you hopefully back from the disease state back to the healthy state?” That’s super powerful. And it’s the gift that keeps on giving.</p>
<p>Like other language models, it keeps getting better the more data you feed it. Over time, you end up with a better and better competitive moat of how understanding the core foundations of biology help you better understand disease and health. This is not just for cellular data. The other source of data that we use is clinical data.</p>
<p>We do the same thing with histopathology. There’s so much more in histopathology than your pathologist typically looks at. In MRI data, your radiologist doesn’t see more than a small percentage of what’s there in your radiology images. It’s also not just imaging. There are also other modalities where there’s an equal amount of information left on the table. Over time, we’re learning the languages of different biological modalities and the ability to translate between them.</p>
  Engineering disease and drug discovery 
<p>Vijay: This concept of a foundation model for biology is particularly exciting because 10 years ago, you could have ML that was predictive, you just needed maybe 100 activities. The problem is if you have 100 examples of a drug that works, you don’t need to design a drug. These low-shot, 0-shot approaches that come from a foundation model are really night and day. How far does this go? The big problem in biology is that biology is hard.</p>
<p>Daphne: Biology is really hard. Sometimes I ask myself, “Why am I doing this?” I could go write an app for, like, a chat agent company.</p>
<p>Vijay: It would be a lot easier. So, why are you doing it? What is the big win? Where does this go by the end of the decade? What could you hope to do that we couldn’t do before?</p>
<p>Daphne: We want do it in a different way and come up with a very systematic recipe for you to go from a decision that I want to work on ALS or fatty liver disease, through a sequence of steps toward something that results in a meaningful intervention in the right patient population.</p>
<p>The hope is by the end of this decade, we will have built this process, run through it a number of times, and delivered some medicines to patients in our first tranche of indications. Then we will have learned enough from that so we can now say, “Here’s how we’re going to do it here, and here, and here.”</p>
<p>It’s not only machine learning that moves forward over time, it’s also the biological tools that we’re relying on. It used to be that there wasn’t any CRISPR. There was just siRNA. Actually, there wasn’t even that. Then there’s CRISPR base editing and now there’s CRISPR prime that replaces entire regions of the genome. The tools that we’re building on also get better and better over time, which unlocks more and more diseases that we could tackle in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>Vijay: Let’s step back for a second because it may not be clear for everyone why biology is so hard. One of the biggest reasons is that if we can do tons of experiments on mice, it’s a great time to be a rich mouse. You could be cured of any disease. All these diseases can be cured in mice, but it’s obviously unethical to experiment on people. That’s one of the big reasons why trials fail. When you go into a clinical trial, you spend all this money to get there. You’re spending hundreds of millions of dollars in the trial, and it turns out mice are different than people—and it fails. How can AI help that?</p>
<p>Daphne: First of all, this notion that we can cure lots of mice is something that really drove our discovery strategy at Insitro, which is that all of our work is done in human and human-derived systems. That incorporates at least some subset of human cells working together.</p>
<p>That’s one piece, and the nice thing about it is that it allows you to intervene in those systems and ask the “what if” questions. The counterfactuals like, “What if I had this person’s biology, but in a world where this gene was inactive versus active, or the other way around?” That’s great, but obviously you want to cure people, not cells or even organoids, so the other source of data we bring in is data from people, from clinical records.</p>
<p>Without machine learning, without AI, the space would be so complex and so high-dimensional that you couldn’t even make sense of it, far less a bridge between those 2 different worlds.</p>
  Bridging the divide between bits and atoms 
<p>Vijay: That makes sense. Let’s change gears a bit and talk a bit about company building. One of the interesting things that you’ve done is you’ve brought together people who are biology experts with people who are ML/AI experts. How do you build that culture? What does that look like, especially since they’re from fairly different parts of the universe?</p>
<p>Daphne: First of all, it may not have been obvious to everybody, but the company name, Insitro, is actually the blend of “in silico” and “in vitro”—”in silico” being in the computer and “in vitro” being in the lab. Those elements of bringing those 2 strands together are so deeply woven even into our logo.</p>
<p>How you build that is really hard. If you take your average machine learning scientist and your average life scientist, even if they’re very well-intentioned, and put them into the room together, they might as well be talking Thai and Swahili to each other. The languages are different, the ways in which they think are totally different. So how do you create a shared language, a shared vision?</p>
<p>There are a few tricks or approaches that we use. First of all, we hire some number of people—you can’t get enough of them, unfortunately—who are in the middle and can be translators for both sides and bring them together. The other really important part is that you create a culture and you hire very rigorously to that culture of people who are genuinely interested in engaging with the other side.</p>
<p>We have a list of company values. The final value, which is one that I hold particularly dear—it’s last, not because it’s least important, but because they’re ordered from what we do to how we do it—is that we engage with each other openly, constructively, and with respect. Each of those words matters. Engage means that we’re not siloed. All of our work is done in cross-functional project teams. “Openly” means an openness to asking really naive questions when you don’t understand and to accepting really naive suggestions from somebody else because sometimes, the best ideas come from an orthogonal mindset.</p>
<p>Vijay: Especially as AI gets into areas that are not just the world of bits, but in the world of atoms: any advice for how to bridge those gaps?</p>
<p>Daphne: Having an appreciation for the complexity of atoms, especially when your atoms are part of life’s systems, they behave in unexpected, unpredictable, idiosyncratic ways that sometimes cause a lot of pain. When you do biological experiments, 1 of the strongest signals when you apply machine learning is: who was the technician who actually did the experiment? They behave a little bit differently, they pipette a little bit differently, they treat the cells a little bit differently. It’s amazing how hard it is to clean that up, which is one of the reasons why we spend so much of our time building robots. They do the same thing over and over again.</p>
<p>I think having a lot of respect for atoms but also an appreciation for the fact that the next frontier of the impacts that AI can have is when AI starts to touch the physical world. We’ve all seen just how much harder that is. We’ve all seen how hard it is to build a self-driving car compared to building a chatbot. We’ve made so much progress on building chatbots and self-driving cars are still blocking fire trucks in San Francisco. Having an appreciation for that complexity, but also an appreciation for the magnitude of the impact, if you can actually nail it.</p>
  The opportunity ahead 
<p>Vijay: You’re talking about life sciences in terms of healthcare and drug design, but there’s a lot more to biology than just drugs. Where do you think this confluence between AI and life sciences goes from here?</p>
<p>Daphne: I actually think that there is this incredible opportunity at this intersection between the 2 fields. Think back on the history of science. At certain times in our history, there have been eras where a particular scientific discipline has made incredible amounts of progress in a relatively short amount of time because there was a click. We started to see the world in different ways or there was a tool that wasn’t available before.</p>
<p>If you think back to the late 1800s, that was chemistry where we suddenly realized we couldn’t really turn lead into gold. There was this thing called the periodic table and there were electrons. It really shifted chemistry. Then, in the early 1900s, obviously that discipline was physics. The connection between energy and matter and between space and time completely shifted our understanding of the universe.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, that discipline was computing. We got these machines that perform calculations that, up until that point, only a human was able to perform. Then in the 1990s, there was this interesting bifurcation. On the one side, there was data science that ultimately drew on computers, but also had elements of neuroscience and optimization, and statistics. That ultimately gave us modern-day machine learning and AI.</p>
<p>And then the other side was quantitative biology, which was the first time where we started to measure biology on a scale that was more than tracking 3 genes across an experiment that took 5 years. That was the first microarray data and the first human genome.</p>
<p>This time that we’re living in is when those last 2 disciplines are actually going to merge. They’re giving us an era of what I think of as digital biology, which is the ability to measure biology at unprecedented fidelity and scale, interpret the unbelievable masses of data, different biological scales, and different systems using the tools of machine learning and data science. Then bring that back to engineer biology using tools like CRISPR and genome editing, so we can make biology do things that it would otherwise not want to do.</p>
<p>Vijay: Like what?</p>
<p>Daphne: There’s applications in human health and agriculture. I don’t think we need to tell anybody anymore, although there’s still some people who might need to hear it, about the impact of global warming and climate change on our world, and the fact that we need to have crops that are much more resistant to drought and severe weather.</p>
<p>Vijay: And to feed 10B people.</p>
<p>Daphne: To feed 10B people. There are opportunities in the environment to maybe do better carbon sequestration using plants or algae. There’s biomaterials and so on. There are so many opportunities at this intersection that I would encourage any of you in this audience who are looking for something truly aspirational and exciting to do. This convergence is a moment in time for us to make a really big difference in the world that we live in using tools that exist today that did not exist even 5 years ago.</p>
<p>Vijay: I think that’s the opportunity at hand. We’ll wrap up there. Let’s thank Daphne one more time.</p>

<p>Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott, in conversation with a16z’s Bob Swan, explains how AI copilots are keeping developers longer in a flow state and why AI copilots more broadly could be the start of an industrial revolution for knowledge work.</p>
 
 [00:59] Microsoft’s approach to AI 
 [5:55] The next Industrial Revolution 
 [10:27] Developer productivity &amp; flow state 
 [15:26] Reprogramming the American Dream 
 [19:48] Advice to builders 
 
  Microsoft’s approach to AI 
<p>Bob: Microsoft has played such a huge role in determining the future of AI. Could you take a few minutes and talk about how you see the vision and the future of AI and what is the role of a large tech leader, like Microsoft, in this wave of AI?</p>
<p>Kevin: We really do see AI not as a product and not as a research project, but as a real platform for lots of people to build many interesting new things on top of.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years and maybe the past 12 months, in particular, with the launch of ChatGPT and GPT-4, you can really see the potential of the platform in the same light as the personal computer or the smartphone. There’s a bundle of technologies that are going to make a whole bunch of new things possible that lots of people are going to be building things on top of, most of which we probably don’t even really understand right now. That’s the exciting thing to me about building a technology. I’ve always been a tool builder, and the idea of building a tool and then having a bunch of people use it in ways that you didn’t anticipate is super interesting.</p>
<p>Bob: In many ways, you’re not doing this on your own. You’ve partnered with leaders in the industry, whether it’s GitHub or OpenAI, as you mentioned, and most recently, Meta Llama 2. Can you talk a little bit more about the role you see partners playing in your vision and how you expect the ecosystem to expand over time? A question that I’m sure you’ve gotten a million times is: where do you get all the GPUs to support growing and expanding relationships?</p>
<p>Kevin: The GPU question is…it’s probably not comical, but I have to laugh at the frequency of that being the number 1 question right now. It’s not even a weekly or monthly thing, the hours in the day that go by where someone is not asking for GPUs are almost nonexistent.</p>
<p>Going back to this whole point of, if you’re building a platform, the platform has to get built with partners and it has to get used by partners. Our partners are extraordinarily important to us. If you think about AI, by far and away the most important partner we have is OpenAI. That partnership has been going for 4 years now and started as a, “Hey, we are a hyperscale cloud. We’re going to build a bunch of AI supercomputing infrastructure in collaboration with you that is then going to train some of the most advanced AI models and systems in the world. Then we’re going to do some work together to figure out how to take those models, those platform building blocks, and get them deployed into products that Microsoft offers, like GitHub Copilot, as well as deploy these things into environments like Azure and Azure OpenAI API, where people can just build their own software on top of it.”</p>
<p>These other partners are super important as well. GitHub, obviously, is one of the most interesting places to deploy AI right now. It is the first illustration of this copilot pattern that we are trying to build out, which is: how can you take a bit of knowledge work or cognitive work that someone is doing and use AI to help them be dramatically more productive at doing that cognitive work? If you look at developers, we just don’t have enough of them to write all of the software that the world needs. A lot of the work that developers do is just toil, so having a tool that can help make the job of software development more delightful and to help software developers be more productive…</p>
<p>You mentioned Meta and Llama 2. I think Llama 2, just like Llama, is going to be an important building block that people are going to want to use to build AI software. We want AI software running on Azure, so we’re doing everything that we can to make that an easy thing for people to do.</p>
  The next Industrial Revolution 
<p>Bob: The concept of Copilot and how you create these AI tools to assist people with the complex cognitive task: how do you think AI can and will change how we all work over time? What’s your advice for how we get the most out of tools like Copilot?</p>
<p>Kevin: If you think about the Industrial Revolution, for the first time, you had engineered devices, machines that were able to assist people with labor. Most of the labor in the 19th and 18th century and through most of the 20th century was physical. The invention of these new technologies all of a sudden allowed the transformation of the physical labor that almost everyone in the world was doing.</p>
<p>I think a similar thing is going to happen now with cognitive work, or knowledge work, which is becoming a bigger and bigger part of what the workforce is spending their time and energy doing. You and I are both knowledge workers. We haven’t really had a massive breakthrough in productivity for knowledge workers. The PC was an accelerator and the invention of the internet was an accelerator. I don’t think the smartphone helped much at all in terms of productivity and knowledge work. But I think this might be the biggest thing that’s ever happened for this particular type of work.</p>
<p>I think the way that it will get used in the early days, and you can sort of see this right now, is two-fold. One is you have these big categories of knowledge work where there is no way to do more of the particular type of work because productivity is not getting any better—but you’ve got some kind of deficit in society because you actually could use more of it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you have tons of drudgery in a lot of the work that we all do. If you had some kind of productivity mechanism that could come in and do your least favorite part of your job or the most repetitive and most redundant work, I think we all would be delighted to have those sorts of tools in our lives. I think lots of companies are going to get created very soon to really help tackle some of those problems of, “Hey, where’s the crap work that people would be desperate and happy to have automated?” It would make their work experience better and would let them get more done.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is with some of these big platform shifts that we’ve had in the past, the most valuable things that get done on the platforms are not the things that got deployed in the first year or 2 of the platform change. If you think about the smartphone, the place where you spend most of your time on your smartphone is not the SMS app, it’s not the web browser, it’s not the mail client. It’s in the new things that got created on top of the platform in the years following the availability of the platform.</p>
<p>It’s the hard stuff that you really have to think about. What are the difficult things that have now become possible that were impossible before? That’s the thing that people ought to be thinking about. What are the hard problems I can be working on? There are a lot of easy things that you can do right now that are going to be useful, but I don’t think those are the most valuable things.</p>
  Developer productivity &amp; flow state 
<p>Bob: One of the use cases that has been pretty powerful has really been code assistant within GitHub Copilot. Going inside the 4 walls of Microsoft, can you talk a little bit about the tools that you’re rolling out to your own engineers, how is it changing how engineers get their work done at Microsoft, and any thoughts or ideas on how you track and measure that kind of productivity in the engineering community?</p>
<p>Kevin: I’m not sure whether any of the AI systems are creating the need for new measures for developer productivity, but I think it’s really, really important. If you are running a software development organization and you don’t have good metrics and visibility into the productivity of developers, you need to get on it right now. It will be very hard to decide which out of a bewildering variety of AI developer tools are coming your way that you want to adopt and what order you want to adopt them in if you don’t have those measurements in place.</p>
<p>The thing that I will say is developer productivity is not lines of code produced. It is how you’re measuring a developer’s ability to very quickly deliver things to users and then measure whether or not those users are benefiting from the things that the developer is producing. It’s instrumenting that entire feedback loop and making sure that you are able to identify points of friction throughout the entire product lifecycle development.</p>
<p>The thing that we’re doing inside of the company right now with AI tools, first and foremost, is getting everybody to use GitHub Copilot, which is a really big productivity win. The thing that it does, in our observation with developers, more than anything else is it helps keep them in flow state longer than they otherwise would. Rather than hitting a blocker when you’re writing a chunk of code or you’re trying to accomplish something and being like, “I don’t know how to go get the next thing done. I’ve got to go consult documentation or ask another engineer who might be busy with something,” being able to get yourself unblocked in the moment before you’re out of flow state is extraordinarily valuable. That’s a thing for folks who are thinking about the utility of these generative AI tools. You’re building for things other than software development.</p>
<p>Last fall, before GPT-4 was announced, I decided, “Could I use these tools to help me write a science fiction book?” Which is something I’ve wanted to do since I was a teenager. It was terrible at writing all of the book. It just wasn’t good at giving you chapters of well-formed prose with character development and all of the things that you would want in a good book. But it was really terrific at keeping me in flow state. So, if I measure my productivity of how many words I could write in a day versus 2X with the tool, it’s easy.</p>
<p>The really interesting thing that everyone should be thinking about, in general, is this notion of flow state. What are the conditions in which people are their absolute most productive or the most delighted at their job? When you’re in flow state, you know it. You’re just killing it. How can you use tools to preserve that as long as humanly possible?</p>
<p>The other place, too, where we’re using a bunch of AI tools is actually in the deployment of AI. A lot of the testing that we’re doing right now, a lot of the responsible AI work that we do, are all using the AI tools themselves to help do that. That’s another interesting thing that just wasn’t obvious. It hadn’t been obvious to me that it was going to be as important as it is when we started doing deployments at scale about 9 months ago.</p>
  Reprogramming the American Dream 
<p>Bob: Can you talk a little bit about how you, as a leader, are effectively rolling out the tools maybe to motivate and inspire rather than stoke the fears that our employees have about what this technology means for our roles? Then, on a related basis, how do you handle the resistance to change organizationally for disruptive tools like this in your daily job?</p>
<p>Kevin: I think those are 2 very different questions and I’ll dig into them separately. I actually wrote a book about this, honestly, at the worst possible time. The book is called Reprogramming the American Dream. It went to the bookstores and hit shelves in March of 2020, the week that the shutdowns for the COVID pandemic started. The whole point of the book was that AI creates more opportunities for people by far than it creates the potential for harm. It’s not to say that the potential for harm is 0, or that you can ignore it, or that you can make that the umpteen thing you’re thinking about with an AI product. But it does mean that we have to be really insistent and determined around these optimistic scenarios.</p>
<p>Part of the book was rooted in my experience. I grew up in rural Central Virginia in a place where the economy was powered by tobacco farming, furniture manufacturing, and textiles. By the time I was graduating from high school, all 3 of these industries had just collapsed.</p>
<p>When folks in these communities have access to very powerful tools, they tend to do remarkable things that create economic opportunities for themselves, for their families, and their communities. They solve problems that you or I are not going to solve just because we don’t see the whole problem landscape of the world. We don’t have their point of view. These tools of AI are becoming more accessible now than they have been by a dramatically wide margin. You can do interesting things with these tools right now to solve problems like create businesses or be an entrepreneur in small-town Virginia without having a PhD in computer science or expertise in classical AI. You just need to be curious and entrepreneurial.</p>
<p>Your second question was how do you get people resistant to change to embrace some of what’s happening right now with AI?</p>
<p>What we have seen at Microsoft over the past 9 months—and I think you all are seeing this, too, in the entrepreneurial community—is as soon as you have large groups of people enthusiastically building things on top of this technology, it’s very easy to see all of your peers adapting to the change, getting excited about it, and building interesting things, and then just say to yourself, “I’ve got to go do this as well.” I think part of the problem in any organization is figuring out how to get yourself to that point of critical mass of adoption where then it just gets easier. Then you have the opposite problem, which is the thing you started the call with, which is people screaming at you that they don’t have enough GPUs.</p>
  Advice to builders 
<p>Bob: Let me close with one last, more general question. What do you see as the biggest open questions in AI at the moment?</p>
<p>Kevin: We have proof points of a 20-watt organ that sits between our ears that is artificial general intelligence, which is many, many, many orders of magnitude more efficient than the digital artificial neural networks that we’re building right now. From a technology perspective, there’s probably a whole handful of breakthroughs left to be discovered in figuring out how to close that efficiency gap.</p>
<p>The unlock that, you have to get to where you can do something on your laptop versus having to go buy millions of dollars’ worth of computing infrastructure to do something really enormous. It does that thing for the product development that I was talking about earlier which is, it helps you turn the crank faster and makes the iterations less expensive. Just getting big efficiency breakthroughs would be great for us, obviously, because we’re spending huge amounts of capital on infrastructure to run these models. But I think it would be great for the whole world and the state of pace of innovation that we’re seeing in AI products.</p>
<p>The thing I will say to all of the entrepreneurs in attendance is go find hard stuff to work on. Don’t chase the trivial things. Don’t be the AI moral equivalent of the fart apps that were flooding the AppStore. Just because a thing has become possible doesn’t mean that it’s useful. Really, really focusing on the fundamentals of product building is important. AI is a model, not a product.</p>
<p>Your understanding as an entrepreneur of: who is your user? What is their problem? What can you do to help them? Then determining whether or not this AI stuff is actually a useful piece of infrastructure to go solve that user problem—that is something that is unchanged. AI is just like a new and interesting piece of infrastructure that has come into existence and lets you solve a new category of problems or solve an old category of problems in better ways.</p>
<p>Bob: Kevin, this is great. Thank you very much for taking the time to join us today. I greatly appreciate you sharing the vision you have there at Microsoft and some of the tools and human aspects of bringing this technology to life. It’s great to see. I look forward to next time.</p>
<p>Kevin: Thank you so much for inviting me.</p>

<p>Noam Shazeer, Character.ai CEO and cofounder, talks to a16z’s Sarah Wang about the dawn of universally accessible intelligence, the compute it will take to power it, and his pursuit of AGI’s first use case: AI friends.</p>
 
 [00:39] Real Noam vs. AI Noam 
 [05:17] Next unlocks &amp; scaling laws 
 [07:13] AGI’s first use case 
 [10:08] Building a full-stack LLM 
 [12:35] Noam calculates global compute capacity 
 [14:26] Universally accessible intelligence 
 
  Real Noam vs. AI Noam 
<p>Sarah: Noam, earlier today, David Baszucki at Roblox said that, in the future, it would be very difficult to parse between a real person and their AI version. So to kick off this session, we thought it would be fun to interview you and the Character.AI version of yourself to see how you both answer the same question. This is live, so we don’t know how AI Noam will be answering. Are you ready?</p>
<p>Noam: Sounds good.</p>
<p>Sarah: I am going to start with a softball personal question. I know that you went to Duke for undergrad. Can you tell us a little bit about why you decided to go to Duke?</p>
<p>Noam: I went on a basketball…no, I’m joking. They recruited me because they wanted to win the Putnam math competition, so I ended up going on scholarship.</p>
<p>Sarah: Great. Let’s get a little more career-related. You were at Google for almost 20 years. Why did you decide to leave?</p>
<p>Noam: I’ve always been excited about AI and I just wanted to push technology forward. I saw this large language model thing…well, at the time, it wasn’t large language models, but neural networks. Language modeling was just the most promising thing on earth. It’s the best problem ever. All you have to do is predict the next word and, once you do it, you get something that can just talk to you about anything.</p>
<p>I know that we can make this technology better in a lot of ways. We can improve it with model architecture, distributed algorithms, quantization, and all of these things.</p>
<p>I was working on that, but then it struck me that the biggest thing is just scale. Can you throw $1B or $1T at this thing instead of $1M? What you need for that is just to show a massively valuable application. There are a few options, coding looks super useful, but just also dialogue—it’s the world’s number one pastime.</p>
<p>Back in 2019 or 2020, my cofounder, Daniel DeFreitas—he’s been on this lifelong mission to do chatbots and dialogue systems—had built the system. He called me in and it was like this 20% project and it was really good. So then it was like, “We have to help Daniel, let’s build something amazing.” We got it on giant models and it was this internal viral sensation at Google.</p>
<p>At some point we realized there’s just too much brand risk in large companies to ever launch anything fun. Let’s do a startup, and let’s maximally accelerate.</p>
<p>Sarah: I would guess that that answer is also probably true. By the way, you’re the third person, in addition to Mira at OpenAI and Dario at Anthropic, who’s also said you haven’t seen any limit to the scaling laws. We’ll get more into that later.</p>
<p>We’re going to actually look toward the future now. This is our last question for AI Noam as well. Noam, are you afraid of AGI destroying the world?</p>
<p>Noam: Well, I think we just need a global pause of about 4 months until we get enough H100s online to train our model.</p>
<p>Sarah: I’ll take that as a no.</p>
<p>Noam: No. Not yet. I think there’s a lot of potential benefits and yeah. We’re going to work on it as the technology improves.</p>
<p>Sarah: Noam, I don’t know if you’ve got to read all of AI Noam’s answers, but how did AI Noam do? How would you score his answers?</p>
<p>Noam: Oh, that’s pretty good. Yeah, that’s better than I would do.</p>
  Next unlocks &amp; scaling laws 
<p>Sarah: We talk about getting better, but what does better mean? In some cases, it’s correctness. But for Character.AI, it’s not always about correctness. How do you see AI Noam getting better? What does better mean?</p>
<p>Noam: Some of the big unlocks we’re working on are to just train a bigger, smarter model. The scaling laws are going to take us a pretty long way. The model we’re serving now cost us about $2M worth of compute cycles to train last year. We could probably repeat it for $500K now.</p>
<p>We’re going to launch something tens of IQ points smarter, hopefully, by the end of the year. Smarter, and more accessible, meaning multimodal. Maybe you want to hear a voice and see a face and also just be able to interact with multiple people. When a virtual person is in there with all your friends, it’s like you got elected president. You get the earpiece and you get the whole cabinet of friends or advisers. Or, it’s like you walk into Cheers and everyone knows your name, and they’re glad you came.</p>
<p>There’s a lot we can do to make things more usable. Right now, the thing we’re serving is using a context window of a few thousand tokens, which means your lifelong friend remembers what happened for the last half hour. Still, there are a lot of people who are using it for hours a day. That will make things way better, especially if you can just dump in massive amounts of information. It should be able to know like a billion things about you. The HBM bandwidth is there. It just needs to do it.</p>
  AGI’s first use case 
<p>Sarah: Let’s talk a little bit more about Character.AI, explicitly. Since launch, you’ve seen more than 20B human messages sent on the platform. Even though you now have millions of daily active users, they’re still, on average, spending 2 hours daily on the platform. Is that right?</p>
<p>Noam: I think the way to understand it is this: entertainment is like a $2T a year industry. The dirty secret is that entertainment is imaginary friends that don’t know you exist. The reason people interact with TV or any of these other things—it’s called parasocial relationships, which is your relationship with TV characters, or book characters, or celebrities—and everybody does it. There are billions of lonely people out here. It’s actually a very, very cool problem. It’s a cool first use case for AGI.</p>
<p>There was the option to go into lots of different applications, and a lot of them have a lot of overhead and requirements. If you want to launch something that’s a doctor, it’s going to be a lot slower because you want to be really, really, really careful about not providing false information. But friends you can do really fast. It’s just entertainment, it makes things up. That’s a feature.</p>
<p>Essentially, it’s this massive unmet need. It’s very important that the thing kind of feels human and is able to talk about anything. That matches up very well with the generality of large language models. One thing that’s not a problem is making stuff up. I want to push this technology ahead fast because it’s ready for an explosion right now, not in 5 years when we solve all the problems.</p>
<p>Sarah: Absolutely. That’s a big contrast with self-driving cars. That’s a different standard versus your AI friend.</p>
<p>Noam: Your AI friend, or something you view as an AI character or AI entertainment. What standard do you hold a comic book you’re reading to?</p>
<p>People like that human experience of very mixed use cases that talk about everything. It’s not that we want to fine-tune to some particular domain or some particular use case. People want this experience of everything, which is fine. It’s what the technology is perfect for.</p>
  Building a full-stack LLM 
<p>Sarah: From the a16z vantage point, we have seen startups come up and say, “Hey, I’m going to tackle the mental health use case,” or “I’m going to tackle the Ed Tech use case.” They go much more narrow than Character.AI. They go after a specific use case and say, “We’re going to train this model to be focused on that. It’s going be better than a generalized model.”</p>
<p>I think you got into this a little bit with the mixed use cases, but can you share more about why you decided not to take that approach? Why do you think having a single model served across a number of use cases is the best approach?</p>
<p>Noam: The more you get to a particular use case, the more you get tempted into writing particular rules and doing things that will not generalize well. It was important to stay away from that.</p>
<p>Our goal is to be an AGI company and a product-first company. The way to do that is by picking the right product that forces us to work on the right things: things that generalize, make the model smarter, make it what people want, and serve it at massive scale and serve it cheaply. I think this was the right product for the right goal.</p>
<p>Sarah: You’ve also chosen this approach when building, we call it a vertically integrated model and app company. There are advancements in the open source model side and folks building a product on top of fine-tune LLaMA tune for chat. How do you think about that kind of competition entering the market and the differences versus the approach you’ve taken?</p>
<p>Noam: I love being a full stack company. It means we get to mess with every layer and do the code design. If there’s something that’s going to affect something at the end, we get to mess with it at the beginning, and we get to pull in lots of user data as feedback.</p>
<p>Plus, a lot of us invented this stuff, so of course we’re going to do a full stack company. A lot of us are motivated by launching. I think the people we’re attracting to work at Character.AI are people who love inventing stuff and love launching it.</p>
  Noam calculates global compute capacity 
<p>Sarah: Let’s go into the evolution of the underlying technology. I think there’s a recent finding around AI developing theory of mind, or just the knowledge that other beliefs, desires, intentions may be different from one’s own. Is this surprising to you and what do you think that means for human-AI relationships?</p>
<p>Noam: Just make the thing smarter, it’s going to have a better theory of mind. I think that’s definitely something that’s massively important. It seems like one of these emergent properties that just is going to come with scale. I see this stuff massively scaling up—it’s just not that expensive.</p>
<p>I saw an article yesterday: NVIDIA is going to build another 1.5M H100s next year. That’s 2M H100s, so that’s 2 times 10 to the 6th. They can do about 10 to the 15th operations per second, so 2 times 10 to the 21, divided by 8 times 10 to the ninth people on Earth. That’s roughly a quarter of a trillion operations per second, per person. Which means that it could be processing on the order of 1 word per second on a 100 billion parameter model for everyone on Earth. But not everyone on Earth because some people are blocked in China and some people are sleeping. It’s not that expensive. This thing is massively scalable if you do it right, and we’re working on that.</p>
  Universally accessible intelligence 
<p>Sarah: I think you said once that the internet was the dawn of universally accessible information and we’re now entering the dawn of universally accessible intelligence. Building off of your last answer, what did you mean by that? Do you think we’re there yet?</p>
<p>Noam: It’s really a Wright Brothers first airplane kind of moment. We’ve got something that works and is useful for now, a large number of use cases, and looks like it’s scaling very, very well. Without any breakthroughs, it’s going to get massively better as everyone scales up to use it. There will be more breakthroughs because now all the scientists in the world are working on making the stuff better.</p>
<p>It’s great that all this stuff is accessible in open source. We’re going to see a huge amount of innovation. What’s possible in the largest companies now can be possible in somebody’s academic lab or garage in a few years. As the technology gets better, there’s going to be all kinds of great use cases that emerge pushing technology forward, pushing science, pushing the ability to help people in various ways. I would love to get to the point where you can just ask it how to cure cancer. It seems a few years away for now, but…</p>
<p>Sarah: Do you think we need another fundamental breakthrough, like the transformer technology, to get there or do you think we actually have everything that we need?</p>
<p>Noam: I don’t know. It’s impossible to predict the future, but I don’t think anyone’s seen the scaling laws stop. As far as anybody has experimented, stuff just keeps getting smarter, so we’ll be able to unlock lots and lots of new stuff. I don’t know if there’s an end to it, but at least everybody in the world should be able to talk to something really brilliant and have incredible tools all the time. I can’t imagine that it will not be able to build on itself.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is, at the core, the computation isn’t that expensive. Operations cost like 10 to the negative of $18 these days. If you can do this stuff efficiently, even talking to the biggest models ever trained, the cost of that should be way, way lower than the value of your time—or most anybody’s time. There’s the capacity there to scale these things up by orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>Sarah: I’d like to end on that note. Thank you so much, Noam, it was awesome.</p>
<p>Noam: Thank you.</p>

<p>On stage at Messari Mainnet today in New York, Brave, Electric Coin Co. (ECC), and Filecoin Foundation announced that they are teaming up to bring innovative new privacy features to the Brave browser and its integrated Web3 wallet.</p>

 Private transactions for all&nbsp; 
<p>With support from ECC, Brave will integrate the Zcash protocol in the browser’s built-in crypto wallet so users can securely store, send, and receive ZEC alongside other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The integration underscores Brave’s commitment to blending privacy, transparency, and user choice. With private transactions possible alongside public ones, users will have greater control over their Web3 activity.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m excited about integrating Zcash into the Brave web browser because privacy should be normal. The Brave browser is a tool that tens of millions of people are using for everyday communication, web browsing, shopping, and other activities. This gives them access to money that respects their security and consent. I’m thrilled for this launch — and what’s to come — as a result of this partnership with Brave and Filecoin Foundation.”</p>
<p>— Zooko Wilcox, CEO, Electric Coin Co.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“This partnership with like-minded organizations reinforces Brave’s mission for a more private and user-first Web. Not only do we hope to make it simple to use ZEC for private transactions, but we also aim to maximize privacy during key moments of purchase or exchange.”</p>
<p>— Yan Zhu, CISO, Brave</p>
</blockquote>

 A private and decentralized messaging feature 
<p>Brave, ECC, and Filecoin Foundation also teased plans on stage to develop a new, privacy-based feature in the Brave browser that will offer private messages and media transmission via the Zcash protocol. InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) – the technology underlying the Filecoin protocol – will play a crucial role in providing secure storage for the encrypted content.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We’re thrilled to be a part of this important project. We believe cryptocurrency can be the foundation for a better Internet — an alternative to big tech that puts people in control of their own data, protects user privacy and security, and permanently preserves humanity’s most important information.”</p>
<p>— Marta Belcher, President, Filecoin Foundation</p>
</blockquote>


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>Brave</p>
<p>Brave Software’s fast, privacy-oriented browser, combined with its blockchain-based digital advertising platform, is reinventing the Web for users, publishers, and advertisers. Users can opt into privacy-respecting ads that reward them with the Basic Attention Token (BAT), a frequent flyer-like token they can redeem or use to tip or contribute to publishers and other content creators. Brave is a driving force leading the way for Web3 adoption, directly supporting Web3 into the broader Web through its privacy browser, independent search engine, and browser-native, multi-chain crypto wallet. Brave currently has over 60 million monthly active users and 1.8 million Creators. Learn more at <a>brave.com</a>.</p>
<p>Electric Coin Co.</p>
<p>Electric Coin Co. launched Zcash in 2016 and continues to support the protocol and user experience, alongside other developers and teams. Zcash is a cryptocurrency built to empower economic freedom. It is similar to Bitcoin in its design, but it uses a privacy technology that encrypts transaction information and allows users to shield their assets. Our vision for Zcash is that it will provide equal access to economic systems and give everyone the ability to participate in economic activity.

 <blockquote>Different approaches to private asset velocity in light of the Privacy Pools paper.</blockquote> <br>Introduction <p>Public blockchains inherently champion transparency. The cornerstone of this architecture allows anyone to validate transactions without dependence on centralized intermediaries. This transparency, while advantageous in many respects, also accentuates the pressing need for privacy, especially given the escalating prominence of platforms like Bitcoin and Ethereum, their DeFi applications, and adoption by institutions.<br></p><p>The industry has various challenges to solve to deliver a better product: transaction linkability, network privacy, and private key management are some. There have been commendable strides in these areas, such as the development of Layer-1 blockchains like <a href="https://z.cash/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Zcash</a>, which offers private transactions, and smart contract solutions like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_Cash?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Tornado Cash</a>, which breaks the transaction link between deposit and withdrawal addresses on Ethereum. Due to their permissionless nature and approach, these systems are currently not designed for risk management. Notably, Tornado Cash “has also been used by various bad actors. Deposit data suggests that hacker groups have moved funds from illicit sources through the protocol.” (<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4563364&amp;download=yes&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Buterin et al.</a>, page 1). While Tornado Cash had its pitfalls, notably its usage by malicious actors (causing the protocol to get internationally sanctioned), the root cause of such vulnerabilities isn't necessarily technological but rather structural and was meant to be exploited.<br><br>At its core, the true sentiment we need to grapple with is this: compliance, while ensuring standardized behavior and safeguarding user interests, undeniably carries a cost – both financial and in terms of user accessibility. There's an exclusionary element to compliance, where stringent checks can sometimes inadvertently alienate non-malicious users. Furthermore, the absence of clear regulatory frameworks around decentralization and DAOs has ushered in shades of ambiguity. This uncertain environment is ripe for exploitation.</p><p>Historically, many actors in the space prioritized rapid growth over diligent compliance, often underestimating or even ignoring the long-term repercussions of such a strategy. Their motivations were straightforward – to reduce immediate costs and accelerate expansion. But such a strategy is inherently flawed. With today's well-informed user base demanding greater clarity and accountability, the repercussions of neglecting compliance have grown exponentially in magnitude. Simply put, compromising compliance for short-term gains threatens the longevity and credibility of any decentralized system.</p><p>It's essential to differentiate between ideologic and economic motives. While the decentralized movement was born from a <a href="https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">desire for autonomy and freedom from permissionless surveillance</a>, its sustained growth and mainstream adoption are undeniably tethered to economic incentives. In this case, ideology isn't the dominant force; it's the potential for economic upside. Similarly, while security concerns are paramount, they represent a distinct set of challenges, separate from those posed by compliance.</p><p>Thus, as we critique systems like Tornado Cash, it's imperative to understand that their vulnerabilities aren't just a result of technology but are deeply intertwined with larger strategic challenges and a blind eye toward solving compliant access.<br><br><a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther Protocol</a>, however, envisions a refined balance. Our goal is to augment data privacy on public blockchains while introducing a flexible approach to compliance, making it accessible to a diverse user base, from individuals to institutional giants.<br></p> Panther’s overall approach <p>Panther Protocol refines and extends the Shielded Pool concept and has developed advanced <a href="https://research.metastate.dev/multi-asset_shielded_pool?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Multi-Asset Shielded Pools</a> to include compliance features enabled by zero-knowledge proofs.</p>  Users can deposit into a <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-shielded-pools-the-cornerstone-of-panther-protocol/">Multi-Asset Shielded Pool</a> (or simply Shielded Pool) only after <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/">presenting a ZK proof of their verified status</a>, an action that's verifiable on-chain.  Transactional activities like deposits or withdrawals necessitate a ZK proof to vouch for the purity of the associated wallet address.  Upon providing the necessary proofs, users activate a zero-knowledge <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/panther-accounts?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Account</a> (or zAccount), which serves as a unique user identity record, tethering all their transactions.  Situations like regulatory scrutiny may necessitate users to reaffirm their credentials, leading to zAccount reactivation.  All interactions with the protocol are strictly based on zero-knowledge proofs, ensuring minimal data exposure on-chain.  With the zAccount system, all transactions from the same user are interconnected, and a ZK proof can be generated to showcase the volume or assets dealt with, offering a possible avenue for regulatory review.  <p>In a pioneering approach that seamlessly complements the decentralized structure we've discussed, Panther introduces an innovative method to manage compliance risks. At the heart of this strategy is the inclusion of a<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/"> compliance provider</a>, operating autonomously from the Protocol. This provider's principal role is to authenticate users, offering them a unique set of credentials after a series of verifications. These credentials then serve a dual purpose:</p><p>First, they enable users to craft zero-knowledge proofs directly within their browsers—a testament to the strategy's user-centric design. Second, in line with the modern digital identity landscape, these credentials can be seamlessly integrated with blockchain-based <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">DIDs </a>and similar platforms. Panther's vision extends even further. In a move that underscores flexibility and choice, users aren't bound to a single compliance provider. They can seek verification from any compliance provider of their choice. Once verified, users can then present these credentials as an irrefutable attestation to their authenticity, granting them unhindered access to the protocol. This strategic integration ensures multilevel compliance and amplifies user trust, forging a pathway to a more secure decentralized future.</p> <br>The responsibility of proof in a modern world <p>In a quest to strike the right balance between privacy and compliance in decentralized finance, Panther unveils a revolutionary approach that aspires to solve the same set of issues as presented in the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4563364&amp;download=yes&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Privacy Pools paper</a> by thought leaders such as <a href="http://vitalik.ca/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Vitalik Buterin</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ameensol?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Ameen Soleimani</a>. As highlighted in their work, "Privacy Pools-like systems allow users to achieve more privacy around their financial transactions data while retaining the ability to prove their disassociation with known illicit activity. We expect that honest users will be incentivized to participate in such a scheme by a combination of two factors: (i) the desire for privacy, and (ii) the desire to avoid suspicion.” (p.8)</p><p>Central to the Privacy Pools model is a foundational idea: "Instead of merely zero-knowledge-proving that their withdrawal is linked to some previously-made deposit, a user proves membership in a more restrictive association set." (p.4) However, Panther diverges here, adopting a more tailored approach suited for real-world applicability. Panther operates on the positive constraint that all deposits emanate from verified users with authenticated wallets. This eradicates the need for additional proof during fund withdrawals.</p><p>Users can:</p>  Attest ownership of the originating Account for their deposits.  Showcase credentials affirming the withdrawal to an address in good standing, either owned by them or a validated Account holder within Panther.  When directing withdrawals <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/defi-adaptors?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">to other DeFi protocols</a> or centralized exchanges, they can offer proof of 'source of funds', which is verifiable by the receiving party.  <p>Another aspect highlighted in the Privacy Pools paper is the inventive adaptation of the Tornado cash UTXO model. However, one of the challenges presented is the maintenance of reliable and upright Associate Set Providers within a decentralised framework. These systems employ third-party entities known as ASPs to establish association sets. While the association data resides off-chain, its Merkle proof is recorded on-chain, ensuring ASPs maintain data integrity. ASPs might encompass compliance providers or even wallet screening oracle services.</p><p>The Privacy Pools paper underscores the necessity of expansive association sets to attain the desired privacy level and to lure good depositors, distancing them from malicious actors. Panther's answer to this is the creation of "<a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools/zones?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Zones</a>". Differently from the association sets of Privacy Pools, Zones are logical divisions within a Shielded Pool, each identified by a unique Zone-ID ingrained in every UTXO commitment. This allows for entities to create and tailor their own Zone, shaping membership criteria, selecting compliance providers, meeting regulatory demands, and even facilitating interactions with other Zone members. Notably, while these Zones provide tailored functionalities, they share the same anonymity set, as they all operate under the unified MASP architecture, reinforcing the strength and integrity of the system.</p><p>For instance, as a Zone Manager, an institution would have the capability to:</p>  Designate which Zones can transact their Zone and vice versa.  Choose a new compliance provider or integrate an existing one tailored for its Zone.  Define KYC renewal durations for Zone members.  Set transactional boundaries, including deposit, withdrawal, and internal transfer limits.  <p>The advent of "Zones" thus arms regulated entities and institutions with a formidable toolset, enabling them to seamlessly conduct privacy-preserving on-chain transactions and interact with protocols, welcoming a broader spectrum of participants into the world of DeFi. This agility comes out of Panther’s UTXO design and is instrumental in tapping into new opportunities and maximizing the potential of decentralized finance.<br></p> Panther Protocol &amp; the advanced UTXO model <p>Before the broader public became acquainted with the intricacies of the Privacy Pools paper, which mentions, "The simplified, privacy-preserving coin systems above only support coin transfers in the same denomination. Zcash supports arbitrary denominations through its use of a UTXO model," (p.6) Panther Protocol was already ahead of the curve. Panther crafted a pioneering system that not only facilitated transactions in diverse denominations, but also tackled real-world challenges to amplify on-chain transactional privacy. Additionally, Panther's advanced Shielded Pools are designed to support a wide range of assets, including:</p>  <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">ERC-20</a>: The standard for fungible tokens on Ethereum, allowing for a consistent interface across multiple token contracts.  <a href="https://ethereum.org/nl/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">ERC-721</a>: A standard for representing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that can be used to represent ownership over unique items or pieces of content.  <a href="https://ethereum.org/nl/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-1155/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">ERC-1155</a>: A more generalized standard that supports both fungible and non-fungible tokens, enabling the creation of multiple token types within a single contract.  <p>With these integrations, Panther Protocol not only serves as a privacy shield for traditional tokens, but also for the blossoming world of NFTs, showcasing its versatility and forward-thinking approach.</p><p>Let’s dig a little deeper into Panther User Accounts and how they enable Compliance:</p><p>1. User Account UTXOs ( or zAccounts): At the heart of Panther's approach lies the concept of the "User Account UTXO" — a distinctive type of UTXO nestled within the broader UTXO Merkle Tree. This can be imagined as a dynamic address book or user registry that can be activated based on several criteria, such as:</p>  Association with a social network account.  Linkage to an Ethereum address.  Ties to a user’s KYC records.  <p>2. Activation and Non-Interactive Transfers: Upon Account activation, the user account registry establishes a link between the public root spending key, public reading key, and a "public" Ethereum address associated with the user. This elegant arrangement enables non-interactive transfers within the Shielded Pool, eliminating the need for the sender to fetch the receiver’s pubkeys.</p><p>3. Accounts and their utility: The fields encapsulated within the zAccount UTXO pave the way for a myriad of functionalities. For instance:</p>  The "Nonce" serves as a transaction counter for user accounts, helping in linking and ordering transactions under the same Account.  Parameters such as "Order" and "Quantity" further enhance transactional clarity.  This feature might also be employed for disclosures to provide proof of completeness.  <p>4. Expiry Time &amp; Renewal Mechanisms: Recognizing the absence of a foolproof exclusion proof, Panther has instituted an "Expiry Time"mechanism, which mandates periodic renewals of user accounts. Potential renewal methodologies could range from:</p>  Aligning with KYC renewals.  Adopting a permissionless approach.  Re-verification of humanity.  Using a zk-proof to validate the total volume of transactions remaining under specified limits.  <p>Panther Protocol's nuanced use of the UTXO model paints a future where transactions are not only private but also flexibly aligned with the intricate demands of the world of DeFi.</p> <br>Navigating the DeFi space with Panther Protocol <p>Panther's architecture, with its foundational pillars of privacy, is crowned with a structure for on-chain compliance. Yet, one might wonder –what avenues are available to Panther users to leverage the augmented privacy derived from their Panther-based transactions?</p><p>This is precisely where Panther distinguishes itself from conventional privacy paradigms:</p><p>1. Seamless integration with premier DeFi protocols<br>Panther has engineered private adaptors in collaboration with eminent DeFi protocols such as <a href="https://uniswap.org/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Uniswap </a>and <a href="https://www.curve.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Curve</a>. This enables users to execute &nbsp;‘one-click’ swaps, instantly privatizing and verifying the transaction from a regulatory standpoint.</p><p>2. Diverse platform Adaptors<br>Our vision goes beyond mere swaps. We anticipate adaptors that <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zswap-and-defi-adaptors-unlocking-private-defi-usage/">bridge Panther with an eclectic range of platforms</a>, spanning from NFT marketplaces to lending hubs and beyond.</p><p>3. zTrade: Panther’s Dark Pool<br>Panther includes an innovative solution for confidential and compliant dark pool transactions. With <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/ztrade-otc-trading?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zTrade</a>, users can preserve their trading strategies, mitigate counterparty risks, and effortlessly execute voluminous trades at pre-negotiated rates, all within the Shielded Pool.<br></p> Conclusion <p>In the ever-evolving world of decentralized technology, the quest for innovation remains perpetual. As the landscape gravitates towards establishing fully permissionless and decentralized privacy solutions, the challenge is ensuring these platforms don't inadvertently provide refuge to malicious actors. Panther recognizes this dilemma and has meticulously worked to strike a balance. By weaving in compliance features, we ensure a blend of unwavering privacy without compromising the ethos of decentralization.</p><p>An essential distinction to note is that while Panther's system might appear to have rules-based access on the surface, it operates within a decentralized framework. No centralized entity dictates or establishes the rules. Instead, the rules of compliance, tiers, and other requirements are orchestrated by the Panther DAO or by the institutional entities that will own and oversee the Zones. This approach signifies a pioneering stride in the blockchain world, merging decentralized ethos and structured compliance advantages.</p><p>Moreover, as government-issued identities gain traction in various developing nations and blockchain-based DIDs persist, the symbiosis with Panther becomes increasingly potent. We are confident that such integrations will pave the way for scalable, secure, and trustful access methods, aligning with the vision of a more inclusive and transparent decentralized world.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther's zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p><p><br><br></p>

      Generative AI’s Act Two         
	By Sonya Huang, Pat Grady, and GPT-4	 



Animation: James Buckhouse, Midjourney and Runway



Published September 20, 2023
        One year ago, we published a hypothesis that generative AI would become a profound platform shift in technology. Then came the firestorm.      



 
<p>Scientists, historians and economists have long studied the optimal conditions that create a Cambrian explosion of innovation. In generative AI, we have reached a modern marvel, our generation’s space race.</p>



<p>This moment has been decades in the making. Six decades of Moore’s Law have given us the compute horsepower to process exaflops of data. Four decades of the internet (accelerated by COVID) have given us trillions of tokens’ worth of training data. Two decades of mobile and cloud computing have given every human a supercomputer in the palm of our hands. In other words, decades of technological progress have accumulated to create the necessary conditions for generative AI to take flight.</p>



<p>ChatGPT’s rise was the spark that lit the fuse, unleashing a density and fervor of innovation that we have not seen in years—perhaps since the early days of the internet. The breathless excitement was especially visceral in “Cerebral Valley,” where AI researchers reached rockstar status and hacker houses were filled to the brim each weekend with new autonomous agents and companionship chatbots. AI researchers transformed from the proverbial “hacker in the garage” to special forces units commanding billions of dollars of compute. The arXiv printing press has become so prolific that researchers have jokingly called for a pause on new publications so they can catch up.</p>



<p>But quickly, AI excitement turned to borderline hysteria. Suddenly, every company was an “AI copilot.” Our inboxes got filled up with undifferentiated pitches for “AI Salesforce” and “AI Adobe” and “AI Instagram.” The $100M pre-product seed round returned. We found ourselves in an unsustainable feeding frenzy of fundraising, talent wars and GPU procurement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And sure enough, the cracks started to show. Artists and writers and singers challenged the legitimacy of machine-generated IP. Debates over ethics, regulation and looming superintelligence consumed Washington. And perhaps most worryingly, a whisper began to spread within Silicon Valley that generative AI was not actually useful. The products were falling far short of expectations, as evidenced by terrible user retention. End user demand began to plateau for many applications. Was this just another vaporware cycle?</p>



<p>The AI summer of discontent has sent critics gleefully grave dancing, reminiscent of the early days of the internet, where in 1998 one famous economist declared “By 2005, it will become clear that the Internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s.”</p>



<p>Make no mistake—despite the noise and the hysteria and the air of uncertainty and discontent,&nbsp; generative AI has already had a more successful start than SaaS, with &gt;$1 billion in revenue from startups alone (it took the SaaS market years, not months, to reach the same scale). Some applications have become household names: ChatGPT became the fastest-growing application with particularly strong product-market fit among students and developers; Midjourney became our collective creative muse and was reported to have reached hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue with a team of just eleven; and Character popularized AI entertainment and companionship and created the consumer “social” application we craved the most—with users spending two hours on average in-app.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, these early signs of success don’t change the reality that a lot of AI companies simply do not have product-market fit or a sustainable competitive advantage, and that the overall ebullience of the AI ecosystem is unsustainable.</p>



<p>Now that the dust has settled for a bit, we thought it would be an opportune moment to zoom out and reflect on generative AI—where we find ourselves today, and where we’re possibly headed.&nbsp;</p>



 Towards Act Two 



<p>Generative AI’s first year out the gate—“Act 1”—came from the technology-out. We discovered a new “hammer”—foundation models—and unleashed a wave of novelty apps that were lightweight demonstrations of cool new technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We now believe the market is entering “Act 2”—which will be from the customer-back. Act 2 will solve human problems end-to-end. These applications are different in nature than the first apps out of the gate. They tend to use foundation models as a piece of a more comprehensive solution rather than the entire solution. They introduce new editing interfaces, making the workflows stickier and the outputs better. They are often multi-modal.</p>



<p>The market is already beginning to transition from “Act 1” to “Act 2.” Examples of companies entering “Act 2” include <a href="http://harvey.ai">Harvey</a>, which is building custom LLMs for elite law firms; <a href="http://glean.com">Glean</a>, which is crawling and indexing our workspaces to make Generative AI more relevant at work; and <a href="http://character.ai">Character</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ava-your-digital-friend/id6446257579">Ava</a>, which are creating digital companions.&nbsp;</p>



 Market Map 



<p>Our updated generative AI market map is below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike last year’s map, we have chosen to organize this map by use case rather than by model modality. This reflects two important thrusts in the market: Generative AI’s evolution from technology hammer to actual use cases and value, and the increasingly multimodal nature of generative AI applications.</p>
 







 
<p>In addition, we have included a new LLM developer stack that reflects the compute and tooling vendors that companies are turning to as they build generative AI applications in production.</p>
 







 
 Revisiting Our Thesis 



<p>Our original <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-a-creative-new-world/">essay</a> laid out a thesis for the generative AI market opportunity and a hypothesis for how the market would unfold. How did we do?</p>



<p>Here’s what we got wrong:</p>



 
 Things happened quickly. Last year, we anticipated it would be nearly a decade before we had intern-level code generation, Hollywood-quality videos or human quality speech that didn’t sound mechanical. But a quick listen to Eleven Labs’ voices on TikTok or Runway’s AI film festival makes it clear that the future has arrived at warp speed. Even 3D models, gaming and music are becoming good, quickly.&nbsp; 



 The bottleneck is on the supply side. We did not anticipate the extent to which end user demand would outstrip GPU supply. The bottleneck to many companies’ growth quickly became not customer demand but access to the latest GPUs from Nvidia. Long wait times became the norm, and a simple business model emerged: pay a subscription fee to skip the line and access better models.&nbsp; 



 Vertical separation hasn’t happened yet. We still believe that there will be a separation between the “application layer” companies and foundation model providers, with model companies specializing in scale and research and application layer companies specializing in product and UI. In reality, that separation hasn’t cleanly happened yet. In fact, the most successful user-facing applications out of the gate have been vertically integrated. 



 Cutthroat competitive environment and swiftness of the incumbent response. Last year, there were a few overcrowded categories of the competitive landscape (notably image generation and copywriting), but by and large the market was whitespace. Today, many corners of the competitive landscape have more competition than opportunity. The swiftness of the incumbent response, from Google’s Duet and Bard to Adobe’s Firefly—and the willingness of incumbents to finally go “risk on”—has magnified the competitive heat. Even in the foundation model layer, we are seeing customers set up their infrastructure to be agnostic between different vendors.&nbsp; 



 The moats are in the customers, not the data. We predicted that the best generative AI companies could generate a sustainable competitive advantage through a data flywheel: more usage → more data → better model → more usage. While this is still somewhat true, especially in domains with very specialized and hard-to-get data, the “data moats” are on shaky ground: the data that application companies generate does not create an insurmountable moat, and the next generations of foundation models may very well obliterate any data moats that startups generate. Rather, workflows and user networks seem to be creating more durable sources of competitive advantage. 
 



<p>Here’s what we got right:</p>



 
 Generative AI is a thing. Suddenly, every developer was working on a generative AI application and every enterprise buyer was demanding it. The market even kept the “generative AI” moniker. Talent flowed into the market, as did venture capital dollars. Generative AI even became a pop culture phenomenon in viral videos like “Harry Potter Balenciaga” or the Drake imitation song “Heart on My Sleeve” by Ghostwriter which has become a chart-topping hit. 



 The first killer apps emerged. It’s been well documented that ChatGPT was the fastest application to reach 100M MAU—and it did so organically in just 6 weeks. By contrast, Instagram took 2.5 years, WhatsApp took 3.5 years, and YouTube and Facebook took 4 years to reach that level of user demand. But ChatGPT is not an isolated phenomenon. The depth of engagement of Character AI (2 hour average session time), the productivity benefits of Github Copilot (55% more efficient), and the monetization path of Midjourney (hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue) all suggest that the first cohort of killer apps has arrived. 



 Developers are the key. One of the core insights of developer-first companies like Stripe or Unity has been that developer access opens up use cases you could not even imagine. In the last several quarters, we have been pitched everything from music generation communities to AI matchmakers to AI customer support agents. 



 The form factor is evolving. The first versions of AI applications have largely been autocomplete and first drafts, but these form factors are now growing in complexity. Midjourney’s introduction of camera panning and infilling is a nice illustration of how the generative AI-first user experience has grown richer. Across the board, form factors are evolving from individual to system-level productivity and from human-in-the-loop to execution-oriented agentic systems. 



 Copyright and ethics and existential dread. The debate has roared on these hot-button topics. Artists and writers and musicians are split, with some creators rightfully outraged that others are profiting off derivative work, and some creators embracing the new AI reality (Grimes’ profit-sharing proposition and James Buckhouse’s optimism about becoming part of the <a href="https://buckhouse.medium.com/augmented-imagination-a3f4519f9784">creative genome</a> come to mind). No startup wants to be the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90942310/ai-napster-who-going-to-own-it-next">Napster or Limewire to the eventual Spotify</a> (h/t Jason Boehmig). The rules are opaque: Japan has declared that content used to train AI has no IP rights, while Europe has proposed heavy-handed regulation.&nbsp; 
 



 Where do we stand now? Generative AI’s Value Problem 



<p>Generative AI is not lacking in use cases or customer demand. Users crave AI that makes their jobs easier and their work products better, which is why they have flocked to applications in record-setting droves (in spite of a lack of natural distribution).&nbsp;</p>







<p>But do people stick around? Not really. The below chart compares the month 1 mobile app retention of AI-first applications to existing companies.&nbsp;</p>







<p>User engagement is also lackluster. Some of the best consumer companies have 60-65% DAU/MAU; WhatsApp’s is 85%. By contrast, generative AI apps have a median of 14% (with the notable exception of Character and the “AI companionship” category). This means that users are not finding enough value in Generative AI products to use them every day yet.</p>







<p>In short, generative AI’s biggest problem is not finding use cases or demand or distribution, it is proving value. As our colleague David Cahn writes, “the <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/follow-the-gpus-perspective/">$200B question</a> is: What are you going to use all this infrastructure to do? How is it going to change people’s lives?” The path to building enduring businesses will require fixing the retention problem and generating deep enough value for customers that they stick and become daily active users.</p>



<p>Let’s not despair. Generative AI is still in its “awkward teenage years.” There are glimpses of brilliance, and when the products fall short of expectations the failures are often reliable, repeatable and fixable. Our work is cut out for us.&nbsp;</p>



 Act Two: A Shared Playbook 



<p>Founders are embarking on the hard work of prompt engineering, fine tuning and dataset curation to make their AI products *good*. Brick by brick, they are building flashy demos into whole product experiences. And meanwhile, the foundation model substrate continues to brim with research and innovation.</p>



<p>A shared playbook is developing as companies figure out the path to enduring value. We now have shared techniques to make models useful, as well as emerging UI paradigms that will shape generative AI’s second act.</p>



<p>The Model Development Stack</p>



 
 Emerging reasoning techniques like chain-of-thought, tree-of-thought and reflexion are improving models’ ability to perform richer, more complex reasoning tasks, closing the gap between customer expectations and model capabilities. Developers are using frameworks like <a href="http://langchain.com">Langchain</a> to invoke and debug more complex multi-chain sequences. 



 Transfer learning techniques like RLHF and fine-tuning are becoming more accessible, especially with the recent availability of fine-tuning for GPT-3.5 and Llama-2, which means that companies can adapt foundation models to their specific domains and improve from user feedback. Developers are downloading open-source models from <a href="http://huggingface.co">Hugging Face</a> and fine-tuning them to achieve <a href="https://www.anyscale.com/blog/fine-tuning-llms-lora-or-full-parameter-an-in-depth-analysis-with-llama-2">quality</a> performance. 



 Retrieval-augmented generation is bringing in context about the business or the user, reducing hallucinations and increasing truthfulness and usefulness. Vector databases from companies like <a href="http://pinecone.io">Pinecone</a> have become the infrastructure backbone for RAG. 



 New developer tools and application frameworks are giving companies reusable building blocks to create more advanced AI applications and helping developers evaluate, improve and monitor the performance of AI models in production, including LLMOps tools like <a href="https://www.langchain.com/langsmith">Langsmith</a> and <a href="http://wandb.ai">Weights &amp; Biases</a>&nbsp; 



 AI-first infrastructure companies like <a href="https://www.coreweave.com/">Coreweave</a>, <a href="https://lambdalabs.com/">Lambda Labs</a>, <a href="https://mlfoundry.com/">Foundry</a>, <a href="https://replicate.com/">Replicate</a> and <a href="https://modal.com/">Modal</a> are unbundling the public clouds and providing what AI companies need most: plentiful GPUs at a reasonable cost, available on-demand and highly scalable, with a nice PaaS developer experience. 
 



<p>Together, these techniques should close the expectations vs reality gap for models as the underlying foundation models simultaneously improve. But making the models great is only half the battle. The playbook for a generative AI-first user experience is evolving as well:</p>



<p>Emerging Product Blueprints</p>



 
 Generative interfaces. A text-based conversational user experience is the default interface on top of an LLM. Gradually, newer form factors are entering the arsenal, from Perplexity’s <a href="https://twitter.com/alexgraveley/status/1659276299091812353">generative user interfaces</a> to new modalities like human-sounding voices from Inflection AI.&nbsp; 



 New editing experiences: from Copilot to Director’s Mode. As we advance from zero-shot to <a href="https://thezbook.com/ask-adjust-the-future-of-productivity-interfaces">ask-and-adjust</a> (h/t Zach Lloyd), generative AI companies are inventing a new set of knobs and switches that look very different from traditional editing workflows. Midjourney’s new panning commands and Runway’s Director’s Mode create new camera-like editing experiences. Eleven Labs is making it possible to manipulate voices through prompting. 



 Increasingly sophisticated agentic systems. Generative AI applications are increasingly not just autocomplete or first drafts for human review; they now have the autonomy to problem-solve, access external tools and solve problems end-to-end on our behalf. We are steadily progressing from level 0 to level 5 autonomy.&nbsp; 



 System-wide optimization. Rather than embed in a single human user’s workflow and make that individual more efficient, some companies are directly tackling the system-wide optimization problem. Can you pick off a chunk of support tickets or pull requests and autonomously solve them, thereby making the whole system more effective? 
 



 Parting Thoughts 



<p>As we approach the <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-paradox-perspective/">frontier paradox</a> and as the novelty of transformers and diffusion models dies down, the nature of the generative AI market is evolving. Hype and flash are giving way to real value and whole product experiences.</p>



<p>At Sequoia we remain steadfast believers in generative AI. The necessary conditions for this market to take flight have accumulated over the span of decades, and the market is finally here. The emergence of killer applications and the sheer magnitude of end user demand has deepened our conviction in the market.</p>



<p>However, Amara’s Law—the phenomenon that we tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run—is running its course. We are applying patience and judgment in our investment decisions, with careful attention to how founders are solving the value problem. The shared playbook companies are using to push the boundaries on model performance and product experiences gives us optimism on generative AI’s second act.</p>

  AI’s $200B Question  <p>GPU capacity is getting overbuilt. Long-term, this is good. Short-term, things could get messy.</p>   
	By David Cahn	 



Published September 20, 2023
  



 
<p>The Generative AI wave, which began last summer, has gone into hyperspeed. The catalyst for this double acceleration was Nvidia’s Q2 earnings guide and subsequent beat. This signaled to the market an insatiable level of demand for GPUs and AI model training.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before Nvidia’s announcement, consumer launches like ChatGPT, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion had raised AI into the public consciousness. With Nvidia’s results, founders and investors were delivered empirical evidence that AI can generate billions of dollars of net new revenue. This has shifted the category into its highest gear yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While investors have extrapolated much from Nvidia’s results—and AI investments are now happening at a torrid pace and at record valuations—a big open question remains: What are all these GPUs being used for? Who is the customer’s customer? How much value needs to be generated for this rapid rate of investment to pay off?</p>



<p>Consider the following: For every $1 spent on a GPU, roughly $1 needs to be spent on energy costs to run the GPU in a data center. So if Nvidia sells $50B in run-rate GPU revenue by the end of the year (a conservative estimate based on analyst forecasts), that implies approximately $100B in data center expenditures. The end user of the GPU—for example, Starbucks, X, Tesla, Github Copilot or a new startup—needs to earn a margin too. Let’s assume they need to earn a 50% margin. This implies that for each year of current GPU CapEx, $200B of lifetime revenue would need to be generated by these GPUs to pay back the upfront capital investment. This does not include any margin for the cloud vendors—for them to earn a positive return, the total revenue requirement would be even higher.</p>







<p>Based on public filings, much of the incremental data center build-out is coming from big tech companies: Google, Microsoft and Meta, for example, have reported increased data center CapEx. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9dfee156-4870-4ca4-b67d-bb5a285d855c">Reports</a> indicate that Bytedance, Tencent and Alibaba are big Nvidia customers as well. On a go-forward basis, companies like Amazon, Oracle, Apple, Tesla and Coreweave should also be important contributors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The important question to be asking is: How much of this CapEx build out is linked to true end-customer demand, and how much of it is being built in anticipation of future end-customer demand? This is the $200B question.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-passes-1-billion-revenue-pace-as-big-companies-boost-ai-spending?rc=0uxjjk">The Information</a> has reported that OpenAI is generating $1B in annual revenue. Microsoft has said it expects to generate $10B in AI revenue from products like Microsoft Copilot. Let’s assume Google will generate a similar amount of revenue from its AI products, such as Duet and Bard. Let’s also assume Meta and Apple each generate $10B in revenues from AI. Let’s use a $5B placeholder for Oracle, Bytedance, Alibaba, Tencent, X and Tesla. These are all dummy assumptions—the point is that even if you assume extremely generous gains from AI, there’s a $125B+ hole that needs to be filled for each year of CapEx at today’s levels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a large opportunity for the startup ecosystem to fill this hole. Our goal is to “follow the GPUs” and find the next generation of startups that leverage AI technology to create real end-customer value. We want to invest in these companies.</p>



<p>The goal of this analysis is to highlight the gap that we see today. AI hype has finally caught up to the deep learning technology breakthroughs in development since 2017. This is good news. A major CapEx buildout is happening. This should bring AI development costs down dramatically over the long-term. You used to have to buy a server rack to build any application. Now you can use the public clouds at a much lower cost. Likewise, today many AI companies are using a large portion of their venture capital on GPUs. As today’s supply constraints give way to a supply glut, the cost of running AI workloads will come down. This should spur more product development. It should also attract more founders to build in this space.</p>



<p>During historical technology cycles, overbuilding of infrastructure has often incinerated capital, while at the same time unleashing future innovation by bringing down the marginal cost of new product development. We expect this pattern will repeat itself in AI.</p>



<p>For startups, the takeaway is clear: As a community, we need to shift our thinking away from infrastructure and towards end-customer value. Happy customers are a fundamental requirement of every great business. For AI to have an impact, we need to figure out how to leverage this new technology to make people’s lives better. How can we translate these amazing innovations into products that customers use every day, love and are willing to pay for?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The AI infrastructure build out is happening. Infrastructure is not the problem anymore. Many foundation models are being developed—this is not the problem anymore, either. And the tooling in AI is pretty good today. So the $200B question is: What are you going to use all this infrastructure to do? How is it going to change people’s lives?&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are building in this space, we’d love to hear from you. Please reach out at <a href="mailto:dcahn@sequoiacap.com">dcahn@sequoiacap.com</a></p>

 The most ambitious software release in Aztec Labs’&nbsp;history <p>Today we’re proud to announce Aztec <a href="https://aztec.network/sandbox/">Sandbox</a>, a local developer testnet for building end-to-end applications on&nbsp;Aztec.</p><p>Aztec is designed to be the endgame for blockchain privacy — the most complete solution for privacy-first blockchain applications ever attempted.</p><p>Aztec Sandbox is the first milestone toward that endgame, allowing developers to write applications that leverage a full suite of privacy primitives:</p>  Private smart contract composability (including public-private composability)  Private L1-L2 function&nbsp;calls  Private state management  Hidden function execution  <p>All enabled by an intuitive software development environment that abstracts the complicated mechanisms necessary to protect user&nbsp;privacy.</p><blockquote>⬇️ Download Aztec Sandbox at <a href="http://sandbox.aztec.network/">sandbox.aztec.network</a>.</blockquote> Background <p>Aztec Labs has been laying the foundation for a privacy-preserving Ethereum L2 for&nbsp;years.</p><p>Yet building the Sandbox has taken just 5 months-a testament to the quality of our team and the ever-improving modularity of Aztec’s technology.</p><p>The Sandbox is the first major step on a development roadmap that includes a multi-phase testnet for Aztec’s execution environment, fee model, sequencers, and provers-all culminating in a privacy preserving zkRollup that is fully decentralized at mainnet&nbsp;launch.</p> What comes in the&nbsp;box? <p>Aztec Sandbox is a comprehensive software release providing developers with a fast, lightweight local Aztec node, with features similar to Ethereum’s Ganache or Anvil local node packages.</p><p>Alongside Aztec’s local node testing environment, the Sandbox includes powerful tools and frameworks that allow developers to write and test smart contracts:</p>  Aztec Node: build and publish rollup blocks with Aztec’s node&nbsp;software  <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/master/yarn-project/aztec-rpc">Aztec RPC Server</a>: decrypt and store client-side private state, execute private functions and submit transactions to the Aztec&nbsp;Node  <a href="http://aztec.nr/">Aztec.nr</a>: write smart contracts using a comprehensive framework that extends Noir-an open-source zero knowledge programming language-with private smart contract functionality  <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/about_aztec/roadmap/features_initial_ldt#aztecjs%20">Aztec.js</a>: make RPC calls to an Aztec Node via Aztec’s Typescript wrapper  <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/docs/docs/dev_docs/cli/main.md">Aztec CLI</a>: interact directly with an Aztec Node using Aztec’s command-line tool  <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=noir-lang.vscode-noir">Noir VS Code Extension</a>: write Noir conveniently. Syntax highlighting, debugging and [other features] that make writing smart contracts in Noir utterly&nbsp;painless  <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/master/yarn-project/noir-contracts/src/contracts">Code examples</a>: get inspired by Aztec Labs-written example private smart contracts and example wallet implementations  <p>Developers should be aware that they are early adopters. You may encounter bugs or&nbsp;hiccups.</p><p>No fret.</p><p>For support related to Aztec Sandbox, join our <a href="http://discourse.aztec.network/">Discourse forum</a>, where you can get hands-on support from Aztec Labs’ developer relation teams and build alongside the Aztec developer community.</p><blockquote>🗣 Join the conversation on Aztec Labs’ <a href="http://discourse.aztec.network/">Discourse</a></blockquote> Get Started in&nbsp;Minutes <p>Aztec Sandbox provides a local development system for building and testing Aztec smart contracts in a fast, safe, and free environment.</p><p>The process of downloading the Sandbox, installing client libraries, and using it to deploy and use a fully private token contract on a local Aztec node takes less than 10&nbsp;minutes.</p><p>First, navigate to <a href="http://sandbox.aztec.network/">sandbox.aztec.network</a></p><p>Or curl the&nbsp;site:</p><p>/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL 'https://sandbox.aztec.network')"</p><p>A package will then download and execute, spinning up two Docker containers:</p><p>The Sandbox will create servers on localhost ports 8545 (Anvil) and 8080 (Sandbox); ensure those ports are free to prevent any conflicts.</p><p>Within a few seconds the Sandbox should be up and&nbsp;running!</p> What you can do with&nbsp;it <p>The Sandbox is the starting point for Aztec smart contract and application developers. The Sandbox helps future-looking developers get a head-start interacting with ZK-native blockchain environments.</p><p>And as pioneers in smart contract privacy, developers will need to add a few useful heuristics to their public-blockchain mental models. Some new concepts&nbsp;include:</p>  Private state management  Account abstraction models  Understanding patterns to keep private information private  Transaction paths which span both private and public function execution  Organizing contracts into privately executable logic and publicly executable logic  <blockquote>For more about UTXO abstraction and how Aztec makes it convenient to manage manipulating private state, read our blog post <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/privacy-abstraction-with-aztec/">here</a>. For more information relating to privacy preservation best practices, see<a href="https://docs.aztec.network/dev_docs/privacy/main">here</a>. And for more about transaction architecture, see&nbsp;.</blockquote><p>Using Aztec.js, developers can build full-fledged applications that let&nbsp;users:</p>  Write, deploy and test private smart contracts  Create accounts (choosing one of various account abstraction schemes!)  Manage their&nbsp;wallets  Send transactions to the network and track their&nbsp;progress  Query current chain state such as chain ID, block number,&nbsp;etc.  <p>Learn more about how to write an Aztec smart contract along with ready-made examples and walkthrough guides&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aztec.network/dev_docs/contracts/main">here</a>.</p> Use-cases we’re excited to&nbsp;see <p>Aztec’s <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/master/yarn-project/noir-contracts/src/contracts">smart contract examples</a> include a broad swath of use&nbsp;cases</p>  Public and private token contracts  Anonymous DeFi  Oracle price&nbsp;feeds  Air-drop contracts  Two-party private&nbsp;escrow  Account contracts that can privately validate account credentials  <p>We’re excited to see other application primitives including private identity, fully on-chain private games, and decentralized finance protocols offering privacy by&nbsp;default.</p><p>We can’t wait to see the explosion of higher-order privacy mechanisms that will be created by remixing and composing these basic primitives into complex smart contracts and full-fledged privacy-first applications.</p> What you can’t do&nbsp;(yet) <p>The Aztec Sandbox is our minimum viable local developer testnet. While developers can begin writing smart contracts, there is no shared in-production network.</p><p>While account creation, wallet management, smart contract creation, and transaction execution are all live, fee estimation, transaction sequencing, proving, and advanced key and address functionality will be released in future iterations of the&nbsp;Sandbox.</p><blockquote>🎻 For a full current list of limitations see&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aztec.network/dev_docs/limitations/main">here</a>.</blockquote><p>You can learn how to write and test Aztec smart contracts. You just can’t deploy production applications-yet.</p> What is Noir’s relationship to all&nbsp;this? <p>Aztec Labs first developed Noir as a standalone, open-source, universal language for zero-knowledge programming. Noir is designed to be compatible across proving systems while also being verifiable to any chain, not just&nbsp;Aztec.</p><p>​​It’s no surprise then, that we’ve chosen Noir as a basis for writing smart contracts on Aztec. Using Noir, we’ve written a collection of functions, types, methods, state variables, annotations, etc. which together provide a rich, syntactically pleasing framework, to aid developers in writing intuitive and legible private smart contracts.</p><p>Imaginatively, we called this framework <a href="http://aztec.nr/">Aztec.nr</a>.</p><p>Aztec applications written with the <a href="https://aztec.network/aztec-nr/">Aztec.nr</a> framework have the advantage of features and tools developers might expect to be packaged with any smart contract framework:</p>  Contracts (including callable contract functions and inter-contract function&nbsp;calls)  Persistent state variables  Contract address semantics  Access to msg.sender and other call context information  Access to transaction context information  Access to historic blockchain data  Events (logs) (both encrypted and unencrypted)  Cryptographic primitives  Cross-chain (L1 -&gt; L2 and L2 -&gt; L1) message&nbsp;passing  <p><a href="http://noir-lang.org/">Noir</a> is an open-source language with universal applicability to zero knowledge use-cases. In fact, our hope is Noir’s extensibility allows it to be used even in non-blockchain / web2 applications!</p><p>But with Aztec.nr, Noir now fits hand-in-glove with Aztec. Noir developers now have access to the best privacy infrastructure for their applications.</p><p>Noir developers: it’s time to come&nbsp;home.</p><blockquote>🏃 Get started now at <a href="http://sandbox.aztec.network/">sandbox.aztec.network</a>.</blockquote> Front-run the&nbsp;future <p>Joining now as a Sandbox developer represents a significant opportunity to gain early access and bend the blockchain universe toward more privacy, not&nbsp;less.</p><p>At Aztec Labs we’ve worked tirelessly to make zero knowledge cryptography accessible to non-cryptographers. Aztec Sandbox now delivers that promise in a developer-friendly package.</p><p>We’re thrilled about the opportunity represented by this release to begin democratizing access to fully decentralized privacy-enabled applications.</p><p>We hope you are&nbsp;too.</p> Get started <p>The fastest way to get going with Aztec Sandbox is our starter page at <a href="http://sandbox.aztec.network/">sandbox.aztec.network</a>, which allows you to download the Sandbox, deploy an example private token contract, and do basic interactions with the contract to transfer tokens between private addresses via the Aztec&nbsp;CLI.</p> Additional resources:   <a href="http://docs.aztec.network/">Documentation</a>  <a href="http://discourse.aztec.network/">Discourse</a>  <p>Originally published at <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/announcing-aztec-sandbox-the-endgame-for-smart-contract-privacy/">https://aztec.network</a> on September 20,&nbsp;2023.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/announcing-aztec-sandbox-the-endgame-for-smart-contract-privacy-f7f883ae352d">Announcing Aztec Sandbox: The Endgame For Smart Contract Privacy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol">The Aztec Labs Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

If ecosystems remain siloed they will become deserted islands. From the start, Cosmos has sought to resolve dependence on L1 blockchains by enabling an ‘internet of blockchains’ with the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) and CosmWasm smart contracts, allowing projects to interact with one another but retain their own distinct character and utility — like a sprawling archipelago of islands, all connected.</p><p>But the design of Cosmos means that all of the network traffic on and between chains — the boats connecting these islands, so to speak — is visible, and therefore vulnerable to attacks, surveillance, and censorship.</p><p>This is not only a problem with dApps, decentralised projects and blockchains of Web3, but with the internet as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>However, what makes decentralised infrastructure particularly vulnerable is the sheer amount of traffic that has to move across open networks in interchain and peer-to-peer broadcasts.</p><p>It is these patterns of ‘metadata’ traffic that are analysed by criminals, governments, big tech, and shady data broker businesses. And it is precisely these patterns that the Nym mixnet protects.</p> Build with the Nym Rust SDK on&nbsp;Cosmos <p>The <a href="https://nymtech.net/developers/tutorials/cosmos-service/intro.html">first part of this tutorial</a> teaches users how to take a first step towards building a service which can interact with a Cosmos SDK blockchain via Nym, thus securing the network&nbsp;layer.</p><p>Think of the service you’ll build as a kind of proxy: it interacts with the blockchain on the client’s behalf, shielding the client from the validator that it interacts with. At the same time, the service is also shielded from the client by the&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Let’s look at an example. Imagine you want to make a transaction. Generally speaking this would&nbsp;entail:</p>  Querying the blockchain for relevant information to construct the transaction;  receiving that back from the blockchain;  then constructing and signing the transaction and sending this to the blockchain;  and receiving a transaction hash back as confirmation.  <p>Using this tutorial, the queries and transactions will be sent from your client via the mixnet and a proxy service rather than directly from you, protecting your patterns of queries and transactions from the blockchain as well as any network observers.</p><p>Conversely, the validator would send information and transaction hashes back via the proxy service, which would send this through the mixnet (using something called <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/architecture/traffic-flow.html#private-replies-using-surbs">SURBS</a>) before it reaches your&nbsp;client.</p><p>NOTE: if you are a wallet developer and your wallet runs SOCKS5, SOCKS4a, or SOCKS4, check out using the socks client via the SDK instead of the websocket client. There is an example of how you’d connect&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/sdk/rust.html#socks-client-example">here</a>.</p><p>The tutorial covers writing two pieces of code in&nbsp;Rust.</p><p>The first piece of code is a client-side binary for constructing a blockchain query, which sends this to the Cosmos SDK blockchain before passing the response back to the client. The example in this tutorial is to query the balance of an&nbsp;account.</p><p>The second piece of code listens out for requests from the mixnet, acts on those requests, and anonymously replies to the client sending those requests.</p><p>The tutorial is in five&nbsp;parts:</p>  <a href="https://nymtech.net/developers/tutorials/cosmos-service/preparing-env.html">Prepare your environment</a>  <a href="https://nymtech.net/developers/tutorials/cosmos-service/lib.html">Prepare your&nbsp;library</a>  <a href="https://nymtech.net/developers/tutorials/cosmos-service/client.html">Prepare your&nbsp;client</a>  <a href="https://nymtech.net/developers/tutorials/cosmos-service/service.html">Prepare your&nbsp;service</a>  <a href="https://nymtech.net/developers/tutorials/cosmos-service/querying.html">Querying the&nbsp;chain</a>  <p>By the end of the tutorial, you’ll have learned how to integrate the Nym mixnet for traffic transport — allowing you to build privacy-preserving apps for real-world use cases much more&nbsp;simply.</p> Most blockchains are not private — yet <p>Most blockchains are not designed with privacy in mind. They are designed to be immutable public ledgers that record transactions and remain unchanged and unalterable.</p><p>The Nym Rust SDK introduces pattern protection for Cosmos traffic. But it does not provide privacy once information is stored on a given blockchain itself.</p><p>Now, if you are simply querying a blockchain, the mixnet will effectively protect those queries. But if you want to write to a blockchain, the mixnet only protects transactions in transit. This means you will need a privacy L1 (such as Anoma or Penumbra) if you want to ensure on-chain&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>The Nym Rust SDK is general purpose and can communicate with any blockchain — including those designed with privacy in mind. So integrate Nym for network layer privacy and choose your stack carefully!</p><p>The Nym mixnet is a general purpose, advanced privacy system for the whole internet, whether Web 2.0 or Web3, or a dApp, L1, or L2 blockchain.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>In August 2023, Brave released <a>Leo—Brave’s native AI assistant</a>—on its <a>Nightly channel</a>. Since then we’ve incorporated a lot of user feedback, and made numerous improvements to the feature. There are more changes on the way, and soon we will launch Leo on our full release channel, making it available to our 60 million users.</p>
<p>We thought now would be a great time to share more about how Brave is thinking about Leo, and the future AI integrations within the browser.</p>

 Background: Brave as a user agent 
<p>Brave has always been a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent">user agent</a>. A user agent is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_%28computing%29">client</a> application that gives users better control of the content they access on the Internet, without conflicts of interest between server operators – including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_tracking">third parties</a> – and the user. Leo takes this concept one step further, moving beyond the limited stance of browsing content in the way the author or creator intended. With Leo, you’re not passively consuming web pages and videos, rather you’re actively exploring content: asking tangential questions, seeking clarifications, exploring diverse viewpoints, and overall tailoring the Web to your preferences.</p>
<p>Leo “understands” the current page you’re visiting—it’s the next best thing to talking directly with the author. In fact, in many ways it’s better, as Leo can independently analyze and reason about pages, free of the author’s or creator’s biases.</p>
<p>To be clear, Brave isn’t trying to create the world’s leading Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch. Instead, our goal is to link users with top LLMs and harness them in innovative and where feasible, privacy preserving ways. Our goal is to open novel, convenient, and private use cases that are often possible only in the context of a particular user’s browsing session.</p>
<p>As with all Brave products, Leo adheres to Brave’s core values and is built with privacy by design. User inputs are always submitted anonymously through a reverse-proxy to our inference infrastructure, giving users an AI experience with unparalleled privacy. Also, conversations are discarded immediately after the reply is generated and are not persisted on Brave’s servers. As we expand Leo’s development, we will continue to integrate privacy into its features and to innovate with new approaches to give our users the privacy they expect.</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    


 General release channel availability: cost and viability&nbsp; 
<p>The first step to opening <a>this amazing feature</a> to our general release channel is to make sure the cost is viable for Brave to offer to its full user base. With more than 60 million users worldwide, the cost of running Leo as-is on our general release channel would be prohibitive without a paid option. For this reason, we’ll soon be offering a premium version of Leo. Alongside the free version of this feature, the premium version will cover the costs of hosting our premium models, and for paying the API access for other premium model choices.</p>
<p>This next update to Leo will include:</p>
 
 A seamless onboarding experience for the premium upgrade, including the ability to pay for premium access with BAT. 
 The ability to select different models directly in the main Leo interface. 
 The addition of integration points from other parts of the browser into Leo. 
 Access to better models such as Llama 2 70B, and Claude Instant (by Anthropic). 
 
<p>Here’s a table that summarizes the free / premium options:</p>

Inputs are always submitted anonymously through a reverse-proxy and are not retained.



<p>We’re targeting mid to late Q4 for the Leo release.</p>

 Mobile parity 
<p>Mobile parity will most likely follow shortly after the desktop release.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The focus of the mobile release will be to make sure everything from the desktop release works on Android and iOS.</p>

 Roadmap 
<p>Major enhancements and features for Leo are described and grouped into categories below. Some of these features will be available with the first release, and others will roll out during each of our browser updates.</p>

 Local persistence of conversations, and full-page interactions 
 
 Ability to store and reference past conversations locally on your device, and continue these conversations at a later date. 
 Ability to sync these conversations across devices using Brave Sync. 
 Full-page interactive UI via a URL like brave://chat (or brave://leo). 
 

 Better answers 
 
 Provide Brave Search results to the model for up-to-date information. 
 Provide <a href="https://community.brave.com/">Brave Q&amp;A</a> and <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us">Brave Support</a> to the model for user questions. 
 Provide Brave News results to the model for help answering user questions. 
 Provide cryptocurrency context to the model for help answering Web3-related questions. 
 Provide a generalized extension framework, or adopt an existing form of extensions such as ChatGPT plugins. 
 

 Richer output 
 
 Image generation as part of Leo’s possible outputs. 
 Ability to highlight text within a page that’s currently being viewed to support Leo’s claims. 
 Ability for Leo to take actions on a user’s behalf (for example, for Leo to start a Web search, change the current page to dark mode, or change a browser setting). 
 Entity highlighting of response text to link to Brave Search (for example, if an output talked about Brave, it may highlight Brave and make it a Brave Search query). 
 

 Model expansions 
 
 Continually add access to the latest-and-greatest models. 
 Expand commercial relationships to offer more model choices for premium users. 
 Larger context sizes. 
 

 Better language support 
<p>Today, if Leo is prompted in another language, it can already answer in that language (such as French and Spanish). However, not all languages are covered, and a page’s context, when used, will likely determine the response language. We’d like to add better handling for languages, and overall to expand the number of languages, and the quality of the output of those languages, by adding better international models.</p>

 Chat interface and customization 
 
 At the time of writing, context for Leo interactions can derive either from the entire page, or it can work with no context at all. In the future, we’d like to make this better via context menus, allowing users to select a specific part of a page to supply the model its interaction context. 
 We’d like to offer access to Leo via omnibox (address bar) suggestions, a new tab card, and more. 
 A CodeLlama integration into developer tools and in the sidebar, with optional injection into the current page context. 
 

 Model personalization and personification 
 
 Customize Leo’s tone and summary styles for personalized interactions. 
 User-defined boundaries, mood, and context awareness. 
 

 Content consumption 
 
 PDF summarization: the ability to interface with not only web pages and videos, but also with PDF documents. 
 Using accessibility and other information available to help models understand web pages better. 
 Image understanding via drag and drop. 
 

 Writing tools 
 
 Tools for filling in editable fields on web pages (such as formatting and generating text). 
 Grammar, spelling, and other suggestions. 
 Content suggestions, and content auto-completion. 
 

 Local model support 
 
 We’d like to offer locally running models, and even allow users to configure their own models. Doing so would open more possibilities for assisting users with their local, private Brave data (for example, making a better suggestion bar or autocomplete suggestions). 
 

 Brave Ads &amp; Brave Rewards integration 
 
 We may offer a privacy-preserving ad-supported option for those users who don’t want to buy a premium subscription, but still want premium features. 
 Thinking beyond display ads, we’d like the model to help users make purchasing decisions, via context such as detailed product information; this could entail an ad catalog and all knowledge about the products behind those ads, but not advertise or give you phony or biased information (for example, if you were trying to buy a TV, Leo could tell you it knows of a less expensive TV, or one that offers features not available in the TV you’re currently asking about). 
 We’d like to investigate how to tie this recommendation engine to Brave Rewards. 
 In these shopping scenarios, the model would always genuinely act first as the user’s agent. For instance, it might respond that a TV you were viewing had a better price elsewhere than in an online ad you may have seen. 
 
<p>With Leo by their side, users can interact with the Web in groundbreaking new ways. The future of Leo outlined in this roadmap is exciting to us. Unlike other AI assistants, Leo is not a simple chat interface. Leo is a companion for helping you make sense of the Web as you browse, while preserving your privacy and helping you stay in charge of your experience.</p>
<p>We genuinely value insights from our community. For any thoughts or feedback, connect with us on our <a href="https://community.brave.com/c/new-feature-feedback/brave-leo-feedback/158">community question and answer site</a>.</p>

We’ll define transaction paths, explain what they mean, and explore how they future-proof the Aztec experience for developers and&nbsp;users.</p> Ethereum Accounts, A&nbsp;Primer <p>In Ethereum, every account is controlled by a private key, commonly derived from a mnemonic. If you’ve ever created an Ethereum wallet, you’ve seen the list of words you need to engrave, memorize, or at minimum jot down to secure your&nbsp;account.</p><p>Note that we’re talking about Ethereum externally-owned accounts here (EOA’s), not contract accounts, since on Ethereum, EOA’s are the only accounts that can initiate transactions.</p><p>When you initiate a transaction on Ethereum, the network expects a signature from the private key that controls the account. If you create a signature that matches the public key associated with the transaction, the transaction is submitted with a transaction payload that instructs the Ethereum Virtual Machine on exactly what functions to&nbsp;execute.</p> Account Abstraction, aka “Seed Phrases Ain’t It,&nbsp;Chief” <p>At Aztec Labs we’ve been thinking hard about forms of account authentication beyond signatures. The use of seed phrases has significant issues:</p>  No recovery: if you lose your phrase you may lose access to your account&nbsp;forever  Confusing hygiene: you should never, ever, ever copy your phrase to your computer’s clipboard using the copy and paste&nbsp;feature  Single point of failure: anyone who has your key has full access to your&nbsp;account  <blockquote>📕 Read this post by <a href="https://twitter.com/smpalladino">Santiago Palladino</a> for more about the account abstraction designs being developed for Aztec on our <a href="https://discourse.aztec.network/t/ideas-on-account-abstraction/339">Discourse forum</a></blockquote><p>So how do we get around seed phrases and private keys as the sole forms of account validation? Seed phrases are just one very secure but very flawed form of account validation. There are myriad methods of account validation, spanning the spectrum from very secure to totally insecure, from intuitive to confusing, including but not limited&nbsp;to:</p>  Key sharding  Plaintext passwords  TouchID and other biometric signature schemes  <p>Keep in mind account validation can be as secure as you want it to be. One simple account validation scheme would be: “If you click the ‘yes’ button the account is validated.” It wouldn’t be secure AT ALL, but you could do&nbsp;it!</p><p>Account abstraction is confusing as a term, since it encompasses “everything but seed phrases,” but the holy grail of authentication would include three&nbsp;factors:</p>  Something you know (like a password)  Something you have (like a hardware wallet or Yubi&nbsp;Key)  Something you are (like biometrics or a decentralized proof of identity&nbsp;scheme)  <p>Aztec allows for combining all&nbsp;three.</p><p>But Aztec’s improvements to Ethereum go beyond the implementation of alternate authentication schemes.</p><p>Aztec’s transaction anatomy is also a bit different — users send proofs of computation rather than signing transactions from an&nbsp;EOA.</p><p>Here is the flow diagram for an Aztec transaction:</p>  User connects wallet to&nbsp;app  User expresses transaction intent  App supplies transaction info to&nbsp;wallet  Wallet executes&nbsp;function  Prove account interaction  Prove function  Wallet generates kernel&nbsp;proof  App receives kernel&nbsp;proof  Wallet broadcasts transaction to&nbsp;network  Aztec node includes transaction in rollup&nbsp;block  Ethereum finalizes L1&nbsp;block  <p>We’ll talk through each in&nbsp;turn.</p> Anatomy of a private Aztec transaction <p>Before we carve the patient open and look at its guts, know that there are two transaction paths within Aztec: private transactions and public transactions, each with their own attributes.</p><p>At the center of these transactions is something called the kernel circuit. The kernel circuit is the beating heart of the Aztec system, and validates private transactions. We’ll get back to it in a&nbsp;second.</p><p>For now let’s talk about what a blockchain transaction in general&nbsp;is:</p>  Authorization: typically a signature, but as we’ll see can be many&nbsp;things  Intent: typically a transaction payload that includes instructions such as FROM, RECIPIENT, SIGNATURE, and fee information  <p>We already discussed how Aztec allows for new forms of authorization, but how does it process transactions?</p><p>Aztec is a completely new execution environment beyond the EVM, and uses client-based zero knowledge proofs to prove individual transactions. That means the application developer’s job is to constrain functions appropriately and prove user&nbsp;intent.</p><p>Application developers can constrain user intents by writing smart contracts using Aztec.nr. In the private transfer example, the circuits behind the smart contract are checking a few conditions:</p>  Does the user own &gt;10&nbsp;DAI?  If so, destroy 10 DAI of their notes by creating nullifiers against&nbsp;them  Create a new 10 DAI note for the transfer recipient  Broadcast and encrypt the message containing the 10 DAI&nbsp;note  <p>The nullifier, new note, an encrypted log are all made public, but kept encrypted, such that the public information tells you nothing about what happened. Roughly all an observer can see is “a transaction happened here but I’m not sure&nbsp;what.”</p><p>That’s the core of Aztec’s value proposition — we know with mathematical certainty transactions are happening that follow blockchain rules, but we can’t derive any information about those transactions.</p><blockquote>📕 See our <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/privacy-abstraction-with-aztec-def9da73eb5">previous piece</a> on how Aztec’s privacy abstraction works</blockquote> Public Transactions <p>The path for public transactions is slightly different, as Aztec relies on the familiar Ethereum account-based model for public transactions.</p><p>The key to Aztec’s public transactions are unconstrained functions–Aztec’s public VM bytecode. Unconstrained functions just do “normal code stuff.” And by “normal code stuff” we mean simply execution code rather than proving execution as in Aztec’s private execution path. Unconstrained functions don’t lay down constraints. They just executes&nbsp;code.</p><p>If Aztec is a world computer, then unconstrained functions are the instructions the computer understands. Just like the EVM executes Solidity, the Aztec VM executes Aztec bytecode.</p><p>One key difference between the private and public execution paths is when code gets executed. In the private transaction example, code must be executed and proven locally–that is, before proof of the transaction is sent to Aztec’s network of&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>In the public execution path, the wallet has to receive authorization, but doesn’t process the transaction, instead sending transaction details onward to an Aztec node which then creates a proof of execution and inserts the proof into a&nbsp;block.</p><p>Because privacy is no longer a concern with public transactions, they can be sent unencrypted to the node to do efficient batch processing, rather than relying on a user’s local&nbsp;device.</p> Conclusion <p>Privacy UX sucks. Zero knowledge is complicated. Our goal is two-fold:</p>  Simplify DevEx with tools like <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/introducing-aztec-nr-aztecs-private-smart-contract-framework-54d716710407">Aztec.nr </a>— a smart contract framework that makes it intuitive to reason about private state management  Simplify UX with abstractions that help users access the blockchain with better tools than EOA signature validation  <p>Great privacy-first applications will be built on the backs of best-in-class tooling that makes it easy to build powerful software that makes preserving privacy smooth and intuitive for&nbsp;users.</p><p>That means more code, less cryptography.</p> Keep in&nbsp;touch <p>To learn more about Aztec generally, keep up to date on our <a href="http://discourse.aztec.network/">Discourse</a>, where we discuss major protocol decisions like <a href="https://discourse.aztec.network/t/request-for-proposals-upgrade-mechanisms/605">upgrade mechanisms</a> and <a href="https://discourse.aztec.network/t/request-for-proposals-decentralized-sequencer-selection/350">decentralizing sequencers</a>.</p><p>For more technical news on Aztec and Noir, join our e-mail newsletter:</p><blockquote><a href="https://embeds.beehiiv.com/83354329-29bf-48be-ba17-a99d72424ace">📬 Subscribe here to the Aztec Labs Developer Dispatch, the latest news and releases about Aztec and&nbsp;Noir</a></blockquote> Join our&nbsp;team <p>Aztec Labs is on the lookout for talented engineers, cryptographers, and business people to accelerate our vision of encrypted Ethereum.</p><blockquote>👪 If joining our mission to bring scalable privacy to Ethereum excites you, <a href="https://boards.eu.greenhouse.io/aztec">check out our open&nbsp;roles</a>.</blockquote><p>And continue the conversation with us on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/aztecnetwork">Twitter</a>.</p> Acknowledgements <p>Thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/Blulinski">Bruno Lulinsky</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Maddiaa0">Maddiaa</a> for input on this&nbsp;piece.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/aztec-transaction-anatomy-53ad2d9bc35e">Aztec Transaction Anatomy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol">The Aztec Labs Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Summary:&nbsp;Reflections on advancing digital asset regulation in 2023. How can we eliminate roadblocks and engender robust and transparent markets?</p>



<p>Like so many of us who have busy lives and demanding careers, we preciously guard our time for private life and relaxation. For me, having an overabundance of free time between jobs was daunting in its own way. I am sure that many of you, in a period of calm, also tend to want to take stock of your life, read books, clean out your closets, listen to podcasts, and do all the “things” there normally isn’t time for, while paradoxically filling the time we wish to have more of.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eventually I found a balance where I enjoyed the calm and time for positive self-reflection through lots of running and reading. Like many of you, I could not escape thinking about my profession, which frankly, I love. I contemplated how we can build on the solid work already undertaken this year in the nascent regulation of digital assets, through further collaboration and analysis, while eliminating barriers and roadblocks that aren’t helping to engender robust, fair, liquid, open and transparent markets.</p>



<p>Improve&nbsp;</p>



<p><a></a><a>&nbsp;</a>“To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often.” -Winston Churchill</p>



<p>In discussing digital assets and the events of the past year, the saying, “don’t throw out the baby with the bath water”, is often used to emphasise the importance of not discarding the positives that DLT has delivered in seeking to improve financial markets through removal of bad practices such as fraud and market manipulation (to name just a couple) and increase participation in the financial system.</p>



<p>This can also be applied to regulation. There is a tendency to think that because there is new technology, the governing policies and regulations must also be completely new, yet this is not always the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Great Financial Crisis of 2007/2008 led to many useful reforms and strong global principles and standards in the (global) financial services sector. These provide a solid foundation that can be modified, improved, and built upon for the regulation of new technologies within financial markets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many global standard setting bodies (GSSBs) have already begun to consult on and modify their principles and recommendations to provide guidance for emerging regional frameworks. There are a few foundational pieces of work by the GSSBs that have been set out over the past few years such as FATF policies<a>[1]</a>, FSB recommendations<a>[2]</a>, and IOSCO principles<a>[3]</a> aiming to improve their existing guidance and requirements and mitigate any unintended gaps.</p>



<p>At a regional level, financial regulators around the world seek to implement the improvements made by the GSSBs while also enhancing and modifying local frameworks. In Europe, work on digital assets frameworks has been predominately grounded in MiFID II. The EU’s MiCA Regulation aims to complement MiFID II, and the UK’s recent consultations have also indicated that they will seek to improve upon these frameworks, and others that are already implemented in the region.</p>



<p>North America has taken approaches that vary widely by country. The US and Canada have drawn predominately on both existing securities and commodities frameworks.&nbsp;Some, such as Bermuda have been amending existing regulation for specific topics such as issuance or custody.</p>



<p>The Asia-Pacific region has also drawn on securities regulation, as well as payments regulation. The UAE is racing ahead with a bold new approach for virtual assets while balancing these with strong securities laws and a common law framework. South America, by contrast has seen some countries jumping straight to using digital assets as legal tender and/or as a permissible mode of payment.</p>



<p>From these few examples of recent policy developments, it is clear there are frameworks that should be built upon. Regulation does not need to start from a blank sheet of paper, and market participants must continuously improve and implement best practices from the responsible innovation of the previous decade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eliminate</p>



<p>“Their knowledge of their tools is purely empirical; and they have a firm belief in the mummery that surrounds them.” – Isaac Asimov, Foundation</p>



<p>The dangers of trust without a comprehensive understanding of digital assets and regulation are hazardous, and this is arguably evident in the rhetoric from all sides. It often appears that many are blind in their beliefs and will trust without question the technology or the current regulation from those who have taught it to them. While much of this works and appears to have a high degree of social utility, many do not have a true grasp on why it works, or how to closely interrogate any individual component to ensure it works in the future with a higher degree of social utility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Danger may present itself in overzealous faith in DLT, especially when compounded by new regulations that are not proportional and are ill-fitting to new digital technologies. If those who work in technology regulation allow ‘mummery’ to induce a haze of belief in the infallibility of innovation, bad actors will continue to undermine the ecosystem. Blind belief must be eliminated, and replaced with verifiable transparency, compliance, and technical understanding from both regulators and market participants.</p>



<p>Despite much work in 2023 to advance legal definitions, there remains a lack of clarity for many market practitioners. Unclear or undecided legal status for digital assets is a clear barrier for the market. There are other missing pieces as well such as a lack of a global taxonomy for digital assets that prevent clear dialogue and comprehensive development of global frameworks.</p>



<p>The persistent use of the term “crypto” when referring to any kind of digital asset muddies the waters and puts Shiba Inu coin into the same bucket as a fully reserved fiat stablecoin or a bank issued digital bond. That is not a particularly helpful association, and a comprehensive global taxonomy could serve to eliminate some of this conflation and confusion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it is important not to blindly believe in technology, it is also important not to vilify it. In a truly technologically neutral approach DLT is not a cult, to be either worshiped or rallied against. DLT-specific risk should be assessed based on its implementation model, lifecycle activity, and network archetype and then the risk management and controls configured accordingly, with regulatory treatment to match.</p>



<p>So, what isn’t working? Ideologically, blind belief, while either favourable or punitive towards digital assets and DLT can be harmful to the market as a whole. From a legal and regulatory lens, lack of clarity both in the terms used, and the legalities that apply must also eventually be replaced by specificity and global consensus.</p>



<p>Delegate&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In dealing with the future… it is more important to be imaginative and insightful than to be one hundred percent ‘right.’” – Alvin Toffler</p>



<p>Beyond the foundational aspects of existing regulation and the problems still to be eliminated, what are aspects of the digital assets market that are not ‘solvable’ so to speak, by immediate regulation?<a>[4]</a></p>



<p>DeFi is one such still evolving area where it may be prudent for regulators to delegate further analysis and research before imposing requirements. Recently, IOSCO published their consultation on DeFi<a>[5]</a>, and the BiS also published a report on the future of DeFi<a>[6]</a>. Yet it is still evolving rapidly and difficult even to define. Even if the right definition is agreed upon, an enterprise that is truly decentralised in nature would present regulatory challenges and a unique and imaginative approach may be necessary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another item that can, and perhaps should be delegated, is RegTech. The ability for regulators to access, analyse and interpret the digital assets market is imperative. There are many RegTech solutions being created by the private sector, and regulators who leverage those innovations to implement outsourced technology, will have a fresh capability for digital supervision and this is pivotal to complete the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are only two areas where perhaps creativity is needed to solve the problem. As progress is made, neither the public nor private sector may always have the ‘right’ answer, however with insight, and imagination, these answers can evolve to contribute to the broader framework in innovative ways.</p>



<p>My reading, running, and at times, at times self-absorbed reflections left me a singular conclusion – it is clear there is much to be improved upon, but not in the sense that what already exists is not beneficial or useful.</p>



<p>There is a wealth of knowledge and existing regulation that can be drawn from to build a comprehensive global digital assets framework. Dogma towards both technological developments and unclear policies should be eliminated to better support the further digital development of the global financial services ecosystem and mitigate risks.</p>



<p>While there are areas where regulation may not provide the (optimal) solution for society, further discovery through cross-sector, multi-jurisdictional, and public private sector cooperation remains pivotal to the success of a robust, transparent, viable, and innovative digital assets market for everyone.</p>



<p>Improve, Eliminate, Delegate.</p>

<p>Toward a fully decentralized privacy-first Layer&nbsp;2</p><p>Today, Aztec Labs is thrilled to share the winning proposal from Aztec’s Sequencer Selection Request for Proposals (RFP) — “Fernet”.</p><p>At the heart of Fernet’s design is a fully permissionless, random leader election. This allows anyone to participate in building Aztec blocks and operating the network, cementing Aztec’s position as a decentralized Layer-2 zk-rollup.</p><blockquote>📕 <a href="https://hackmd.io/@aztec-network/fernet">Read the 3-minute summary of Fernet’s decentralized sequencer selection protocol</a></blockquote> Why Fernet? <p>The Aztec Labs team, with input from various industry leading experts, chose Fernet over the B52 protocol (and other designs submitted during the RFP process) due to its simplicity, safety, and ease of implementation.</p><blockquote><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/aztec-sequencer-selection-finalists-122dbc6bb4">📕 Read our previous announcement sharing B52 &amp; Fernet as the two sequencer selection finalists</a></blockquote><p>The random leader election in its design ensures that all participants have an equal opportunity to contribute. This not only fosters inclusivity and decentralization but also contributes nicely to the network’s censorship resistance properties, alongside features like <a href="https://discourse.aztec.network/t/forcing-transactions/606">forced transactions</a>.</p><blockquote>The Aztec Labs team could speak for hours on the tradeoffs and why this decision was made. We would love to engage in discussions, Twitter Spaces, or otherwise! Please <a href="mailto:hello@aztec.network">reach out to our team</a> for more information if you are curious and would like to discuss&nbsp;further.</blockquote> Dive Deeper with BlockScience <p>To provide a comprehensive and independent perspective on our decision, we engaged BlockScience — a third-party firm specializing in complex systems engineering.</p><p>We’re excited to present BlockScience’s detailed report contrasting B52 and Fernet, shedding light on the broad set of considerations and trade-offs between random leader elections and enshrined MEV auctions.</p><p>This report — in addition to significant internal debate and research — culminated in our choice of&nbsp;Fernet.</p><blockquote>📑 <a href="https://hackmd.io/@blockscience/Aztec_Sequencer_Selection">Read the BlockScience Report</a></blockquote><p>We will be hosting a Twitter Spaces with BlockScience tomorrow, Tuesday September 19th, at 11am EST to answer questions from our community and discuss their&nbsp;report!</p> Acknowledgements <p>We are very appreciative of the numerous individuals that lent their expertise, feedback, and insights.

      Bringing Generative AI to Healthcare         
	By Josephine Chen	 



Animation: Matt Hamel



Published September 14, 2023
        Where startups have traditionally struggled, LLMs have the potential to unlock growth and disruption.      



 
<p>Healthcare is a massive market rife with administrative inefficiencies. Of the over $4T in annual spend in the U.S. alone, $300B of that is administrative opex, mostly in repetitive, labor intensive processes. Generative AI is especially well suited to attack the labor costs of this services-heavy industry. As we have seen in legaltech, LLMs may unlock growth and disruption in a traditionally difficult vertical for software. Right now, the main applications of this technology target cost saving and automation in back office operations and making workflows more efficient for frontline staff, but the dream is for generative AI to dramatically improve patient outcomes.</p>



<p>We are already seeing innovative companies attack specific use cases, such as medical scribing, patient engagement and other workflows like prior authorization—and new opportunities are being discovered every day. The battle is already brewing. Faced with the familiar incumbents’ advantages in distribution, new entrants must lean on all their speed, ambition and creativity to break through, succeed and endure.&nbsp;</p>



 Market Background 



<p>Over the past decade, many new healthcare software companies confronted unfavorable market dynamics. Providers operate with razor thin margins and are often unwilling to spend on the promises of long-term cost efficiencies. Payors also suffer low margins and are a concentrated buyer group, with the top 5 players commanding more than 50% market share. These organizations can be slow moving and sales cycles can be incredibly long, creating roadblocks for upstarts.</p>



<p>It is no surprise that the biggest success stories in digital health have largely sidestepped these barriers by:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Benefiting from one-time regulatory changes (Epic, Cerner, Aledade) 



 Focusing on healthcare delivery within specific verticals of care (Maven for fertility, Livongo for diabetes, Hinge/Sword for MSK, Lyra/Headway for mental health) 



 Delivering a product experience adjacent to care (Zocdoc to help patients find doctors and book appointments, Doximity to help doctors connect with each other)&nbsp; 
 



<p>On the other hand, success in attacking core healthcare operations are few and far between, with the rare bright spots generally emphasizing revenue enablement over cost reduction (e.g., Viz, Cedar). The picture is even dimmer on the payor side. Frustrated with the intransigence of payors to adopt new technology, some startups have marched into the payor market instead, often with similarly disappointing outcomes.</p>



<p>GenAI tackles these constraints directly. It overcomes the buyers’ “poverty trap” by delivering large and immediate value, while maintaining robustness to unstructured data and operating environments. Its novelty factor and recognizable impact help to galvanize buyers, especially those who hope to appear innovative among peers. Most importantly, new entrants can leverage genAI to get a foot in the door and a chance to attack the broader healthcare software stack. The companies in our landscape represent these opportunities across six broad categories of front and back office operations.</p>
 







 
 Front Office 



<p>Patient-facing workflows are well-suited to LLMs because they are natural language interfaces that require the flexibility to address a wide range of conditions and special cases. There is also the potential for alignment here between care providers, payors and pharma companies, creating vectors for monetization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patient Engagement<br>There are 3 parts to patient engagement—pre-consultation discovery, patient intake and post-consultation care adherence. Discovery and intake are good fits for generative AI, which can access unstructured data to reduce search friction and help patients find the right provider more easily.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The best opportunity here is to improve post-visit care adherence. Patients take only half of the medication prescribed for chronic conditions leading to more than $100B in unnecessary health expenses. The solution can be as simple as automating the texts and calls that remind patients to go to follow up appointments, take medications and answer their basic questions. These tasks are currently done by legions of nurses and case managers. Cleveland Clinic, for example, gets 6M calls every month. Because payors bear the cost of non-adherence from aggravated ailments while pharma loses revenue for drugs not taken, there may be creative go-to-market angles here that startups can leverage.</p>



<p>Documentation<br>Patient-doctor interactions during consultations generate a load of manual process work, particularly transcribing these conversations into EHR fields and coding them appropriately. This taxes already overworked medical professionals and is often blamed for elevated professional burnout rates. There are an estimated 100K medical scribes today, up from 20K in 2016. With an average spend of $40-50K per scribe per year, this seemingly narrow use case costs at least $4B, exclusive of physicians’ opportunity costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the long term, players here have strong platform potential. They can deepen their features on the captured data, providing better referencing and workflows and eventually becoming a first-class system of record. Some documentation companies are already expanding downstream into areas such as coding and billing.</p>



<p>This is not a new insight, but there is a clear “why now.” The last generation of startups fell short because the tech was not ready, but the problem lends itself well to today’s LLMs, particularly Whisper and GPT4 models. Ironically, the risk now is that it is too easy and the tech will almost surely commoditize. In the market of smaller health systems and clinics, startups will need to go beyond the scribing wedge to create an all-in-one suite for provider operations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clinical Decision Making<br>As shown in legaltech, genAI can provide an interface to organize, retrieve and synthesize complex medical facts, notes and research. Physicians have traditionally been reluctant to embrace new workflows, but other use cases are potentially open to attack. For instance, one could envision LLMs empowering physicians to query a vast corpus of drug information or providing more personalized care for a patient.&nbsp;</p>



 Back Office 



<p>Much of the back office workload stems from the conflicting incentives between payors and providers. Providers often get paid for the service, rather than the outcome. Payors are naturally skeptical of what providers represent as necessary and would rather not pay for a service or drug. As a result, payors force providers through complex frameworks and arduous processes to justify their reimbursement requests and deny more than 1 in 10 claims. Payors are also burdened by the need to manually review and adjudicate claims. Both sides thus employ thousands of nurses and administrative staff to handle these tasks.</p>



<p>Prior authorization<br>Prior authorization is the arduous process insurance companies impose on physicians to seek approval before they can prescribe certain drugs to a patient or schedule certain procedures. In 2021, physicians submitted more than 35 million prior authorization requests to Medicare Advantage payors, of which 2 million were denied. AI-enabled automations arm the providers, patients and pharma companies—whose incentives are all aligned—against this death by administration. LLMs have been able to generate prior authorization forms with remarkable accuracy out of the box, which is why so many startups have started here.</p>



<p>There is a risk that this need may get regulated away. As the number of prior auths have grown so egregiously over the last few years, regulatory intervention looks increasingly likely. New policies that reduce the burden of prior auths overall would dramatically reduce the value of these products. And, as with AI-scribes, the technology to generate a prior authorization form is also fairly commoditized, so companies have to build out additional workflows to endure.</p>



<p>Coding<br>Medical coders read physician notes and look at labs to identify the right code for the diagnosis and procedure. These codes are then used for insurance billing. The medical coding market in the U.S. is worth around $21B, comprising about 35K medical coders. Despite all that labor, almost $20B of revenue is lost by U.S. hospitals annually due to coding errors, which has led to a cottage industry of local consulting firms that help providers “discover” missing revenue.</p>



<p>While most of the traditional solutions are rule-based, multimodal LLM models can collate unstructured physician notes, lab panels, and imaging to determine the right diagnosis codes. Automation can also reduce the administrative back and forth with payors and will be a natural lead into the massive opportunity that is revenue cycle management. Incumbents in the documentation space will also have a formidable advantage here.</p>



<p>Revenue Cycle Management<br>Medical billers create and submit a medical claim to the payor once they get the codes for the procedures/office visit. While claim submission is automated, following up on them is not. The combination of investigating and appealing rejected claims, verifying eligibility and benefits of all treatments and dealing with payors is probably the most significant administrative headache for provider systems. Eleven percent of all healthcare insurance claims were denied in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two ways to attack the RCM market: workflow automations or handling the billing itself. Automation comes with some tech risk and significant amounts of incumbent advantage (e.g., UiPath incorporating LLMs), while billing suffers from protracted sales cycles. The best entrypoint may be to expand into RCM over time from adjacent use cases.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Disruption in healthcare has historically been difficult and the windows of opportunities fleeting and narrow, but generative AI may finally provide the unlock. We are excited to meet teams who dare to reimagine the next decades of healthcare.</p>

 Noir gets extended with smart contract functionality <p>Today we’re announcing Aztec.nr, a powerful new smart contract framework for Aztec applications. Aztec.nr enables smart contract developers to intuitively manage private&nbsp;state.</p><p>In other words, Aztec now has a smart contract language.</p><blockquote>👀 <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-nr">Explore the Aztec.nr Github repo&nbsp;here</a></blockquote><p>Aztec.nr is a framework built on top of <a href="http://noir-lang.org">Noir</a>, an open-source, universal zk programming language to which Aztec Labs is a core contributor.</p><p>Aztec.nr allows developers to write private smart contracts in Noir and extend their functionality with templated functions that simplify state management.</p><p>Last week we teased how simple and intuitive private state management would be on&nbsp;Aztec.</p><blockquote>📕 Read the first post in this series: <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/privacy-abstraction-with-aztec-def9da73eb5">Privacy Abstraction with&nbsp;Aztec</a></blockquote><p>Today we’re explaining how Aztec.nr works and showing how you can get started building smart contracts and full-fledged privacy-preserving applications on&nbsp;Aztec.</p> The point of&nbsp;Aztec.nr <p>The Aztec.nr framework helps you deal with complex note management that is critical to privacy preservation within smart contract development.</p><p>But it does so in a way that makes it so that developers don’t have to rebuild smart contract functionality from scratch every time they write a Noir&nbsp;program.</p><p>Without Aztec.nr, you wouldn’t be able to emit events, make calls to other contracts, or even have the notion of a contract or an address. You’d have no msg.sender or access to historic blockchain.</p><p>Aztec.nr takes Noir — a general zero knowledge programming language — and gives it the smart contract functionality and syntax developers might expect coming from Solidity.</p><p>Developers can now access a complete set of smart contract features:</p>  Contracts (including callable contract functions and inter-contract function&nbsp;calls)  Persistent state variables  Contract address semantics  Access to msg.sender and other call context information  Access to transaction context information  Access to historic blockchain data  Events (logs) (both encrypted and unencrypted)  Cryptographic primitives  Cross-chain (L1 -&gt; L2 and L2 -&gt; L1) message&nbsp;passing  <p>For examples of Aztec.nr at work, check out examples&nbsp;of:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/yarn-project/noir-contracts/src/contracts/uniswap_contract/src/main.nr">a swap&nbsp;contract</a>  <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/yarn-project/noir-contracts/src/contracts/lending_contract/src/main.nr">a lending&nbsp;contract</a>  <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/yarn-project/noir-contracts/src/contracts/card_game_contract/src/main.nr">a card game&nbsp;contract</a>   How we got&nbsp;here <p>At Aztec Labs we harbor two very strong&nbsp;beliefs:</p>  Privacy is the major unlock for the next leg of adoption. Having every single address, transaction, and balance exposed in plaintext is a non-starter for everyday users, businesses, and institutions coming on-chain.  Privacy UX has to be better than the existing state of the art in blockchains. Privacy-preserving technology is only useful if the experience of using it isn’t better than what is available today.  <p>The Aztec.nr framework is a major step in improving the developer experience for managing private state — functionality that “vanilla” Noir doesn’t&nbsp;have.</p><p>For example for a simple private token contract, Aztec.nr includes helper functions like:</p>  get_balance  increment  decrement  etc.  <p>In other words, the kinds of functions you might expect to call in a standard token contract!</p><p>Let’s walk through this private token contract to show you how Aztec.nr helps with abstracting private note management:</p><blockquote>Follow along in the Github repo of our private token contract example&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/yarn-project/noir-contracts/src/contracts/private_token_contract/src/main.nr">here</a></blockquote>How private notes can be&nbsp;managed<p>Say Alice wants to send funds to Bob. Practically, she would have to aggregate all of the existing non-nullified notes they have of the asset she were sending, add up the values, and once she had enough notes to send the amount, create a change note to reconcile her&nbsp;balance.</p><p>For example, say Alice had two UTXO’s of 0.25 ETH each, and wanted to send 0.4 ETH to Bob. In order to spend the note Alice would have to sum the two 0.25 ETH notes together, nullify them both, and create a change note for herself of 0.1&nbsp;ETH.</p><p>Thankfully, Aztec.nr makes it easy to manage notes. Take for example the decrement and decrement_by_at_most functions written by the Aztec Labs team for the private token example&nbsp;above.</p><p>Here’s how decrement_by_at_most works:</p><blockquote>Follow along with the decrement_by_at_most example&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/0247b859d88781740fa990801a24881c09c5ca3c/yarn-project/aztec-nr/value-note/src/utils.nr#L59">here</a>.</blockquote><p>1. Find notes to decrement. The function begins by getting some notes that add up to max_amount or less from the set of notes owned by&nbsp;owner.</p><p>2. Destroy selected notes. It then iterates over these selected notes and destroys them, adding their values to a variable decremented.</p><p>3. Handle Change: If the total value of the destroyed notes (decremented) is greater than max_amount, it creates a new note with the excess value (change_value) and assigns it back to the&nbsp;owner.</p><p>4. Return the Decrement: Finally, the function returns the total value that was decremented, which is stored in decremented.</p><p>The decrement example is a perfect showcase for how Aztec.nr makes it easy to manage notes and nullifiers with built-in get, insert, replace, and remove functions.</p><p>If a dev wanted to write this without Aztec.nr (as in, write it with “vanilla” aka non-smart-contract Noir), they would have to write their own Merkle trees to insert and prove membership of notes and support non-membership checks for nullifiers.</p><p>But as a developer, you don’t have to worry about rebuilding core privacy primitives — the Aztec Labs team has already done all of that work on your&nbsp;behalf.</p><p>You just focus on smart contract&nbsp;logic.</p> When will I get to play with all this cool&nbsp;tech? <p>Soon, anon,&nbsp;soon.</p><p>We’ll soon release a local developer environment for developers to write and test Aztec smart contracts against a local instance of an Aztec&nbsp;node.</p><p>Developers will soon get a full-fledged development kit for building smart contracts and applications on Aztec, supported by Aztec.nr’s functionality.</p><p>But for now, you can preview what comes in the&nbsp;box.</p><blockquote>Explore the Aztec.nr Github repo&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-nr">here</a></blockquote><p>Start familiarizing yourself with Noir syntax, since Aztec.nr is simply a smart contract framework written in vanilla&nbsp;Noir.</p><p>To get started learning Noir, check&nbsp;out:</p>  The <a href="https://github.com/noir-lang/noir-starter">Noir starter</a>&nbsp;repos  The official <a href="https://noir-lang.org/">Noir&nbsp;docs</a>  <p>Finally, sign up for Aztec Labs’ developer e-mail list to stay apprised of all technical developments across Noir and&nbsp;Aztec:</p><blockquote><a href="https://embeds.beehiiv.com/83354329-29bf-48be-ba17-a99d72424ace">📬 Subscribe here to the Aztec Labs Developer Dispatch, the latest news and releases about Aztec and&nbsp;Noir</a></blockquote><p>To learn more about Aztec generally, keep up to date on our <a href="http://discourse.aztec.network">Discourse</a>, where we discuss major protocol decisions like <a href="https://discourse.aztec.network/t/request-for-proposals-upgrade-mechanisms/605">upgrade mechanisms</a> and <a href="https://discourse.aztec.network/t/request-for-proposals-decentralized-sequencer-selection/350">decentralizing sequencers</a>.</p> Join our&nbsp;team <p>Aztec Labs is on the lookout for talented engineers, cryptographers, and business people to accelerate our vision of encrypted Ethereum.</p><blockquote>If joining our mission to bring scalable privacy to Ethereum excites you, <a href="https://boards.eu.greenhouse.io/aztec">check out our open&nbsp;roles</a>.</blockquote><p>And continue the conversation with us on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/aztecnetwork">Twitter</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/introducing-aztec-nr-aztecs-private-smart-contract-framework-54d716710407">Introducing Aztec.nr: Aztec’s Private Smart Contract Framework</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol">The Aztec Labs Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

      Retooling the Status Quo         
	By Emma Starer Gross	 



Photography: Mark Davis



Published September 13, 2023
        David Hsu’s rebellious spirit led him to re-imagine the world of software.      



 
<p>David Hsu looked out the window of his childhood bedroom in Palo Alto. It was 2017, and for the greater part of the year, the room had served double duty as Hsu’s living quarters as well as the headquarters for his peer-to-peer payments startup, Cashew. Hsu’s parents had welcomed their son and the Cashew team into their home, sharing meals, couch space and the washing machine with the 20-something-year-olds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few months earlier, Cashew had been accepted to Y Combinator, but more recently, on Demo Day, when participants present their companies to potential investors, the Cashew team remained seated. They had nothing. Unable to make Cashew’s financial model work, Hsu and his team had burned through half their cash, and would ultimately decide to call it quits.</p>



<p>Hsu recalls the pain of this moment. “Our peers were up on stage raising all this money, and we felt like we let all the people who believed in us down,” he says. “I remember thinking, ‘What are we doing? Why are we burning away our savings, working on an app that loses money on every transaction?’” Mulling it over in his childhood bedroom, with its walls covered in punk-rock posters—relics that reflected his teenage rebelliousness and fighting spirit—Hsu decided he wasn’t done yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Failure is something you can recover from,” Hsu says. “I thought, ‘Okay, what did we learn? And how can we apply that to what’s next?’” From this soul searching, Retool was born.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Retool is a software development platform that offers drag-and-drop, customizable building blocks for developers to quickly assemble commonly-used software systems—admin panels, support dashboards, customer portals and more—so that they can focus on core features that set their businesses apart. “Our view was that the way people were building software was ridiculously inefficient,” Hsu says. “There’s no need for everybody to be constantly writing all this boilerplate code.” While critics bristled initially at this belief and found elements of Retool’s business counterintuitive, Hsu stuck to his guns. Today, the platform launched from Hsu’s childhood bedroom powers tens of thousands of companies including Disney, Airbnb and Mercedes-Benz.</p>

David Hsu</blockquote>



 



<p>When Hsu was 16, his parents told him they’d had enough. His grades were terrible and his friend group—fellow punk-rock fans who favored mosh pits and garage jam sessions over school—was, in their eyes, even worse. Hsu’s parents, who had immigrated from China to the United States for post-graduate studies, had tried everything, from curfews to taking away Hsu’s bicycle (Hsu simply walked instead). They informed their son they were moving him to Saratoga, a quaint suburb near Palo Alto. No more wayward friends, no more East Bay counterculture to distract him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hsu acknowledges that, angry as he was, the change helped. With fewer diversions, he started thinking about his future. Hsu was already an avid Hacker News reader and remembers an essay where Paul Graham, the venture capitalist who co-founded Y Combinator, described the creation of startups as “almost a measurement of the accuracy of your worldview. In a startup, there’s nowhere to hide,” Hsu says. “You can’t hide behind the work of others, you can’t fake your way to long-term success. You have to work hard (since otherwise you fail), you have to be smart (since otherwise you fail), and you have to be correct often enough (since otherwise you fail). But if you do it right, the impact of your work is remarkable: you can create something that actually puts a dent in the universe.” As a rebellious teenager who dreamed of having an impact and proving to others that his worldview was correct, Hsu was enamored by this challenge.</p>



<p>This fascination was heightened by the fact that Hsu’s high school experience coincided with the rise of Twitter and the Arab Spring. “I watched as this website, which was created in a matter of days, just miles from where I lived, topple a dictator halfway around the world,” Hsu says. “Technology could change peoples’ lives for the better, and that was exhilarating to me.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Silicon Valley founder trope would suggest Hsu might forgo or drop out of college to focus on technology. Instead, he did the opposite. He hunkered down, was admitted to Oxford to study philosophy and computer science, graduated high school early, and spent a gap year in China. “I wanted to learn more about the innards of computers,” Hsu says. “But I also wanted to leave the bubble of Palo Alto.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for his interest in philosophy, Hsu says it stemmed from Douglas Hofstadter’s Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid. He recalls a particular chapter about the relationship between ants and anthills. In it, a crab, anteater and tortoise discuss the paradox of how individual ants (who are not intelligent), when formed into a colony, can demonstrate signs of intelligence at the colony level. “This phenomenon is similar to neurons in the brain, where any individual neuron isn’t doing anything particularly smart,” Hsu says. “But then you put all the neurons together and you create a brain. That’s pretty smart.” Back in 1979, Hofstadter also used this logic of emergent intelligence to predict computers gaining the power to think like humans. “These philosophical ideas about humanity and science really interested me,” Hsu says. And then, of course, “the other reason I chose this area of study was that philosophy is kind of a big f*** you to your parents.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“What’s the worst that could happen?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was 2015 and Hsu, now in his senior year at Oxford, had gone out for ice cream with classmates. “We wanted to pay each other back,” Hsu says, “But England didn’t have an easy way for people to send money to each other.” Venmo, so popular in the United States, didn’t exist in the U.K. Hsu turned to his friends: “I was like, ‘It can’t be that hard. I bet we can build something similar.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One year earlier, on a whim, Hsu had joined his college’s Ball Committee, which organized the school’s seasonal dances. He quickly realized that ticketing for the balls was an unwieldy process. “Technology is unevenly distributed across the world,” Hsu says. “In the U.S., you have good ticketing platforms, but there wasn’t anything good in England.” So Hsu, having never built a production ticketing system before, decided to engineer a system where students could RSVP to the balls, buy tickets in advance, and check in by scanning their wristbands by the door. “It wasn’t particularly complicated, but attendees were shocked: there were no queues for purchasing tickets, the site handled thousands of concurrent users successfully, and scanning the wristband admitted you directly to the ball,” Hsu says. “If I had been back in Silicon Valley and built a ball ticketing site, no one would have cared. But at Oxford, where there were very few computer scientists, the skillset I had was valuable, and I was happy to have found a use for it.”&nbsp;<br>Back at the ice cream parlor, Hsu saw a similar opportunity and laid out his argument: there was a need in the U.K. for a peer-to-peer payments system. No one had built one; why shouldn’t they? What’s the worst that could happen?</p>
 







 
<p>“It’s a terrible idea,” John Collison said. The Stripe co-founder sat across from Hsu in Mountain View, at Y Combinator’s office. It was the winter of 2017, and in the time since the ice cream outing, Hsu had graduated from Oxford, launched Cashew, gained a small, local following for the app, and been accepted to Y Combinator.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hsu had 30 minutes booked with Collison. He spent the first three minutes pitching Cashew. Collison, in turn, took the next three explaining why it wouldn’t work: Cashew lost money on every transaction with fees paid to credit card providers, and while this was negligible in the startup’s early stages, if the app’s adoption continued, the cost would become a death sentence. Building out a business model that could offset transaction costs in the U.K. would be next to impossible. “I had arguments against what he said, but he rebutted each one,” Hsu says. “He was like, ‘no, nope, no, no, no.’ After maybe 10 minutes of our 30-minute allotted time, there was nothing left to say.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Had Hsu taken a page from his philosophy textbook, perhaps he would’ve listened to Collison. Hsu says one of his main takeaways from studying philosophy relates to the idea that reality isn’t objective. “People see the world from different angles,” Hsu says. “The way we react to things, evaluate pros and cons, and generate opinions is based on our own axioms and lived experiences. There’s no one ‘right way’ or ‘right reality.’ And so approaching situations with empathy and humility, seeing the world through someone else’s perspective, and then often revising your previously held beliefs, is critical.”</p>



<p>Still fresh from uni, however, this lesson hadn’t fully registered. Hsu left his meeting with Collison (respectfully) defiant and determined to prove him wrong. “And then, of course,” Hsu says, “he was right.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the spring of 2017, the company was hemorrhaging money in transaction fees and its bank account was rapidly dwindling. The Cashew team had attempted to cut its losses by convincing retailers to take payments via a Cashew digital wallet, but its development proved costly and time-intensive. “Looking back, I was incredibly naive,” Hsu says. “I had a pie-in-the-sky sort of attitude about what I thought of as this rebellious undertaking that everyone said wouldn’t work. Cashew had started as a project with friends, right? But after Y Combinator invested in us, after I moved back home, it was like, ‘Okay, this is real now. It’s time to get serious.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Cashew’s Achilles’ heel was its financial model, Hsu recognized that the internal systems the team had developed to support the app were powerful. The process of building these systems, however, had been repetitive and inefficient. “I remember always thinking, ‘I wish there was a faster way to build this software,’” Hsu says. “And so, post-Cashew, we had this idea of, ‘What if we took the code that we already had from Cashew and repurposed it? What if we gave it to other developers so they didn’t have to build the same internal systems from scratch?’” Hsu says. “This was the provenance of Retool.”&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I remember always thinking, ‘I wish there was a faster way to build this software.’”</p>
David Hsu</blockquote>



<p>As with Cashew, Hsu’s new idea—offering visual building blocks for engineers—had its share of naysayers. “Most people thought it was a pretty bad idea,” Hsu says. “Why would engineers buy something they could build themselves? Why not target non-coders? Why give engineers a vitamin when you could give non-coders a lifesaver?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Companies offering low-code or no-code solutions were trending at the time, but Hsu’s take was that, in the case of what Retool was looking to solve for, targeting non-coders was unrealistic. “Yes, these are building blocks, but they’re not one size fits all. They require customization and stitching together into a system that is fairly complex,” Hsu says. “You need to be able to talk to your computer, and to code, to achieve this.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for the argument of why engineers wouldn’t simply build the features Retool was offering themselves, Hsu’s view was that a company’s edge is its core product, not its internal systems. “Why not provide building blocks for those internal systems so that engineers can focus on their company’s core product, the custom stuff that’s fun, creative, exciting and differentiating?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the echoes of “this won’t work” from a previously failed endeavor might have stopped someone else, Hsu’s individualistic streak won out again. But he was also no longer the “pie-in-the-sky” college graduate who pitched John Collison and plowed ahead despite his warnings. His experience with Cashew had taught him “just because you’re a contrarian, it doesn’t mean you’re right,” Hsu says. “To know whether you’re a contrarian and right, or a contrarian and wrong, you have to take the time to fully understand the world in which you’re operating, the customers you’re serving and the business you’re building.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To achieve this, Hsu began talking to other engineers to see if a product like Retool might be useful to them. “I remember one day going into Y Combinator in Mountain View and going around to all the other startups asking, ‘Is it just us, are we the weird ones, or would this be helpful?’ And they responded enthusiastically to the idea,” Hsu says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bryan Schreier, the Sequoia Partner who led Retool’s Series A funding, was one such early enthusiast. “I used to work at Google, and I managed a large team of engineers who built internal tools. Despite being mission-critical, those engineers couldn’t wait to graduate and take on higher-value work. And when they did leave internal tools, they went on to build Gmail and Google Drive. If we had had something like Retool, we could have liberated all those engineers and the team wouldn’t have needed to exist at all,” says Schreier, “so for me, it was just clearly obvious that a company should address this space.”&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>

Bryan Schreier</blockquote>



<p>This support from the YC collective left Hsu determined to pursue Retool in earnest. “Later that day, during the 20-minute drive home to Palo Alto, I had this conviction that our contrarian view was right. That the way engineers built software was ridiculous. We could build a company to change that,” says Hsu.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When he returned to YC for Demo Day in the summer 2017, Hsu stood confidently in front of an audience of investors. The team had already signed a large enterprise customer to a $1.5 million pilot. Redemption achieved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In keeping with his commitment to know his own company nuts to bolts, instead of hiring a head of sales at the onset, Hsu took on the role himself. “I’d never done sales before and always pictured that scene in Glengarry Glen Ross where it’s all about charisma and closing,” Hsu says. “In reality, sales hinges on empathy and being able to explain your product. It’s about figuring out what a win-win situation could look like for both of you to work together.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each time a customer signed up for Retool, Hsu remembers “it felt unbelievable.” But these achievements were ones he and his team barely acknowledged. After the failure of Cashew, Hsu was skeptical of success. “I didn’t want to celebrate prematurely. Every customer felt like it might be our last. Eventually someone’s going to find out that we’re writing code from my parents’ house!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Parental HQ notwithstanding, Retool’s users grew steadily in numbers, and Hsu’s approach to his new venture reinforced just how far he had come from his Cashew days. “With Retool, we prioritized having a sustainable business from the get-go, so we cared quite a bit about unit economics and stayed very lean as a company. Compared to Cashew, where every transaction cost us money, this was a pretty different mindset. Here, people were paying us to use the software we wrote—in my childhood bedroom. Wow.”</p>



<p>Today, Retool has tens of thousands of customers; it’s helped businesses save hundreds of millions in operational costs; it boasts use cases including forecasting for the Olympics and operating networks of satellites. But Hsu’s focus on pragmatism with respect to his business remains strong. “Yes, Retool’s much larger now,” Hsu says. “But even today, we don’t want to oversell ourselves.” As Retool’s customer base grows, Hsu feels it’s more important than ever to remain empathetic and open-minded in order to understand their increasingly varied and complex needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, in 2017, a customer suggested that Retool be able to connect to application programming interfaces (APIs) as opposed to just a company’s databases. “For a while, we pushed back on this,” Hsu says. “We were like, ‘We think connecting to databases alone is fine and this is a request we can ignore.’ But then we self-reflected and thought, ‘Actually, you know, why not? Is it a core belief of ours that Retool must not connect to APIs? No.’ So we changed our mind, and today APIs are our most popular resource.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Our approach was, rather than immediately jumping on the AI bandwagon, let’s talk to our customers and understand how we could use AI to actually deliver value to them.”</p>
David Hsu</blockquote>



<p>The ability to connect to APIs has proven fruitful in other ways, perhaps most significantly in putting the pieces in place to help Retool’s customers make use of AI—a shade of Hofstadter’s Gödel, Escher, Bach prediction realized. “There’s a lot of hype around AI, and we’ve seen a lot of startups in Silicon Valley try to rebrand themselves as AI companies,” Hsu says. “Our approach was, rather than immediately jumping on the AI bandwagon, let’s talk to our customers and understand how we could use AI to actually deliver value to them.” They found that most of their customers were interested in AI, but weren’t sure how to approach it or how it could help them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result of these conversations, Retool developed a <a href="https://retool.com/products/ai">suite of AI features</a> that work in tandem with its current library of tools. “These features fall into two categories,” says David Dworsky, Retool’s Product Manager for AI. “The first category helps engineers build applications faster—so using AI to assist with code generation, query generation and debugging. The second category helps companies expedite AI-powered workflows that are specific to them. So if you’re an insurance company, using AI to match a claim with a policy. Or if you’re a fintech company, using AI to flag fraudulent transactions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because Retool is already connected to its users’ databases and APIs, “you can start stitching AI actions together with that data in literally a matter of minutes, without having to become an AI expert,” Dworsky says. “And we’re enabling these actions to be backed by whatever vendor a company wants to use—OpenAI, LLaMA, Cohere, etc. Our key insight here was to maintain flexibility behind the scenes, while making our AI features really intuitive to use.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For 16-year-old Hsu, a teenager with punk aspirations, siloed from friends and under the rule of parents, the prospect of founding a startup and getting to be his own boss was enticing. But today, at 28, Hsu recognizes that the job demands more than just rebellion. “Yes, you have to have your own differentiated view of the world and stand by it,” Hsu says. “But, when it comes to every element of your business, you have to be open-minded. You have to acknowledge when you are wrong, be willing to change your beliefs, and take a philosophical approach to understanding your customers and the world.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hsu no longer works out of his childhood bedroom: Retool now operates out of offices in San Francisco, New York and London. While the Retool of today differs from the company at its outset, Hsu has made sure its humble beginnings aren’t forgotten, documenting the company’s journey via photos. “That’s a piece of advice I have for founders,” He says. “Take pictures every step of the way. Five, six years out, you can look back and see how far you’ve come.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the case of Retool, the photos on its walls show a team that has expanded from a nonconforming party of just a few, to hundreds of people around the globe who recognize the value of thinking outside the box, and the possibilities that come with questioning, retooling—and occasionally rebelling against—the status quo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today we are excited to announce our partnership with ZebPay, one of India’s leading crypto exchanges. ZebPay represents a new custodial account provider option for <a>Brave Rewards</a> users in India, and is available in Brave version 1.58 on both desktop and Android.</p>
<p>With this partnership, Brave Rewards users in India will now be able to connect a ZebPay account to Brave Rewards in order to begin earning <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">Basic Attention Tokens (BAT)</a>. Existing users in India with <a>previous earnings</a> will also be able to connect a ZebPay account and have their balances redeemed for BAT and transferred to their ZebPay accounts.</p>
<p>In the near future, creators will also be able to connect a ZebPay account to their <a href="https://creators.brave.com">Brave Creators</a> account, allowing them to receive BAT contributions from Brave Rewards users.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to partner with ZebPay to enable our millions of Brave users in India to benefit from their Brave Rewards experience,” said Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave. “With this custodial integration, users can seamlessly access their BAT payouts in their ZebPay account and get rewarded for their online attention.”</p>
<p>“We are excited to be the exclusive partners for Brave Rewards in India,” said Rahul Pagidipati, CEO of ZebPay. “This strategic partnership not only reinforces our commitment to empowering users but also demonstrates our unwavering support of the crypto ecosystem in India. By enabling users to seamlessly transfer Brave Rewards to ZebPay, we are unlocking a new realm of possibilities for crypto enthusiasts. This is a testament to ZebPay’s vision of creating a more inclusive and accessible crypto ecosystem where users can fully harness the potential of their digital assets.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brave provides users with a better Internet experience by protecting their privacy. The Brave browser blocks invasive ads and trackers, which provides a faster (3-6x) and more private Internet experience, as well as less battery drainage. Brave users can earn BAT for seeing privacy-preserving ads in Brave. Online creators can also earn BAT from Brave users with <a href="https://creators.brave.com">Brave Creators</a> by publishing great content across a range of platforms including YouTube, Twitter/X, Vimeo, Github, Twitch, or their own website.</p>

 Instructions 
<p>To connect a ZebPay account to Brave Rewards, first make sure you’re on the latest version of Brave (version 1.58 or above). On Android, some users may only see Brave version 1.58 on the app store in a few days.</p>
 
 Open the Brave Rewards panel by selecting the BAT icon in the URL bar. Select “Connect account”, and then select ZebPay as your account provider. 
 


    
    

    


    


    
    

 
 Follow the steps on ZebPay. If you don’t already have a ZebPay account, create one and then complete these steps. Make sure to complete all ID verification steps for your account on ZebPay. 
 


    
    

    


    


    
    

 
 Voilà! Once your ZebPay account is connected, you’ll see a “Connected” status and a ZebPay zebra icon in the Brave Rewards interface.

<p>Deirdre Connolly joined the Zcash Foundation in <a href="https://zfnd.org/the-zcash-foundation-welcomes-a-core-engineer/">May 2019</a>. Over the past four years, she has been a key member of the Foundation’s engineering team, helping it grow from two people to nine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deirdre has been a key contributor to the development of both the Zebra node and the Foundation’s FROST implementation. She co-authored the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost/">FROST specification</a> (and will continue to contribute to that effort), and has served as a ZIP editor since 2020, helping steer Zcash through the lengthy and challenging NU5 upgrade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Outside her work with the Foundation, Deirdre co-hosts the <a href="https://securitycryptographywhatever.com/">Security Cryptography Whatever</a> podcast, and is fascinated by isogeny-based cryptography. She has also held a long-standing interest in quantum-resistant cryptography, and she has been tempted away from the Zcash Foundation by an opportunity to pursue this topic more deeply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her departure is bittersweet in that, while we are disappointed that her future career path lies outside the Zcash Foundation, we are pleased that she has found an opportunity that will allow her to further develop her talents as a cryptographer, and that she will continue to contribute to Zcash as a member of the Zcash Foundation’s Technical Advisory Board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On behalf of the Zcash Foundation team members past and present, and the Zcash community as a whole, we want to thank Deirdre for her contributions to Zcash and the broader mission of financial privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

This means that it does not protect traffic patterns from global adversaries, only against local adversaries, similarly to a dVPN. By default, Speedy Mode is not enabled, and users will have to switch the option on — allowing users to decide whether they want to optimise for speed or optimise for&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>The Nym mixnet is designed to be a privacy layer for the whole internet. But this can only be achieved if it is fast enough to support a wide range of use cases. Right now, the Nym mixnet works and can be integrated with any SOCKS5-compatible application.</p><p>However, the mixnet is slow and its utility is limited to use cases where speed is not so much of the essence, like&nbsp;email.</p><p>NymConnect with Speedy Mode will solve this by optimising latency across use cases. The first step will allow users themselves to manually optimise for privacy and latency depending on what they are using the mixnet for. As the system moves towards a full-stack VPN, some of this will be automated.</p><p>According to recent load testing benchmarking, the default mixnet currently averages download and upload speeds of 100KBps. Ping times were typically in the range of 800–1,000ms.</p><p>Those same tests found average upload and download speeds of Speedy Mode were 1,000 KBps, while ping times were as low as&nbsp;200ms.</p><p>The default option in NymConnect will be complete privacy protection via the regular mixnet. But if users want to optimise for a specific low-latency use case, they can “dial down” the mixnet by reducing cover traffic and enabling Speedy&nbsp;Mode.</p><p>Dial down cover traffic, dial up the&nbsp;speed!</p><p>Users in Speedy Mode can still trust the mixnet to provide robust privacy protections because data still travels through three hops. The majority of VPNs offer just one hop, merely obscuring your IP from your internet provider and little&nbsp;else.</p><p>To achieve the breakneck 10x pace of Speedy Mode, the cover traffic feature of the regular mixnet, where dummy data packets are mixed in with real data, has been dropped. However, cover traffic will still be sent when accessing the default&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Quickly now, without&nbsp;delay</p><p>A feature of the default mode is that packets are sent at randomised, delayed intervals through the mixnet. This provides extremely strong privacy protection. To whizz data along faster, Speedy Mode does not delay these packets, optimising for speed&nbsp;instead.</p><p>Bigger packet sizes, better&nbsp;speeds</p><p>The default mixnet splits content up into tiny packets of 2KB before sending these across the mixnet. To make things faster, Speedy Mode uses slightly larger packets of 16KB. These are still small enough to throw off snooping adversaries but because they’re larger, fewer of them need to be&nbsp;created.</p><p>Geo-optimisation</p><p>The mixnet splits up and casts your data far and wide all around the world. This makes it near-impossible to track metadata. For this reason, the default mixnet does not operate with geo awareness switched on. However, sending packets across the whole world is not particularly efficient for connectivity or usability.</p><p>When operating in Speedy Mode you will be switching on geo-awareness. Behind the scenes, Speedy Mode contacts mixnet gateways and locates the closest to your region and then identifies which Network Requesters are nearby. All other nodes are then grouped by region based on the selected gateway for that session, meaning the nodes used to mix traffic will be closer, and the mixnet will be much, much&nbsp;faster.</p><p>Only the first hop can assess your location. This cannot subsequently be linked to any of the other hops, nor your final recipient, so your communications remain safe, unlinkable and untraceable.</p> How to turn on Speedy Mode in NymConnect <p>Switching Speedy Mode on couldn’t be&nbsp;simpler.</p><p>Open NymConnect, click the menu icon, and navigate to ‘Privacy&nbsp;Level’.</p><p>Hit ‘Enable’ and that’s it — NymConnect is in Speedy&nbsp;Mode!</p> Split tunelling: the optimised Nym&nbsp;VPN <p>The upcoming VPN will put holistic privacy in the hands of you, the&nbsp;user.</p><p>Just like NymConnect, users will be able to opt for the default Nym mixnet for hardcore pattern protection against the most powerful adversaries. Or they will be able to optimise for speed instead of privacy where that makes sense, such as for streaming video via Speedy&nbsp;Mode.</p><p>But Nym VPN will eventually go even further into the application level.</p><p>With split tunelling, users will be able to select the level of privacy protections for each individual app across their whole&nbsp;stack.</p><p>In short, your crypto wallet could run over the highest possible privacy settings via the default mixnet, while your web browser could run in Speedy Mode for content streaming! The choice is&nbsp;yours.</p><p>Speedy Mode is a proof of concept, so please test it! As NymConnect is still in beta, it should not be used for strong privacy protections yet, and that goes for Speedy Mode too. Speedy Mode is a work in progress, and Nym needs your help to determine the privacy implications, so feedback is essential.</p><p>Send your feedback via error reporting <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/nymconnect">in the NymConnect app</a> or <a href="https://discord.com/channels/824256813200834580/1045634270766563358">the feedback channel on&nbsp;Discord</a>.</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/meet-speedy-mode-the-mixnet-but-10x-faster-70e6573920b4">Introducing Speedy Mode on NymConnect!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>with @alive_eth @danboneh @smc90</p><p>This week's all-new episode covers the convergence of two important, very top-of-mind trends: AI (artificial intelligence) &amp; blockchains/ crypto. These domains together have major implications for how we all live our lives everyday; so this episode is for anyone just curious about, or already building in the space.&nbsp;</p><p>The conversation covers topics ranging from deep fakes, bots, and the need for proof-of-humanity in a world of AI; to big data, large language models like ChatGPT, user control, governance, privacy and security, zero knowledge and zkML; to MEV, media, art, and much more. Our expert guests (in conversation with host Sonal Chokshi) include:&nbsp;</p>  Dan Boneh, Stanford Professor (and Senior Research Advisor at a16z crypto), a cryptographer who’s been working on blockchains for over a decade and who specializes in cryptography, computer security, and machine learning -- all of which intersect in this episode;  Ali Yahya, general partner at a16z crypto, who also previously worked at Google -- where he not only worked on a distributed system for a fleet of robots (a sort of "collective reinforcement learning") but also worked on Google Brain, where he was one of the core contributors to the machine learning library TensorFlow built at Google.  <p>The first half of the hallway-style conversation between Ali &amp; Dan (who go back together as student and professor at Stanford) is all about how AI could benefit from crypto, and the second half on how crypto could benefit from AI... the thread throughout is the tension between centralization vs. decentralization. &nbsp;So we also discuss where the intersection of crypto and AI can bring about things that aren't possible by either one of them alone...</p><p>pieces referenced in this episode/ related reading:</p>  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06616.pdf">The Next Cyber Reasoning System for Cyber Security</a> (2023) by Mohamed Ferrag, Ammar Battah, Norbert Tihanyi, Merouane Debbah, Thierry Lestable, Lucas Cordeiro  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14752.pdf">A New Era in Software Security: Towards Self-Healing Software via Large Language Models and Formal Verification</a> (2023) by &nbsp;Yiannis Charalambous, Norbert Tihanyi, Ridhi Jain, Youcheng Sun, Mohamed Ferrag, Lucas Cordeiro  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.01215.pdf">Fixing Hardware Security Bugs with Large Language Models</a> (2023) by Baleegh Ahmad, Shailja Thakur, Benjamin Tan, Ramesh Karri, Hammond Pearce  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03622">Do Users Write More Insecure Code with AI Assistants?</a> (2022) by Neil Perry, Megha Srivastava, Deepak Kumar, Dan Boneh  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09293">Asleep at the Keyboard?

<p>The PIVX community is dedicated to decentralized governance, allowing members to actively participate in shaping the project’s future. However, navigating a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) can be challenging, leading to reduced engagement. To address this issue, a comprehensive suite of PIVX DAO tutorials was created, aiming to empower the community and promote active participation in the DAO. <br>Let’s explore the significance of these tutorials and their impact on the PIVX community.</p><p>Voter apathy can hinder the effectiveness of any DAO, including PIVX. The tutorials will educate community members on launching proposals, voting, and tracking progress. The objective is to enhance the community’s understanding and knowledge of the DAO, creating a more inclusive, engaged, and empowered PIVX community.</p><p>The tutorial series comprises of six videos, each focusing on a crucial aspect of participating in PIVX’s decentralized governance. These videos will provide clear instructions on creating proposals, voting, and tracking their progress.</p><p>The topics covered include:** <br>1- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkJcWK0iMaM&amp;t=1s">Introduction</a> <br>2-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0Lx2VJSJlg"> Setting up a PIVX Wallet</a><br>3- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HL7sLovu6A">How to launch a pre-proposal</a><br>4 -<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3G7y6Jjcq0">How to launch a proposal on chain</a><br>5 -Monitoring your proposal<br>6 -How to promote your proposal<br>7 -Feedback and&nbsp;Followup</p><p>The tutorial videos are hosted on<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PIVXCrypto"> PIVX’s YouTube</a>&nbsp;channel.</p><p>The PIVX DAO tutorials aim to bridge the knowledge gap, increase voter participation, and attract new members to the community.

  Partnering with Co:Helm: The Co-Pilot for Health Care  <p>Abdel, Zahid and their team are giving clinicians a second set of hands—and fixing one of the biggest pain points for patients.</p>   
	By George Robson	 



Published September 11, 2023
  



Co:Helm co-founders Zahid Mahmood and Abdel Mahmoud.



 
<p>When your doctor orders a scan, prescribes a new medication, or tells you you need a surgery, you usually want to move as quickly as possible. But you also want to know it will be paid for, which for many patients in the U.S. means first getting your insurance company to sign off. In this “prior authorization” process, the insurer’s clinicians review your medical records—often a massive amount of different kinds of information, from test results to doctors notes, PDFs to imaging files—and compare them with a set of care guidelines to make a decision.</p>



<p>It is a time-consuming, manual process—and not just for the insurance company’s doctors and nurses, but for those on the provider side, as well, who sometimes spend hours responding to requests when they would otherwise be treating patients. Meanwhile, those patients have to wait for even the simplest approvals; in some cases, care is delayed as much as a month. And the problem is not just about speed, but also cost: <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare/our-insights/administrative-simplification-how-to-save-a-quarter-trillion-dollars-in-US-healthcare">One-quarter</a>, or $950 billion, of U.S. health care spending goes to administrative expenses, with as much as <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/briefs/administrative-waste-excess-health-spending?mkt_tok=ODUwLVRBQS01MTEAAAGHYLsgjXQJM8WofOYcJiWvqPptP5gxpsCn6iLacQY0QFcMunVE7Y0NWxKxNGRbiKYlHrnsLYiy0pwKPYQlNV7gki8eZRyyUMGkmpbleRKZUPxa">$570 billion</a> lost to inefficiencies that don’t improve patient outcomes.</p>



<p>We at Sequoia have seen again and again, across industries, that AI can be a powerful tool for solving just such challenges. But in this case, the trouble has been that while people with expertise in health care or AI are relatively easy to find, people with both are quite rare.</p>



<p>Luckily for us, though, <a href="https://www.co-helm.com/">Co:Helm</a> co-founders Abdel Mahmoud and Zahid Mahmood applied to <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/arc/">Arc</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Born in Libya, Abdel came to the U.K. as a refugee at 8 years old. By 15, he had his own software business—and by 18, he had joined the prestigious Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, where he became the youngest infantry officer in the U.K. Then Abdel became a doctor. He loved helping patients, but grew frustrated with the mountains of paperwork that kept him from spending more time with them, and eventually left medicine, returning to University College London for a master’s in computer science and going on to work in product at Facebook and Google.</p>



<p>Zahid, too, founded a company as a teenager—the first of his now-four founder journeys. He started the other two as side projects during a successful run as a software engineer building payment platforms for large insurance companies, which gave him deep expertise in the industry. He and Abdel became friends at UCL, and now they are teaming up to give doctors and nurses the extra set of hands that Abdel, when he was treating patients, always wished he had.</p>



<p>Co:Helm is an LLM-powered co-pilot for administration, handling all the work that comes before the clinical decision-making. Where it might take a nurse several hours to track down, organize and summarize hundreds of pages of records they need, Co:Helm can do it in seconds, allowing clinicians to increase their output tenfold and focus on what matters most: helping patients.</p>



<p>With partners including one of the top U.S. health plan administrators, Abdel, Zahid and their team will soon be making a difference for millions of patients, and the waitlist is growing quickly. We are proud to lead this seed round and help them hit the gas pedal as they <a href="https://www.co-helm.com/p/careers">hire</a> across engineering, sales and GTM, and regulatory roles. And while they are starting with prior authorization, there is a long list of pain points Co:Helm will ultimately be able to address, from case management to underwriting and beyond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fixing these problems will take grit, imagination, and both high IQ and EQ—but as we’ve seen ever since meeting Abdel and Zahid, those are defining qualities of the Co:Helm team. Throughout Arc, they also proved themselves to be great students: humble, eager for feedback, and serious about continuously improving their product. They have truly been a joy to work with, and we look forward to the joy of helping them build better health care.</p>

 Feature: Secrets, and how to prove them — a magician’s guide to zero knowledge proofs <p>with Michael Blau</p><p>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic (or so science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke famously said). One such area of sci-fi-like progress is that of <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/zero-knowledge-canon/">zero-knowledge</a> proofs (or ZKPs), a cryptographic tool that addresses two critical challenges in web3: scalability, and privacy. In particular, ZKPs could be the key to unlocking lower transaction fees and designing new privacy-preserving applications — ushering in many more crypto users. But beyond crypto, ZKPs can also help transmit sensitive data securely, combat illicit finance through <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/privacy-protecting-regulatory-solutions-using-zero-knowledge-proofs-full-paper/">privacy-preserving regulatory solutions</a>, and fight <a href="https://medium.com/@boneh/using-zk-proofs-to-fight-disinformation-17e7d57fe52f">disinformation</a>. </p><p>But what are ZKPs, really? There are many clever explanations out there, but even with the wealth of analogies available — from Waldo to Ali Baba’s Cave — it’s not easy to find an accurate, easy-to-grasp explanation of zero-knowledge proofs. Especially one that fully captures their superpowers, including for those who aren’t cryptography researchers or engineers.</p><p>So in this post and special demo, a16z crypto partner Michael Blau combines his background in magic with his work in crypto to explore a new analogy for demystifying ZKPs: a magic trick. Magic tricks, and magicians hiding secrets, can serve as a helpful mental model for understanding the key properties of ZKPs. Which makes sense, since zero-knowledge proofs in practice are indistinguishable from magic…  </p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/a-magicians-guide-to-zero-knowledge-proofs/">read more/ watch here</a><br>share: on <a href="https://twitter.com/blauyourmind/status/1700175388557885828">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0xb8bff3">Farcaster</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/a16zcrypto_magic-tricks-are-zero-knowledge-proofs-activity-7105942084783636480-sKAY">LinkedIn</a></p> Resource: ‘Back to school’ special playlists  The latest in crypto research  <p>Tim Roughgarden</p><p>With the goal of advancing the science and technology of the next generation of the internet, last year we <a href="https://a16z.com/announcing-a16z-crypto-research/">introduced</a> a16z crypto research — a new kind of multidisciplinary lab dedicated to helping shape crypto and web3 as a formal area of study. One of our goals was to help bridge the worlds of academic theory with industry practice, and one of the ways we do so (besides working with our portfolio and publishing our own work) is by bringing together the very best research talent across disciplines relevant to the space.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To that end, we’ve now hosted two immersive summer programs at the a16z crypto office — where we invite both established and emerging researchers to present their work and ideas, collaborate on some of the hardest problems in the ecosystem, and sharpen each other’s ideas by spending time with one another. You can watch many of the seminars (and listen in on our in-room conversations!) from summer 2022 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjQ9HCQMu_8yPGgfvsscHgt1w1KJkx8BN">here</a>, and from fall 2022/ spring 2023 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjQ9HCQMu_8yyzwwop1pq0MGCHC-WRC6B">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, we’re releasing new talks <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/introducing-our-summer-23-research-seminars/">from the latest summer 2023</a> program &amp; cohort. The initial drop included talks from a16z crypto research partners Joe Bonneau on distributed randomness beacons and Lera Nikolaenko on distributed data storage; as well as talks from Matt Green (Johns Hopkins) on “going beyond zero knowledge: next steps for compliance and constrained encryption on blockchains”; Sarah Meiklejohn (University College London, Google) on distributed key generation; and Ittai Abraham (Intel Labs, former VMWare; also <a href="https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/">Decentralized Thoughts</a> blog) on “it’s all about trust”. The second drop, themed “<a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1696632783194718451">cryptography week</a>”, features talks from Dan Boneh (Stanford, a16z crypto); Elaine Shu (CMU); Foteini Baldimitsi (GMU); and Ron Rothblum (Technion), <a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1696632783194718451">here</a>.

There are 3 main types of secrets most people have to hold for online access:</p>  <p>Passwords — which people use to access various websites and services. These must not only be kept secret, but be unique from service to service.</p>  <p>TOTP codes — which are often generated by an authenticator app or TOTP (time-based one time password) system. These provide two-factor authentication, where a second layer of security (hence the “two”, and “multi-” if more layers) helps protect access.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Seed phrases — “mnemonic” codes or recovery phrases that give direct control of all crypto wallets derived from that seed phrase. This reflects one of the empowering features of crypto wallets: Once you enter your seed phrase, you have total control of your assets without needing to move them from one custodian to another.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Note, these “secrets” aren’t all specific to crypto/ web3; anyone using the internet today should be using these practices (or something custom tailored for their needs)! And while our recommendation would be to harden everything to the maximum extent possible, the practical reality is that purchasing hardware wallets, webauthn keys, and machines with TEEs isn’t easy to do for most people (at least, not yet). Furthermore, losing secrets can sometimes be a greater risk than having them compromised: some information, once lost, can’t ever be found.&nbsp;</p><p>So one could consider this a “minimal viable security” approach. That minimum setup — using things many people already have — would be to use a well-vetted password manager to store your seed phrases and passwords; and a TOTP app on your phone to store and use TOTP codes for 2FA (two-factor authentication). Here’s more on why and how:</p><p>Do NOT use text messages on your phone (SMS) as a second factor for authentication. SMS is a very weak choice for 2FA, given <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220208">the rise</a> of SIM swapping/ jacking: where a hacker pretends to be you to your mobile provider (“I lost my phone and need help accessing it…”); then reroutes your phone number to their device; and then can then access any accounts linked to that phone. That’s why we recommend using authenticator apps (like Authy, Google Authenticator, etc.). Not all services allow two-factor authentication, unfortunately; so you should still make sure you’re using strong, unique passwords.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Store your passwords in a password manager. This is mostly to make having unique passwords for all internet services possible; otherwise most people default to reusing passwords across sites. A password manager secures each online account with a unique, complex password — and uses one strong “master password” to encrypt all the stored passwords (see for example <a href="https://1passwordstatic.com/files/security/1password-white-paper.pdf">1Password</a>, <a href="https://bitwarden.com/help/bitwarden-security-white-paper/">Bitwarden</a>, or <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/download/whitepaper-en.pdf">Dashlane</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Your master password should be at least 16 characters — preferably a randomly generated passphrase of at least 5 words, which is usually around 30 characters, but easier to remember. This is not an arbitrary recommendation; the GPU costs for computers to guess passwords by brute force <a href="https://support.1password.com/pbkdf2/">goes up exponentially</a> the more characters and words there are in a password. That’s why longer is better. Finally: Never forget the master password! If you have to, you can write down a password hint with pen and paper, store that in the safest place you can think of, and remember where it is.</p><p>Store an encrypted copy of your backup codes/ TOTP in cloud storage, and print them out in a secure hard safe. But what about storing your TOTP codes in a password manager? Some password managers do support this, but it is better to use two different applications so that both security “factors” — password, and TOTP — remain separated. So then where should you store seed phrases? While the answer is a bit more complicated, the short answer is: in your password manager. (If you have a crypto wallet with a lot of assets in it, consider a more complex scheme; otherwise, this approach should work for most).</p><p>related:</p>  <p>📑 <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/wallet-security-non-custodial-fallacy/">Wallet security: the ‘non-custodial’ fallacy</a> (with Nassim Eddequiouaq &amp; Riyaz Faizullabhoy)</p>  <p>🎧 <a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/crypto-web3-security-bridge-hacks-wallet-hacks-nomad-slope-MomCe42_">Bridge hack, wallet hack</a> (with Matt Gleason)</p>  <p>☑️ <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/11/12/16-steps-secure-you/">16 steps to securing your data, and life</a> (a16z)</p>  <p><br>-- Sonal Chokshi and a16z crypto teams</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6db3e133-2c70-4dbb-bb2a-d5ad55d3c1fa_550x69.png">   </a> <p><br>You’re receiving this newsletter because you signed up for it on our websites, at an event, or elsewhere (you can opt out any time using the ‘unsubscribe’ link below).

<p>Social media revolves around content creation, and while the content itself could be tokenised through NFTs, SocialFi aims to take it a step further. The recently released friend.tech app went to show that users might be interested in something more than just content - creator shares. This implicitly links back to handles and profiles, and we can slowly start to unveil the primitives of social media. Lens Protocol predates the friend.tech venture, in both timeline, as well as scope. While social media became synonymous with monopolistic central entities, Lens Protocol aims to build the decentralised bedrock for Web3’s social layer. These primitives would not only be interoperable with any Web3 application, but they would redefine content creation, feed generation and monetisation.</p><p>We were joined by Stani Kulechov, founder of Lens Protocol &amp; Aave, to discuss decentralised social graphs and how to leverage smart contracts to build the primitives for Web3's social layer.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  The vision behind Lens  Lens V2 and smart contract capabilities  Social media development platform  Defining the Web3 social media primitive  Feed generation algorithm on Lens  Integrating on-chain and off-chain infrastructure  The tragedy of the commons in decentralised social media  Can a public good architecture also accommodate private goods?

 Smart contract privacy without the brain&nbsp;damage <p>Aztec’s architecture is a departure from the current trend in blockchains of horizontal scaling via more general-purpose EVM-compatible execution environments. At Aztec Labs we joke we’re the first protocol not to build a&nbsp;zkEVM.</p><p>Instead, we are focused on one thing: becoming the ultimate destination for developers who understand and need smart contract&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>We are building a network and set of tools that gives developers everything they need to build privacy-first apps&nbsp;with:</p>  Anonymity by&nbsp;default  Private state read/write functionality  Private smart contract function execution  <p>In this piece you’ll learn why privacy on account-based systems like the EVM doesn’t really work, why Aztec therefore isn’t EVM-compatible, and how Aztec makes dealing with the unique architecture of private state environments as intuitive as possible for smart contracts developers used to EVM-like environments.</p> Why do this at&nbsp;all? <p>Since day 1, Aztec Labs has pursued smart contract privacy: private compute that doesn’t rely on trusted third parties or trusted hardware security&nbsp;modules.</p><p>And in a world with fully on-chain smart contract privacy, private state has to be a first-class citizen.</p><p>That means no EVM, no Solidity, and no account-based blockchain architecture, all of which are privacy-leaking.</p> Privacy isn’t EVM-compatible <p>Now you might find yourself asking, “Wait, why doesn’t the EVM support privacy?” And in fact there have been Solidity smart contracts that run on the EVM and provide primitive, non-programmable privacy functionality like&nbsp;mixing.</p><p>But we’re not talking about&nbsp;that.</p><p>We’re talking about smart contract privacy — an entire system that incorporates programmable privacy within the contract itself — at the level of state variables and functions.</p><p>In Ethereum’s model, state variables are stored in a public account-based tree, and to edit one of those variables you need to broadcast to the world exactly which leaves of the tree you’d like to edit, what they contain, and how you’d like to edit&nbsp;them.</p><p>This has some drawbacks.</p>  The current and historic values of every state variable are&nbsp;public  The functions invoked to execute state changes are&nbsp;public  The state variables modified by those functions are&nbsp;public  <p>Et cetera.</p> UTXO’s and nullifiers, name a more iconic&nbsp;duo <p>Instead of this nakedly public way of doing things, Aztec relies on an encrypted UTXO (Unspent Transaction Object) data architecture — the same technology Bitcoin uses to store network&nbsp;state.</p><p>The foundation of Aztec’s privacy design is an append-only data tree containing encrypted UTXO’s and another data tree containing their nullifiers. And we owe the original UTXO-nullifier design to the pioneers who created the ZCash protocol.</p><p>UTXO’s are also referred to as “notes,” and we’ll refer to them as such for the rest of the&nbsp;piece.</p><blockquote>For a layman’s explanation of our UTXO architecture, see <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/fully-confidential-ethereum-transactions-aztec-networks-privacy-architecture-274f968b13d4">this&nbsp;post</a>.</blockquote><p>In order to manipulate an owned note (which as a reminder are encrypted UTXO objects), users take the following steps:</p>  A function is&nbsp;called  The function requests an edit to a private&nbsp;state  The function asks the user’s note database for all notes belonging to that private&nbsp;state  The user (in reality the user’s Aztec node) proves on their local machine that each of the retrieved notes exists as a leaf in the tree machine without revealing which&nbsp;leaf  The user does an action: read, change, or delete values inside the&nbsp;note  The user furnishes a nullifier, which prevents duplicate action and prevents the user from reading the same leaf ever&nbsp;again  The user inserts a new leaf, containing a new value, as a way of updating the private state’s&nbsp;value   A short history&nbsp;lesson <p>You can trace our obsession with notes back to our initial desire for smart contract&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>And one of the things “smart contract privacy” requires is hidden function&nbsp;inputs.</p><p>We started with zkSNARKs, which allow us to hide function&nbsp;inputs.</p><p>We then built Noir, an intuitive, open-source universal ZK language for writing functions whose inputs can be hidden. But Noir doesn’t have a built-in notion of state storage and state variables.</p><p>So now, we’re introducing a smart contract framework that creates state variable structs on top of&nbsp;Noir.</p> Let variables be variables! <p>So to have privacy, you need private state, and for private state you need private state variables.</p><p>But what are private state variables? Well they can’t be&nbsp;notes.</p><p>Notes stores data or information, and when combined with nullifiers they can preserve privacy, but notes are constant and immutable.</p><p>Variables are variable! They can be modified by the functions of a contract. So how can we create the concept of a private state variable using notes as a building&nbsp;block?</p><p>Well, as we saw above, notes can be destroyed and created. To create the abstraction of a private state variable, maybe we can cleverly destroy and create notes behind the&nbsp;scenes.</p><p>That’s exactly what Aztec does: declare a named private state variable, then write functions which read current state, edit that state, and write the updated state at the&nbsp;end.</p><p>Behind the scenes, these private state variable structs are figuring&nbsp;out:</p>  which notes they need to gather as leaves in the private state&nbsp;tree  which notes they need to prove existence of in the&nbsp;tree  which notes they need to&nbsp;nullify  any new notes that need to be created and inserted into the&nbsp;tree  <p>But to a developer, the variables just look like variables.</p> Private token contract&nbsp;example <p>To be less abstract, let’s think about the bread and butter of blockchain: a private token contract. The first thing a dev would wish to declare is a private_balance state variable.</p><p>Aztec allows a dev to declare a private_balance state variable, and then modify the balance in a transfer function.</p><p>Behind the scenes, the private_state struct that’s been exposed can figure out how to create and destroy notes in a way that represents adding-to or subtracting-from a user’s balance, all while not leaking that user’s balance (by emitting nullifiers from the function).</p><p>You can represent anything as a private state variable:</p>  Values: an object with a value and owner field, like a banknote / $100&nbsp;bill  NFTs: an object with a unique identifier, or that contains all the unique attributes of an&nbsp;NFT  Accounts: an object owned by one or many&nbsp;owners  and more! Votes, DeFi positions, identity objects, and anything else you can dream&nbsp;of  <p>Private state variables store data or information, and can be programmed with two useful properties:</p>  They can be mutable (updateable) or immutable (non-updateable); and  They can either comprise a single note (be a singleton) or comprise a group of notes describing a state variable (in this case a type of private state variable called a&nbsp;set)  <p>It’s important to note (!) that notes are just used to store information, and don’t store functions or contracts. We will cover private and public execution in a future&nbsp;piece.</p><p>In case you can’t tell, managing UTXO’s would normally be a little bit complicated, and involves a few “gotchas” including how&nbsp;to:</p>  Search the tree for one’s own notes efficiently  Combine notes  Make change from combined&nbsp;notes  Destroy and update notes with nullifiers  <p>Unlike Ethereum accounts, which can simply be credited and debited, notes have to be created, combined, and nullified, which represents a distinctly different mental model. And where Ethereum values are just that — values — notes contain&nbsp;values.</p><p>Luckily, we at Aztec Labs have designed Aztec as a network with abstraction in mind. Our aim is to eliminate these difficulties and make writing Aztec smart contracts as similar to writing Ethereum smart contracts as possible.</p><p>Finally, while one of the benefits of our architecture is helping smart contract developers manage note complexity, one of the primary goals of this design is to abstract notes entirely from&nbsp;dApps.</p><p>Application developers rejoice! You’ll never have to think about UTXOs or notes at all, instead being able to call functions you would expect, like token.transfer(amount) or token.getBalance().</p><p>Passed around specific notes in an application would be extremely painful, and our smart contract framework helps abstract that completely from the dApp&nbsp;layer.</p><p>In the next post, we’ll cover Aztec’s smart contract framework and how it assists developers in managing private&nbsp;notes.</p> Start learning Noir&nbsp;today <p>Aztec Labs is a core contributor to <a href="https://noir-lang.org/">Noir</a>, the universal language of zero knowledge. We’re building an Aztec smart contract framework on top of Noir that extends its functionality beyond zk circuit writing language and toward private smart contracts.</p><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/noir-lang/noir-starter">Get started with Noir</a>, <a href="https://noir-lang.org/">read the docs</a>, and get ahead of learning the prerequisites for building on&nbsp;Aztec.</blockquote> Jump into the conversation <p>The Aztec Labs team is committed to building our privacy technology publicly.

<p>In November 2024, the <a href="https://electriccoin.co/reaching-consensus/">current Zcash development fund</a> will expire. Conversations about a new dev fund have begun, and community sentiment seems to favor changes regarding who receives Zcash issuance and how much issuance they receive. There’s little support for carrying over the current structure into a new dev fund, and there is a vocal minority who advocates against any new dev fund.</p>



<p>A little over a month ago, I gave <a href="https://youtu.be/Cy0rwBhlv10?si=2MvzjDRK2qTt8FRz">a presentation</a> at Zcon4, the annual conference hosted by the independent Zcash Foundation, about the importance of the Zcash dev fund and why it’s Zcash’s superpower. I made the argument that every decision is about balancing trade-offs and that the community needs to consider this in structuring funding and governance.</p>



<p>For context, here’s a common view of how Zcash community funding works today: 80 percent of Zcash issuance is distributed to miners, while 20 percent is devoted to Zcash development funding. Importantly, 8 percent of the total block reward (or about 40 percent of the current dev fund) goes into the Zcash Community Grants organization, which exclusively funds independent third-party developers. ECC (through the Bootstrap org) receives 7 percent of the total rewards, and the remaining 5 percent goes to the Zcash Foundation.</p>







<p>While this view of funding and governance is accurate, there are alternate views that are also accurate.&nbsp;</p>



 Tradeoffs in the current dev fund structure 



<blockquote>
<p>“There are no solutions. There are only trade-offs.”</p>
Thomas Sowell</blockquote>



<p>The Zcash Community Grants organization actually receives its funding through the Zcash Foundation; it doesn’t receive funds directly. It was set up this way for good reasons (mainly, creating a wholly new and separate entity is expensive), and Exhibit B represents this flow of money.&nbsp;</p>







<p>In <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014">ZIP 1014</a>, the community stipulated that the Zcash Foundation must not interfere with Zcash Community Grants’s decisions, and both the Zcash Foundation and Zcash Community Grants should be commended on their financial transparency. In a majority of cases, this structure in which money flows through the Zcash Foundation to the ZCG to independent developers and teams is just fine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the tradeoff is that the Zcash Foundation is beholden to US laws* which means that any organization or team that is downstream of the Zcash Foundation is also constrained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In my Zcon4 presentation, I highlighted two recent examples of the real-life implications of this structure.</p>



 
 In 2022, a person living in Iran who goes by Bitcoin Buddy applied for a grant to become a Zcash ambassador. They wrote about living under a theocratic dictatorship and incompetent kleptocracy that inflicts poverty and allows women to be attacked in the streets. Their goal was to tell their community about Zcash and frame it as an alternative or an “escape” from the oppressive Iran ruling regime. I suspect Zcash Community Grants would have liked to fund Bitcoin Buddy, but it couldn’t because its money flows through the Zcash Foundation, which is based in the US, is subject to the laws of the US, and would find its nonprofit status at jeopardy by funding a person or project in Iran. 



 In another example, a team of engineers who wished to remain anonymous applied for funding to build and implement new code on Zcash. However, because the team refused to give information like names and home addresses, a US KYC (Know Your Customer) requirement, its application was rejected. 
 



<p>If these scenarios alone don’t demonstrate the need for changes in a “Dev Fund 2,” consider that ECC, the organization I lead, is also based in the US and subject to the laws of the US, which means that all dev fund monies are constrained by the laws of a single government and regulatory framework.</p>







<p>It’s worth noting that miners, who receive 80% of all Zcash issuance, live outside the control of the US government and are not bound by rules on how they use that issuance.</p>



 A metric for Zcash sustainability and resilience 



<p>One useful way to address trade-offs is to look at a metric: the number of independent and sustainable organizations that support Zcash.</p>



<p>Exhibit A shows us that the number is three: ECC, Zcash Foundation, and Zcash Community Grants. Exhibit B illustrates that there are only two, and Exhibit C suggests that all of these organizations are consolidated and beholden to one entity, the US government. (I don’t count miners as supporters of Zcash because, to my knowledge, none of the large commercial miners do anything to improve Zcash. And in fact, most sell it at the end of each day to buy Bitcoin.)</p>



<p>There’s an ineluctable trade-off between independence and accountability. For any circle in these illustrations, you can choose independence or accountability, but only one attribute, not both.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Exhibit B, for example, the Zcash Foundation serves a valuable role, which is that it holds Zcash Community Grants accountable to its charge. But because it’s downstream of the Zcash Foundation, Zcash Community Grants isn’t actually independent.</p>



<p>At the blockchain level you can create accountability by the community as a whole adding and removing recipients of a dev fund, but below the blockchain level independence and accountability are a trade-off.</p>



 Failure modes 



<p>As a security engineer, I really like thinking about failure modes. In Exhibit D, I break them into four categories.</p>







<p>The first two failure modes, external and internal attacks, are pretty self-explanatory. Either could have a huge impact and even cause catastrophic failure of a project. US policy appears to be lining up against crypto as an industry, but for now, I still categorize these failure modes as “rare.”</p>



<p>Category 3, however, is common. Sadly, two-thirds of everyone who sets out to do anything never quite finishes, because success requires a mix of vision, timing, talent, and luck. When designing governance, we must be aware of and protect against a simple law of the universe: No matter how well-intentioned and skilled a person or team appears to be, there’s a not-insignificant chance they will fail to live up to expectations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The last failure mode, Category 4, is 100% likely. Every person and every group of people is a special interest with differing motivations, differing blindspots, and differing values and perspectives. Systems of governance must be resilient enough to produce good results in spite of this universal law.</p>



 Designing the next Zcash dev fund 



<p>Even with guaranteed failure modes and complex tradeoffs, it’s possible to design a governance system that increases the sustainability and resilience of Zcash.<br></p>



<p>As I said at Zcon4, “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” The next dev fund the Zcash community implements needs to (1)&nbsp; include more, independent teams than the current iteration, and (2) at least one of those teams should be headquartered outside the US.</p>







<p>No governance model is perfect, but my opinion is that these two recommendations will foster lasting benefits for Zcashers and the future of Zcash. I have extremely high confidence in the voice of the community, and I’m looking forward to continuing this conversation into 2024 and beyond!</p>



<p>*The Zcash Foundation recently announced that it has begun the process of setting up an operational nonprofit entity in the Cayman Islands, so that’s excellent news!</p>

  Crucible Moments: The Pivotal Decisions That Define Us  <p></p>   
	By Roelof Botha	 



Published September 7, 2023
  



 
<p>In 2012, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang noticed something strange. The GPUs his company was producing for gaming consoles and computer graphics were starting to pop up in research labs and academic circles. Machine learning computations that had been taking weeks to complete shrunk to hours when run on Nvidia processors. There were no commercial applications for this technology—but Jensen saw a far-off opportunity and pounced, leading what he calls a “wholesale pivot” to reorient Nvidia toward enabling AI. Most saw this as profoundly risky. It took a full decade, until ChatGPT launched in 2022, to comprehend the magnitude of Jensen’s audacious decision.</p>



<p>This is what we at Sequoia call a crucible moment—an inflection point where a choice you make today has an outsized bearing on your trajectory for years or even decades. Crucible moments define companies. They also shape our careers and lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I can identify a handful of decisions that disproportionately influenced the trajectory of my life. I grew up in South Africa. The country’s history cast a shadow, and I always felt that the innovation pushing the world forward—which I longed to be a part of—was happening elsewhere. Leaving my home, where I had deep roots, and setting off for the unknown in California was unnerving and lonely. It was full of risk. But it was also full of promise. Embracing uncertainty and moving to the heart of Silicon Valley just as the internet was taking off in the late 1990s profoundly altered the course of my life.</p>



<p>I faced another crucible moment soon after arriving in California for business school. A currency collapse in South Africa in 1998 wiped out my savings. I had a stark choice to make. I could rejoin McKinsey (where I’d worked briefly in South Africa), which generously offered to pay for my education. Instead, I was drawn toward a scrappy startup I’d met that was facilitating payments over the nascent internet. The company was burning cash and had offered me a scant salary to work part-time while finishing my degree. But it was building a magical product with transformational potential. It wasn’t the obvious choice, but I joined PayPal—and once again my life changed course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At Sequoia, we have had the privilege of partnering early with many of the most iconic founders of the past half-century. Time and again, we’ve seen how their willingness to make bold decisions in crucible moments—to optimize for long-term impact over short-term wins—is what enables them to build legendary companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometimes these moments are proactive, like Jensen pivoting to AI long before its time. Sometimes external factors create a forcing function for transformational change. A powerful example is Brian Chesky radically repositioning Airbnb through the pandemic. Airbnb’s revenue plunged 80% as lockdowns took hold—just as the company was preparing for an IPO. Less than two years later, after doubling down on its community and adapting its product for long-term stays, Airbnb went public at a valuation double its initial plan. That’s the impact of a crucible moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crucible moments typically don’t announce themselves. They can sneak up on you. I believe learning to recognize them and having the courage to act decisively—even when it requires defying conventional wisdom—is the single biggest determinant of sustained success.</p>



<p>Following through on the initial insight often requires making painful changes. You may discover you need a new set of capabilities on your team—or that capabilities you’ve toiled to build no longer serve you. In every case, navigating a crucible moment requires conviction and the grit to overcome naysayers, near-term obstacles, and the possibility of failure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For over 50 years, Sequoia has faced its own crucible moments. When I joined in 2003, the scars of the 2000 dot-com crash remained fresh. Most firms had afforded themselves a “mulligan,” telling LPs that funds raised in the lead-up to the crash had been written off. Sequoia chose to do the opposite. We forfeited fees and reinvested proceeds until the funds yielded gains for our LPs. The decision established a defining principle that we would not let our clients lose money and helped crystallize core values of performance and stewardship that still guide us today.</p>



<p>More recently, we have made foundational changes: we established the Sequoia Capital Fund, an innovative open-ended structure designed to weather short-term market fluctuations in order to attain the best long-term performance. The trust we earned with LPs following the dot-com crash and our continued performance allowed us to pioneer this approach. And in early 2023, after 15 years of growing leading firms under the Sequoia banner in China and India, we collectively decided to become fully independent partnerships across all five business units. Separating was not an obvious choice given each unit’s success—and yet it was the right decision for enduring impact in the coming decades.</p>



<p>Recognizing the opportunities and risks inherent to crucible moments is core to how we work with founders. Each company will face a unique set of pivotal decisions that shapes their trajectory, and we spend most of our time helping identify and navigate them. Occasionally, we convene our companies to help them see around corners when seismic shifts create a crucible moment for everyone—as we did in the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, at the start of pandemic in 2020, and early in the 2022 market correction.</p>



<p>Most recently, we convened founders at our AI Ascent event in March, 2023 to call attention to the collective crucible moment we all currently face. The era of low-cost capital and easy fundraising has ended; meanwhile, an era of unprecedented innovation potential and productivity growth driven by AI is just beginning. The convergence of these factors requires us to adapt. How we do will define the next decade. Careers will be made. Companies will be formed that change how we live, work and play.</p>



<p>We created our new podcast series, Crucible Moments, to offer a window into this mindset and this critical aspect of company-building. Legendary founders like Max Levchin of PayPal, Jack Dorsey of Block, Jensen Huang of Nvidia, Anne Wojcicki of 23andMe, Brian Chesky of Airbnb and Julia Hartz of Eventbrite will bring you inside their decision-making and reveal how they navigated the crucible moments that shaped their journeys. Jensen will break down that pivotal pursuit of AI; you’ll learn how Airbnb navigated the pandemic to emerge stronger, and much more.</p>



<p>At Sequoia, we help the daring build legendary companies from idea to IPO and beyond. We hope this series will prove useful and inspiring to a new generation of ambitious founders—and anyone curious for a new perspective on how to navigate the most important decisions you face when the answers are unclear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/video-game-market#:~:text=Report%20Overview,13.4%25%20from%202023%20to%202030.">gaming market set to grow at 13.4% yearly until 2030</a>, gaming is bigger than ever. And in a digital era marked by blockchain innovation, GameFi emerges as a game-changer, blending gaming with Web3 technologies. This article sheds light on what GameFi is, explaining its core elements, the exciting opportunities it offers players and publishers, and the complex challenges it faces.</p>



<p>GameFi isn’t just a passing trend; it’s a dynamic system that lets players earn while they play, provides publishers with new ways to make money, and creates special communities. But it also needs to deal with tricky issues like regulations, market ups and downs, and security concerns. As GameFi continues to evolve, it’s not just changing how we see gaming; it’s a symbol of the resilience and innovation of our digital world. The future of gaming has arrived, and GameFi is leading the way, ready to transform the gaming industry in ways we are only beginning to understand.</p>



 What is GameFi?  



<p>At its core, GameFi represents the usage of novel web3 aspects in traditional games, referring to things like changes in ownership of in-game assets as well as changes in reward mechanisms.</p>



<p>Some of the key components of GameFi include play-to-earn models as well as tokenised assets, both of which we will explain below to give you a better understanding of what GameFi is about.</p>



 Play-to-earn models 



<p><a href="https://zaisan.io/play-to-earn-business-models-games/">Play-to-earn models</a> are models for games in which players get rewarded for playing the game. These rewards can then be exchanged for real money (or cryptocurrencies).</p>



<p>In contrast to traditional gaming models such as pay-to-play or free-to-play models, where players either purchase the game upfront or invest money for in-game benefits, play-to-earn models harness the power of blockchain technology to establish an entirely new dynamic. While pay-to-play and free-to-play models have effectively catered to gamers’ preferences for years, the introduction of play-to-earn models represents a shift in how players perceive their gaming experience and their potential to make money while gaming.</p>



<p>Play-to-earn models approach this differently and compensate players for their time spent in the game. This compensation usually happens in the form of digital assets, both in the form of ‘regular’ tokens as well as non-fungible tokens. Players can also receive certain rewards for reaching specific milestones, achievements, levels, etc. After a player receives these rewards, they can either use them again in the game or sell them on a marketplace.</p>



<p>All in all, this kind of model provides a greater incentive for the players to continue playing, and it allows game publishers to push players in certain directions by changing the reward structure.</p>



 Tokenised assets  



<p>Closely related to these play-to-earn models are <a href="https://zaisan.io/services/tokenisation/">tokenised assets</a>. In a GameFi context, tokenised assets are actually the same as regular in-game assets, with the only difference being that instead of the game developers controlling the assets, the user controls the asset.</p>



<p>And this opens up a whole barrage of options. First of all, when players purchase in-game assets, their financial investment doesn’t simply disappear within the gaming ecosystem. Instead, they can sell or trade these items outside the game environment, linking their tokenised assets to real-world financial opportunities. While platforms like Steam currently allow the sale of in-game assets, these transactions are limited to the platform’s ecosystem. Tokenised assets have the potential to break down these barriers, offering a more versatile and user-friendly solution.</p>



<p>Secondly, tokenised assets empower players with greater influence over the in-game economy. Traditionally, game economies are subject to the control of developers. While this dynamic still holds true to some extent in play-to-earn games, players are gaining a voice in determining the value and significance of different aspects of the game, including specific items or features.</p>



<p>Thirdly, by tokenising assets, game developers can hand out limited in-game assets more transparently and easily. Blockchain technology can prove the scarcity of the items, adding more trust and also making it easy to verify the authenticity of in-game items in marketplaces and inventories.</p>



<p>These tokenised assets are key to play-to-earn models, as well as to GameFi as a whole.</p>



<a href="https://alienworlds.io/"></a><a href="https://alienworlds.io/">Alien Worlds</a> is one of the largest GameFi games in the world in terms of transaction volume.



 Opportunities of GameFi 



<p>There are a variety of opportunities opened up by GameFi, ranging from new ways to make money for both players and game publishers to the opportunity to create new kinds of exclusive communities. Let’s dive into each of these below!</p>



 Earn money while playing  



<p>GameFi offers gamers a unique chance to turn their favourite pastime into a potentially lucrative venture. Unlike traditional gaming, where the fun is its own reward, GameFi lets players earn real money while they enjoy virtual adventures. This shift is exemplified by play-to-earn models, which allow players to collect valuable in-game items and cryptocurrencies as they play.</p>



<p>Another fascinating aspect of this is the creation of limited special items. Game developers can use blockchain tech to make unique, scarce digital goods that players can get through in-game achievements or events. These limited items create a buzz, making players compete to get them, and they often become valuable assets that can be sold for profit on secondary markets. Furthermore, they can be used by game developers to incentivise player behaviour or to generate hype around certain events.</p>



 Secondary market fees for publishers 



<p>For game publishers, GameFi opens up a new way to make money through secondary market fees. As players actively trade and sell tokenised in-game items on external marketplaces, publishers can charge small fees for each transaction. These fees, although tiny individually, add up significantly as more and more trades happen within the game’s ecosystem.</p>



<p>These secondary market fees offer publishers a steady income source that goes beyond the traditional game purchase or in-game purchases model. This consistent revenue stream enables publishers to invest more in game development, enhancing the overall gaming experience and attracting a wider audience.</p>



<p>The secondary market also creates a lively ecosystem, encouraging players to actively participate in trading and investing in virtual assets. This dynamic player-driven economy enhances the game’s long-term appeal.</p>



 Exclusive communities  



<p>Another benefit of GameFi is the ability to create exclusive communities within gaming ecosystems. As players accumulate achievements, assets, and more, they become part of a unique group of individuals who share similar experiences or possess similar skills and/or items. These communities can be built around the shared ownership of rare in-game items, achievements, and a mutual interest in exploring the possibilities of GameFi.</p>



<p>These exclusive communities offer several advantages. They enable players to verify and show off their in-game achievements and items transparently, thanks to blockchain technology. This transparency builds trust among players and makes it easy to confirm the authenticity of in-game items in marketplaces and player inventories.</p>



<p>Game developers can also use these exclusive communities to foster direct communication with their player base. This direct engagement allows for real-time feedback, which can be invaluable in shaping game development and ensuring a responsive and player-centric gaming experience.</p>



 Challenges of GameFi  



<p>As with any new technology, challenges are part of the adoption process. GameFi is no exception to this, so it is important to consider the following three challenges related to GameFi.</p>







 Regulatory issues 



<p>One of the foremost challenges facing GameFi is the ever-evolving landscape of regulatory frameworks. Governments and regulatory bodies worldwide are still grappling with how to classify cryptocurrencies, decentralised applications, and blockchain-based assets. This ambiguity can result in uncertain legal status and potential compliance challenges for GameFi projects.</p>



<p>Moreover, the integration of real-world financial incentives, such as cryptocurrencies, within gaming environments can raise concerns about consumer protection, taxation, and money laundering. Navigating these complex regulatory waters requires a delicate balance between innovation and adherence to evolving legal standards, making it essential for games using GameFi components to stay informed and proactive in addressing regulatory challenges.</p>



 Market volatility 



<p>GameFi’s reliance on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology also exposes it to the inherent volatility of these markets. The value of cryptocurrencies can experience rapid fluctuations, impacting the real-world value of in-game assets and player earnings. Players and developers alike must grapple with the potential for sudden wealth fluctuations, which can pose financial risks and affect the overall stability of the GameFi ecosystem.</p>



<p>These fluctuations in prices of both cryptocurrencies and assets related to the game can heavily influence interest, player behaviour, and overall sentiment. To mitigate these challenges, developers may need to implement strategies like stablecoin integration or token stabilisation mechanisms within their games. Such measures can help shield players from extreme volatility while maintaining the economic incentives that make GameFi appealing.</p>



 Security concerns  



<p>As GameFi relies heavily on blockchain technology, the security of smart contracts, wallets, and decentralised applications becomes paramount. Malicious actors are constantly probing for vulnerabilities and exploits, and the financial aspect of GameFi makes this even more appealing. Incidents like hacks, exploits, or scams can erode player trust and confidence in the platform.</p>



<p>It is key to invest in robust security measures, including rigorous code audits, multi-layer authentication protocols, and secure wallet integrations. Additionally, educating players about safe practices in handling cryptocurrencies and in-game assets can help protect them from potential security breaches. After all, you decide for yourself how secure you store your assets.</p>

But the mixnet is already shielding users from surveillance, whether by guarding validator privacy on blockchains, or helping people gain real financial privacy by obscuring crypto wallet&nbsp;traffic.</p><p>Read ahead for more on how the mixnet protects communication patterns — the VPN, private crypto wallets, and shielded validators — how these protections are helping people, and why they&nbsp;matter.</p> Nym use case #1: Nym VPN: the world’s most powerful VPN — coming&nbsp;soon <p>Approximately <a href="https://surfshark.com/blog/vpn-users">1.6 billion people</a> use a VPN today, and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/vpn-statistics/">by 2027 the value of the VPN market is estimated to soar to US$107.5 billion globally</a>. With a fifth of the world’s population actively using a VPN, there’s not just a thirst for protecting online privacy, there’s a clear need for it. As governments work in lockstep to meddle with the freedom of communication or to access information without censorship, the VPN market is only going to grow even&nbsp;further.</p><p>The upcoming Nym VPN will combine the features, ease of use and speed of VPNs with the unparalleled privacy and trust offered by the Nym mixnet. It will solve three major vulnerabilities with most existing VPNs by offering:</p>  Pattern privacy Every online interaction leaks data about data, called ‘metadata’, which is used to infer information from patterns and de-anonymise people. The Nym mixnet splits data into smaller, identically sized, encrypted packets, which is then mixed in with dummy traffic and dispersed through Nym nodes around the world at randomised intervals. Finally it is decrypted and reassembled, preventing the observation of metadata and providing pattern&nbsp;privacy.  Privacy when paying If you use a traditional bank card to buy a VPN you’re doxxing yourself. Nym VPN subscriptions will be available with completely anonymous credentials and payment methods for total, holistic&nbsp;privacy.  A decentralised, trustless model Centralised VPNs are extra vulnerable to data breaches. Having a single point of failure also opens VPNs to vulnerabilities as <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/atlas-vpn-zero-day-vulnerability-leaks-users-real-ip-address/">with the zero-day vulnerability found with Atlas VPN that leaked users’ IP addresses</a>. There is no centralisation in the Nym mixnet whatsoever, unlike even Tor, the previous gold standard for online privacy. Unlike Tor, the Nym mixnet directory authority is decentralised and it is the Nym token economics that governs reputation and rewards on the&nbsp;mixnet.  <p>Today, individuals and organisations are already communicating securely through <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/configuring-nymconnect-with-telegram-9ca6425d95b6">Telegram</a> and <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/element-matrix-over-the-nym-mixnet-private-decentralised-and-secure-messaging-ac7f47bc47af">Element</a> via the Nym mixnet by using NymConnect.</p><p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/what-does-it-take-to-build-the-worlds-most-powerful-vpn-d351a76ec4e6">See also: What does it take to build the world’s most powerful&nbsp;VPN?</a></p><p>With Nym VPN, users will be able to access the mixnet with all the simplicity of a VPN — curtailing censorship and giving people unfettered access to whatever services they wish to use, free from interference and overreach.</p> Nym use case #2: financial privacy with crypto wallets on the Nym&nbsp;mixnet <p>Gain real financial privacy and safeguard your crypto finances from attackers and surveillance and join the users already protecting their wallets with NymConnect. Developers and project owners: check the <a href="https://nymtech.net/developers">developer portal</a> to learn more about integrating your wallet with NymConnect.</p><p>All Web3 wallets, or ‘light nodes’, communicate with validators, or ‘full nodes’, when they sign transactions and retrieve data. This means the transaction information of hundreds of thousands of people hurtles across open networks every minute of every day. And the patterns of this traffic are entirely exposed, putting people’s identities, digital assets, social graphs and more at&nbsp;risk.</p><p>Furthermore, every single crypto transaction is recorded on the blockchain forever. This is by design to keep blockchains ‘immutable’ i.e. permanent and tamper-proof. But because blockchains are public ledgers, these transactions are also visible to the whole internet forever — exposing transactions (peer-to-peer broadcasts) to anyone who cares to&nbsp;look.</p><p>Without a privacy-minded approach to crypto, users are at risk of being deanonymised through their transactions and targeted for attacks or hacking.

Even privacy-minded projects fail to address the fundamental problems of the network&nbsp;layer.</p><p>To answer these problems and build pattern privacy, <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-libp2p-how-to-solve-the-ethereum-privacy-crisis-with-public-goods-e2a4972bdf1c">Nym partnered with Chainsafe for a LibP2P module that cloaks validators on the Ethereum chain</a> and <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-partners-with-aztec-to-provide-integral-infrastructure-privacy-in-ethereum-chains-694963c55192">Aztec to further protect transactions on Ethereum</a>.</p><p>A proof of concept on the Cosmos Broadcaster that runs via the Nym mixnet has been completed and will soon be merged on GitHub.

<p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>This month, we completed Stage 0 of our v1 testnet, launched Testnet Stage 1, saw the DAO put across two crucial improvement proposals (one of them forming a solid alliance!), and expanded the information available in the Panther-verse.</p><p>Let’s recap everything that happened in August.</p> Tech Updates  Stage 0 is complete, but the Miner will keep going! <p>We are proud to announce that Stage 0 of the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-announcement-panthers-testnet-is-going-live-on-july-10th/">v1 Testnet</a> was successful! We're thrilled by the engagement we registered during it, and invite you to be a part of the journey towards Panther’s v1 launch.</p><p>Importantly, the Miner will continue working during the whole Testnet, with rewards not exhausted yet. However, browser mining has been discontinued, and only the desktop version will remain available.</p><p>Here’s, so far, how mining testing is going:</p>Mining Testnet results. v1 Testnet: Stage 1 Stage 1 is LIVE!<p>After a successful <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage0-live/">Stage 0</a>, we are debuting <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage-1-compliance-integrations-is-now-live-heres-how-to-test/">Stage 1 of Panther’s Testnet</a>. At this stage, you’ll test two of Panther’s very anticipated innovations: third-party compliance integrations and zero-knowledge accounts.</p><p>Stage 1 is public and will have dedicated rewards. Differently from Stage 0, users are rewarded for completing the product flow. However, we encourage the community to try to find and submit bugs, as well as to provide feedback. This process ensures that the Testnet returns a bug-free protocol, ultimately improving our product and its users’ experience. Furthermore, it works only on desktops, and not mobile devices. </p><p>At this stage, you’ll be testing two features that allow Panther to combine privacy-preserving DeFi access with compliance capabilities:</p>  <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/third-party-compliance-integrations?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Third-party compliance integrations</a>  <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/panther-accounts?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther Accounts</a>  <p>Users can visit the Testnet link for Stage 1 <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">in the info repository on our docs</a> to test the onboarding functionality. This involves creating a Panther Account, undergoing a simple verification process (name and email required, ID NOT required) with PureFi, and activating their Account. </p>Stage 1 of Testing showcases our first-ever third-party integration: PureFi!<p>To share feedback, testers will be using <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczZNB-tvMILSo8paFjIkeeSub3cqxv7L85rCeR47ad5bs2Gw/viewform?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">a dedicated form</a> as the only accepted procedure. The steps mentioned in the form’s description are needed to make this interaction both efficient and productive.</p> v1 Testnet documentation <p>Our Testnet documentation page will compile all the relevant links and info as our Testnet release progresses. This will guide users through our Testnet's development, ensuring easy access to the latest updates, key milestones, and important information. </p><p>Click here to view the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">v1 Testnet page</a> on our docs.</p>This chart containing all relevant Testnet information will be updated as our Testnet release progresses. Panther’s compliance integrations <p>We recently shared an in-depth article on <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/">Panther's compliance integrations</a>. These integrations are a major milestone for the protocol and will be tested at Stage 1 of Panther's Testnet!</p>Panther’s privacy-preserving compliance integrations.<p>Panther recognizes the need for a robust solution that safeguards privacy and also ensures compliance with regulatory standards. This keeps malicious actors away from the protocol while adhering to &nbsp;the Web3 ethos of decentralization and anonymity.</p><p>The Panther team and DAO have meticulously discussed ways to address this challenge, with ongoing conversations around regulatory best practices. As a result, we’ve designed an approach to bring compliance to the protocol while retaining neutrality.</p><p>Within Panther's solution, compliance providers need to be able to process users' data without the protocol learning it, proving a user's ownership of their wallet and giving them a zero-knowledge proof attesting to the validity of their statements. This allows users to access Panther while maintaining the protocol's neutrality.</p><p>Panther's strategy hinges on three core components:</p><p>1) Third-party compliance vendor integrations, maintaining neutrality and decentralization.</p><p>2) Panther accounts (zAccounts), creating a ZK bridge between verification and privacy.</p><p>3) Zones, logical partitions within Shielded Pools.</p><p>This article sheds light on Panther's simple yet elegant solution to the privacy-compliance paradox, adding yet another innovative feature to Panther’s groundbreaking solution.

During this discussion, multiple compliance vendors have been mentioned, and through <a href="https://snapshot.org/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x454f67e23b7f38f65b837a3c97233f467967fcb304e8c2826e3ab9b5fee97d35">PIP-17</a>, PureFi was proposed as the best solution for Panther Protocol based on, but not limited to, the following criteria:</p>  Decentralization.  Protocol-level integrations.  On-chain support for ZK-compatible attestations and signatures.  Fees paid (in $ZKP) on-chain by the protocol, enabling further utility for our token.  <p>As such, this integration will be of great importance as we progress towards Panther v1. Panther’s compliance integrations and PureFi’s flow can already be tested at Panther’s Testnet Stage 1. </p><p>In time, we’ll publish a blog post with all the details about the integration, which are also found at <a href="https://snapshot.org/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x454f67e23b7f38f65b837a3c97233f467967fcb304e8c2826e3ab9b5fee97d35">PIP-17</a>.</p> Events  ParisDOT conference <p>At <a href="https://twitter.com/Paris_Dot_Comm?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">ParisDOT Conference</a>, our Co-Founder Anish Mohammed shared his expertise on Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) during a panel with <a href="https://twitter.com/hydra_dx?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">HydraDX</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/paritytech?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Parity Tech</a>,<a href="https://twitter.com/BifrostFinance?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Bifrost Finance</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/DIAdata_org?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">DIA</a>! </p><p>Take a deep dive into this exciting DeFi trend:</p> Media  Router Protocol interview <p>Co-founder Anish Mohammed also participated in a Twitter Spaces organized by<a href="https://twitter.com/routerprotocol?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Router Protocol</a> to discuss Panther.

<p>The maximal extractable value (MEV) problem, if left unchecked, could represent an existential threat to Ethereum’s core values. One might argue that it is a natural result of solving market inefficiencies, but it entices to centralisation and collusion in order to extract the highest amount of value. Additionally, through front-running and back-running, it creates unnecessary overhead, which caused up to 2.4% of the total network congestion back in DeFi summer of 2020 (according to Flashbots’ research). As current infrastructure cannot eliminate MEV altogether, Flashbots and other research groups have tried to come up with solutions to address its aftermath.</p><p>We were joined by Stephane Gosselin, co-founder of Flashbots and Frontier Research, to discuss the MEV landscape, what research breakthroughs have been recorded and how they impact DevEx and UX.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Reflecting on ‘Frontrunning the MEV crisis’  Decentralising the MEV ‘supply chain’  The vision behind Frontier Research  Request-for-Quotation (RFQ) explained  Block building  Uniswap X and how it might impact LPs &amp; block building  Decentralising block building  Proposer-builder separation (PBS)  MEV burn  How MEV influenced different applications’ UX   Intents  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/thegostep">Stephane Gosselin on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://frontier.tech/">Frontier Research</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/FrontierDotTech">Frontier Research on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://www.flashbots.net/">Flashbots</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Brian Fabian Crain &amp; Felix Lutsch.

<p>7 years of experience building blockchain communities. Privacy advocate. Previously at Oasis&nbsp;Network.</p><p>Alyssa (Aztec): Hey Meredith! So the idea of this interview is to get a sense of your career path, your role at Aztec, and what you’re excited about as a new member of our commercial team!</p><p>Can you start by sharing your web2 background and how it helped lead you to&nbsp;web3?</p><blockquote>Hi there, and yes! I was previously working in real estate, and funny enough I was an Assistant Leasing Manager for ~7 apartment complexes here in Baton Rouge. In a way, I was “Community Manager” — doing marketing and other leasing&nbsp;work.</blockquote><blockquote>I wanted to start investing, but wasn’t exactly sure about what to invest in. I started doing copious amounts of research and stumbled upon crypto. I had heard of it like most people, had seen it in the news, and just generally heard all the crazy stories about how crypto was being used back in those days. This was around 2016, and I was young and&nbsp;excited.</blockquote><p>Alyssa: How about what falling down the web3 rabbit hole looked like for&nbsp;you?</p><blockquote>It took me a while to piece together what a smart contract or protocol was, and why these systems made sense for this transparent blockchain context as opposed to what we have in web2 — where everything is off-chain and we don’t have much control or flexibility.</blockquote><blockquote>Once I really started understanding what this technology meant for the future of society, for my children, I was inspired. I was working full time, mom of two, and staying up until 2:00 or 3:00am every single night on Reddit, on Facebook groups, on Twitter. Learning everything that I could — reading white papers. Since then, I’ve remained extremely passionate and&nbsp;curious.</blockquote><p>Alyssa: How do you feel about the industry’s evolution over the past ~8&nbsp;years?</p><blockquote>Of course there’ve been periods when I’ve been disappointed in the industry, and seen the exact behaviors that we wanted to avoid from the traditional finance sector/web2 world replicated in this space that I saw as a shining&nbsp;beacon.</blockquote><blockquote>But I’ve really enjoyed most of it, and now I’ve reached a point where I fully acknowledge that things are shifting rapidly, and people are going to make mistakes. Web3 is a place where we can learn and improve together.</blockquote><p>Alyssa: Why did you decide to join&nbsp;Aztec?</p><blockquote>I’m super passionate about privacy in general. I was previously working at another privacy project called <a href="https://oasisprotocol.org/">Oasis</a>. And before that, I did work for <a href="https://pivx.org/">PIVX</a> — also centered around privacy. This has been a major theme in my excitement about what blockchain means.</blockquote><blockquote>There’s this public side of things which is great. But to expand these really cool use cases, some degree of privacy is needed. Having more control over our privacy is an opportunity in&nbsp;web3.</blockquote><blockquote>I’ve been super passionate about projects that are building in this direction and I became involved with the <a href="https://privacyalliance.com/">Universal Privacy Alliance</a> (UPA). That’s how I got Aztec-pilled.</blockquote><p>Alyssa: Would love to hear more about how you got Aztec-pilled, what did connecting with the project and team look&nbsp;like?</p><blockquote>I was already very impressed with Aztec when <a href="https://twitter.com/Blulinski">Bruno</a> and I had the opportunity to work on an ETHDenver event together - it was a mini-summit that I organized with about seven other members of the&nbsp;UPA.</blockquote><blockquote>While we were in Denver, I went to the Aztec meetup and got to chat with some of the other teammates. I felt synergy as it was clear to me that this team cared about doing things the right way, not the easy&nbsp;way.</blockquote><blockquote>I’ve always wanted to serve a community actively working towards putting privacy tools in the hands of developers, so that privacy can be leveraged by everyone else. In my core, I want to make sure that I’m a part of that privacy piece, specifically. This is why joining Aztec — where we’re paving the way to programmable privacy — made sense for&nbsp;me.</blockquote><p>Alyssa: What are you focused on as Developer Advocate and what do you enjoy most about the role? Would be great to hear more about your work right&nbsp;now.</p><blockquote>Yea! The title Developer Advocate is a new one for me. I’ve had many different ones, and in web3 we’re often required to wear many&nbsp;hats.</blockquote><blockquote>I’ve been a Community Lead, Social Media Strategist, and Marketing Manager. I’ve also had plenty of different hybrid roles across the projects I’ve been fortunate to be involved&nbsp;with.</blockquote><blockquote>As a Developer Advocate, I believe my core responsibility is to speak up for developers and make sure their feedback is being heard by the internal Aztec&nbsp;team…</blockquote><blockquote>…and also educate developers about what we’re building. We accomplish this through Discord, community events, 1:1 meetings, diving into GitHub — looking far beneath the surface of what people say to try to piece together: Where are we lacking? How can we improve? And conveying that to our&nbsp;team.</blockquote><p>Alyssa: What does a robust, healthy developer community for a project like ours look like? What does it have and what does it need to&nbsp;have?</p><blockquote>We can learn from a book that Bruno recommended to me when I first started at Aztec, it’s called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Producing-Open-Source-Software-Successful/dp/0596007590">Producing Open Source Software</a>. When you look at how this book outlines everything that matters for an open source software project, including building the community, you can learn a&nbsp;lot.</blockquote><blockquote>First of all, you want to have a place where people can openly and freely contribute in a way that make sense for them — not putting the barrier too high on how people can get involved, or the time commitment. If they want to tinker with Noir or Aztec for 30–45 minutes a week — they’re still welcomed in our community. We leave expectations at the&nbsp;door.</blockquote><blockquote>For any developers engaged with our community, of course we want to provide a supportive environment that includes educational content, tooling, funding, listening to their feedback, and connecting them with fellow devs. Also seeding inspiration/ideas.</blockquote><blockquote>If you have a developer community where people feel like they belong, heard, and accepted, that’s&nbsp;key.</blockquote><p>Alyssa: Wow, it’s really inspiring to hear you talk about&nbsp;it.</p><p>And what about beyond web3? Just general interests and maybe hobbies. Are they pretty tech focused given you work in blockhain?</p><blockquote>I’m a big time reader. I’ve read 39 books this year, and I’m working on a couple more. It’s my little escape — I read a mix of fiction and non-fiction to balance&nbsp;things.</blockquote><blockquote>I’m learning how to garden as well. I live in the south so I’ve been growing okra, peas, tomatoes, and carrots.

<p>As humans age the chances of dying from specific diseases (cancer, coronary, neurological, etc.) increase, where the rate of aging is controlled by genetic pathways and biochemical processes conserved in evolution. Although the hallmarks of aging (including several cellular and molecular processes such as genomic instability, telomere attrition, stem cell exhaustion etc.) have been a major focus of research for many decades, the scientific pathways behind reversing aging are complex and remain elusive. Recently several approaches to cell rejuvenation have been based on partial cellular reprogramming (demonstrating that reprogramming cells to pluripotency can reverse age-related cell phenotypes), although there are still many challenges when trying to reprogram cells including the loss of somatic identity&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Clock.Bio is taking a new approach to cellular reprogramming in order to develop novel, anti-ageing therapeutics and drugs with technology developed at Cambridge University. Their initial goal is to identify the entire set of rejuvenation programs in human cells. They will leverage Bit.Bio’s opti-ox technology to screen for rejuvenation biology and identify repair mechanisms that can reverse the hallmarks of aging. In addition to opti-ox the company leverages tools such as CRISPR/a to modulate genes and combinations of genes, attempting to understand the full biology of reversal of&nbsp;aging.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>Aging is core to many human ailments and by reversing aging we can potentially cure age related conditions. By leaning on Bit.Bio’s opti-ox technology and by tapping into the company’s screening, synbio stack and customer relationships, Clock.Bio will be able to accelerate data collection and conduct relevant anti-ageing screens, giving them a head start in the race for anti aging solutions. Ultimately we believe that by screening for therapeutic leads (existing and novel small molecules, cell and gene therapies, etc.) and creating specific rejuvenation effects on cells, Clock.Bio are well positioned to bring a number of antiaging assets into the&nbsp;clinic.</p><p>We are excited to be backing the entire Clock.bio team on their longevity mission to extend healthspan by 20 years or even more. Read more about the company’s pre-seed round <a href="https://endpts.com/exclusive-bit-bio-founder-launches-new-startup-clock-bio-to-find-drugs-that-increase-healthspan-by-20-years/">here</a> as well as their white paper&nbsp;<a href="https://mark-kotter.medium.com/a-white-paper-for-rejuvenation-therapies-and-blueprint-for-clock-bio-29a52d375059">here</a>.</p>

TL;DR:</p>  Is it possible to build a voting system on Ethereum that’s user-friendly, trustless, fair, weighed, and ballot-secret? Yes,&nbsp;very!  If these properties can’t all be met at the same time, which of them are incompatible, and why? All of them can be&nbsp;met.

<p>As a followup to our <a>February blog post regarding the changes to Brave Rewards</a>, today we are announcing the expected vBAT sunset deadline: October 31, 2023.</p>
<p>If you’re a Brave Rewards user without a custodial account connected, soon you will see vBAT-related notices appear across the Brave Rewards interface that look like this:</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>Users in unsupported regions will still have the option to contribute their vBAT balances to <a href="https://creators.brave.com">Verified Creators</a> of their choice before the deadline.  For a refresher, see <a>our original blog post</a>.</p>

 Update on supported regions 
<p>As promised, we’ve been working with our custodial account provider partners to widen regional support for Brave Rewards before saying goodbye to vBAT. Since the announcement in February, we’ve been able to re-enable support for the following regions:</p>
 
 Croatia 
 Greece 
 Slovakia 
 Slovenia 
 Taiwan&nbsp; 
 
<p>You can find the latest <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/6539887971469">list of supported regions for each custodial account provider here</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, we’re delighted to confirm that users in India with vBAT will soon be able to connect an account from one of our new custodial partners to Brave Rewards, allowing them to redeem their balances for BAT before the deadline. More information to come!</p>
<p>If you have any questions, join us on the <a href="https://community.brave.com">Brave Community forums</a>.</p>

From the tension between centralization vs. decentralization and the role of platforms in power, we also talk about the importance of financial freedom and American innovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/payments-bitcoin-crypto-decentralization-platforms">listen here</a><br>share <a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1694008498580021696">on Twitter</a> | <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0x8480c8">on Farcaster</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7099761028321705984">on LinkedIn</a></p> 💎 Resource: On ‘protodanksharding’, ‘danksharding’, and ‘data availability sampling’ … in 30(ish) minutes <p>Valeria Nikolaenko</p><p>In just 36 minutes, a16z crypto research partner Valeria Nikolaenko describes and explains protodanksharding, danksharding, data availability sampling, rollups (how they work, types)… all of which are important for future upgrades to Ethereum, and for understanding networking/ blockchain scalability. Nikolaenko also highlights some of the best data availability schemes so that others can improve on them, incorporate those ideas into their own projects, or do further research.

So she covers the process of pitching from start to finish — before making a deck, before the pitch, during the pitch, and following up after — including especially how to craft a narrative for your product and team. Why is this a big market/ vision/ opportunity? Why are you the right team to bring it to market? And what is the one question Simpson likes to ask every founder? (Hint: the answer will be the key theme throughout your pitch).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/JL0zM7MkDpI?si=Ttx8bQEazrxunSMd">watch this video</a> &nbsp;<br><a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1692693948433608882">share</a></p> 🌐 Trend: On stateless blockchains <p>Miranda Christ and Joe Bonneau</p><p>As blockchains grow to support more users and more frequent transactions, so too grows the amount of information (the “state”) that validators have to store to verify transactions. For example: in Bitcoin, the state consists of a set of unspent transaction outputs; while in Ethereum, the state consists of an account balance for each account, as well as code and storage for each smart contract. These storage burdens will become unwieldy as blockchains grow (given enough accounts or everyday transactions), making it difficult to become a validator — posing a potential threat to decentralization.&nbsp;</p><p>While it’s tempting to turn to cryptography as a solution — where tools such as Merkle trees and zero-knowledge proofs have previously helped us achieve the implausible — to create “stateless” blockchains, they remain far from practical despite substantial research (e.g., <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1188">Boneh et al</a>, <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/verkle_and_state_expiry_proposal">Buterin</a>, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/599">Srinivasan et al</a>, <a href="https://petertodd.org/2016/delayed-txo-commitments">Todd</a>). In fact, argue the authors of this piece (including a16z crypto research intern &amp; PhD student Christ), stateless blockchains won’t ever be feasible without additional measures to manage the state. But such “impossibility results” shouldn’t be discouraging, because they can direct researchers and builders to pursue more fruitful paths…</p>  <p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/on-the-impossibility-of-stateless-blockchains/">read the post</a> “On the impossibility of stateless blockchains”&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/UGcfTkZbjAw?si=rpL-hXcQcDVhNJHd">watch the video</a> “On limits on revocable proof systems, with implications for blockchains”</p>  <p><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1478">check out the full paper</a> “Limits on revocable proof systems, with applications to stateless blockchains”</p>  <p>share on <a href="https://twitter.com/miranda__christ/status/1694735693463826856">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0xa76b82">on Farcaster</a></p>   🗞️ News &amp; moves: IRS guidance on staking; crypto &amp; banks; more <p>Our ongoing <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/tags/regulatory-updates-roundups-recaps">regulatory updates</a> — as curated by the a16z crypto regulatory team — cover news, guidance, legislation, and frameworks released by agencies, associations, governments, banks, and other entities around the world as they impact the crypto industry in terms of regulation and policy.

<p>Panther community,</p><p>After a very successful Stage 0, today we are debuting Stage 1 of Panther’s Testnet. At this Stage, you’ll test two of Panther’s very anticipated innovations: <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/">third-party compliance integrations and zero-knowledge accounts</a>. </p><p>Stage 1 is public and will have dedicated rewards. It will work only on desktop, not mobile devices. Differently from Stage 0, users will be rewarded for completing the product flow. However, we encourage the community to try to find and submit bugs, as well as to provide feedback. This process ensures that the Testnet returns a bug-free protocol, ultimately improving the protocol and its users’ experience.</p><p>Let’s dive deep into Stage 1:</p><p>(Note: For this Stage, the Panther Miner used in Stage 0 will be shut off for two days. We’ll put out an announcement when it is back to activity).</p> Why Stage 1 matters <p>At this stage, you’ll be testing two features that allow Panther to combine privacy-preserving DeFi access with compliance capabilities:</p> Third-party compliance integrations <p>Panther has built a system that retains neutrality by plugging directly into compliance providers and integrating them into the application’s flow. These systems can capture certain types of user data and issue a zero-knowledge proof attesting that users have been verified without the protocol learning any information from them.</p><p>The Panther DAO has been commissioned to select a compliance vendor that aligns with its interests, a discussion taking place in <a href="http://forum.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther’s forum</a>. For the sake of this Testing exercise, an integration has been built that uses <a href="https://purefi.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">PureFi’s</a> system. PureFi is a multi-vendor compliance provider that has demonstrated interest in partnering with Panther through the DAO discussions.</p><p>Registering using these integrations is a multi-step process that connects a user’s Panther Account with the verification performed by PureFi.</p><p>It consists of:<br><br>a. Creating a Panther Account by connecting your wallet (e.g., Metamask).<br>b. Undergoing a basic verification on PureFi’s site (opened in a pop-up tab).<br>c. Completing the verification process in the Panther dApp by providing the created proof of verification. This process involves downloading files on your browser (around 30MB), which can sometimes take 2-3 minutes (depending on IPFS’ responsivity at the time. In case of trouble, reloading may help.)</p><p>The above activates the user’s Panther account created in step (a) above, and issues account creation rewards to the user.</p> Panther Accounts <p>Within Panther, users are identified through their Panther Account (which has a corresponding zAddress), a concept similar to a bank account in that it englobes all of a user’s transactions within a single reference point. Accounts attest to users’ compliance verification while retaining zero-knowledge properties. In other words, they prove that a user has passed verification (as well as the type of verification passed), but they do not store any private information about users.</p><p>We posted an article further expanding on the rationale behind both of these components, as well as Panther’s compliance focus. <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/">Check it out here!</a></p> Testing and providing feedback <p>As we mentioned, Testnet rewards are automated, and as such, the Testnet itself will reward users for going through the Account creation flow. However, the goal for the Testnet is to debug and enhance the protocol before v1’s launch. </p><p>Our expectation is that users submit bugs and share ideas to enhance end-to-end functioning, interaction and usage of wallets, UI/UX flows, and let us know about any component that doesn’t look or feel as expected. We have created the following <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GUvug0JhhlIUHBR4d2TZVKEUeGzvD_MIR-NrcIpptko/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">spreadsheet</a> containing all the details that users can test, which includes functional and visual components. Note that every testing case is numbered to facilitate the process of providing feedback.</p><p>Spotting and fixing any possible bugs within the Testnet will make the first version of the protocol more sustainable in the middle term while allowing users to receive their earned rewards.</p> How to test <p>Users can visit the Testnet link for Stage 1 found <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">in the info repository on our docs</a> to test the onboarding functionality. This involves creating a Panther Account, undergoing a simple verification process (name and email required, ID NOT required) with PureFi, and activating their Account. We recommend that you test along with reviewing the testing <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GUvug0JhhlIUHBR4d2TZVKEUeGzvD_MIR-NrcIpptko/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">spreadsheet</a> so that you can keep track of everything you need to test.</p><p>To share feedback, testers will be using <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczZNB-tvMILSo8paFjIkeeSub3cqxv7L85rCeR47ad5bs2Gw/viewform?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">a dedicated form</a> as the only accepted procedure. The steps mentioned in the form’s description are needed to make this interaction both efficient and productive.</p><p>Users will be rewarded with 100 $tzZKP (test $zZKP) sent to their wallet as soon as they complete the onboarding process and successfully activate their Panther account. tZKP tokens will be used to interact with the protocol during later stages. Interactions with the protocol also accrue rewards for users in the form of tPRP, which will be used in the second stage. As such, testers will receive 500 tPRP.</p><p>Remember that, to test, you will need to use the Mumbai Polygon Testnet. To use this network, you may also use a faucet (such as <a href="https://faucet.polygon.technology/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">this one</a>) to obtain test MATIC to pay for transactions.</p> Important note (do not skip this!) <p>It’s possible that, during testing, you might encounter a set of RPC errors derived from the Mumbai testnet network itself. These errors are due to infrastructural challenges and outside Panther’s control. <br><br>If at some point (such as while logging in or trying to switch networks) you encounter an error that prevents you from signing transactions (which might even cause your wallet extension to crash needing a browser or PC restart), please: </p>  Visit <a href="https://chainlist.org/chain/80001/to?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">https://chainlist.org/chain/80001/</a> to see a list of Mumbai network working nodes.  Identify a working node. Note that, since this is a Testnet product, privacy is non-essential.  Access your wallet’s Network settings, and edit the Mumbai network to use the working RPC’s server address.  If needed, change the Chain ID to “80001”.  Re-start the product flow.  <p>If the problem persists even after trying a new valid RPC, please use <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczZNB-tvMILSo8paFjIkeeSub3cqxv7L85rCeR47ad5bs2Gw/viewform?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">the official form</a> to fill out a bug report.</p> Thank you for testing!<br> <p>The Panther community has done a great job testing Stage 0. We’re sure this will be a constant as we progress through the different stages of our Testnet leading up to v1. </p><p>We’re looking forward to receiving your feedback. If you have any further questions, please reach out through our official channels below!</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther's zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

Nevertheless, today all drugs in oncology are developed by R&amp;D teams using the same classic textbook definition of tumor acidity which leads to (among other issues) poor tumor targeting and specificity, resulting in a paradoxical situation: despite an increasing number of promising oncology treatments, most cancer therapeutics or chemotherapy agents still have significant toxicity issues and severe side effects, mainly due to off-target effects, ie. where drugs kill healthy&nbsp;cells.</p><p>The <a href="https://cytosolix.com/">Cytosolix</a> team has spearheaded a decade-long research program at the Engelman Lab at Yale that recently resulted in a paradigm shift in our understanding of tumor acidity by discovering that the tumor micro-environment is much more acidic than previously thought, opening up the possibility to create better acid-targeting cancer therapeutics. Based on this discovery, Cytosolix has developed a platform focused on small molecules, called TAP (tumor-activated permeability), and has developed a unique chemical library over the past decade as part of its goal to make order of magnitude better cancer therapeutics.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>In an era when a single blockbuster therapeutic for cancer can be worth billions of dollars in annual revenue, we believe Cytosolix’s TAP platform has the potential to be applied to nrealy all solid tumor targeting small molecules that are already approved and in development, meaning that Cytosolix could receive a part of the upside from a number of existing drugs if TAP is genuinely effective. Moreover, the company’s first oral lead small molecule has been shown to enhance in vivo biodistribution to tumor cells by several orders of magnitude, compared to the original drug, which could translate to a significant efficacy benefit and the company’s own best-in-class drug. Cytosolix will pursue several more candidates during the seed&nbsp;phase.</p><p>We look forward to joining <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/colinjohnfoster/">Colin</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-deacon-cytosolix/">John</a> and the <a href="https://cytosolix.com/">Cytosolix</a> team on their&nbsp;journey.</p>

<p>From the very beginning, Cosmos set out to provide an alternative to the monolithic blockchain architecture proposed by Ethereum. Cosmos SDK was the cornerstone of this vision, as it allowed developers to spin up blockchains effortlessly. Its modularity enabled custom, self-sovereign chains to become a reality. And, instead of being a jack of all trades, those chains were centred around a sole purpose, thus transforming them into appchains. In turn, as the ecosystem grew, appchains had to be interoperable with one another, but this was already a core feature of Cosmos, via IBC. Before Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap, appchains were thought to be a much-needed scaling solution. However, with the advancements of zero knowledge technology, the Cosmos SDK now faces another set of challenges as it navigates the market demand for L2 scaling solutions.</p><p>We were joined by Marko Baricevic, Cosmos SDK product lead, to discuss the development philosophy behind the Cosmos Hub and how appchains evolved over time.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Marko’s background  Cosmos SDK’s history and high-level overview  Cosmos SDK modules and VMs  Ethereum’s &amp; Cosmos’ development philosophies  Cosmos SDK value prop and use cases  Cosmos SDK vs. other frameworks (e.g. Substrate)  Token value accrual and the fragmentation dilemma  Using the Cosmos SDK to build rollups  Cosmos SDK vs. Avalanche’s HyperSDK  Adoption of fraud proofs and validity proofs by the Cosmos SDK  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/mark0baricevic">Marko Baricevic on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/cosmos">Cosmos on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/cosmos_sdk">Cosmos SDK on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/interchain_io">Interchain Foundation on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/binary_builders">Binary Builders on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Meher Roy &amp; Felix Lutsch.

 Verus Internet Protocol (VIP) — Provable, Decentralized Cross-chain Communication  Written by Mike Toutonghi, lead developer of the Verus Protocol.  How it&nbsp;started <p>Bitcoin proved that decentralized, secure, permissionless and provable agreement on a worldwide blockchain network of participants is possible.</p> How it’s&nbsp;going <p>Beyond Bitcoin, most leading blockchain networks today were initially centralized through ICOs or large pre-mines, rather than a fairly launched protocol. In some cases, the ICO or pre-mined share of ownership was further entrenched by switching from proof of work, as a way for anyone to earn, to pure proof of stake, where owning the network currency is required to earn and those with the most earn the most. As part of prioritizing early growth to capture maximum crypto market share, these platforms generally abdicated the hard work of designing or implementing core protocol primitives, such as currencies or identities, beyond one native currency, as originally conceived in&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p><p>Instead, the popular VM model of many blockchains today, which generally provide a shared “computer” or VM on top of a decentralized blockchain, leaves building critical primitives as someone else’s problem, usually companies and app designers, basically writing centralized apps. Instead of a secure set of underlying rules for currencies, we get best practices and the evolutionary legacy of thousands of “dApps”, which ironically, are mostly just partial or full re-implementations of the secure primitives missing in the consensus-based L1 protocols themselves.</p><p>As a result of the focus on pumping and market capture vs. evolving what we could learn from Bitcoin with sustainable, decentralized, more secure primitives and better protocol design, billions of dollars of value has been lost or transferred from naive early users who bought into the pumped crypto hype to hackers, scammers, VCs, centralized exits, and MEV-exploiters who all leveraged the mass of weaknesses they either failed to protect against or in some cases created and obscured themselves on systems that don’t define or enforce even the most common core primitives, currencies or identities. A great deal of loss has been due to obviously poor cross-chain “bridge” design, with the most common problem being bugs in complex smart contract workflow, followed by stolen or compromised private keys of contract owners / controllers, and in some cases, outright theft by contract controllers.</p><p>The lack of agreement on basic primitives and how to represent them in a globally resolvable way has held back general, robust solutions to the fundamental problem of interoperability between blockchains and other financial networks today. To complicate our collective challenges, adding full primitive support in the protocols is hard work, especially in an industry where just a year of development is considered a massive investment that must be rewarded by timely exit liquidity. Consequently, an abundance of shortcuts and heavily marketed yet hastily built solutions still dominate the popular narrative, as hacks, rugpulls, and losses continue to pile&nbsp;up.</p> The solution <p>Verus was founded by technology veterans and others who believe humanity can do better than being exploited by the technology these same veterans had been building for corporations over decades. The Verus PBaaS protocol was designed, built, and tested over more than 5 years by a self-selected and often volunteer group of technology, finance, legal, operations, or just life veterans and newbies alike. Early Verusians shared a common vision and made it reality, achieving a fairly launched, community driven project without VCs or ICO participants who may want to exit and a truly decentralized unlimited scale network that all humanity can use and build upon without paying rent to&nbsp;anyone.</p><p>It has taken exactly as long as it has to realize the vision laid out 5 years ago, which is more clearly relevant today than ever. Along the way, that vision has grown and evolved as new community members contributed their own vision to help us improve, making the Verus PBaaS protocol, of which VIP is a small part, a major milestone for the crypto industry and a move back to the original intent of decentralized networks that was pioneered, if not fully realized by Satoshi Nakamoto in Bitcoin. Verus has taken Nakamoto consensus to the next level with consensus driven functional protocols for network primitives that are needed in any network hoping to securely enable financial applications.</p><p>To ensure maximum decentralization, the Verus Internet Protocol (VIP) takes a maximally decentralized, validator driven approach to its multi-network bridging by incorporating and accounting for currencies, identities, namespaces, and the concept of connected networks themselves in the L0 and L1 consensus protocols. The Verus Internet Protocol provides just enough structure to interoperate with any system that can control funds based on logic and exposes a provable representation of currencies and/or identities.</p><p>By grounding interoperability in a cryptographically provable, hierarchical namespace of self-sovereign, worldwide resolvable identities, VIP enables the first high-throughput, unlimited scale, decentralized, multi-protocol, non-custodial, auditable and transparent, currency and identity aware cross-blockchain communications protocol.</p> A cross-chain protocol with same chain properties <p>VIP can be seen as a cross-chain protocol that operates on proof of proof of consensus (PoPoC). VIP has the following properties:</p>  Transactions that include cross-chain operations, cross-system currency transfers, or new currency and identity definitions, are standardized in the protocol, as are the semantics of their cross-chain use, fee models, cross-system, name-centric provable routing, and MEV-resistant bundling and rollup properties. These characteristics can be and have been implemented on UTXO, VM-based, and transparently centralized networks.  VIP supports direct or indirect system&lt;-&gt;system communication, including cross-system export and import of currency and identity definitions, as well as revocation, recovery, and controlling keys. All cross-chain or DeFi functions in the protocol are accessible to full or lite node clients and applications by simply creating standard transaction inputs and outputs that specify the operations. Available APIs on every node or FOSS API server simplify the creation of transactions with cross-chain outputs in response to command requests or JSON RPC&nbsp;calls.  Transactions with Identity, DeFi, or cross-chain operations, including all inputs and outputs, even exports and imports of all currencies, are checked for validity by miners and stakers with network consensus, just as single currency inputs and outputs are in today’s single currency blockchain networks.  Cross-chain protocols operate in the same way as on-chain DeFi protocols and are processed on chain by miners and stakers with a bundle-&gt;export-&gt;import workflow, enabling high-throughput DeFi and cross-chain operations.  In PBaaS, exports, imports, and DeFi operations are all solved simultaneously and processed with at per-block or larger granularity in an MEV-resistant manner as part of the core protocol, recognizing and enabling the need for beneficial arbitrage, while eliminating toxic MEV such as front-running and sandwiching once and for&nbsp;all.  All cross-chain operations are proven based on one of the following proof models, which are configurable on a per system/chain basis:    Decentralized consensus-achieved, witness enhanced, cross-chain cryptographic proofs. (auto-notarization)  Decentralized consensus-achieved, witness-dependent, cross-chain cryptographic proofs. (notary dependent notarization)  Semi-centralized or centrally controlled gateway&nbsp;proofs  <p>Full auto-notarization is only available between Verus and PBaaS chains, and operates faster with but is not dependent on notary witnesses. When auto-notarization is applied to other gateway connections, the protocol will fall back to the closest it can come between auto-notarization and notary dependent, which may evolve towards less dependence on the notaries in future versions. Whether you auto-notarize or depend on notary witness confirmation, all forms of notarization operate similarly. We’ll start with the basic workflow, then highlight differences:</p>  “Earned” and “Accepted” notarizations — VIP broadly defines two types of cross-system notarizations, earned and accepted.    Generally, one side of a connection will create “earned” notarizations, which on PBaaS chains or for the Ethereum bridge, are created by miners and stakers adding a notarization output to the coinbase. Earned notarizations, which can only be created by Verus or PBaaS chain miners and stakers, include a way to agree or disagree with specific past notarizations, and are subject to further “confirmation” rules, which may vary depending on if the rules are “auto”, centralized, or “notary confirm”.  Once a new, earned notarization is confirmed, the proof of confirmation is sent to the “notary” system, which is typically a launch chain, and in the case of the ETH bridge, is Ethereum, along with any notary signatures necessary to prove confirmation, which are typically present. The new, confirmed, earned notarization is entered on the notary chain as an “accepted” notarization, and is entered as “agreeing” with a prior accepted notarization along with proof of the agreement. If the prior accepted notarization it agrees with is not yet confirmed, then it may be considered newly confirmed.  <p>2. Once an earned notarization has been agreed to by a new earned notarization, alternating between PoW and PoS blocks to help further decentralized requirements for agreement, and by following all notarization rules, notary witnesses may sign signifying they agree with the notarization as well. Although they can disagree with a signature, no signature is also a valid way to disagree.</p><p>3. After validators and notary witnesses have agreed, or in the case of auto-notarization, a longer validation period with more agreement has passed, the prior notarization agreed with by a new notarization that has passed all necessary agreement, is confirmed. Once that happens, the blockchain is considered final up to the point of that confirmation and will resist reorganizations to any point&nbsp;behind.</p><p>The primary difference between notary confirm notarization and auto-notarization is the amount and type of evidence required to enter a potentially confirmed notarization. Most notably, “notary confirm” always requires a quorum of signatures from the specified notaries, whereas auto-notarization requires more multi-stage evidence in the face of randomized proof selection, potential fraud proofs and disagreements. Fully centralized gateways still operate on cryptographic proofs, but they only need notaries to agree on the cryptographic roots in order to consider them true and do not need cryptographic proof to establish the notarization proof&nbsp;root.</p><p>Once a proof root has been established by notarization, this root is used to cryptographically prove bundles of transactions exported from one chain or system and imported to another. Even Ethereum transactions are proven in both directions using the same workflow, although Ethereum transactions are validated using <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/">PATRICIA Trie</a> proofs, while PBaaS chains use the Verus <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp">Merkle Mountain Range (MMR)</a> method, both being cryptographically sound. Cross-chain bundles of transactions follow the same bundling protocol when sourced from Verus or PBaaS chains as is followed in DeFi to prevent&nbsp;MEV.</p><p>Transactions are always delivered to the destination network with bundles in the order they were created on the source network and according to the enforceable rules of the source network. Since a relayer may add arbitrage transactions when the destination is a PBaaS chain, but may not affect the provable source contents of a relayed bundle from one network to another, no restriction is placed on who relays a valid bundle of transactions. Since validators who relay and mine or stake transaction bundles into a block may earn a validation fee from the import transaction itself, validators or notaries will generally shuttle transaction bundles between chains and networks out of self interest, while having no ability whatsoever to censor or modify protocol level&nbsp;bundles.</p> What witness / notaries do NOT&nbsp;do <p>Witnesses / notaries have no control over what transactions are or are not included or the order in which they arrive from one system to another, as all of that is dictated by the protocol. By default, notaries cannot create notarizations and can only witness the validity of notarizations already created and agreed to by both proof of work and proof of stake validators.</p><p>Witness notaries’ primary role is to agree or disagree with the network validators’ earned notarizations, which are earned on one blockchain and accepted on another chain or system. As long as validators enter valid notarizations as part of the merge mining or staking process, confirm other notarizations entered by past validators, and a majority of notaries sign and witness their recognition of those events, a proof root that can be used by anyone to prove committed bundles of cross-chain transactions is established on both systems for the other. As the protocol ensures via cryptographic proof validation that the cross-chain bundles are the exact bundles in the order they were packaged on the source system, importing cross-chain transaction bundles is a permissionless operation that anyone, usually a validator, can perform, which relies on the proof established in relation to a confirmed, notarized proof&nbsp;root.</p> Do auto-notarization and notary-confirm notarization options have different security considerations? <p>Yes. Proper planning and selection of options and witness ID structure during the launch of a blockchain network or gateway can ensure that security levels meet network demands. There are security tradeoffs between auto-notarization and notary-confirm options, which basically are a tradeoff between a permissionless model where proof root determination is enhanced, but not dependent upon multisig agreement of notary witnesses, auto-notarization vs. a model where establishing any cross-network cryptographic proof root requires the honest participation of a majority of the notary witnesses, which can be represented by revocable and recoverable IDs, allowing for further decentralization, even while requiring participation of a&nbsp;quorum.</p><p>Determining which option to choose, how many and what notaries to choose, what other safeguards can further enhance security, and then understanding the resulting security profile from each set of choices, is important when launching a blockchain or gateway. The following outlines the current high-level security considerations when configuring a new chain or&nbsp;gateway.</p><p>Currently, Verus VIP supports 2 proof models for interchain communication, the Verus PBaaS Merkle Mountain Range proofs, which also assume the Verus Proof of Power protocol, and Ethereum PATRICIA Trie proofs that enable interfacing with VIP between any PBaaS chain, and any Ethereum VM + PATRICIA Trie compatible network.</p><p>Since Verus PBaaS is the only interface to fully support notarization finalization using full auto-notarization, it is important to understand the differences between PBaaS and Ethereum proof protocols. At present, there is no objective proof protocol implementation for Ethereum that is known and implemented, which can operate without dependence on some set of notary witnesses. At this time, auto-notarization, when applied to Ethereum, is more similar to notary-confirm, with additional revocation safeguards that could address more edge-case threat&nbsp;models.</p><p>As new proof algorithms evolve for Ethereum, enabling trustworthy cross-chain proof models in both directions that are both timely and do not need to be backed by witness signatures, it will be possible to update the protocols to remove dependence on witnesses over time. To ensure maximum decentralization on the Ethereum bridge, the network itself can permissionlessly propose contract upgrades, and if affirmatively voted on by Verus validators, an upgrade and new contracts can eventually change the cross-chain proof conditions.</p><p>Auto-notarization of one PBaaS chain on another (PBAAS_AN) differs from and Ethereum interface or notary-confirm (NC) in that, if there are enough validated blocks, both mined and staked, as well as validator agreed notarizations, PBAAS_AN allows validators to finalize a notarization and submit it to the alternate chain. If there are disagreements about the correct notarization, the process becomes an on-chain proof competition, requiring each party to represent a growing, actual chain with both proof of work and proof of stake with an eventual winner. NC still has the miners and stakers create and earn from earned notarizations, but it also must have agreement from specified notaries to finalize any notarization and cannot finalize cross-chain proof roots without that agreement.</p> Improvement over common cross-chain protocols <p>Since Verus VIP does not ever have any identity, multisig or otherwise, hold custody over any funds when crossing from one decentralized network to another, even in the context of the Verus Ethereum contracts, threats caused by malicious notaries or stolen keys to drain funds on decentralized bridges or currencies are simply not viable against the Verus VIP protocol.</p><p>Cross-chain notarizations must first be entered by an earning validator, either PoW or PoS, and must also be agreed to by another validator, alternating between work and stake in eligibility. Only after that happens can notary witnesses apply their signature and agree to make that a confirmed notarization candidate. Still, what happens if a majority of notaries are malicious and colluding, or if some entity was able to somehow steal a majority of the notary private&nbsp;keys?</p><p>If the majority of notary witnesses are honest and operate their witnessing nodes according to the protocol, the security of such a model should be sufficient for any level of cross-chain transaction proof. If, however, a majority of the notaries were colluding and malicious or if their keys were stolen, Verus VIP still provides ways to ensure that the protocol responds to such a situation without risk of loss. Although there are ways to mitigate such a form of attack, even if no mitigation were available, such malicious or fraudulent notary witnesses would need the following in order to attack a PBaaS cross-chain connection:</p>  Colluding, malicious notaries  Fake validators with more combined hash + stake power than the publicly validated chain making earned notarizations  Developers helping them by creating an alternate protocol for the shadow&nbsp;chain  <p>While you may recognize these requirements as very close to the requirements of attacking any blockchain, the Verus VIP protocol provides a way to even defend against such an unlikely scenario. VIP provides for revocation of all VerusIDs, including notary IDs, even those that are used for Ethereum protocol bridges. Furthermore, each PBaaS chain, including Verus, has a network agreed multisig chain oracle that can separately pause cross-chain notarizations or transactions temporarily, which also can be overridden by network validators.</p><p>To enable yet another layer of safeguards, the Verus VIP protocol does not confirm any notarization that has first been agreed to by validators, then agreed to and signed by all notaries on either the earned or the accepted chain, until a second such notarization confirms the first. This ensures that every notarization on any chain is first made public, given a period of time before confirmation, and finally, if nothing stops it, confirmed.</p><p>Meanwhile, with basic monitoring by witnesses to see if their own identities have signed for anything they do not actually agree with, meaning their keys were stolen, notaries can auto-revoke their own identities and prevent stolen key attacks from being anything more than an inconvenience. Additional monitoring by chain oracle controllers to look for clear discrepancies between soon to be confirmed notarizations and chains that they monitor can also use the oracle notification network to pause cross-chain transactions, providing yet another line of defense for each chain on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>While there are numerous capabilities and safeguards built into the Verus VIP protocol beyond those described in this document, by separating the proof root notarization process and using cryptographic proof as the foundation of a provable, high throughput, cross-chain export/import protocol, VIP enables the most secure, scalable, decentralized and multi-modal cross-chain protocol ever designed for blockchains and the Internet of&nbsp;Value.</p> Try the Verus Protocol Yourself! ✅ <p>Look up <a href="http://docs.verus.io">docs.verus.io</a> to use many API commands (e.g. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/launch-currency.html">launching currencies, tokens &amp; liquidity pools</a>).</p><p>Or look up the <a href="https://wiki.verus.io/#!faq-cli/clifaq-02_verus_commands.md">complete command list&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Join the community.

<p>The chain-agnostic Nym mixnet solves the transport layer privacy problem for any Layer 1 chain or Layer 2 dApp, wallet or&nbsp;app</p><p>Every single internet application and service whether Web 2.0 or Web3 suffers from the same common issue: network traffic is exposed. This is an underlying problem in the design of the internet itself. But Nym, with its mission of complete privacy online for everyone, everywhere, solves this ‘transport layer privacy problem’ by obscuring network traffic for any web service, chain, dApp, wallet or app. Read on to learn why Nym is the ‘Layer 0’ privacy stack for the whole internet:</p> What is Layer 0 — and where does the Nym mixnet fit&nbsp;in? <p>The internet is split into different layers with different functions, and the underlying network infrastructure layer is Layer&nbsp;0.</p><p>Languages: <a href="https://note.com/koko_crypto/n/nbe0921ed80d9">日本</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymturkish/nym-i%CC%87nternetin-tamam%C4%B1-i%C3%A7in-katman-0-gizlilik-altyap%C4%B1s%C4%B1-24605d2d72e1">Türkçe</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nym_china/nym-%E6%95%B4%E4%B8%AA%E4%BA%92%E8%81%94%E7%BD%91%E7%9A%840%E5%B1%82%E9%9A%90%E7%A7%81%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80%E8%AE%BE%E6%96%BD-4bdbfbb29ba3">中文</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nym_ru/nym-%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%84%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D1%83%D0%BA%D1%82%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B0-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8-%D0%BD%D1%83%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE-%D1%83%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D1%8F-%D0%B4%D0%BB%D1%8F-%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%BE-%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0-24de3615d4ba">Русский</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymfrance/nym-infrastructure-de-confidentialit%C3%A9-de-couche-0-pour-lensemble-d-internet-70e3d1997626">Française</a></p><p>The Nym Mixnet is also Layer 0. It addresses the network layer, or transport layer of the internet: think of this as the roads and highways of the&nbsp;web.</p><p>Just like in the physical world, these roads and highways are all completely visible.</p><p>Now imagine looking at all these roads and highways from above. While it might be difficult to identify drivers, concealed in their vehicles, there are plenty of other identifiers that could help an observer paint a revealing profile of that motorist.</p><p>Even if this observer couldn’t see inside the car, they can see how big the car is, the colour of the vehicle, where it’s going, time of departure, and time of arrival. Together, this information can reveal a lot about that drivers’ relationships, state of mind, habits, career, and&nbsp;life.</p><p>These roads and highways are essentially the core communication protocols of the internet, like TCP and&nbsp;UDP.</p><p>As data packets speed along these highways, the behaviour of this data can be monitored and information built around how they travel along it, just like the example of a driver on a real road. This is called metadata, in other words, data about the&nbsp;data.</p><p>The Layer 0 Nym mixnet solves this by obfuscating the metadata. The Nym mixnet encrypts internet traffic into identically sized packets, mixed with ‘dummy’ packets of data that contain nothing whatsoever. These are all then sent through three layers or ‘hops’ into mix ‘nodes’ that are distributed around the world, at randomised times and intervals, before they are reassembled and decrypted on the receiving side. This makes network traffic observation near-impossible.</p><p>To return to the highways analogy: imagine if all cars travelling on a packed highway looked exactly the same. They travel through tunnels at random intervals, and it’s impossible to see when they departed or where they were going or when and where they ended their destination. Unique identifiers, like their colour or type of car, are stripped away. Suddenly, it would be a lot more difficult to make any inferences or guesses about the habits of that driver or their relationship to&nbsp;others.</p><p>By obfuscating metadata at the network layer — Layer 0 — this is what the Nym mixnet achieves.</p> What is Layer 1 and why does it need L-0 privacy protection? <p>Web3 promised to jettison the centralisation that plagued Web 2.0, where power is concentrated into the hands of governments and corporate monopolies. Transparency is a core part of this proposition, but transparency runs both ways and currently, traffic is visible and vulnerable to analysis.</p><p>See also: <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-is-not-a-blockchain-but-it-is-powered-by-one-4bb16ef16587">Nym mixnet is not a blockchain — but it is powered by&nbsp;one</a></p><p>The Web3 world of blockchains, decentralisation and distributed apps is split into various&nbsp;layers.</p><p>To use another metaphor, think of a building. Before anything can be built on top of this structure, it needs foundations at the very&nbsp;bottom.</p><p>Right at the bottom of this stack is Layer 0, the foundational, network layer for&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Blockchains are Layer 1. These distributed ledgers are the systems on which other apps and services or blockchains are built. Right now, these are vulnerable to traffic analysis and attacks at the network layer, Layer&nbsp;0.</p><p>In order for a blockchain to function, they need peer to peer transactions as well as broadcasts to signal that these transactions are taking place. They also need coordination between validators, which confirm (or validate) transactions.</p><p>Even if the blockchain itself is designed with security in mind, currently, traffic between peer to peer transactions and coordination between validators is&nbsp;exposed.</p><p>The Layer 0 Nym mixnet provides cover. Again, it protects metadata information from leaking by obscuring network&nbsp;traffic.</p><p>Without Layer 0 privacy infrastructure, blockchain traffic can be analysed, opening the infrastructure to attack, whether that is from DDoS attacks, targeted censorship, or exposing the behaviour of validators or end-user transactions.</p><p>Nym is chain-agnostic, so Nym can be integrated with any blockchain to obfuscate the traffic on it. In short: the Nym mixnet provides network-level, Layer 0 privacy for any Layer 1 blockchain.</p> What is Layer 2, and why does it need L-0 privacy protection? <p>Layer 2 means the tokens, other blockchains, and dApps that run via smart contracts hosted on the Layer 1 blockchain.</p><p>No changes are needed to the Layer 1 blockchain to build these applications or services, they simply nestle on top of the layer beneath&nbsp;them.</p><p>For example: Bitcoin is a Layer 1 blockchain, but the Lightning Network payment protocol layered on top of Bitcoin is Layer&nbsp;2.</p><p>See also: <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/a-breakdown-of-the-smart-contracts-that-run-the-nym-token-economics-3a61b4139f95">A breakdown of the smart contracts that run the Nym token economics</a></p><p>Integrating Nym obscures traffic to and from Layer 2 applications or tokens or services.</p><p>Additionally, developers can privacy-enhance existing apps or build new privacy-enhanced apps with the Nym Layer 0&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>This means that when users run an application, no matter where it lies or what blockchain it’s hosted on, the traffic will be run through the Nym mixnet, offering Layer 0 protections to both the Layer 1 blockchain and the Layer 2 application, protecting metadata across the whole&nbsp;stack.</p> A holistic approach to&nbsp;privacy <p>The internet is fundamentally broken and does not preserve privacy. By design, traffic data is visible, and powerful interests like governments and corporations take advantage of this fact.

  Today we're excited to announce that Leo, the AI assistant built natively in the Brave browser, is now available for testing and feedback in the Nightly desktop channel (starting with version 1.59).

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Today we’re excited to announce that Leo, the AI assistant built natively in the Brave browser, is now available for testing and feedback in the Nightly desktop channel (starting with version 1.59).</p>
<p>Building on the success of the <a>Brave Search AI Summarizer</a>, we’ve made Leo available as a companion in the browser sidebar. Leo allows users to interact with the web pages they’re visiting—for example, by asking for video transcripts or interactive article summaries—without leaving the page itself. Leo can also suggest follow-up questions, augment original content, and even help with reading comprehension. Leo can answer questions just like other AI-powered chatbots, but directly within the experience of a web page.</p>

 What is Brave Leo? 
<p>Brave Leo is a chat assistant hosted by Brave without the use of third-party AI services, available to Brave users on the desktop Nightly channel. The model behind Leo is Llama 2, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/07/llama-2/">a source-available large language model released by Meta</a> with a special focus on safety. We’ve made sure that user inputs are always submitted anonymously through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy">reverse-proxy</a> to our inference infrastructure. In this way, Brave can offer an AI experience with unparalleled privacy.</p>
<p>We’ve specifically tuned the model prompt to adhere to Brave’s core values. However, as with any other LLM, the outputs of the model should be treated with care for potential inaccuracies or errors.</p>

 How to try Leo and share feedback 
<p>Leo is available today for all users of the Brave browser desktop <a>Nightly channel</a>. Nightly desktop users can access Leo via the  button in Brave Sidebar.</p>
<p>Are you a Brave Nightly user? <a href="https://community.brave.com/c/new-feature-feedback/141">Please tell us what you think of Leo</a>!</p>

 A note on anonymity 
<p>Leo is free to use for any desktop Nightly user, and no user login or account is required. Chats in Leo cannot be used for training purposes, and no one can review those conversations, as they’re not persisted on Brave’s servers—conversations are discarded immediately after the reply is generated. For this reason, there’s no way to review past conversations or delete that data—it isn’t stored in the first place.</p>

 What data does the Brave browser send? 
<p>If you use Leo, the browser shares with the server your latest query, your ongoing conversation history and, when the use case calls for it, only the necessary context from the page you’re actively viewing (e.g. the article’s text, or the YouTube video transcript).</p>

 How can I get better results out of Leo? 
<p>As with any AI, the more specific you are with your prompts and context, the better the results Leo can provide. Remember to give Leo clear, detailed instructions and, if you don’t get exactly the answer you’re looking for, to try wording your query/prompt a different way.</p>

 Does Leo have access to live information? 
<p>For now, Leo does not have access to live information. However, in future releases we do plan to offer a version of Leo with some level of access to current information. This will be powered by our own independent <a>Brave Search</a>.</p>

 What’s next for Brave Leo? 
<p>In addition to incorporating live information, we’ll be making improvements to Leo’s accuracy and user experience. We hope to release Leo to all Brave browser users in the coming months.</p>

							<p>Earlier this year, we <a href="https://zfnd.org/launching-the-zcash-minor-grants-program/">launched the Zcash Minor Grants program</a>. Ten minor grant applications were <a href="https://zfnd.org/minor-grants-applications-april-2023/">submitted to a poll of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel</a> (ZCAP), and <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcash-minor-grants-april-2023/">four grants were approved</a>.</p><p>Feedback from the community was overwhelmingly positive. Therefore, we are today opening applications for a second round of the Minor Grants program. </p><p>The maximum grant size is $25,000, and the total budget for this round is $75,000. We will again be engaging the Zcash community, and taking advantage of the “wisdom of the crowd” by polling ZCAP regarding which grants should be funded.</p><p>If you are interested in submitting a Minor Grant application, please read this blog post carefully. </p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 The Application Process 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>Applications must be submitted via the <a href="https://zcashgrants.org/submit">ZF grants platform</a>, and applicants must agree to sign ZF’s <a href="https://zfnd.org/terms-and-conditions/">grant agreement</a>, and undergo <a href="https://zfnd.org/aml-kyc-requirements/">the ZF KYC process</a> if their application is successful. </p><p>The deadline to submit a grant application is 20:00 UTC on Monday 18th September. </p><p>ZF will review all applications, and will reject any grant applications that are deemed unsuitable (see the FAQs section below for examples of why ZF may judge a grant application to be unsuitable under this program). Suitable applications will then be submitted to a poll of ZCAP to determine which should be funded. Applicants who are members of ZCAP will not be eligible to participate in this poll.&nbsp;</p><p>Applicants should feel free to submit a grant application in their native language. ZF will translate it to English (likely using an online tool, such as Google Translate) and make both the original and translated application available to ZCAP.&nbsp;</p><p>We aim to publish the list of suitable grant applications, and open the ZCAP poll by 2nd October. The ZCAP poll will remain open for approximately two weeks, and we plan to announce the results on 16th October. We will keep applicants and the community apprised of any changes or delays to this timeline via the Zcash Community Forum.&nbsp;</p><p>To be eligible for funding, a grant application must receive greater than 50% approval from the participants in the ZCAP poll. Eligible grants will then be funded in order of priority determined by the level of ZCAP’s approval, and as the total budget permits. There will be no partial funding of grants.&nbsp;</p><p>Grant payments will be made in the form of shielded ZEC. Successful applicants will be required to provide a z-address or u-address. Approved grantees will also be required to submit <a href="https://zfnd.org/kyc-policy-abbreviated/">KYC documents</a> before receiving payment.&nbsp;</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Example of how the ZCAP poll will work 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>In the example below, ten suitable grant applications for varying amounts were voted on in a ZCAP poll that had a turnout of 134 with a $75,000 USD total budget. </p>

							<p>In this example, the approval threshold to be eligible for funding would be 68 votes.&nbsp;</p><p>The Zeta and Kappa grants would not be funded because there would be insufficient funding remaining in the budget (after funding grants with higher approval ratings) to fund those grants.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the Theta grant would be funded because, while it achieved a lower approval rating than Zeta, it is small enough that it could be funded out of the remaining budget.&nbsp;</p><p>The Sigma and Omega grants would not be eligible for funding because they failed to achieve a greater-than-50% approval rating in the ZCAP poll.&nbsp;</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Frequently Asked Questions 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>What is the Zcash Foundation’s mission?</p><p>Our mission at the Zcash Foundation is to build financial privacy infrastructure for the public good, by helping sustain and improve open financial networks that allow anyone and everyone to protect their own privacy, on their own terms. While our primary focus is the Zcash protocol and blockchain, we also support broader applications of zero knowledge proofs, as well as other approaches to financial privacy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do grant applications have to be Zcash-related?&nbsp;</p><p>No. Any project that aligns with the Zcash Foundation’s mission is suitable for the Minor Grants program. We would especially like to attract grant applications that are not directly Zcash-related but explore broader applications of zero knowledge proofs or other approaches to financial privacy, in line with our charitable purpose.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How does the Minor Grants program relate to Zcash Community Grants?</p><p>The Minor Grants program is entirely separate from the Zcash Community Grants program (ZCG). ZCG is intended to fund Major Grants for teams that are carrying out large-scale, long-term projects. By contrast, the Minor Grants program is intended to provide a source of funding for smaller, more short-term grants for both teams and individuals. We also hope that the Minor Grants program can provide an opportunity for teams to demonstrate their ability to deliver on a Minor Grant before applying for a Major Grant.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Under what circumstances would ZF reject a grant application as unsuitable?</p><p>Here are some examples of why ZF may reject a grant application:</p>  The grant’s purpose is not congruent with the Foundation’s mission.  The grant does not, in our estimation, represent value for money.  We have reason to believe that the applicant is not capable of delivering on the grant.  The purpose of the grant would violate U.S. law or contravene the Zcash Foundation’s obligations under <a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations">U.S. IRS 501(c)(3)</a>.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Can applicants remain pseudonymous?</p><p>Applicants can keep their identity private but they must undergo <a href="https://zfnd.org/aml-kyc-requirements/">the ZF KYC process</a> if their application is successful, which includes disclosing and verifying their identity to ZF.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Where is the funding for this program coming from?</p><p>This program is being funded by the Zcash Foundation, from its slice of <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014">the Dev Fund.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My application to the ZCG program was rejected. Can I re-apply to the Minor Grants program?</p><p>Yes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Can current and former recipients of ZCG grants apply for a Minor Grant?</p><p>Yes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Can I submit multiple Minor Grant applications?</p><p>You may only submit one Minor Grant application at a time (i.e. per round).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Can I specify multiple milestones as part of my grant?</p><p>No. There is no “milestone” option for Minor Grants. Grant payouts will either be paid upon award of the grant (i.e. up-front) or upon completion of the grant. Note that members of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel may look less favorably on applications that request up-front funding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I have a question that’s not answered here.</p><p>You can post questions to <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/opening-applications-for-the-second-round-of-zf-minor-grants/45463">this topic on the Zcash Community Forum</a>. Alternatively, you can email minorgrants@zfnd.org</p>

<p>Iraq recently blocked (and then un-blocked) Telegram in the country. Here’s how citizens can connect to Telegram via the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>This is a Nym Community post by privacy researcher Saliveja.</p><p>Languages: <a href="https://medium.com/@nymfrance/comment-utiliser-telegram-en-irak-avec-nymconnect-5846d2ae0989">Française</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@nym_ru/%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BA-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C%D1%81%D1%8F-telegram-%D0%B2-%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B5-%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B7-nymconnect-344f304ade3c">Русский</a></p><p>Earlier this month, the telecoms ministry of Iraq <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/iraq-blocks-telegram-app-cites-personal-data-violations-2023-08-06/">blocked Telegram</a>, claiming that it violated the integrity of Iraqi citizens’ data by allowing private information to remain on the platform without their&nbsp;consent.</p><p>This week the service <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/iraq-unblock-telegram-app-platform-responded-security-requirements-statement-2023-08-12/">was restored</a> following conversations with Telegram, which complied with the ministry’s requests.</p><p>The situation in Iraq demonstrated just how quickly the basic web services people rely on can be switched off and on, stifling communication. With NymConnect, citizens can always access Telegram via the Nym mixnet no matter the state of the political situation. Here’s&nbsp;how:</p> Privacy-enhanced Telegram <p>This was not the first time Iraq has banned applications or cut the internet. During the 2019 protests, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/03/internet-down-across-iraq-third-day-protests">Iraq banned applications such as Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp, while internet access was also shut down to curtail organisation and prevent reporting</a>. The Iraqi government has advanced its technological capabilities over the years, and this has been used to <a href="https://netblocks.org/reports/study-shows-extent-of-iraq-internet-shutdown-and-social-media-restrictions-during-protests-zPyXjzAE">suppress&nbsp;dissent</a>.</p><p>The purpose of the following manual is not to promote Telegram but so citizens can use it with the Nym mixnet if they wish to, should a situation like this occur&nbsp;again.</p><p>NymConnect is a one-click interface enabling you to privacy-enhance everyday applications by running them through the Nym mixnet. This privacy-enhances Telegram at the network level and allows users to access the application from locations like&nbsp;Iraq.</p><p>See also: <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/element-matrix-over-the-nym-mixnet-private-decentralised-and-secure-messaging-ac7f47bc47af">Element (Matrix) over the Nym mixnet: private, decentralised and secure messaging</a></p> Configure Telegram with NymConnect on&nbsp;desktop:   Download and install <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">NymConnect</a>. For more releases, check out <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tags">Github</a>. NymConnect is available for Linux, Windows, and MacOS. On Linux make sure NymConnect is executable. To do this, open a terminal in the same directory and&nbsp;run:   chmod +x ./&lt;YOUR-NYM-CONNECT-VERSION&gt;.AppImage    Start NymConnect  <p>Telegram is added to NymConnect by&nbsp;default.</p>  Click connect — the host and port will now be displayed.  Open Telegram’s proxy settings.  <p>Linux: Telegram -&gt; Settings -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Connection type -&gt; Use custom&nbsp;proxy</p><p>MacOS: Telegram -&gt; Settings -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Data &amp; Storage -&gt; Connection Type -&gt; Use custom&nbsp;Proxy</p><p>Windows: Telegram -&gt; Settings -&gt; Data and Storage -&gt; Use&nbsp;proxy</p>  Add a proxy with the Add proxy&nbsp;button.  Select SOCKS5 and make sure the port details are the same as those generated by NymConnect. Alternatively, follow this link: <a href="https://t.me/socks?server=127.0.0.1&amp;port=1080">https://t.me/socks?server=127.0.0.1&amp;port=1080</a>  Save the proxy settings in Telegram.  <p>Telegram is now running through the Nym mixnet and is privacy-enhanced!</p><p>This allows you to connect from regions which have blocked Telegram.</p><p>Note: if you remain idle on Telegram for a while you might lose connectivity and your messages might not get through via the SOCKS5 proxy. If that happens, reconnect NymConnect and reset the proxy&nbsp;again.</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/how-to-use-telegram-in-iraq-with-nymconnect-106a3b8dd050">How to use Telegram in Iraq with NymConnect</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In the ever-changing world of digital assets, there’s a simple truth: NFTs without a purpose are basically worthless. As NFTs continue to make waves and redefine ownership, one key factor sets apart the impactful from the forgettable – utility. Just like a strong foundation supports a tall building, utility gives NFTs a solid footing, turning them from a short-lived hype into powerful tools for creativity, connection, and progress.</p>



<p>In this article we will take a look at the different types of utility an NFT can have and how this contributes to the value of an NFT.</p>



 Key takeaways 



 
 NFTs derive their value from the utility they provide, rather than having an inherent value 



 Utility in NFTs can come in many forms, such as digital art and collectibles, memberships and access, loyalty rewards, asset ownership, and more 



 The value of an NFT is affected by (changes) in the value of the underlying utility. As the utility evolves, the value of the NFT may fluctuate, emphasising the importance of assessing long-term viability and potential growth 



 The ecosystem in which an NFT resides is a key contributor to its success or failure 
 



 Understanding NFTs and their characteristics  



<p>To understand what gives an NFT value it is important to first take a look at what NFTs are exactly. In essence, an NFT is nothing more than a certain token on a certain blockchain that holds some data. This token can be sold, held, and traded, and whatever data it holds is up to its creator. This should make it obvious that the NFT itself has no inherent value. Its value comes from the utility the creator or community attaches to it.</p>



<p>But what does utility mean in this context? It means that the NFT should give the holder the ability to do something with it in a specific ecosystem, ranging from utility in a big metaverse to utility in a small restaurant. And the specific utility can be very broad as well, ranging from the ability to use a tokenised in-game item in a certain game, to gaining exclusive access to a certain event. And since everything is easily verifiable and accessible on a blockchain, anybody or any ecosystem can add utility to (a certain set of) NFTs at any time. Tomorrowland NFT holders could for example get special discounts on Lollapalooza tickets. This ability to add a diverse range of utilities to an NFT, along with easily verifiable ownership and their transparent nature has opened up many opportunities.</p>



<p>Now you have a better understanding of what gives an NFT value and what utility in an NFT context means, let’s take a look at different kinds of utility that can be attached to an NFT.</p>







 Different types of NFT utility  



<p>As already mentioned, NFTs can get their value from a variety of different types of utility. We have summarised the 4 main types of NFT utility and will describe each of them below:</p>



 
 Ability to collect  



 Providing access 



 Rewarding loyalty  



 Asset tokenisation 
 



 Ability to collect 



<p>One of the key ways NFTs gain value is through collecting and owning digital art and collectibles. It’s a lot like the joy people get from collecting physical things, whether it’s art, cards, or other treasures. But with NFTs, there’s a modern twist – they live on the blockchain. Think of it like owning a piece of digital art that’s securely stored online. This similarity brings a similar kind of fun – the excitement of collecting, the satisfaction of completing a set, or having something really unique. Plus, NFTs can also be seen as investments, with their prices going up and down over time. And, there’s a social aspect too. Collectors can connect with each other, just like people who share a love for collecting physical items.</p>



<p>The blockchain part makes digital collecting even cooler. Even though you can’t hold NFTs like physical objects (although you can display your NFTs in a digital frame!), you can easily prove they’re real, trade them with others from anywhere in the world, and even use them in different online places, like games. Furthermore, the digital world opens up new opportunities. It gives you a chance to do things with your collectibles that would not be possible in the ‘real world’, like combining and staking your collectibles.</p>



<p>In some cases, an NFT can also represent a digital twin of a physical and tangible item, further blurring the boundaries between the digital and physical worlds. However, we will explain this further in the asset tokenisation section below.</p>



 Providing access 



<p>Another way NFTs bring value is by providing access. This can be access to anything, ranging from access to a certain membership, to a certain subscription, or perhaps access to exclusive events or experiences.</p>



<p>These kinds of NFTs come in various shapes and sizes, ranging from membership <a href="https://nft.tomorrowland.com/membersclub">NFTs offered by the famous Tomorrowland festival</a>, which give holders access to exclusive raffles, tours, festival tickets, and more, to <a href="https://www.nftboxes.io/">NFT subscription boxes which give holders special NFTs </a>on a monthly basis. Another great example are the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, which essentially serve as entry tickets to the BAYC ecosystem.</p>



<p>Within this category of NFTs the specific utility that an NFT offers varies a lot depending on the party offering the NFT. However, it always boils down to specific access in a certain way.</p>



 Rewarding loyalty 



<p>Unlike NFTs focused on providing utility by providing certain access that are typically bought, loyalty reward NFTs are earned, typically through ongoing engagement. The utility lies in the added value they bring to holders’ experiences, creating a sense of exclusivity and pride among the loyal community. And for businesses, it is an innovative way to <a href="https://zaisan.io/web3-improve-customer-loyalty-travel-industry/">leverage web3 technologies to increase customer loyalty</a>.</p>



<p>The adoption of NFTs for loyalty rewards introduces numerous advantages over traditional loyalty programs. Unlike conventional loyalty schemes that are often limited to a single company, NFT-based loyalty programs have the potential to facilitate collaborations between multiple businesses. For example, multiple businesses in a certain area, or various businesses in the same industry. This opens the door to more diverse and appealing rewards that can be redeemed within a broader ecosystem, further enhancing customer loyalty and satisfaction.</p>



<p>Moreover, NFT loyalty rewards bring a higher level of flexibility. Unlike traditional loyalty points or perks, NFTs are tradable assets, enabling customers to access a marketplace where they can buy, sell, or exchange rewards. This feature empowers customers to maximise the value of their loyalty programme participation. Unwanted or duplicate rewards can be converted into money or points, granting customers greater control over their loyalty benefits.</p>



<p>With increased adoption of NFTs in loyalty programs, customers are set to enjoy richer, more personalised experiences, while companies benefit from heightened brand loyalty and deeper customer relationships. And in terms of utility, the better the rewards, the greater the utility of loyalty reward NFTs for customers and companies alike.</p>



 Asset tokenisation 



<p>The last type of utility is by far the broadest category and it refers to the ability to tokenise any asset, either physical or digital, and tangible or intangible. This asset usually already has a certain type of utility, but by using NFTs to tokenise them they get even greater utility.</p>



<p>We will take a deeper look at how that works and what is possible. It is important to first understand the difference between the tokenisation of an asset using fungible tokens, or non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Let’s take a hotel as an example. Let’s say you want to tokenise the hotel rooms of a hotel, and want token holders to receive part of the revenue that these hotel rooms generate. One of the ways in which that could be done is using fungible tokens. In this case you could create a certain amount of tokens, for example 1000, and then every token would receive 1/1000 of the total revenue from the hotel rooms. This is an example of using fungible tokens to tokenise something.</p>



<p>Another way in which this could be done is by tokenising each specific room. In this case, every token would be unique and represent a specific room in the hotel. Each token would then earn (part of) the revenue generated by the room represented by the NFT they hold. This is an example of using non-fungible tokens to tokenise something, and what we will focus on in this section.</p>



<p>The utility of tokenised assets extends far beyond their non-tokenised counterparts. By leveraging NFTs, these assets can unlock numerous advantages, such as fractional ownership, granting more people access to valuable assets, increased liquidity as they can be easily traded on various marketplaces. As well as heightened transparency through the immutable nature of the blockchain, and reduced transaction costs compared to traditional intermediaries. And in addition to these points, the underlying asset, as well as any rights or claims tied to the NFT, are of course key in determining its value and utility.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>NFTs have emerged as a game-changer in the digital world, thanks to their wide applicability. Furthermore, their value lies in their utility, and this utility can be anything, ranging from the ability to collect to providing access to a wide range of experiences, subscriptions, and memberships.</p>



<p>In the ever-evolving NFT landscape, the value of these digital assets hinges on the ecosystem in which they reside. A focus on tangible utility and long-term viability is critical to weather market fluctuations and ensure sustained success. As the market matures, NFTs continue to expand into new industries, creating unique opportunities for creators, collectors, and businesses.</p>



<p>The transformative potential of NFTs is boundless, offering novel ways to interact with and monetise digital content, democratise ownership of valuable assets, and to foster deeper connections between brands and their customers. As time moves forward, the fusion of creativity, technology, and utility in the NFT space promises to reshape ownership paradigms and unlock endless possibilities in the digital age. Embracing this transformative potential, we step into an era where NFTs redefine value, ownership, and the way we engage with the digital world.</p>

<p>The Web3 ecosystem almost unanimously agrees on the benefit of users <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/is-privacy-a-human-right-philosophy-economics-legality/">preserving their privacy</a> while retaining permissionless access to distributed ledger technology. </p><p>This shared understanding, however, tends to face an equally strong pushback (particularly from regulatory authorities) when we are reminded that privacy, without checks and balances, can become a shield for illicit activities. Indeed, the purpose of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency is not to enable criminal actors to surpass Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) regulations or to find a way around sanctions. Rather, permissionless tools are preferred by the Web3 ecosystem based on its initial ideology, centered on the pursuit of individual freedoms and the attempt to decentralize currency and eliminate intermediaries on the Web.</p><p>For most people, privacy and compliance seem to be at odds. However, the latest technological advances, such as zero-knowledge proofs, are paving the way for innovation. Combining these technologies with an approach based on <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/zk-and-non-zk-reveals?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">ZK disclosures</a> and decentralizing access to compliance, Panther is pioneering privacy-preserving access to DeFi while enabling new compliance mechanisms. </p><p>Here's how.</p> Understanding risks and challenges<br> <p>To avoid a scenario where a malicious actor can exploit the protocol to commit crimes, it's important to first understand the different regulations, their purpose, and the risks a privacy-preserving solution needs to address.</p><p>Some of the most important regulations are:</p> Conceptualizing a solution<br> <p>Considering the difficulties in developing a decentralized solution that preserves privacy and enables compliance, Panther designed an approach that utilizes three essential components. These elements collectively form a pathway to achieve compliance by leveraging the protocol's zero-knowledge characteristics.</p><p>Panther's solution is based on:</p> Third-party compliance vendor integrations <p>Panther has built a system that retains neutrality by integrating compliance providers that accept multiple types of verification. These systems are called "multi-compliance vendors" as they allow users to choose from various compliance providers while retaining a decentralized approach. </p>At v1, there will be just one verification level available for all users.<p>The <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/dao-and-decentralization/panther-dao?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther DAO</a> has been commissioned to select a multi-compliance vendor that aligns with its interests, a discussion taking place in Panther's <a href="https://forum.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">forum</a>. When integrating these providers, the following requirements are taken into consideration:</p>  Ability to blacklist PEPs or newly flagged individuals based on unverified identities.  Blacklists for verified EoAs.  Ability to perform checks to create an "allowlist" that works on- and off-chain.  Preferably, maintaining an on-chain verification list through oracles/smart contracts.  Performing validations at deposit and withdrawal.  Optionally, allowing users to register multiple addresses. This is suggested so that users can break the on-chain link between their transactions by withdrawing and depositing from different addresses.  Optionally, using a zero-knowledge proof to allow users to create new accounts once they have passed verification.  <p>Within Panther's solution, compliance providers need to be able to process users' data without the protocol learning it, proving a user's ownership of their wallet and giving them a zero-knowledge proof that attests to the validity of their statements. This allows users to access Panther but maintains the protocol's neutrality. The diagram below exemplifies this process: </p>Panther's flow for user verifications. zAccounts<br> Once they complete the verification process with a multi-compliance vendor, users can create a zero-knowledge zAccount.<p>Within Panther, users are identified through their <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/zaccounts?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zAccount</a>, a concept similar to a bank account in that it englobes all of a user's transactions within a single reference point. zAccounts attest to users' compliance verification while retaining zero-knowledge properties. In other words, they prove that a user has passed verification (and the type of verification passed), but they do not store any private information about users.<br></p><p>As you saw in the diagram above, Panther is interested in allowing users to have multiple accounts for withdrawals and depositing, all of which would be connected to their zAccount. This would prevent users from creating obvious, observable on-chain links between their public wallets and zAccounts.</p> Zones <br> When creating a zAccount, users are onboarded onto a Zone with particular specifications.<p>Although they primarily serve a different purpose (which will be covered in an upcoming article), <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools/zones?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Zones</a> also play a part in the design of Panther's compliance integrations.</p><p>This is because Panther's overall compliance solution covers multiple Zones. Zones are logical partitions of liquidity within Shielded Pools, each managed by a different ZM (<a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/ecosystem-roles/zone-managers?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Zone Manager</a>). ZMs can determine what compliance information their Zones require from users and control the integration of specific compliance vendors into their Zones to fit their particular goals.</p><p>The requirements ZMs set for users, the types of verifications these users undergo, and other factors related to Zones also influence users' transaction limits, the types of movements they're allowed to do, and other variables. As such, Zones are also vital in Panther's design to enable compliance.</p> Conclusion <br> <p>With a first-of-its-kind approach to zero-knowledge DeFi access with enabled compliance, Panther attempts to create a new approach to DeFi <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/start-here/who-is-panther-for?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">for institutions and retail users alike</a>. The protocol's unique architecture offers a comprehensive solution for regulated entities to function in the DeFi space while remaining neutral at a protocol level.</p><p>Panther has also given much thought to flexibility, enhancing the possibilities for users and Zone Managers. The protocol is committed to aligning the needs of users, regulators, and institutions in the DeFi space. Its vision puts users in control of who views their data while remaining able to comply with regulations, two characteristics previously never combined in the DeFi space.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther's zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

 The Last 12 Months of Aztec&nbsp;Grants <p>It has been almost a year since Aztec Labs formally announced the first iteration of the Aztec Grants program, and since then, a lot has happened.</p><p>Aztec Labs has been running full-steam ahead towards building the Aztec rollup, a programmable zkRollup supporting both public and private smart contract execution. The Noir programming language has continued to improve on tooling, developer experience, and functionality. And the developer community around our ecosystem has grown significantly — in fact, we were named the fastest growing developer community earlier this year by Electric Capital’s <a href="https://twitter.com/aztecnetwork/status/1655558182302007296">Developer Report</a>.</p><p>In the meantime, the Aztec Grants program has funded over 50 independent contributors across our ecosystem. Before announcing the next wave of grants, we wanted to celebrate some of the grantees who have been working alongside us for the last 9 months and the projects they have been building&nbsp;towards.</p> Celebrating Some Recent Aztec&nbsp;Grantees <p>Many grantees are independent developers or small teams of independent devs. Here are some of the projects that they’ve been working&nbsp;on:</p><p>Halo2 Backend for&nbsp;Noir</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/Mach-34">Mach34</a> team and <a href="https://github.com/Ethan-000">Ethan000</a> are developing an additional proving <a href="https://github.com/Ethan-000/halo2_backend">backend for Noir</a>. As a reminder, Noir is proof system agnostic, so this backend will allow for the verification of Noir circuits using the Halo2 proving backend. The version that is being worked on is the Axiom and PSE version — not to be confused with the original Halo2 proving system developed by the zCash&nbsp;team.</p><p>One additional thing to note is that some of you may recognize the Mach34 team from their work on <a href="https://github.com/Ian-Bright">BattleZips</a>! BattleZips is a set of implementations of the game Battleship in various ZK languages, intended to demonstrate how a web3 app can be built in a way that’s comparable in usability/performance to a web2 application. If you’re interested, check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWACGbvIsEgnR2aUCr9i-PpmTVhF5Zuik">BattleZips-Noir video tutorial&nbsp;series</a>.</p><p>DarkSafe Module</p><p><a href="https://github.com/colinnielsen">Colin Nielsen</a> is building DarkSafe, a Gnosis Safe module which allows for private multi-sigs using Noir’s secp256K1 signature verification, Merkle Tree membership proofs, and Gelato&nbsp;relays.</p><p>This Dark Safe module is intended as a proof-of-concept, but this signature verifier could be a simple module in Gnosis’ API — any Safe could install this module as a plug-in, and have this as a way to sign transactions from their&nbsp;Safes.</p><p>Ethereum Storage&nbsp;Proofs</p><p>Aragon ZK Research (AZKR) and Aztec Labs jointly participated in <a href="https://prop.house/nouns/private-voting-research-sprint/3954">the NounsDAO proposal</a> and won the proposal to implement a <a href="https://github.com/aragonzkresearch/noir-trie-proofs">private voting MVP</a> for <a href="https://nouns.wtf/">NounsDAO</a> using Storage Proofs. While Aztec led the research to unlock these proofs in Noir, AZKR focused on designing and implementing the voting solution using the&nbsp;proofs.</p><p>Aztec donated Aztec’s portion of the winnings to the <a href="https://twitter.com/aztecnetwork/status/1654471030310834179?s=20">Gitcoin ZK round</a>, and we ultimately funded AZKR with an additional grant to generalize the work that’s being done around private voting for NounsDAO (detailed above) into <a href="https://github.com/aragonzkresearch/noir-trie-proofs">more general libraries</a> that can be used by other projects.</p><p>Dark Forest Circuits in&nbsp;Noir</p><p>The <a href="https://zkga.me/">Dark Forest</a> strategy game, developed by 0xParc, is one of the most well-known zero-knowledge projects that exists today. Originally written in Circom, it’s a major Schelling Point for early ZK enthusiasts.</p><p>Aztec has funded <a href="https://github.com/SleepingShell/darkforest-noir">SleepingShell</a>, an independent developer within the Noir community, to complete the re-write of Dark Forest circuits in&nbsp;Noir.</p><p>Noir Implementation of Semaphore</p><p><a href="https://semaphore.appliedzkp.org/">Semaphore</a> is a proof-of-membership protocol developed by the Ethereum Foundation’s PSE group. Semaphore can be used to anonymously prove that individuals are part of a group. Semaphore is used across the ZK landscape for projects building private identity, authentication, governance, and social applications. The goal for this project is to reach feature-parity with the Semaphore CLI.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/siosw">Simon Oswald</a> and <a href="https://github.com/velkoskis">Stefan Velkoski</a> were formerly part of the <a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/introducing-polygon-nightfall-mainnet-decentralized-private-transactions-for-enterprise">Polygon Nightfall</a> team. They have extensive Circom experience from their time at Polygon, where Simon was a core contributor to Polygon Nightfall’s zero-knowledge circuit infrastructure.</p><p>Noir Puzzles</p><p><a href="https://www.rareskills.io/">RareSkills</a> provides educational bootcamps to help teach programming languages related to crypto. The company has <a href="https://github.com/RareSkills/noir-puzzles">applied its puzzle format to&nbsp;Noir</a>.</p><p>Other Grants</p><p>Finally, since the mentions above are a non-exhaustive list of projects built over the last few months, we also wanted to share the repositories of some other projects from our recent wave of grants. This list is also by no means inclusive of all projects we’ve funded over the last 9 months but should still give you an idea of the types of projects we are aiming to&nbsp;fund.</p>  <a href="https://github.com/shuklaayush/noir-bigint">BigInt library</a>  <a href="https://github.com/0xrishabh/zkPic">zkPic</a> (inspired by <a href="https://medium.com/@boneh/using-zk-proofs-to-fight-disinformation-17e7d57fe52f">Using ZK Proofs to Fight Disinformation</a>)  <a href="https://github.com/seugu/Noir-MiMCsponge/tree/main">Noir MIMC-Sponge implementation</a>  <a href="https://github.com/onurinanc/noir-bn254">BN254 pairings&nbsp;library</a>  <a href="https://github.com/tsujp/tsujp">Fog of War&nbsp;Chess</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hhamud/tree-sitter-noir">Treesitter Noir</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hhamud/noir-mode">Emacs syntax highlighting</a>   Introducing Aztec Grants Wave&nbsp;3 <p>Now, as our community has gotten larger, we’re seeing more people organically contribute to the language without grants as a motivating factor — <a href="https://github.com/resurgencelabs/signed_int">useful</a> <a href="https://github.com/colinnielsen/ecrecover-noir">libraries</a> are being built for the benefit of the Noir community, <a href="https://hackmd.io/XZX9_pZ8Q1aa_ySDPeQopg">explanatory materials</a> are being written to educate and expand the ecosystem of developers interested in Noir, and projects are springing up in places we <a href="https://github.com/storswiftlabs/python2noir">didn’t expect</a> led by teams we didn’t know&nbsp;about!</p><p>With the third wave of our grants program, we want to keep attracting developers interested in contributing to the Noir language, and we want to provide an avenue for independent developers to get rewarded for work in Noir already in progress or completed. Importantly, we want to make the process as easy and painless as possible.</p><blockquote>In this Grants wave, we are funding retroactive grants for completed and in-progress libraries that benefit the Noir ecosystem and projects built using Noir. This Aztec Grants funding wave is open through the end of the 2023 calendar&nbsp;year.</blockquote><p>If you are a maintainer of a non-Noir-specific project that our developer community uses frequently — like the <a href="https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky">Chumsky parser tool</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p">js-libp2p library</a> — a grant could make sense for you.

<p>Following conversations at Zcon4 in Barcelona, the Zcash Foundation (ZF) and Electric Coin Co. (ECC) are excited to announce that we’ve agreed to move core Zcash protocol work from zcashd to Zebra! 🦓🛡️</p>



<p>Zebra is a brand new Zcash full node implementation written from the ground up in Rust. Both the ECC and ZF teams believe the modern architecture and good engineering in Zebra will provide a safer and more efficient implementation of the Zcash core protocol.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zebra was created by ZF with significant support and assistance from ECC developers, and relies on Zcash core libraries authored at ECC. Both organizations’ teams will collaborate to identify what functionality needs to be added to Zebra to address the necessary use cases, and to encourage and support key users to migrate to Zebra. Zcashd will continue to be supported during the transition, which will take an undetermined amount of time. ECC plans to continue independently supporting core Zcash protocol upgrades, such as its planned implementation of proof of stake, using Zebra.</p>



<p>ECC engineers built the original Zcash full node (“zcashd”) and have maintained and supported it through 69 releases and 6 network upgrades since 2016. This original implementation inherits the Bitcoin codebase and has grown challenging to maintain. Today’s announced transition will reduce the time it will take to deploy new features for Zcash, and allow more engineering time toward wallet SDKs and a transition away from PoW consensus. For ECC, this is part of its strategy of “Decentralize Zcash and Focus ECC”. For ZF, this marks a significant milestone for the Zebra project.</p>



<p>As part of this transition, Zooko at the Electric Coin Company has gifted a zebra suit previously seen on stage at Zcon1, to Jack Gavigan of ZF.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Zebra implements the <a href="https://zcash.github.io/rpc/getblocktemplate.html">getblocktemplate</a> RPC together with its associated RPCs. You can find the instructions for mining in <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/mining.html">The Zebra Book</a>. In a nutshell, you need to compile Zebra with the getblocktemplate-rpcs feature flag and adjust the config file to suit your setup. You can find the recommended system requirements <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/requirements.html">here</a>. The Zebra Book also contains other useful details. For example, you can enable <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/metrics.html">metrics</a> via Prometheus and Grafana.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>With each Zebra release, along with our regular <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/zfnd/zebra/tags">Docker images</a>, we also publish ones that have the .experimental suffix in their name. These images let you instantly run Zebra with mining support enabled. You can read more about them in the docs <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/mining-docker.html">here</a>. If you’re compiling Zebra yourself, you can enable freshly implemented terminal-based <a href="https://zfnd.org/experimental-zebra-progress-bars/">progress bars</a> that will let you easily see Zebra’s syncing status and a bunch of other metrics directly from the terminal.</p>

<p>In this video, we delve into the frontier of longevity and the pursuit of living forever. The discussion of longevity sparks different reactions among people, with some rejecting the idea outright, deeming it unnatural or immoral.</p> <p>At Zuzalu, two distinct groups emerged—the Health and Wellness tribe, focused on healthy lifestyles, and the longevity tribe, resembling crypto enthusiasts, passionately researching the silver bullet for eternal life.</p> <p>We explore the two conversations of slowing down aging and accelerating rejuvenation, with a particular focus on the latter. Interviews with Patrick Linden, author of "The Case Against Death," Sergio Ruiz, an epigenetic reprogramming expert, and Michael Greer, founder of the Humanity app, shed light on the socio-cultural reactions, DNA reprogramming, and AI-driven longevity scoring.</p> <p>While the pursuit of longevity faces regulatory challenges, its potential to eliminate diseases and revolutionize healthcare holds transformative power. The quest for extended health spans offers tremendous benefits for humanity's future.</p> <p>------ 🚀Join Ryan &amp; David at Permissionless II in September. <a href="https://bankless.cc/GoToPermissionless">https://bankless.cc/GoToPermissionless</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ 📣 STADER LABS | ETHX LIQUID STAKING <a href="https://bankless.cc/Stader">https://bankless.cc/Stader</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>🐙KRAKEN | MOST-TRUSTED CRYPTO EXCHANGE ⁠https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2&nbsp;</p> <p>🦊METAMASK PORTFOLIO | MANAGE YOUR WEB3 EVERYTHING ⁠https://bankless.cc/MetaMask&nbsp;</p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM ⁠https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum&nbsp;</p> <p>🛞MANTLE | MODULAR LAYER 2 NETWORK <a href="https://bankless.cc/Mantle">https://bankless.cc/Mantle</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>👾POLYGON | VALUE LAYER OF THE INTERNET <a href="https://polygon.technology/roadmap">https://polygon.technology/roadmap</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🗣️TOKU | CRYPTO EMPLOYMENT SOLUTION <a href="https://bankless.cc/Toku">https://bankless.cc/Toku</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ TIMESTAMPS:</p> <p>0:00 Intro 1:30 Wellness vs Longevity</p> <p>7:00 PATRICK LINDEN 9:30 The Pursuit of Immortality 12:30 We Want Choice 16:30 How Long Would You Live? 23:20 Now is the Time 27:00 Health is Longevity 33:30 Increasing Healthspan 36:30 The Case Against Death 41:40 How to Not Die</p> <p>46:00 SERGIO RUIZ 48:45 Healthspan and Lifespan 52:50 Longevity Research 57:45 Epigenetic Reprogramming 1:05:30 Feeling Young 1:09:30 Longevity Escape Velocity 1:14:30 Challenges and Obstacles 1:18:30 The Economic Case</p> <p>1:28:00 MICHAEL GEER 1:31:50 A Billion Years of Health 1:38:45 Utilizing Technology 1:43:45 Using AI for Health 1:46:15 Good Metrics to Track 1:52:00 Defining Health 1:55:00 The Humanity App 2:01:30 More Users, More Wearables 2:08:45 Get Healthier</p> <p> ------ RESOURCES:</p> <p>Patrick Linden <a href="https://twitter.com/DrPatrickLinden?s=20">https://twitter.com/DrPatrickLinden?s=20</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Sergio Ruiz <a href="https://twitter.com/Sergio_A_Ruiz?s=20">https://twitter.com/Sergio_A_Ruiz?s=20</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Michael Geer <a href="https://twitter.com/Geeria?s=20">https://twitter.com/Geeria?s=20</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Case Against Death <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262543163/the-case-against-death/">https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262543163/the-case-against-death/</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>VitaDAO <a href="https://www.vitadao.com/">https://www.vitadao.com/</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Animal Free Precision Medicine <a href="https://www.afpm.bio/">https://www.afpm.bio/</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Humanity App <a href="https://www.humanity.health/">https://www.humanity.health/</a>&nbsp;</p> <p> ------ Not financial or tax advice.

 1. Feature: Making SNARKs more accessible, more auditable, and more widely usable for more developers <p>with Justin Thaler, Sam Ragsdale, Michael Zhu et al </p><p>We recently released two new innovations that can significantly speed up scaling and building applications in web3: Lasso and Jolt, which together represent a fundamentally new approach to SNARK design.&nbsp;</p><p>Why does this matter? So much work over the past few years has gone into increasing the efficiency and usability of <a href="https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/jthaler/ProofsArgsAndZK.pdf">verifiable computing</a> in general, and SNARKS specifically, to deliver on the promise of trustless distributed systems.&nbsp;At a very high level, <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/tags/snarks">SNARKs</a> — which have many applications both in web3 and beyond — compress arbitrary computations so that anyone can quickly verify that they were done correctly. For crypto and web3, they move expensive computations off-chain and only carry out verification on-chain. </p><p>Lasso and Jolt represent <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/introducing-lasso-and-jolt/">a new paradigm</a> for implementing streamlined zkVMs (zero-knowledge virtual machines) because they avoid the need for circuits that have to be optimized tediously by hand. Until now, building with SNARKs required specialized expertise that very few developers have. But Lasso accomplishes a much more streamlined approach by performing “lookups” [see more on lookup arguments in the posts below] against massive structured tables with less computational waste. This was previously impossible because prior lookup arguments required (super)linear preprocessing or prover time. Meanwhile, Jolt-based VMs are simpler, faster, and more easily auditable.&nbsp;</p><p>Together, Lasso and Jolt help unlock more compute-intensive applications —  allowing many more kinds of applications to be built than are possible now. Importantly, this approach helps make SNARK design more widely usable, and the SNARK toolchain much more accessible to more developers, by allowing SNARKs for existing popular programming languages (not only those designed for the task). Many instructions across different instruction sets are similar, allowing significant code re-use… a hallmark of web3 and open source.&nbsp;</p><p>An analogy here might be to the early days of semiconductor engineering: Before chip design was accelerated and democratized through CAD and a broader ecosystem of tooling, many circuit designs were hand-coded and optimized in a bespoke manner; we are in a similar moment with SNARKs today. And while there is a long way to go to get there, Lasso and Jolt could help set us on that path. Right now, Lasso is 10x faster than existing approaches and should get to 40x once optimized (and beyond, once Jolt is further built). To that end, we welcome more developers and builders to contribute to this body of open source work, which is available to anyone!

Trends: AI &amp; crypto <p>with Ali Yahya, Dan Boneh, Sonal Chokshi</p><p>This week's all-new episode of “web3 with a16z” covers the convergence of two top of mind trends: artificial intelligence/machine learning, and blockchains/crypto. The conversation covers topics ranging from deep fakes, bots, and the need for proof-of-humanity in a world of AI; to big data, large language models like ChatGPT, user control, governance, privacy and security, zero knowledge and zkML; to MEV, media, art, and more. </p><p>The first half is about how AI could benefit from crypto, and the second half on how crypto could benefit from AI — but the thread throughout is the tension between centralization vs. decentralization.&nbsp;We also discuss where the intersection of crypto and AI can bring about things that aren't possible by either one of them alone. Together, the fields of AI and crypto have major implications for how we all live our lives everyday; so this episode is for anyone just curious about, or already building in the space.&nbsp;<br><br><a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/ai-crypto-centralization-decentralization">listen here</a><br><br><br><a href="https://twitter.com/moodlezoup/status/1689761274320637952">builder of worlds</a><br><br>--Sonal Chokshi and a16z crypto teams</p><p>You’re receiving this newsletter because you signed up for it on our websites, at an event, or elsewhere (you can opt out any time using the ‘unsubscribe’ link below).

 Better utilizing Horizen block rewards to enhance the security of EON network and drive greater growth for the Horizen ecosystem 



<p>HCC has recently submitted ZenIP 42206 which proposes redirecting the portion of the Horizen mainchain block reward currently paid to Secure Nodes to an EON Forger Subsidy Fund.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose is to drive the success of the Horizen EON network by increasing the security and decentralization of the network.&nbsp;</p>

 &nbsp; 
 Why Should We Make This Change? 
<p>The Horizen main blockchain currently has a block reward that’s paid toward 4 different entities:</p>
 
 Miners (60%) 
 Horizen Treasury (20%) 
 Super Nodes (10%) 
 Secure Nodes (10%) 
 
<p>Secure Nodes are No Longer Needed and Currently Causing A Burden</p>
<p>This allocation structure was created prior to Zendoo’s implementation. Zendoo has increased the requirements of mainchain nodes so that the Secure Node minimum requirements are no longer sufficient to provide any benefit to the Horizen chain. Furthermore, with the <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/upcoming-deprecation-of-the-horizen-mainchain-shielded-pools/">removal of the shielded pools on mainchain</a>, the need for Secure Nodes is diminished. The subpar performance and the lack of usage of Secure Nodes pose a burden to the chain.</p>
<p>There is a Strong Need for Forger Nodes in EON</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there is a strong need for forger nodes in Horizen sidechains for enhancing the security of the network, and for decentralization. The current Secure Node operators are well-equipped to provide this type of support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Timing is Right to Optimize the Allocation of Horizen’s Block Reward</p>
<p>Therefore, it’s necessary to update and optimize the allocation of Horizen’s block reward to reflect and better support recent developments of the project – the current Secure Node reward can be put to better use securing and supporting the EON network.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What Will This Change Entail? 
<p>A number of things will happen:</p>
 
 There will be a DAO-controlled address called “EON Forger Subsidies” set up on both EON and the Horizen blockchains.&nbsp; 
 The 10% of the block reward currently paid to Secure Nodes will be redirected to the “EON Forger Subsidies” address on the Horizen mainchain, and held there until both of the following are true:&nbsp;
 
 Forging on EON becomes open to the public 
 A mechanism to automatically forward transfer 10% of the block reward to the EON chain’s “EON Forger Subsidies” address has been added to the mainchain 
 
 
 After the automated forward transfer is set up, there will be an automated distribution of funds based on block forging, with an equal amount of ZEN paid out for each EON chain block forged. 
 All block subsidies will be distributed at the end of each Sidechain Consensus Epoch. 
 The Secure Node tracking service will be deprecated 
 Secure Nodes operators will no longer be eligible to receive block reward allocations but will have the option to choose to migrate to EON to be eligible for forging subsidies. 
 



 The following are more FAQs to address the questions we have received from the community 
<p>Q: Why redirect Secure Nodes instead of Super Nodes?</p>
<p>A: We’ve said from the early days of Horizen that we wanted to dedicate Super Nodes to a special purpose in the Horizen ecosystem. We want to maintain that goal and reserve Super Nodes for a higher value potential use in the future. Furthermore, unlike Super Nodes, the Secure Node hardware requirements are no longer sufficient to support their function on the Horizen mainchain and are causing a burden to the blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: Will Secure Node operators be able to become node forgers for EON and continue to earn rewards?</p>
<p>A: Yes! Anyone who wants to support the EON network and get rewarded can participate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: How do I become an EON node forger and what are the requirements?</p>
<p>A: Participants who want to run EON forger nodes would have to set them up. Instructions on how to do so and the requirements are forthcoming.</p>
<p>Q: How much reward the EON forgers will be able to earn?</p>
<p>A: We cannot estimate the exact reward amount at this moment. </p>



 What’s Next? 
<p>ZenIPs are for the community to approve or decline. Please join the conversation and make this decision with us. We will be hosting a series of town halls on Discord to have live conversations about this decision, but we recognize that it can be difficult to match global time zones. So to ensure that we can include everyone, we will be recording a new episode of the Beyond the Horizen podcast with our co-founder Rob Viglione. We will collect your questions and feedback for the podcast in the coming days. There will also be a community poll to collect votes from the community, please stay tuned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We highly encourage you to read the full <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/zenip_42204-draft/zenip_42206.md">ZenIP on GitHub</a> to get a complete understanding of what this means.

<p>After a 2021 frothy bull market, NFTs are currently experiencing the depression phase of the market cycle. However, despite the fact that only NFT art has truly found its product-market fit, NFTs in general represented the consumerist moment for crypto. In addition, they also provided a solution for tokenising real world assets (RWA) and intangibles, potentially penetrating markets worth hundreds of trillions of dollars. Moreover, similar to digital art, the advent of AI poses a challenge when it comes to establishing provenance, but this represents another utility for NFTs, as they can be traced back to their origin, given the public nature of blockchains.</p><p>We were joined by Stephen Young and Storm from NFTFi, to discuss the general state of the NFT market, future prospects for NFT development and how their P2P NFT lending platform unlocks new sources of liquidity in this bear market.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Stephen’s &amp; Storm’s backgrounds and what allured them to NFT finance  NFT market overview  Tokenised real world assets (RWA)  NFTFi’s peer-to-peer vs. peer-to-pool models  How other DeFi derivatives apply to the NFT market  NFT vs. fungible token market size  Blur’s Blend  NFT royalties  NFT lending protocols differences  How escrow contracts affect NFT ownership and utility  NFTFi roadmap  Interest rates for different collections  NFT art market  AI art  Collateralizing RWA  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/stephen_yo">Stephen Young on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/0x_Biscay">Storm on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/NFTfi">NFTFi on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Brian Fabian Crain.

 V8 Menger — Mainnet  Introduction <p>The Scala community is buzzing with excitement as the countdown begins for the much-anticipated release of V8&nbsp;Menger.</p><p>This upcoming version promises to bring a slew of new features and enhancements that will elevate the user experience and bolster the network’s security and sustainability.</p> Unveiling V8&nbsp;Menger <p>V8 Menger is set to introduce a range of innovative features that will shape the future of the Scala ecosystem. Let’s delve into some of the key highlights.</p> Diardi V2: Enhancing Network Security and Decentralization <p>At the heart of V8 Menger lies Diardi V2, a powerful upgrade that introduces 32 notary miners. These miners are poised to play a pivotal role in fortifying the network’s security and decentralization.</p><p>By harnessing the collective power of these notary miners, Scala aims to ensure the robustness of its infrastructure and the integrity of its transactions.</p> Introducing “Felidae”: Multi Proof-of-Work Algorithm <p>Scala is also proud to unveil a groundbreaking addition to its arsenal: the “Felidae” PoW algorithm.</p><p>This new in-house proof-of-work algorithm is still heavily optimized for mobile/ARM devices while being lighter and faster. It should also help prevent the centralization caused by some&nbsp;miners.</p><p>For those eager to dive into the technical intricacies, a comprehensive overview of “Felidae” is available on the official GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/scala-network/felidae">here</a>.</p> Revamped Block&nbsp;Rewards <p>The approach to block rewards takes a transformative turn with the V8 Menger release. Inspired by the practices of prominent projects like Monero, Scala is implementing an eroding curve for block&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This strategic move aligns with the project’s long-term sustainability goals, ensuring that rewards are distributed in a manner that supports both miners and the overall health of the ecosystem.</p><p>For an in-depth exploration of these features and their significance, readers can refer to the official Medium post&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/scala-network/menger-v8-specifications-75a8abb9a3c5">here</a>.</p> Mark Your Calendars: Important Dates <p>We have meticulously planned the rollout of V8 Menger, and here are the key dates to remember.</p> August 14, 2023: Official Release of New Executables <p>On this date, users will have the opportunity to access the new executables, marking the commencement of a new era for Scala. Mining, sending, and receiving XLA will be powered by the latest advancements introduced in V8&nbsp;Menger.</p> September 14, 2023: Hardfork and&nbsp;mainnet <p>We understand the importance of a seamless transition. To ensure a smooth upgrade process, the community, exchanges, and mining pools will have one month to migrate to the V8 daemons and applications. The Scala team will be actively engaging with these stakeholders, providing guidance and assistance to facilitate the&nbsp;switch.</p> Your Burning Questions Answered <p>To address common queries, we have compiled a brief&nbsp;FAQ.</p> Is V8 Menger a hardfork? <p>Yes, V8 Menger represents a hardfork. Users are required to install the new executables to access the upgraded&nbsp;network.</p> Do I need to create a new&nbsp;wallet? <p>No, there’s no need to generate a new wallet. Existing wallet addresses and seed words can be seamlessly used to access your&nbsp;coins.</p> What if I don’t upgrade during the transition period? <p>Don’t worry, you won’t lose access to your wallet or coins. However, installing the new executables is essential to regain access to the&nbsp;network.</p> Embracing a Bright&nbsp;Future <p>The Scala community is eagerly awaiting the dawn of the V8 Menger era. These enhancements symbolize a pivotal step forward in the evolution of the network, and the community’s role is integral to its success. As we embark on this journey together, stay tuned for further updates, insights, and exciting developments.</p><p>We extend our heartfelt gratitude to our dedicated community for their unwavering support and enthusiasm. Your commitment fuels our determination to push boundaries, elevate experiences, and carve a remarkable path for&nbsp;Scala.</p><p>Let’s celebrate the upcoming release and collectively shape the future of blockchain technology. Stay engaged, stay informed, and stay empowered. Together, we’re building something extraordinary.</p><p>Thank you for being an indispensable part of the Scala&nbsp;journey!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/scala-network/v8-menger-mainnet-bca35aa69d63">V8 Menger — Mainnet</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/scala-network">Scala</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In this article, we explore the key concepts and considerations for implementing a DAO (decentralised autonomous organisation) in your organisation. As the DAO landscape evolves, new business models and innovative structures emerge, offering exciting opportunities and unique challenges. We drew insights from experts in the field, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivierrikken/">Olivier Rikken</a>, DAO and Governance Expert, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandreprate/">Alex Prate</a>, co-founder of HyphaDAO, as they shared their knowledge and experience in the LeDg webinar episode: Unleashing the Power of a DAO.</p>



<p>Organisations can explore innovative ways of governance and collaboration. Understanding the core principles and considerations of implementing a DAO is crucial for harnessing its true potential.</p>



 1. Understanding DAOs: a new form of collaboration 



<p>DAOs represent a paradigm shift in organisational structures, enabling collective governance around a shared treasury. Unlike traditional organisations, DAOs empower members with voting power proportional to their contributions, fostering a sense of ownership and shared entrepreneurship. Whether it’s a startup, community, or a political party, DAOs can take various forms, promoting transparency, autonomy, and purpose-driven decision-making.</p>



 

 



 2. Tailoring Your DAO’s Purpose 



<p>Before embarking on the DAO journey, clearly define your organisation’s mission and vision. Assess whether a DAO structure aligns with your goals and values. Consider if you seek collaborative decision-making or quick and efficient top-down governance. As Olivier highlighted, it is important to choose a governance model that suits your organisation’s needs, be it equal voting, reputation-based, or token-weighted.</p>



 

 



 3. Designing the Governance Structure 



<p>Crafting an effective governance structure is paramount to a successful DAO. Determine how members can join the DAO and earn their place, or whether participation requires buying tokens. Address the decision-making process: should it involve the entire community or specialised circles? Assemble a core team responsible for leading the DAO and collaborating with the wider community.</p>



 4. Defining Use Cases for DAOs 



<p>DAOs serve a diverse range of use cases. They can facilitate collective investment in blockchain projects, political movements, social and economic innovations, cultural preservation, education initiatives, and even regenerative projects. The flexibility of DAOs allows organisations to harness collective intelligence, enabling them to thrive in various domains.</p>



 

 



 5. Integrating DAOs with Existing Organisations 



<p>Olivier discussed examples of how DAOs can complement existing organisations and empower their employees. Consider integrating DAOs to foster employee motivation, community engagement, or innovation. Implementing DAOs can also streamline decision-making processes and facilitate global scaling of products and services, attracting talents and ambassadors to your organisation.</p>

 Conclusion 



<p>In conclusion, implementing a DAO (decentralised autonomous organisation) can revolutionise organisational structures, fostering collective governance and shared entrepreneurship. Integrating DAOs with existing organisations empowers employees, streamlines decision-making, and facilitates global scaling, offering exciting opportunities for innovation and collaboration in various domains. Embracing DAOs can lead to a more dynamic and efficient organisational ecosystem, marking a new era of decentralised collaboration and decision-making. We would name it the era of Organisation 3.0.</p>
