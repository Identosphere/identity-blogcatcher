<p>Last year, one of Nym’s core community members suggested a change to the Nym token economics: to set a minimum profit margin for Nym node operations. This would prevent a ‘race to the bottom’, whereby nodes competing for stake would lower their profit margin and costs to near 0 in an effort to attract stake. The proposal envisioned that a minimum profit margin would promote a healthy dynamic for operators, ensuring a minimum acceptable income for everyone.</p><p>This blogpost gives an update on the current state of this proposal and outlines a process for arriving at a decision. In short, there is currently a suggested minimum profit margin in the Nym wallet interface of 4% and maximum at 80%, as well as a minimum operator cost of 40NYM and max of 2000NYM. These are ‘nudges’ rather than dictates and can be bypassed in the CLI. As of yet no changes have been made on-chain.</p> What happened? <p>Following the community proposal in the early summer last year, a <a href="https://t.me/nymchan_help_chat/64986">sentiment check</a> was taken at the time with a majority of participants in favour. The proposal went to the core team for further discussion, but was not established as a priority at the time as there was little actual operational costs and network load and no clear evidence that a race to the bottom was occurring.</p><p>In the late summer a new behaviour was discovered: operators were setting very low profit margins and operator costs to attract stake and then radically increasing their operator costs shortly after. This led to renewed discussions by the core team leading to a proposal to set a minimum profit margin at 7% and a maximum operator costs at 2000&nbsp;NYM.</p><p>This change was implemented on the wallet interface only, with on-chain changes to follow. With the latest release, min PM was lowered to 4% min and 80% max, and operator costs at min 40 NYM and max 2000&nbsp;NYM.</p><p>This is a limitation on the wallet front end only and can be changed manually via the&nbsp;CLI.</p> What now? <p>The wallet interface changes are nudging operators to set a healthy PM and reasonable OC. This change was set to be implemented on-chain also to ensure equal rules for all, but has since been met with some disagreement among community members. This calls for a deeper discussion and potentially a vote if consensus cannot be reached on the&nbsp;change.</p><p>In the meantime, the change to the front end has the effect of potentially creating an uneven playing field for new operators: new joiners will be encouraged to set the min PM and max OC while older node operators can continue with their existing settings.</p><p>Countering this potentially unfair advantage, Nym Core team are running an official delegations program for high quality operators, giving them a leg up on stake. This has the effect of levelling out the playing field for honest, high quality operators.</p> What next? <p>Taking all these factors into consideration, there is no urgent need to make on-chain changes to profit margin and operator costs. Further discussions on min PM and max OC are encouraged in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#operators:nymtech.chat">Node Operator channel</a> and during the regular operator AMAs (next one on next Tuesday 9th of&nbsp;April).</p><p>Nym core will also be hosting a larger Nym node operator Town Hall towards the end of April to present the Nym Gateway reward scheme following Smoosh and projections for the&nbsp;NymVPN.</p> Resources   <a href="https://nymtech.net/operators">Nym Operator&nbsp;Guide</a>  <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#operators:nymtech.chat">Nym operator channel (Element)</a>   Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#general:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/the-question-of-minimum-profit-margin-for-nym-nodes-142275840da7">The question of minimum profit margin for Nym nodes</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

      Climate Awakenings at Scale         
	By Harry Spitzer	 



Published April 3, 2024
        How the trio behind Watershed are working to make what’s good for the planet just as good for business.      



 
<p>In the summer of 2023, New York City was shrouded in smoke. Staring out the window of my office in the Financial District, I could barely see the East River. I dreaded going outside. The haze, which partially obscured not-so-distant Brooklyn from view, came from a series of devastating Canadian wildfires <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-wildfire-july-18-1.6909596">unlike</a> anything on record, with air quality indexes in NYC reaching 800% above what is considered “safe.” It was also very hot—here, and in so many other cities around the world. A relatively recent phenomenon, the effects of human-induced climate change are staring us in the face. Meanwhile, most experts agree that all of this, and so much <a href="https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/climate-change-fueling-migration-do-climate-migrants-have-legal-protections">more</a>, is only going to get worse.</p>



<p>I’m fascinated by the idea of “climate awakenings”—the moment when the climate crisis goes from an abstract notion to a real and present danger for a person. Why does it occur for some people as children after hearing a story about deforestation of the Amazon, while for others it takes a Category 3 hurricane barrelling toward their doorstep to finally acknowledge it might be real?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Motivating climate awakenings is what Taylor Francis, Avi Itskovich and Christian Anderson hope to do with Watershed, the company they co-founded. “The world needs to decarbonize between 5 to 10% per year,” says Francis. “We wanted to build something that could be a really big contributor to that.” Rather than targeting individuals, Watershed aims to awaken companies, inspiring them to minimize their carbon footprint and transition to clean power sources.</p>



<p>For Francis, 31, the aha moment came via a former Vice President the summer before eighth grade. He remembers seeing Al Gore’s “An Inconvenient Truth” in the theater with his mother and being “pretty shaken.” With no real summer plans to speak of, and with newfound existential dread, Francis took it upon himself to cold-email Al Gore’s office to see how he could lend a hand in saving the planet. To his surprise, he got a response just a few days later: an invitation to Nashville for the following month to attend the Climate Reality Project, a mini-climate advocacy bootcamp.</p>



<p>Over the course of three harrowing days, climate experts walked Francis and a couple hundred activists (all then-13-year-old Francis’s elders by at least 15 years, and one of whom, John Doerr, would later join the board of Watershed) through every slide of the “An Inconvenient Truth” PowerPoint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Francis walked away inspired, but also overwhelmed by the enormity of the challenge ahead. Determined to do something, he started giving hyper-localized, high school-friendly versions of the “Inconvenient Truth” talks in schools and libraries and community centers around the Bay Area. “I talked about the California droughts and wildfires, and I had little handouts to bring home to their parents that said things like ‘switch lightbulbs, buy a Prius, vote,’” he remembers, “and I think kids went home and yelled at their parents in a pretty big way.”</p>



<p>He kept at it in college, studying public policy and nursing a dream of working on climate legislation. But after graduating from Princeton in 2014 (and helping to convince Al Gore to be his “<a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2014/02/14/al-gore-selected-2014-class-day-speaker">Class Day” speaker</a>), that passion was hard to maintain in the face of the government’s seeming apathy on the issue, especially after the <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/anatomy-of-a-senate-climate-bill-death/">Cap and Trade Bill</a> had died in Congress that year. “It was a bit of a ‘what’s next?’ moment for climate policy,” he says—and realizing he didn’t yet know the answer, Francis decided to pivot careers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If I can’t work on climate policy,” he remembers thinking, “I might as well work in an amazing company and learn as much as I can about how to build a company of my own. And that kind of led me back to the Bay Area, into Stripe.”&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Itskovich, 31, never saw “An Inconvenient Truth” as a teen—his attentions in middle school were elsewhere. “My family kind of hopped around a lot,” Itskovich remembers. “I was born in the former USSR, when I was two I moved to Israel and then when I was about 10 I moved to Canada. I think we were preoccupied with, like, other things than climate.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of those things was academic excellence; when Itskovich brought home a 97% on a middle school report card, he was admonished by his dad, who had been schooled in the Soviet system where “anything less than a perfect score meant you weren’t great,” remembers Itskovich. As a high schooler, Itskovich steered this work ethic toward software engineering. After finishing his school’s computer science curriculum, he built an entirely new internal grading system for the school from scratch. By then, CS didn’t feel forced; it felt more like a calling—not just because of what it enabled Itskovich to do, but because of what it enabled others to do. “The power of being able to program is not like, ‘cool, I created the thing,’” says Itskovich. “It’s watching someone else use it, and in ways you might not even have expected.”</p>



<p>After graduating from the University of Waterloo with a degree in computer science and four tech internships in San Francisco under his belt, Itskovich knew he wanted to be at the center of the world’s greatest coding ecosystem, building tools that could empower millions. He returned to the Bay, where he’d landed an engineering gig at Stripe. There, he would meet a couple of key friends who would pull him away from his computer and into the outdoors—and in the process, help him find his life’s next major calling.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>For Anderson, 32, more than either of his co-founders, his climate awakening was something of a foregone conclusion—his father is an environmental policy lawyer who largely worked from home. “He always gave me a solid glimpse into the work he was doing,” remembers Anderson. A passion for climate action felt inevitable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At 10, Anderson made his first foray into early climate tech: He made a website. By then a consummate lover of backpacking and forests, Anderson couldn’t stand the idea of losing the world’s largest one. “It’s the kind of thing that’s so visual when you’re a kid, right?” says Anderson. “Imagine these forests in the Amazon getting chopped to death.” With his dad’s help, he built a web page titled “Foundation for our Future” to educate about conservation and accept donations to protect the Amazon rainforest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was only in high school that the concept of man-made climate change really clicked for Anderson. He remembers learning about it in his classes and feeling moved intellectually. He switched to vegetarianism and became a stickler for recycling, but felt mostly powerless otherwise. Like Francis, he says he couldn’t “connect with it as a problem that I could solve the way you might solve local environmental issues. I saw it as too huge a problem to affect.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>So instead, he followed other, more “accessible” passions, earning dual undergraduate degrees in physics and math at Harvard before being accepted into a physics PhD program at MIT for quantum informatics. But before fully “veering into a deep science direction” and committing to another six or seven years in Boston, Anderson decided he needed a gap year on the other side of the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What he found in the Bay Area’s tech scene reawakened a years-dormant urgency in Anderson. “There were a lot of people in San Francisco working to try to make the world better in an immediate way,” says Anderson. In this crucial juncture, as he was considering the impact he wanted to make in his life and work, that immediacy resonated. “For me it was, do we try to make the world better in a somewhat long-running roundabout way through science or, you know, could I try to build something with my own two hands that makes the world better?” says Anderson.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anderson decided to delay his PhD, and within weeks he had secured an engineering role at a promising young payments startup.</p>

Christian Anderson</blockquote>



 



<p>Once their lives converged at Stripe, so did most of the trio’s weekends. Anderson had started organizing small backpacking and camping trips for fellow Stripe outdoors enthusiasts, and while there weren’t many takers, in Itskovich and Francis he found kindred spirits, who were equally intense about outdoor activities. The three would calculate exactly how much outdoor time they could compress into the window between signing off on Friday and logging back in on Monday morning. They would go backcountry skiing in Tahoe, belaying up Mount Diablo and sprint-hiking a Lost Coast route in a day when it was meant to be done in two. “We bonded over this outdoor stuff where it’s all about pushing yourself, taking a risk, taking a challenge, kind of trusting somebody else,” says Anderson. “When something goes wrong and it becomes an adventure—that’s when that bond truly forms,” adds Itskovich with a laugh.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their weekends away also reawakened something that Francis and Anderson, for one reason or another, had placed on the back burner: climate urgency. Back in the office, much like their backpacking intensity, their collective interest in climate-focused work compounded as they worked together. In 2017, Francis started pitching in with Stripe’s early climate efforts, wrangling funds from the company to buy carbon offsets. Eventually, Anderson and Itskovich joined him, encouraging other corporations to do the same.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By 2018, their dedication to climate action would be put to the test. In October of that year, an intergovernmental panel on climate change published a report that became known colloquially as the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/">1.5 degree report</a>. Its main claim was that if humanity can limit global warming to just 1.5 degrees Celcius, we can avoid many of the more extreme, damaging impacts of climate change. But that doing so would require “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anderson read the report while visiting a friend on a wooded island off the coast of Vancouver, Canada. Surrounded by water and trees, he remembers thinking, “They did such a good job in that report, balancing the message of, ‘We are not past the point of no return, but the window for action really is closing.’” Just a few months later, Francis and Itskovich felt the same sentiment at an event hosted by the nonprofit Protect Our Winters (POW). One of the speakers presented the reality of climate change in stark terms: “We are the first generation to see the effects of climate change and the last generation to have an impact on it,” Itskovich remembers hearing. “It’s the kind of sentence that gets lodged in your brain and drives urgency. It means oh, maybe I shouldn’t wait five or 10 years to work on climate change. Maybe the time is now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike so many people who hear the alarm bells but find ways to quiet them and carry on with business as usual, the ringing remained deafening for the trio. They started mulling over, first individually, then collectively, what they could do—and how they could do it, fast. Francis and Itskovich left Stripe shortly thereafter, in mid-2019, to focus on climate action full-time, with the understanding that Anderson would join them soon. A few months later, after finalizing his work with Stripe’s climate initiative and handing off his teams, he did.</p>
 



Avi Itskovich, Christian Anderson and Taylor Francis



 
<p>In late fall 2019, the three ex-Stripes gathered around a whiteboard in Anderson’s apartment near Buena Vista Park. They knew only two things for certain: They wanted to work together on something, and that something would be climate-related. What exactly it would be, well, that’s where the whiteboard came in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the next two weeks, they workshopped a different idea every day, sketching out the pros and cons of each on the board. The ideas drew upon each of their respective areas of expertise, and ranged from altering public consciousness (starting a climate-focused media company), to tracking personal emissions (like Strava, but counting carbon instead of kilometers), to structural changes (political advocacy to mobilize bipartisan support for climate legislation), to more consumer-oriented fare (a slickly branded site that enabled consumers to buy clean power with the click of a button).&nbsp;</p>



<p>They evaluated each idea on its ability to remove or reduce 500 million tons of CO2 every year (“We thought it would be pretty awesome to build something that could be driving 10 to 20% of global decarbonization, which needs to be 5 gigatons of CO2 per year,” says Francis), and their ability to make an impact without relying on external societal or technological changes. At the end of two weeks, they concluded that changing hearts and minds wasn’t enough, that creating low-carbon materials like cement and concrete was just one piece of the puzzle (albeit an essential one), and that a consumer focus couldn’t scale. What they needed was to harness the enormous scale of corporate spending and direct it toward renewable energy—a mass corporate climate awakening.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We thought it would be pretty awesome to build something that could be driving 10 to 20% of global decarbonization.”</p>
Taylor Francis</blockquote>



<p>“We wanted to enable companies to take the geyser of money that they currently point at dirty technologies and redirect as much of that as possible toward the clean stuff,” says Francis. “If we could pull that off, we could enable not just one low-carbon cement company, but dozens of low-carbon cement companies and also low-carbon agriculture companies and low-carbon transportation companies and more demand for all the sustainable aviation fuel innovators. We could be this kind of leverage point.” As a bonus, it would give corporations a productive means of responding to any pressure they might face from investors, regulators and customers to take action on climate change.</p>



<p>In Anderson’s living room, the co-founders drafted the first slide of the deck they’d use for sales calls and pitches to investors, putting their value prop in plain terms: They would enable companies to measure their carbon footprint, meaningfully reduce it and report on their progress to employees, customers and investors. “The first slide of the sales deck that we made in 2019 is the same first slide of the sales deck today,” says Francis.</p>



<p>They added a title slide for their still-nameless company. It read: “Powering Carbon Reductions for _____.” Now, in order to catalyze the change they were hoping to accomplish, they just needed to fill in that blank a few thousand times over.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Two days before Christmas 2019, Francis hopped on a flight for an unexpected trip down to Los Angeles. The founders had received an early holiday gift: an email from Sweetgreen’s then head of supply chain and sustainability—a customer they’d been courting for weeks—saying he was free for a last-minute meeting. With Anderson and Itskovich away with their respective families for the holidays, Francis went to take the team’s first major meeting on his own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Francis walked into Sweetgreen’s Culver City office with their pitch deck and an early version of the Watershed platform that Itskovich and Anderson had built in the previous months (they’d settled on their name a month earlier for its dual ecological and idiomatic significance). The product wasn’t pretty—regarding its design, an early advisor had noted, “Whenever I’m in your product, I want to not be in your product.”—but it was functional, and showed how their dashboard could help companies measure and interpret their various sources of carbon emissions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Francis walked through the pitch deck, highlighting the existential nature of their mission and reinforcing their belief in the crucial role companies can play in reducing global carbon emissions. An hour later, he drove home, pleased with the presentation, but unsure how Sweetgreen would respond. “We were so early on doing enterprise sales, I had no idea how it went,” he remembers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within a matter of weeks, Sweetgreen got back to Francis: the restaurant brand had been moved by their vision and was eager to act. And thanks to Watershed’s platform, they could do so in a way that didn’t compromise profits, something instrumental to Watershed’s pitch. They’d officially landed their first major customer. “The key thing here is we’re not pitching ‘climate action at the expense of the corporation.’ We’re helping the corporation put climate into its core and treat it like a business priority,” says Itskovich.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The key thing here is we’re not pitching ‘climate action at the expense of the corporation.’ We’re helping the corporation put climate into its core and treat it like a business priority.”</p>
Avi Itskovich</blockquote>



<p>Over the following months, the founders onboarded Sweetgreen onto a considerably more beautiful (and functional) version of their platform, plugging in the restaurant chain’s food suppliers, farmers and transportation teams in order to understand where they could use the most carbon-friendly adjustments. All the data pointed to two key areas for carbon emission reduction: “Chicken and cheese,” says Itskovich. “You gotta solve your chicken and cheese emissions.”</p>



<p>With that in mind, Watershed helped Sweetgreen develop methodologies for engaging their poultry and dairy suppliers in ways that would increase awareness of their carbon emissions, and foster best practices for reducing them. First, they asked suppliers to fill out a survey. “The key question on the survey that you had to answer was, do you have a methane digester for your manure? For cheese creameries, it’s all about what you do with the manure,” says Francis. Using survey results, Watershed then offered recommendations for Sweetgreen’s suppliers to lower their carbon footprint, and encouraged Sweetgreen to seek out new suppliers if their original ones were unwilling to change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using insights from Watershed’s platform, Sweetgreen has changed its menu to reflect more carbon-conscious ingredients and deploy clean power in every store. With Watershed’s help, the restaurant chain is aiming for complete carbon neutrality by 2027. “The partnership with Sweetgreen has paved the way for what is possible for sustainability in a food system and supply chain like theirs,” says Francis.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Anderson hung up the phone, exhausted. It was early 2020, and in the wake of their Sweetgreen success, Watershed had managed to secure partnerships with Airbnb, Segment, Square and Shopify, all of whom were eager to make climate-friendly changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team got to work on Watershed Marketplace, a hub where customers could access vetted carbon credits, nascent carbon removal technologies, and, in theory, clean energy sources. But the latter was proving difficult to secure. “I legitimately called every major clean power developer in the United States to try to find one who would be willing to do business with a small tech startup,” says Anderson. This was a not-so-short list of 14 or so companies, who without fail would make their opinion of Watershed known. “We were small fries!” remembers Anderson. “It’s this big, expensive, really physically complex industry. They would get some tech startup on the phone that’s like, ‘Hey, we’re building the customer base, we think we could move a lot of your product!’ They were like, ‘Right, okay, sure man.’”</p>



<p>After upwards of 15 calls with a DC-based solar energy company called Sol Systems, Anderson finally got the response he was looking for. Convinced by Watershed’s mission and growing roster of customers, “They said ‘yes,’” remembers Anderson. “Sol Systems was our first Marketplace partner. This was the moment the Watershed Marketplace really got off the ground.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Marketplace established, the co-founders realized it was time to graduate out of Anderson’s living room. In mid-2020, they hired their first two employees and raised a Series A. Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins co-led the round, which also included backing from their former bosses at Stripe, the Collison brothers. “They were amazing mentors to us, so it meant a lot to have their investment—actual and symbolic—in the company,” says Francis.</p>



<p>They moved into a SoMa office space with an airy courtyard (“That was still mega COVID time, so we would do masked outdoor meetings,” says Francis). As the company grew, the trio enjoyed the same jolt of wonder with each new customer that Itskovich had first felt building his school’s grading system—of seeing their creation used in ways they’d never imagined. Like Sweetgreen, some companies used Watershed’s platform to make their supply chain more carbon-friendly. Others, like DoorDash, focused on the vehicles being used to deliver food, increasing the amount of bikes and EVs, while Shopify used Watershed to hone their logistics. For software companies, it was all about changing their data center usage, finding ways to be more carbon-efficient in their use of cloud computing and storage. “Every software company’s supply chain eventually gets very physical,” says Anderson. “What I think people probably don’t know is how much concrete is going into building a data center for, you know, an hour of a Netflix video. Every company is built on the physical world—there’s no company that escapes it.”</p>



<p>Each partnership felt like meaningful, incremental progress toward their monumental goal (i.e., saving the planet). More customers and more data also helped them refine their product, allowing them to work with customers to identify which climate-friendly changes could be made immediately and easily, and which would be the most impactful. “For example,” says Itskovich, “in the food space, the packaging pales in comparison to the food inside the packaging. There’s a big difference between the thing that sounds good and the thing that matters.”</p>



<p>With their business taking off, they realized that their joint professional history had some drawbacks. “One of our weaknesses as a founding team was all coming from the same company,” says Anderson. “And we did a big push to get outside of that, to recognize our blind spots and make a big effort in the first year of the company to build relationships with founders and executives from very different companies and industries.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of those blind spots was hiring. “We had to play catch-up in terms of growing the team. There was a bit of scrambling, kind of misjudging the market time,” says Anderson. For founders schooled in Stripe’s comparatively deliberate growth strategy, rapid expansion posed a challenge. Like their mentors, the founders wanted to personally meet and vet each potential new hire. But gradually, necessity and the advice of their advisors pushed them to delegate hiring responsibilities to other trusted people on their team. “For Watershed, this climate tech market arrived like a tidal wave,” says Sequoia partner Shaun Maguire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, all three admit that even in their most optimistic projections, they were blown away by that tidal wave. “I think we were very wrong in 2019—we thought it was gonna be five to 10 years before the climate imperative broadened out from these early adopters,” says Anderson. But the reality is that the industry was hungry for what they were offering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They attribute this hunger to a broader, collective climate awakening. Not only the kind that’s reflected in accelerating legislation and subsidies and technological progress, but, perhaps more important, the kind I saw outside my window earlier this summer, the kind that’s apparent in wildfire smoke and canceled flights and record-breaking heat and rising tides and shrinking biodiversity. The kind of existential awakening that’s increasingly become difficult to deny, on a personal or a professional level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Francis believes that this awakening has triggered a fundamental corporate shift, “from a mindset around environmentalism as conservation, to solving climate change as an economic, industrial, technological, capitalistic endeavor,” he says. “We have to build a ton of stuff. And the thing that has changed is that clean technologies are a lot cheaper today than they were 10 years ago.” It helps that today, as Maguire puts it, “Certain green technologies have already gotten so good. They’re already better and cheaper.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Certain green technologies have already gotten so good. They’re already better and cheaper.”</p>
Shaun Maguire</blockquote>



<p>This is why a large part of Watershed’s mission is to make it impossible for corporations to participate in climate denial on economic grounds. “I think the fundamental thing that enables Watershed is that even the most ruthless business can prioritize climate right now,” says Anderson. “We can surface the data so they can cut 20 to 40% of carbon today, and then there’ll be another 20 to 40% available by the time you’re done because of technological progress.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sangwon Suh, Watershed’s head scientist and former <a href="https://www.unep.org/">UNEP</a> member, sees businesses as playing an instrumental role in combating climate change. “So many changes are induced by the private sector,” says Suh. “If we can harness the power of the private sector—a sector that’s quick, efficient and not subject to congressional consensus—I think that there is a reason to be hopeful and optimistic about solving this climate change problem.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anderson sees this corporate climate awakening as fundamentally social, feeding off of communication. “I think the x variable that we failed to factor in was that there would be this feedback loop of, as more companies get in, and you get more proof points, it’s easier for the next company to get in.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of these shifts in mindsets, technologies and climate mean that much more of the world is now attuned to the reality of climate change. “At least in the business world, we’re past the climate denialism phase,” says Anderson. But as all three founders experienced at one point or another, more understanding can also mean more dread. “Climate doomerism is the feeling that there’s nothing [we can] do. Or the only thing that we can do is some sort of complete systemic change that eradicates existing businesses altogether. This is one of these other challenges—getting really clear data to businesses on the short-term action that you could actually do that will actually move the numbers this year,” says Anderson. “I think if we can just keep getting that message successfully out there, it’ll succeed.”</p>



 



<p>Now that more corporations are awakened to the challenge, the real work can begin. “We have a long way to go, but already more than 527 million tons of CO2 are managed by companies that use Watershed,” says Francis. “So we’ve gotta scale that number up.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>While most people would find the task daunting, Watershed’s founders see more reasons for optimism than ever, in part because of their front-row seat to all of the talent and ingenuity being devoted to averting the climate crisis. “Cement and steel are great examples of industry sectors where historically there has been no low-carbon alternative,” says Anderson. “And we are just now at the threshold of having commercially viable low-carbon options for both.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carbon removal technologies are also making strides. Suh is particularly excited about “biological approaches like growing biomass and turning that into more permanent storage for carbon, or using carbon to produce more permanent polymers that do not degrade over time.” he says. There’s also the development of “direct air capture,” a solution that works by capturing carbon from the air, heating it up to the point of saturation, then storing it all in rock form where it can’t leak back into the atmosphere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Every week at our all-hands, we have this thing called climate corner,” says Itskovich. In recent meetings, the team has learned about which materials in the apparel industry are most emissive (animal-based products like wool), about ways to create lower-carbon cement (reducing the amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement_clinker">clinker</a>) and about pathways to net-zero emissions from aviation (replacing fossil jet fuel with biofuels or synthetic fuels).&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it’s this idea, this regular, communal exposure to climate science, more than anything else the founders have told me, that feels like an answer to my question of why their climate awakenings occurred earlier than most. Crucially, it also reveals an answer of sorts to how we can ensure that others have similar awakenings before it’s too late. For Watershed’s founders, it took seeing the impacts of climate change, but it also took engaging in a meaningful climate dialogue with people they trusted. It’s what Watershed is doing internally, and it’s a conversation they’re continuing to foster in the private sector around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re doing a rafting trip with our executive team in Montana in late September,” Francis shares as we wrap up our conversation, a reminder of the foundational joy that fuels all their urgency and long hours and coding and selling and problem-solving. “It would be the first time we’ve done an outdoors trip with a broader group within the company—but I think it could be very successful,” adds Anderson with a smile. That “could” seems to imply that the trio hasn’t completely ruled out sprint-hiking from the agenda.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Recently, Brave announced the first step of our goal to bring Leo—our privacy-preserving AI assistant in the browser—to Brave mobile with our <a>Android release</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, Brave is happy to announce the completion of this goal, with the release of Leo for iOS. iPhone and iPad users who update to version 1.63 can ask Leo questions, summarize pages and PDFs, translate pages, create content, and more from the browser address bar.</p>
<p>Leo enables natural conversations on a wide range of topics. With AI built right in the browser and several large language models (LLMs) to choose from, Leo makes it easy to interact with AI in a seamless, familiar way.</p>
<p>For the second half of our mobile launch, we’ve added in a special feature available only on iOS. With voice-to-text capability, iOS users can speak their input and have it converted to text without needing to type. This streamlines the interaction and makes conveying information to the AI assistant even easier. Couple this with document integrations and <a>new models like Mixtral</a>, and Leo for iOS becomes a powerful, mobile AI assistant you can take with you wherever you go.</p>

 What can Leo do? 
<p>Leo can handle any number of tasks, both in the context of the webpages you’re viewing and completely separate from this context. Among other things, Leo can:</p>
 
 Create real-time summaries of webpages and PDFs 
 Answer questions about content 
 Get instant answers for queries 
 Generate new long-form written content such as reports, articles, or social media 
 Translate pages, analyze, or rewrite them 
 Write and suggest software code for multiple languages&nbsp; 
 
<p>In addition to these great core use cases, we integrated Leo in the Brave browser app especially with mobile users in mind, including:</p>
 
 Voice-to-text: Use your iOS device’s voice-to-text functionality to speak prompts directly to Leo, converting your spoken words into written text without typing. 
 Docs and PDF summaries: Leo can summarize different types of content files—including PDFs—making it much easier to consume dense content on a small screen. 
 Google Docs integration: You can use Leo to power your mobile productivity with the Google Docs and Google Sheets integration. Brainstorm and assist on writing, create quick summaries, translate, and more. 
 
<p>With Leo on iOS, you can maximize productivity as you move between home, office, and anywhere else you go. All with the same privacy and security guarantees of the Brave browser. With Brave Leo, there’s no login or signup required—you just open your browser and chat.</p>

 Mixtral as the default LLM brings higher quality answers 
<p>Brave Leo gives access to several high-quality large-language models (LLMs), ensuring better, more relevant answers to even niche questions, and fewer of the hallucinations that plague other AI experiences.</p>
<p>Out of the box, Leo includes access to Mixtral 8x7B, Claude Instant, and Llama 2 13B. Mixtral—the default LLM—can interact in multiple languages including English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mixtral 8x7B has quickly gained popularity and usage among the developer community since its December, 2023 release. Mixtral 8x7B currently outperforms ChatGPT 3.5, Claude Instant, Llama 2, and many others, according to the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard">LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard</a>. Mixtral also shows improvements in reducing hallucinations and biases, <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/">according to the BBQ benchmark</a>.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, <a>we recently set Mixtral 8x7B as the default LLM</a> for Leo on desktop, and we’ve seen great feedback. And while Mixtral is the default LLM for iOS as well, users have the option to select from other LLMs, or to upgrade to Leo Premium for higher rate limits.</p>

 Leo Premium&nbsp; 
<p>The Brave Leo experience is free to all users. For those who’d like access to higher rate limits, however, Leo is also available as a Premium experience. Users can subscribe to Leo Premium for <a href="https://account.brave.com/?intent=checkout&amp;product=leo">$14.99/month</a>, and one subscription covers up to 5 different devices across iOS, Android, Linux, macOS, and Windows.</p>

 Smart AI, still private by default 
<p>As with all of Brave’s other features, privacy remains paramount for Brave Leo. Chats with Leo are private and secure. Leo doesn’t record chats, or use them for model training, and no account or login is required to use Leo. These specific privacy protections in Leo include:</p>
 
 Reverse proxy: All requests are proxied through an anonymization server so the request and user cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address. 
 Responses discarded: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded after they’re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers that can be linked to you (such as <a>IP address</a>), and no personal data is retained by Brave-hosted AI models. If you select a model from Anthropic and submit Leo queries, that data will be processed by Anthropic for a period of 30 days, then deleted. See more in our <a>Privacy Policy</a>. 
 No login or account required for access for the free version: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo. 
 Unlinkable subscription: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you use to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience. 
 

 What’s next for Leo, and how to get started 
<p>Brave Leo for iOS is now available to all Brave iOS users who’ve updated to version 1.63. Note that it will be rolled out in phases over the next few days, so users should check back soon if they’re not seeing it today.</p>
<p>Ready to try Brave Leo? It’s easy: Simply open the browser, begin typing in the address bar, and click  “Ask Leo”. For the on page chat experience, iOS users can tap “…” and then tap Leo to get started.</p>
<p>Leo is an opt-in feature and can be disabled at any time. Users can easily disable auto suggestions by going to Settings, tapping Leo and disabling Show autocomplete suggestions in the address bar.</p>

 Nym Explorer release: stake directly using Keplr from your&nbsp;mobile  A long-awaited real easter egg for the Nym community means you can now stake NYM tokens via Keplr on the Nym network&nbsp;explorer <p>With this latest release it is now possible to delegate stake directly from the <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">Nym Explorer</a>. This unlocks a major usability issue for the Nym community: staking via mobile. The release includes an integration of the widely used <a href="https://www.keplr.app/">Keplr wallet</a>. This makes it far easier for anyone in the Cosmos ecosystem to start staking NYM tokens and help secure privacy as a fundamental right in the digital&nbsp;age!</p><p>This development is a direct response to Nym community’s request to make it easier for NYM token holders to delegate stake to mix nodes. Delegating stake is an essential part of the Nym <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/depin-and-nym-a-decentralized-physical-infrastructure-network-for-privacy-e41db833816c">DePin flywheel</a> effect. It is a direct value transfer that rewards people in the Nym community for the added value of collectively ensuring high quality of service through staking rewards. (If this all sounds alien to you, scroll down to learn about NYM staking for beginners).</p> What do you need to&nbsp;know? <p>The <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">Nym Explorer</a> is a window into the Nym privacy mixnet. It allows people to browse all the different nodes that make up this global infrastructure, assess their performance, their reputation, where they are located and more. If you are a NYM token holder, the Explorer is likely one of your essential tools for selecting a mix node, delegate stake and start earning. But you would have had to copy the node’s ID from the explorer and then go to your Nym <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/wallet">desktop wallet</a> to delegate.</p><p>The Explorer release provides two new ways for anyone to stake their native NYM tokens: from their mobile phone using the <a href="https://www.keplr.app/">Keplr</a> application as well as from desktop browsers, using the <a href="https://www.keplr.app/">Keplr</a> browser extension.</p><p>The NYM token is the utility token of the Nym mixnet and was minted on Nyx, a fast-finality Cosmos SDK blockchain. With Keplr wallet being one of the popular wallets in the Cosmos ecosystem, the new release enables the broader Cosmos community to more easily take part in securing the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>1) Holders of native NYM tokens can now stake on mix nodes using the Nym Network Explorer and a Keplr Wallet&nbsp;login.</p><p>2) Delegation is also possible through your mobile device, accessing the Nym Network Explorer (<a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">https://explorer.nymtech.net/</a>) from the Keplr mobile wallet’s integrated browser.</p><p>3) This is just one step towards enabling more seamless staking in Nym. More wallets are lined up for NYM token integration.

And earn rewards for doing so? If you are a beginner, here is how to get started with the Nym token economics. First thing is to join one of the community channels. Here you will have the chance to win NYM tokens by participating in one of the weekly quizzes and contests and get more information on how to get hold of native NYM tokens. Then get the Keplr wallet or Nym desktop wallet to hold your&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Staking means to lock up your tokens with a node in the network (you can unlock whenever you want). You will want to select a high quality node so you can earn good rewards and so that the network continues to perform&nbsp;well.</p>  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/how-to-stake-in-the-nym-mixnet-15a28d687e56">Read this article for a step-by-step staking&nbsp;guide</a>  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/want-to-stake-in-nym-here-is-how-to-choose-a-mix-node-to-delegate-nym-to-c3b862add165">Learn how to select mix node to start&nbsp;staking</a>  <p>You will want to check in on your delegations every once in a while to make sure the nodes you selected are still doing a good job.

You can either create a new wallet or add an existing Nym account to the Keplr wallet using your mnemonic.  Add the Nyx chain to your wallet, by selecting it on <a href="https://chains.keplr.app">https://chains.keplr.app</a>  Send NYMs to your Keplr Nym address that you’ll delegate&nbsp;from.  Navigate to the Nym network explorer: <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">https://explorer.nymtech.net/</a> and click — Connect Wallet &amp; authorize your Keplr to interact with the Nym explorer. Make sure that you have your Nym mainnet selected in&nbsp;Keplr!  Use your criteria to filter the list of nodes (for newcomers: look for higher saturation, lower operating cost / margin&nbsp;nodes).  Hit the delegate button next to your chosen mix node and approve the transaction in your Keplr&nbsp;wallet.  <p>You can access your delegations under the “delegations” tab in the explorer. And remember: staking and un-staking takes up-to an hour, and your rewards auto-compound. You can always check your pending actions under the delegations tab.</p> Stake NYM from your mobile device using&nbsp;Keplr   Download and install the Keplr mobile&nbsp;app.  Set up an account (or import an existing Nym account using your mnemonic password) and navigate with the built-in browser in Keplr to: <a href="https://chains.keplr.app">https://chains.keplr.app</a>, search for Nyx chain and add the&nbsp;chain.

<p>Featured image: <a href="https://r2-collectibles.com/">R2-Rewards.com</a></p>



<p>So you’ve got a nice collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). After a few months, you have managed to amass a respectable amount of those little digital wonders. You might have been able to sell one or two, earning you enough for a couple of cups of coffee in your nearest franchised outlet. But as you take sips off that hard-earned coffee and browse through your NFT portfolio, you can’t help but wonder about the value hidden there, just waiting to be uncovered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The question is, how to unlock the value in those NFTs?&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 NFT staking: definition 



<p>When they hear the word staking, most people think back to the old Hammer films, when the nefarious Dracula would meet his demise with a wooden stake through the heart. And yes, that is one traditional understanding of the word staking.&nbsp;But it’s 2022 now, and though Count Dracula still roams somewhere down the darkest halls of our dreams, staking now means something altogether more profitable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In today’s digital context of NFTs, staking is sort of a game of investment/rewards. You commit (‘lock’) your NFTs into a platform or protocol for a set period, and you receive rewards (or other benefits) in exchange for such a commitment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Staking addresses one NFT’s inherent issue: liquidity. Remember, NFTs are tokenized assets that you can sell, trade, or, as we see in this article, stake for a yield. Staking enables earning passive income off your NFT portfolio while retaining ownership.</p>



<p></p>



 Fungible vs non-fungible: an explanation 



<p>For a long time, the concepts of fungibility and non-fungibility had been well outside the layman’s lexicon. But once NFTs entered public discourse, people began to learn more about what these concepts mean.</p>



<p>In short, fungibility means the possibility of using goods, items, or commodities interchangeably because they have the same value. Banknotes or coins, pieces of the same fruit, or a liter of petrol are good examples of fungibility.</p>



<p>Non-fungibility denotes uniqueness. Collectible items, including original oil paintings, baseball cards, art pieces, diamonds, and vintage cars can be considered non-fungible.</p>



<p>It is the latter concept that emerges as most interesting, as non-fungibility carries value, and it is a value that NFT staking unlocks.</p>

 NFT staking: how it works 



<p>Unlocking the value of your NFTs through staking is easier than you think. All you need is a crypto wallet and, well, NFTs. The more the better. Then, choose a protocol or a platform to stake your NFTs in, and wait for the rewards, which might be distributed daily, weekly, or in any other fashion. It really is that simple.</p>



<p>NFT staking is akin to yield farming, insofar as you lock a certain amount of wealth (NFTs in this case) and receive a certain percentage of rewards based on the amount staked, the period of time that the NFTS will be locked, and other parameters.</p>



<p></p>



 All about staking rewards 



<p>When you invest in traditional financial products (bonds, stocks, mutual funds, etc.), you expect your investment to produce a certain yield. Equally, the ultimate purpose of staking your NFTs is to get a return – a reward.</p>



<p>But this raises several questions: what kind of rewards do you get? And who issues those rewards?</p>



<p>If you purchase an investment bond, your reward at the end of the investment term will usually be money, a certain percentage based on the bond’s performance, length of investment, etc. The staking rewards system works similarly. You lock your stake in for a certain amount of time and you get rewards. Some platforms might offer a fixed amount, while others might give users different amounts, depending on how many people are participating, and the total size of the rewards pool.</p>



<p>And who pays these rewards? Well, the platform or protocol where you stake your NFTs. Normally, an algorithm would calculate the due rewards based on specified parameters, and the rewards would be deposited into your account at the agreed intervals. Now, what these rewards are, depends on the protocol or platform. Sometimes, you get the platform’s native tokens, other times you get tokens that you can exchange for fiat, and certain protocols issue tokens that can only be used within their own environment (a gaming platform, for example). Always check the terms and conditions when you sign up so you know exactly what rewards you will get, and how often.</p>



<p></p>



 Risk versus Reward 



<p>As with most financial endeavors, returns are never guaranteed and are not entirely without risk. If you put up collateral it means you risk losing that. In the case of a staking system, there are often 2 things to keep in mind. First of all, in most staking systems you will need to purchase a staking key to get started. Buying the key can be seen as an entrance fee to the platform and there are often a variety of keys, ranging from cheap and small ones to big and expensive keys. Of course, you hope to earn your investment into the key back but this is never guaranteed.</p>



<p>Another risk is that the staking platform can be hacked and you may lose your NFTs since they’re not in your custody anymore. While the right permissions setup (along with responsible project owners) can drastically reduce this risk, hacks are and will always be a risk for platforms holding considerable amounts of value.</p>



<p></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>NFT staking is a subset of the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. It is a relatively new practice in the space, but there already are several NFT management companies that offer staking services, including Zaisan, which launched a <a href="https://r2-rewards.com/">staking platform in collaboration with R2</a>. While there is an inherent risk to using and creating a staking platform, this risk can be minimised by choosing the right partners and using secure setups.</p>



<p>All in all, staking is just another cool utility of NFTs, which are proving to be rather versatile assets that break new ground almost every day.</p>

<p>Anish Mohammed, Co-Founder, CTO, and Chief Scientist at Panther Protocol, recently joined Meher Roy on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwhBWdn3R5M&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Epicenter Podcast</a>. They discussed Anish’s journey into crypto, the genesis of Panther Protocol, how Panther will preserve the privacy of its users, what’s coming in its Mainnet launch, and its mission to enable privacy and compliance in the DeFi space.&nbsp;</p> Who is Anish Mohammed? <p>Anish Mohammed’s foray into the tech world began at Ericsson, where he developed payment systems and became familiar with cryptography. His two decade-long career in security and cryptography has seen him design and audit several blockchain protocols and advise leading Web3 projects. His previous roles include being the lead security architect at HSBC and Lloyds Banking Group, and he’s held strategic positions at Accenture and Capgemini. Four years ago, Anish and Oliver Gale embarked on a journey to found Panther Protocol, a Zero-Knowledge, cross-protocol layer to safeguard user data and facilitate compliant DeFi access.</p> The need to preserve privacy and enable compliance <p>Panther Protocol addresses a critical gap in current blockchain technologies, where public ledgers like Bitcoin and Ethereum expose all transactions and smart contract interactions. This lack of privacy can disadvantage high-performing investors and significantly impact high-volume traders and corporations, who may want to protect the insights and advantages (or alpha) gleaned from their trading strategies. Unlike many 'dark’ pools and privacy chains, which lack transparency and complicate regulatory compliance, Panther provides DeFi users with access to its privacy-preserving protocol but also enables their transaction history to be disclosed to anyone of their choosing, in part or as a whole, at will, enabling compliance. For example, a user might disclose certain information to a tax authority or a regulator, as required in their jurisdiction. Panther uses Zero-Knowledge proof-enabled KYC checks to ensure malicious actors do not use the protocol.</p> Preserving privacy amid disclosure <p>While Panther Protocol allows users to disclose transactions as needed, Panther takes steps to ensure there is always sufficient overall volume to mask non-disclosed transactions effectively.</p><p>One key component of how this gets done is via network participants who are rewarded for staking their assets to generate additional transactions and increase liquidity pools. In the process, the privacy of non-disclosed transactions is preserved.&nbsp;</p> The importance of Shielded Pools for DeFi's future <p>Shielded Pools are at the heart of Panther Protocol, offering a privacy-centric solution for DeFi transactions. These pools, supported by advanced cryptographic methods like zk-SNARKs, allow users to transact while retaining the option to disclose information for compliance. The Shielded Pool is pivotal for the Protocol, enabling users to interact with DeFi applications privately and securely.</p><p>For a deeper dive into Shielded Pools, including the intricacies of Zones and Zone Managers, visit<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-shielded-pools-the-cornerstone-of-panther-protocol/"> Panther’s blog on </a>Shielded Pools.</p> What’s coming in Panther’s Mainnet beta launch? <p>Anish presented some of the features that Protocol participants can expect to see in the upcoming&nbsp; Mainnet beta product:&nbsp;</p>  zAccount registration. A zAccount is your private identity and entry point to Panther, aligning with KYC protocols and using Zero-Knowledge proofs.  Privacy-staking reward mechanism: Panther incentivizes network participants to enhance the pool’s transaction set and liquidity by staking assets.  Transactions and communication between Zones: exchange of assets and information across different Zones in Panther.  Withdrawals: The action of converting and transferring zAssets back to standard tokens.  Basic disclosures: The user can reveal details about transactions conducted within Panther, allowing for compliance and verification.  Advanced disclosures: Offers users the capability to selectively disclose specific aspects of their transactions, providing flexibility in privacy and compliance.  zAccount renewals: Regular verification and update of a user’s KYC information to ensure ongoing compliance and integrity of their zAccount.  DeFi Swap adapter: A tool that integrates Panther with external DeFi platforms, facilitating private and compliant swaps and other transactions.  zTrade: Zero-Knowledge trades with others in the same Zone.   Conclusion <p>As DeFi continues to evolve, the need for on-chain privacy solutions that accommodate regulatory compliance becomes increasingly critical. Panther Protocol, under the guidance of Co-Founder Anish Mohammed, is at the forefront of addressing this challenge. By pioneering Shielded Pools and facilitating the role of Zone Managers, Panther is setting a new standard for privacy preservation and compliance in DeFi. Panther Protocol’s innovative approach protects users’ data and paves the way for institutional participation in the DeFi ecosystem. As Panther progresses toward its next development phases, the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">call for testers</a> lets you, the community contribute to a more private and compliant DeFi future.&nbsp;</p><p>Join Panther’s journey in shaping a balanced world where privacy meets compliance, empowering users and institutions to navigate the DeFi landscape securely and transparently.</p> About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in Shielded Pools; zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs; and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s Zero-Knowledge primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

<p>Nobody puts Baby in a corner — especially if Baby happens to be fragmented financial services data. Historically, the key to building a successful financial services data company has been to extricate and analyze valuable but difficult-to-access resources like public filings, diligence materials, research reports, conference call notes, and news. Now, with the advent of large language models, such previously shackled information might soon be easily and widely available to everyone, ushering in a new LLM-powered era that could shift the financial services landscape.</p>
<p>That said, the financial services data market is currently dominated by several billion-dollar companies that, given their scale and other advantageous moats, are extremely entrenched. But Bloomberg, Morningstar, and Verisk — three prominent examples — didn’t become market leaders in a vacuum. All initially followed a specific three-step playbook at the dawn of the digital age, whereby they 1) identified large, fragmented pools of data in valuable markets; 2) found a way to bring that data into a relational database; and 3) charged for access to that information. In doing so, each built the beginnings of what are now category-defining businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For new entrants looking to take advantage of the advent of LLMs and disrupt the status quo by going upstream of these incumbents, we’ve done a deep dive into Bloomberg, Morningstar, and Verisk’s stories. Here we’ve pulled out several instructional lessons for startups, as well as posed a few questions about issues that you should be thinking about. Let’s get started:</p>
 Bloomberg  
<p></p>
<p>Michael Bloomberg famously founded Bloomberg L.P. in 1981 after he was fired by Salomon Brothers, where he had been responsible for analytical tools for sales and trading. Having seen the massive amount of paper the investment bank had gone through to update their daily trades and prices, Bloomberg used his <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/michael-bloomberg-getting-fired-fueled-his-billion-dollar/452180">$10 million severance package</a> to build an independent IT solution, initially called Innovative Market Systems, to bring firms that needed it the same type of data and simple analytical tools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to Bloomberg — and its aggregated financial data — entering the scene, firms had to collect data independently, often relying on calculators. By being the first one to accurately and quickly capture this data in a digital format, Bloomberg was able to gather users in a way that allowed his business to add on additional products and features, most important of which became communication.</p>
<p>Though Bloomberg was able to continue building his business by acquiring offline businesses like John Aubert’s Sinkers, which published corporate bond prices in a reference book, the big unlock came when the company took on Merrill Lynch as their first design partner. Not only was this association critical for brand trust and recognition, but by powering Merrill’s growing bond trading operation, Bloomberg was able to acquire real-time data from a market leader. And because this data ended up being better than what all the other platforms had at the time, Bloomberg ended up powering the daily bond prices for the Wall Street Journal, even though Dow Jones, the WSJ’s parent company, provided a competitive product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What Bloomberg realized, and what set it apart from competitors like Datastream (now Refinitiv), was that a data advantage built on information that cannot be cornered won’t last forever. So the company was quick to couple its early lead with additional services, such as news and communication tools. Without the data and distribution that the terminal provided, Bloomberg would never have been able to compete with Dow Jones and Reuters, the two largest incumbents at the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the incredibly rich data feeds, analytical models, and real-time news, the most valuable aspect of Bloomberg is the social aspect. The data and news brought all of the appropriate users onto the terminal and created a network effect lock-in that rivals any other social network.</p>
 Lessons for Startups 
<p>Bloomberg’s initial insight was to corner hard-to-access data and give it to customers in a usable format. To do so, it acquired a legacy offline business and used that to partner with a large player to further its data advantage. Bloomberg’s greatest insight, however, was that beyond continuing to innovate in financial data, its most significant value came from owning workflows and creating network effects driven by its communication tool.&nbsp;</p>
 Questions for startups: 
 
 What data is Bloomberg not capturing properly today?&nbsp; 
 Is there a workflow that isn’t well captured by Bloomberg?&nbsp; 
 Are there groups your product serves that might benefit from a closed network communication center?&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Morningstar   
<p></p>
<p>Morningstar was founded by Joe Mansueto in 1984 after he realized that mutual funds were on the rise but there was no good system to assess the quality of them. The holdings and reporting data needed to accurately assess the quality of mutual funds existed in various prospectuses, shareholder reports, and price histories, but acquiring this data was painful; analysts had to physically write to each fund’s managers to get access to their reports. After Mansueto realized that everyone who wanted to invest in mutual funds&nbsp; — from retail investors to large limited partners (LPs) representing many smaller investors’ capital — had to go through the same process, Morningstar was born.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mansueto’s original idea was realizing that just aggregating all of this data into one, searchable place was a product in itself, and his first product was a book that was marketed in Barron’s and available 4 times a year; eventually, this database became the digital Morningstar product. Over time, Morningstar has leveraged its initial advantage in data aggregation and moved into additional verticals. This has predominantly happened <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/search/acquisitions/field/organizations/num_acquisitions/morningstar">through acquisitions</a>, and Morningstar can immediately increase the value of these businesses as it has an established sales channel and an industry-leading brand.</p>
<p>One early driver of Morningstar’s success was mutual fund LPs insisting that their funds use Morningstar for their analytics and reporting. These LPs needed an easy way to explain to their investors what they were investing in and why, and they knew they could trust Morningstar’s research and data due to the business’ early expertise and reputation. Once LPs started driving this requirement, the industry standardized around it and Morningstar’s brand positioning was cemented.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite not owning any core workflows or collaborative element, Morningstar has a near monopoly on fund characterizations, and it has used the higher profit margins that come from a powerful brand to continue to acquire other businesses that have cornered interesting pools of financial data. Perhaps the most interesting of these acquisitions is Pitchbook, which both has unique data and is a workflow tool that might help Morningstar create a more Bloomberg-like relationship with its customers.&nbsp;</p>
 Lessons for Startups 
<p>Morningstar is another classic example of an early financial services player understanding the value of aggregating challenging-to-access financial data and making it available in real time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is unique about their strategy is how they leveraged LPs to push the industry toward adopting their offerings. At the end of the day, mutual funds serve at the pleasure of LPs. When enough large, institutional LPs push for a certain reporting requirement, it happens and funds standardize, creating a brand moat.</p>
 Questions for startups:&nbsp; 
 
 Is there a tailwind “why now” moment for the data you are capturing to become more valuable?&nbsp; 
 Are there players (customers, regulators) in your industry that want to help drive adoption of your product?&nbsp; 
 Is there whitespace for a brand around what you are offering? 
 
 Verisk   
<p></p>
<p>A non-profit consortium of 7 large property and casualty insurers founded the Insurance Services Office (ISO) in 1971 to be a neutral third party that could help with statistical and actuarial services, insurance programs, and state regulatory requirements. Realizing the significant value in standardizing and aggregating the large swath of insurance ratings bureaus, ISO, now a subsidiary of Verisk, was able to consolidate a massive amount of data. That gave carriers who accessed it greater economies of scale when it came to pricing and underwriting risk, and it was the start of Verisk’s data flywheel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To further solidify and grow its data advantage, ISO expanded beyond ratings bureaus themselves and began standardizing ratings and forms. Modifying ratings schedules was particularly important in hard-to-insure categories like fire risk, where ISO created a single nationwide fire rating schedule that is still used today. At the same time, ISO created a vastly simplified personal lines (home and auto) insurance policy document that made it easier for a policyholder to understand what was covered by a policy. This standardization increased brand awareness and trust, as well as gave Verisk ownership over the data ingestion format.</p>
<p>Outside the obvious financial incentives, the advent of the internet and the ability to share its information online was a main driver behind converting ISO from a non-profit organization to its current for-profit status as Verisk Analytics. In the late 1990s, ISO launched ClaimSearch and combined additional claims datasets with what it already had and became the industry’s largest claims database. In becoming the first provider of online claims and pricing information, ISO continued to acquire more users, and data, further increasing its positioning as the leading provider of insurance data solutions.&nbsp;</p>
 Lessons for Startups 
<p>Verisk is unique as it started as a nonprofit dedicated to helping insurers better understand risk and claims data. At the time, the regulatory environment created the fragmentation of data, and building a new business was the best way to fix that problem. Offering better claims and risk data by creating a powerful give-to-get data exchange model solved the cold start problem of getting data that is valuable to carriers and regulators. In turn, carriers and regulators helped push the industry toward Verisk and cement its scale advantages.</p>
 Questions for startups: 
 
 Are there significant data issues in your space that require industry collaboration but need a neutral third party?&nbsp; 
 Do regulators want to drive substantial change in your industry? How might you position your company to be their instrument to drive forward this change?&nbsp; 
 Is there a way you can drive standardization of fragmented workflows that leads to interesting data exhaust?&nbsp; 
 
 Conclusion   
<p>The rise of dominant market leaders Bloomberg, Morningstar, and Verisk has been characterized by a playbook centered around identifying large, fragmented pools of data and leveraging technology to provide valuable insights and solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These companies have built category-defining businesses by capturing historical data, standardizing it, and offering it to customers in a simplified, accessible format that is enhanced by additional services and features that drive home defensibility. The advent of LLMs heralds a new era in data analytics and financial services. With the potential to unlock previously inaccessible data sources, LLMs may create opportunities for new players to emerge and disrupt the status quo by going upstream of these incumbents.</p>

		 TL;DR&nbsp; 
 
 Horizen’s proof verification chain is live on testnet!&nbsp; 
 Aims to redefine blockchain efficiency with ZK proof verification and settlement layers 
 Marks a significant milestone for web3 as the first instance of a modular proof verification network 
 Future plans include enhancing zkStack compatibility and opening up testnet access to the public 
 
<p>We are excited to announce that Horizen has achieved a major milestone: the deployment of our proof verification chain to testnet.&nbsp; This leap forward signals a new era for the Horizen ecosystem, where we aim to redefine blockchain efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
 Backstory: 
<p>Horizen is pioneering a new layer in the modular blockchain stack focusing on ZK proofs verification and settlement. This focus dramatically reduces costs and improves efficiency for zk rollups and appchains. Following the passing of <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42400-modernizing-horizen-technology-via-a-modular-proof-verification-layer/394">ZenIP 42400</a>, we have been heads down building and leveraging dev tools like Substrate, Polkascan, and other open-source resources to bring our vision to life rapidly. Check out this 10-minute demo to see Horizen’s proof verification chain live in action!</p>     
 

 
					 
			 
									
								 
			
		 
		
			 

 
	     
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why This Matters? 
<p>The launch of this testnet marks a significant point for the broader web3 space as the first instance of a modular proof verification network. The New Horizen network is composed of the following key components:</p>
 
 A Revamped Mainchain: Powered by Substrate, the Horizen mainchain is the foundation for our modular proof verification network. This network allows for the exchange of $ZEN (Horizen’s native token) and verification of FFLONK Proofs produced by Polygon zkEVM instances. 
 Proof Submission Interface: A user-friendly interface that enables zk-rollups to submit proofs seamlessly to the Horizen network for verification. 
 Attestation Mechanism: A protocol published on date to Ethereum and validates proofs (providing additional transparency). 
 New Horizen Smart Contract: The storage and validation mechanism on Ethereum that allows Horizen users to verify that their proof was included in an attestation. 
 Polygon zk-EVM Rollup: A rollup built with Polygon’s CDK that generates and submits proofs to Horizen’s proof verification chain. 
 
 Looking Ahead: 
<p>Celebrating this milestone is just the beginning. Horizen is committed to pioneering advancements in the modular blockchain space, focusing on dramatically reducing costs and improving efficiency for rollups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are already setting our sights on the next development phase, with lots of exciting developments on the horizon!</p>
<p>Here’s what you can expect from us in the coming months:</p>
 
 Enhanced Compatibility with zkStack: We aim to expand the compatibility of New Horizen with zkStack, and further broaden its interoperability and market reach. 
 Opening Up Access to the Public: In the spirit of bringing our community along for feedback, we will open up access for the Horizen community to run testnet nodes and become validators.

  Partnering with Zafran: Put Your Defense on Offense  <p>Sanaz, Ben and Snir are empowering security teams to fight attacks—with the controls, rules and actions they already have.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/doug-leone/">Doug Leone</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bogomil-balkansky/">Bogomil Balkansky</a>	 



Published March 28, 2024
  







 
<p>In the old days of cybersecurity, you could fix every problem and patch every vulnerability. But those days are long gone. AI is accelerating the speed and ability of legitimate developers and bad actors alike, and the number of attacks keeps growing exponentially. Today’s security teams face a never-ending game of whack-a-mole​​—for every threat they mitigate, two more take its place. It’s an asymmetric battle they must keep fighting but can never win.</p>



<p>Part of the challenge is speed: a recent <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2023/02/28/a-shifting-attack-landscape-rapid7s-2022-vulnerability-intelligence-report/">Rapid7 report</a> found most vulnerabilities are exploited within a week, but remediation can take weeks or months—if it’s feasible at all. While a security team may be able to spot a problem and recommend a patch quickly, they’re at the mercy of busy colleagues in Engineering or DevOps to deploy it.</p>



<p>But even if a company had the unlimited resources necessary, patching every one of its thousands or millions of known vulnerabilities simply wouldn’t make sense—because only a fraction of them are actually dangerous. More often, vulnerabilities exist in a function that’s never called by the code, or a server that’s not exposed to the internet. Addressing these non-problems would be a waste of time and money, and it would introduce risk; modifying existing systems is the number one cause of downtime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What security teams really need is a way to identify, and quickly defuse, the vulnerabilities that are truly a threat—and that’s why Sanaz Yashar, Ben Seri and Snir Havdala created <a href="https://www.zafran.io/">Zafran</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through their work in top security companies and Israeli intelligence, Sanaz, Ben and Snir saw firsthand the frustrations security teams were facing. But they recognized what many others did not: most teams already have more than enough security tooling. What they lack, instead, is better information about how to use it. By connecting to both vulnerability data and an organization’s existing controls, rules and actions, Zafran empowers security teams to identify and defuse threats far more quickly.</p>



<p>The platform correlates control configurations with runtime data, internet exposure, and threat intelligence to pinpoint which vulnerabilities are exploitable—but that’s just the first step. Zafran then adjusts existing security controls, working seamlessly with endpoint detection and response, firewalls, cloud tools and more, to proactively reduce risk and defuse vulnerabilities. It puts companies’ defense on offense—and puts the power to stop attacks and defuse threats in the hands of security teams, freeing them and their teammates up to patch only where it’s really needed.</p>



<p>It’s an innovative product—and we at Sequoia are just as excited about the stellar team. Sanaz is a force of nature, and when Bogomil had the pleasure of spending time with her, Ben, Snir and the rest of Zafran recently in Tel Aviv, he found a group of people with deep experience to match their vision. We are proud to support them and lead their Series A.</p>



<p>No doubt there are plenty of challenges still ahead for companies fighting to reduce risks, adapt to evolving threats and gain the upper hand against attackers. But the work the Zafran team is doing is a critical step toward leveling the playing field and setting security teams up to win.</p>

<p>The Zebra team has released an alpha version of the Zebra Launcher, which enables Zebra to be installed and run on common operating systems without a command-line interface (CLI) or any prerequisites other than the operating system itself.</p>



<p>As of <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra-launcher/releases/tag/v0.0.0-alpha.1">Zebra Launcher v0.0.0-alpha.1</a>, there are now installers for Windows, MacOS, and Debian.</p>



<p>The Zebra Launcher bundles the compiled binary from the latest zebrad code on the main branch, as of the March 7th 2024, <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/tree/9b91d4bc0e7a78566e62af8b129c14be82f8d67e">commit</a>, with the latest changes in zcash_script from<a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zcash_script/pull/108"> Restore Windows support with MSVC</a> building on another hack sprint project for restoring Windows support to Zebra. (Thanks Conrado!❣!) It streams Zebra’s logs to a native desktop application window, displays Zebra’s configuration, and allows for updating the configuration from within the app.</p>



<p>Made with a web-based UI and a Rust backend, it uses <a href="https://tauri.app/">Tauri</a> as the application framework for inter-process communication and SolidJS as its UI framework.</p>



<p>SolidJS is a relatively new UI framework with a reactive architecture for managing state and displaying updates that offers a robust developer experience, a minimal memory footprint, and minimal updates to the webview that helps keep the UI quick when it’s displaying lots of data and to keep the project maintainable as it grows.</p>



<p>Using a web-based UI with Tauri and SolidJS allows for embedding other web-based projects, such as Grafana or Zingo-PC, into the Zebra Launcher’s UI, enabling users to access them all in one place.</p>



<p></p>



 What’s Next 



<p>The Zebra Launcher currently includes checks and example data for displaying previews of its appearance in-browser without the Rust backend, and a CI workflow for deploying those previews on every pull request so that it’s easy to review style changes. However, there aren’t any automated tests checking the states in either the TypeScript frontend or the Rust backend, we would need to add these initial tests to help find and fix bugs, and to ensure that bugs aren’t reintroduced as we add features or make changes.</p>



<p>There are also several low-effort, high-impact fixes and improvements on the horizon:</p>



 
 Zebra icons (it currently uses the default Tauri icons) 



 Adding a system-tray menu and keeping the zebrad process running when the Zebra Launcher window is closed. 



 Enabling Tauri’s built-in updater so users are notified when updates are available and so that it’s as easy as possible to download and install those updates. 



 Buttons for starting and stopping zebrad. 



 Bundling external binaries for Prometheus and Grafana, and embedding the Grafana dashboard in the Zebra Launcher UI. 
 



<p></p>



<p>There are other ideas for features that could require more effort and which could be prioritized based on community feedback:</p>



 
 Community page for keeping up with the latest updates across ZCash Discord servers, the Community Forum, and the Zebra Github repository, or to inform us about bugs and development opportunities. 



 Validated form for updating Zebra’s configuration 



 A dashboard page and search bar 



 Progress bars based on Prometheus metrics. 



 Embedded desktop wallet in the Zebra Launcher UI such as Zingo-PC. 
 



<p>We want to provide a delightful user-experience for our community, which is what motivated us to work on this project, and we’re excited about the opportunities for making it better.</p>



<p>Please <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra-app/releases/tag/v0.0.0-alpha.1">try it out by downloading and running the installer for your operating system</a> and let us know what you think! We would also welcome any improvements to the project in the form of issues, discussions, or PRs on the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra-app">zebra-launcher Github repository</a>.</p>

  AI Ascent 2024  <p>Sequoia convened leaders in AI for a day of conversations, talks and demos.</p>   
	By Team Sequoia	 



Published March 26, 2024
  



 
<p>On March 20, we hosted our second AI Ascent event in San Francisco, bringing together 100 leading founders and researchers in AI to discuss what partner Pat Grady calls, “the single greatest value creation opportunity mankind has ever known.” Partner Sonya Huang set the stage for how the promise of Generative AI to revolutionize industries and provide amazing productivity gains is starting to come into focus. And partner Konstantine Buhler looked ahead to how AI will infuse the companies of the future.</p>



<p>Over the course of the day we chatted with AI leaders including Sam Altman of OpenAI, Dylan Field of Figma, Alfred Mensch of Mistral, Daniela Amodei of Anthropic, Andrew Ng of AI Fund, CJ Desai of ServiceNow and (currently) independent researcher Andrej Karpathy. The talks ranged from the merits of large and small models, the rise of reasoning agents, the future of compute and the evolving AI ecosystem.</p>



<p>Below is a selection of highlights from the event (some sessions were off the record):</p>

<p>An enduring promise of new technologies is to find ways to increase human productivity. Software and robotics, for example, have always presented immense potential to automate repetitive mundane tasks that humans perform, freeing them up to do more valuable work. In the last few decades, we’ve made meaningful progress toward this goal, and the first generation of robotic process automation created some massive companies, such as UiPath.</p>
<p>Yet, we never made it past the most simple tasks. Moreover, these automations were helplessly brittle, often requiring a new configuration if any of the underlying tools or steps changed. They weren’t living up to their potential and, as a result, there remains a huge category of repetitive processes that humans still perform manually. We can’t help but think solving the next layer in complexity would create even bigger companies!</p>
<p>Watching advancements in LLMs and AI reasoning unfold over the last few years, we think there is about to be an enormous unlock in what’s possible with automation. There’s a vast subset of currently manual tasks that computers can’t perform because that data is unstructured, or the steps involve just enough ambiguity that human reasoning and judgment is required — for example, determining the correct next step based on how a patient has completed an intake form. It turns out LLMs are especially good at overcoming these hurdles, and they will set new standards for what software is capable of automating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We first met <a href="https://www.tennr.com/">Tennr</a> two years ago, and we believe they’re the right team to tackle this problem. Today, we are excited to announce we’ve led their Series A.</p>
<p>It’s clear that founders Trey Holterman, Diego Baugh, and Tyler Johnson are craftsmen with a vision to redefine the status quo. In 2022, as LLMs took the world by storm, the market was trying to navigate the right way to build solutions on top of the many models becoming available. Trey kept the team focused and spent months obsessing over novel applications of new open source models. Diego designed and built an elegant product to make these applications practical and usable for non-technical teams. Tyler (who was the fastest promotion to engineering director at his previous firm) scaled the systems data pipelines so that training and inference could work at scalable economics for the average business. Together, they turned sophisticated ML research into differentiated, practical applications for non-technical business users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result is a powerful horizontal product called Tennr, which is anchored around understanding unstructured inputs and doing the work that comes after. It can apply AI reasoning and decision-making to perform end-to-end workflows that are much more complex than what legacy solutions can support. Customers in healthcare, financial services, and logistics have been particularly successful using Tennr to perform processes they previously had to do manually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we spoke to Tennr’s customers, it was clear we were observing a true step-function change in how organizations think about their workflows and processes. We’re quick to think of time and cost savings, but the impact is much larger. For example, one customer pointed out that the ability to automate processes around new customer onboarding is a revenue-accelerating outcome because it enables them to serve more customers. Another pointed out that their staff can now focus their time on higher-value work. We were hearing soundbites reflecting the true potential of process automation that actually works: business owners changing assumptions on their business models. As one customer put it, “We are salivating at the opportunities for what this means for our business.”</p>
<p>We’re excited to partner with the entire Tennr team on their journey. Their focus, determination, and grit to advance how software can make humans more productive is unparalleled. We have no doubt they’ll continue to push the boundaries of what’s possible.</p>

<p>It was really fun for me to participate in the last Zebra Hackathon Sprint, a 2-week period to be creative, explore new ideas and build some proof of concept projects.&nbsp;This time I worked on <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/openapi.html">an OpenAPI specification for Zebra RPC methods</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 Zebra OpenAPI Specification 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In order to provide a documentation resource for Zebra RPC methods, an openapi.yaml specification was added to Zebra,<a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/blob/main/openapi.yaml"> located at the root of the project</a>. This file can be pasted into <a href="https://editor.swagger.io/">Swagger Editor</a> to automatically render documentation for Zebra’s RPC methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
Zebra API in Swagger
 &nbsp; 
<p>If you have a zebrad node running at http://localhost:8232 you will be able to send commands to the blockchain and retrieve data. Otherwise, you can still view the documentation for the methods in the Swagger interface. More information can be found at the<a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/openapi.html"> Zebra OpenAPI book page</a>. The OpenAPI proof of concept pull request is available<a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/pull/8342"> here</a>.</p>
<p>If there is interest, this documentation could be hosted somewhere similar to <a href="https://zcash.github.io/rpc/">https://zcash.github.io/rpc/</a>, and be kept up to date with changes and additions to Zebra’s RPC interface. In the meantime, please try it out and let us know what you think!&nbsp;</p>

 Introducing Switch — The Gateway Currency to Switch Between Stablecoins on&nbsp;Verus  Switch is a decentralized currency fully backed by VRSC, DAI, USDC &amp; EURC. Use it to switch between Verus and the different stablecoins. Or hold it while it accrues value from conversion fees.  ⏱️ Switch launch block: 2,984,851 (Saturday 30 March,&nbsp;2024).  ✅ Start preconverting to Switch now for a 7 day period. Read further to learn&nbsp;how.  ❓ <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/usdc">USDC</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/eurc">EURC</a> are stablecoins issued by <a href="http://www.circle.com">Circle</a>. DAI is a USD stablecoin issued by&nbsp;<a href="https://makerdao.com/en/">Maker</a>.  💸 Low-cost, MEV-resistant DeFi conversions with max. fees of&nbsp;0.05%.  ⌨️ Join the <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Verus Discord</a> and type in /basket and then ‘switch’ to see how much is in the reserves, the Switch supply &amp; its protocol&nbsp;prices.  What is&nbsp;Switch? <p>Switch is a decentralized currency on the Verus blockchain. It is fully (100%) backed by its reserves. Its initial supply is 20,000&nbsp;Switch.</p>  Its reserves are weighted as follows: VRSC (16%), DAI DAI.vETH (21%), USDC vUSDC.vETH (21%) &amp; EURC EURC.vETH (42%). What does this mean? E.g. when you put EURC in the reserves you get more Switch after preconversion than when you put VRSC&nbsp;in.  After the preconversion period you can use Switch to convert between any of the reserves for a max. fee of 0.05%. Switch then becomes a MEV-resistant AMM. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/sendcurrency/">Learn more about Verus&nbsp;DeFi.</a>  Switch accrues 50% of the conversion fees — the conversion fees stay in the reserves, increasing the value of&nbsp;Switch.  The other 50% of the conversion fees go to the miners and stakers of&nbsp;Verus.  There is a risk to holding Switch — USDC &amp; EURC are distributed by the centralized company&nbsp;Circle.  After the preconversion period the supply of Switch is dynamic. Switch gets minted when people convert to it from VRSC, DAI, USDC or EURC, and get burned when people convert back to the reserves.    Register subIDs— *.Switch@ for a 10 EURC (in Switch) fee. Those fees get burned. <a href="http://docs.verus.io/verusid">Learn more about subIDs (VerusIDs).</a>  Switch is perfect to use with <a href="https://docs.verus.io/veruspay/">VerusPay</a> — Get your local businesses to take DAI, USDC &amp; EURC on Verus. If you hold VRSC, DAI, or USDC and need to buy coffee in EURC, just scan a QR code! Verus scales to everyone worldwide and auto-converts payments from your favorite currency for always low transaction fees &amp; a 0.05% conversion fee.   What is the preconversion period? <p>The preconversion period is a 7 day period in which users can fund the reserves of Switch with VRSC, DAI DAI.vETH, USDC vUSDC.vETH &amp; EURC EURC.vETH. Depending on how much they added they will get their fair share of the 20,000 Switch after the 7 day&nbsp;period.</p> How to bridge USDC &amp; EURC over to&nbsp;Verus <p>USDC and EURC are ERC-20 token stablecoins issued by Circle. Get them on <a href="http://www.coinbase.com">Coinbase</a> or other exchanges. On the Verus blockchain they are called vUSDC.vETH &amp; EURC.vETH.</p><p>DAI DAI.vETH is readily available on the Verus network. Below are the ERC-20 token contracts for the&nbsp;tokens:</p>  <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48">USDC token&nbsp;contract</a>  <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x1aBaEA1f7C830bD89Acc67eC4af516284b1bC33c">EURC token&nbsp;contract</a>  <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f">DAI token&nbsp;contract</a>  <p>To be able to use those ERC-20 tokens to preconvert into Switch they need to be bridged to the Verus blockchain. The bridging is done through the non-custodial and trustless Verus-Ethereum Bridge. Bridging and preconverting can be done with <a href="https://verus.io/wallet/mobile">Verus Mobile</a>, <a href="https://verus.io/wallet/desktop">Verus Desktop</a> (full node) &amp; MetaMask with <a href="https://eth.verusbridge.io/">the bridge&nbsp;website</a>.</p> Verus Mobile&nbsp;bridging <p>Let’s start by bridging with Verus Mobile. First thing to do is to add the ERC-20s in Verus Mobile. This is how to do&nbsp;it:</p>Adding ERC-20s to Verus&nbsp;Mobile.  Press the plus-button bottom-right corner  Press “Add ERC-20&nbsp;Token”  Select checkmark to “Find using mapped PBaaS currency”, and fill in eurc.veth, vusdc.veth or dai.veth. Then press Continue.  Press OK when a warning screen pops&nbsp;up.  <p>Now you are ready to receive USDC, EURC or DAI (as ERC-20s) on Verus&nbsp;Mobile.</p><p>Before bridging the tokens over to Verus let’s add the currencies on the Verus blockchain to the&nbsp;wallet:</p>Adding the currencies on the Verus blockchain on Verus&nbsp;Mobile.  Press the plus-button bottom-right corner.  Press “Add PBaaS currency”.  Fill in eurc.veth, vusdc.veth or dai.veth and press continue.  Press “ADD”.  <p>Now we are ready to bridge the ERC-20s over to the Verus blockchain.</p>Bridging EURC to Verus. It will come out as EURC.vETH.  Select the ERC-20 you want to bridge. (In the example we use&nbsp;EURC).  Press “Send” and then “Convert or cross-chain”.  Press “Send off-chain”.  As the recipient address fill in a Verus address you own (R- or i-address, or VerusID).  Fill in the amount you want to bridge&nbsp;over.  Then as “Select network to send to” choose&nbsp;Verus  Then as “Select currency to receive as” choose EURC.vETH  <p>That’s it. It can take up to 90 minutes before the ERC-20 arrives as a currency on&nbsp;Verus.</p> Verus Mobile preconverting <p>Choose any of the currencies you want to preconvert: VRSC, DAI.vETH, vUSDC.vETH or EURC.vETH.</p>Preconverting the reserves to&nbsp;Switch.  Press Verus, DAI.vETH, vUSDC.vETH or EURC.vETH  Press “Send” and then “Convert or cross-chain”.  Press “Preconvert”.  As the recipient address fill in a Verus address you own (R- or i-address, or VerusID).  Fill in the amount you want to preconvert.  Then as “Select currency to preconvert to” choose&nbsp;Switch.  The network to send to is&nbsp;Verus.  Now press “Send” and confirm, and that’s it! You have now added a currency into the reserves of Switch and have to wait until Switch is out of the preconversion period.  To show Switch in your wallet after it has been distributed by the protocol do the following: press the “plus”-button, “Add PBaaS Currency”, fill in “Switch”.   Bridging with&nbsp;MetaMask <p>Let’s bridge with MetaMask and the <a href="https://eth.verusbridge.io/">Verus-Ethereum Bridge&nbsp;website</a>:</p>Bridging with MetaMask to a Verus-address, EURC used as&nbsp;example.  Connect MetaMask with this website: <a href="https://eth.verusbridge.io/">https://eth.verusbridge.io/</a>  Address: where you want the DAI, USDC or EURC to end up on the Verus blockchain (as DAI.vETH, vUSDC.vETH or EURC.vETH)  Select token: [Euro Coin] as EURC.vETH, [0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48] as vUSDC.vETH or&nbsp;DAI.vETH  Destination: select the same&nbsp;… on&nbsp;VRSC  Choose the amount you want to bridge&nbsp;over  It may take up to 90 minutes before the funds arrive on&nbsp;Verus   Preconverting with Verus&nbsp;Desktop <p>If you bridged currencies into your wallet on Verus Desktop don’t forget to add DAI.vETH, vUSDC.vETH or EURC.vETH in the “Multiverse”-tab!</p><p>On Verus Desktop click the “Convert Currencies”-button and then go to the “Advanced”-tab.</p>  Choose amount to&nbsp;send.  “From Currency”: fill in VRSC, DAI.vETH, vUSDC.vETH or EURC.vETH  “To Currency”: fill in&nbsp;Switch  “Destination Address”: fill in a R-/i-address or VerusID where you want to receive&nbsp;Switch  Check the box: “Send as pre-convert”  “Refund Address”: Sometimes a currency has a minimum or maximum amount to preconvert before it launches. For example, when the minimum preconversion amount is not met, and thus the currency not launched, you will receive your funds back. In this case there isn’t a minimum or maximum but you still need to fill it in. Can be the same as your Destination Address.  Now click “Convert Currencies”, and that’s it! You have now added a currency into the reserves of Switch and have to wait until Switch is out of the preconversion period.

<p>Effectively monetizing any new technology is a race to capture market share while still giving yourself room to grow your business. But the stakes are much higher with generative AI: though it promises to deliver unprecedented value to businesses, it can also be very expensive to serve to each incremental customer. At the growth stages in particular, founders need to be mindful of their unit economics and margins. We often hear these founders ask: how can I capture the value created by genAI? Should I eat the cost of my genAI features, or pass it along to customers? Will my customers actually be willing to pay for genAI and if so, how much?</p>
<p>We’re in the very early days of genAI and until adoption curves and costs stabilize, there won’t be any tried-and-true pricing or packaging frameworks. That said, we’ve outlined how we’re thinking about pricing and packaging in a part of the market that’s debating how to monetize their new genAI feature—B2B SaaS and prosumer companies—and how we’re seeing other companies approach the same question so you can better understand where your strategy fits in today.&nbsp;</p>
  Triangulate early usage, customer personas, and product mission 
<p>As with any pricing and packaging exercise, the best place to start is to understand:</p>
 
 How much value your feature delivers and to whom, and&nbsp; 
 How much serving that feature costs 
 
<p>Then, square those findings with how core you think genAI will be to your overall product offering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of this will be more art than science, since founders are still figuring out what value genAI delivers to customers and how much it costs. That said, your early usage and customer personas can give you insight into both of these vectors.&nbsp;</p>
 Beta and early usage 
<p>For beta and early usage, you want to understand which customers are using your product, how often, how much it costs you to serve them, and how much they’re willing to pay for a genAI feature. For instance, it’s important to dig into the following:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Does it increase your TAM? (e.g., were you previously serving 10 customers and can now serve 100?) 
 Does your genAI feature increase conversion from a free to a paid tier, or a higher paid tier?&nbsp; 
 Does your product have a base of power users who account for the majority of the feature’s use? If so, how are they impacting your COGS?&nbsp; 
 
 Customer personas 
<p>For customer personas, you want to figure out which personas are willing to pay and which aren’t. Do all your customers realize value from the genAI feature, or just some?&nbsp;</p>
<p>A good way to learn more about your customer personas and segments is through interviews, surveys, and sales team data.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Interviews. If you have a small number of customers, interviewing them can give you a better signal into who’s interested in buying your product and what products they might be interested in in the future.&nbsp; 
 Surveys. If you have a larger number, you can survey them about what potential new features are most important to them, then tie that information back to their company industry or function.&nbsp; 
 Sales team data. Your sales team talks to customers day in and day out, which means they usually have a great read on what features different types of customers need in order to be successful with your product.&nbsp; 
 
<p>One note here: be wary of “AI tourists”—or customers who sign up for your product because they either have a company-wide mandate to experiment with genAI (B2B) or because they’re excited to try a new genAI feature themselves (prosumer). These users can be difficult to retain, even in cases where they’re willing to pay to try your product. (That said, we are seeing more enterprise companies <a href="https://a16z.com/generative-ai-enterprise-2024/">reallocate genAI spend from innovation lines to standard software lines</a>, which indicates that genAI is evolving into a key part of many enterprises.)</p>
 Product vision 
<p>This is where your vision as a founder comes in. Maybe only a subset of your customers are excited about generative AI right now, but you believe that generative AI will eventually reshape the customer experience of your product and present a much richer value prop. Or maybe you’re still determining how generative AI will benefit your customers, and right now it’s a nice-to-have for certain users. This part of the exercise is qualitative and vision-oriented, and it’s up to you to decide how central genAI will be to your product roadmap and value prop going forward.</p>
<p>Once you have both a good sense of the value and cost of your genAI feature, and a working hypothesis for how generative AI figures into your current product offering and future roadmap, you can start thinking about packaging and pricing concretely.&nbsp;</p>
  Packaging: core, upgrade, or add-on? 
<p>We generally see B2B and prosumer genAI features fall into 3 buckets: as a core offering, as part of an upgrade tier, or as an add-on. Many of the best practices for packaging non-genAI prosumer and B2B SaaS still apply in the genAI era at this point, so it can also be helpful to reference how companies have packaged their new non-genAI features in the past.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Emerging-best-practices-for-packaging-your-B2B-or-prosumer-AI-feature-scaled.jpg"></a></p>
 Core 
<p>If all your customers are excited and willing to pay for your genAI feature, early usage data shows that it significantly increases adoption and conversion, and genAI is mission-critical to your value prop, it can be smart to include it as part of your core offering. In this case, you might not need to directly monetize your genAI feature because it has significant downstream effects on your TAM and conversion. The example we cited earlier applies here: maybe you could serve 10 customers with your existing product and now you can serve 100 thanks to your genAI feature.</p>
<p>Since we’re in the “land grab” phase of generative AI adoption, including your generative AI feature in your core offering can also make your product more appealing than offerings from incumbents and other startups. Because there’s demand for this feature across all segments, however, we imagine that some companies will eventually increase the total price of their core package to better account for the cost of serving the feature.</p>
 Upgrade 
<p>Packaging your genAI feature as an upgrade works when it’s a nice-to-have feature that can act as an upsell lever for the majority of your customers. The feature doesn’t radically change the way customers use your product, but it can help most of them unlock more value. Some genAI companies might offer more data sets in an upgrade feature, for instance. Or take Mailchimp as an example. Most of their users might not need a genAI feature in the core offering—they likely just want to be able to build and serve an email list—but genAI-generated email copy, segmentation, and analytics could enhance most users’ experience of the product. We’ve also seen some companies use their genAI feature as an upsell lever to increase conversion to a higher pricing tier or cover part of the cost of serving genAI.</p>
 Add-on 
<p>Packaging a genAI feature as an add-on is wise if your genAI feature delivers significant value to a small set of customers willing to pay a premium and you want to directly manage your margins when serving the feature. Packaging as an add-on can:</p>
 
 Monetize your innovation directly, which leads to more sustainable margins over the short term. (If you believe AI will become a core differentiating factor for your product over the long term, however, you may need to transition to a different packaging model.)&nbsp; 
 Increase your TAM: you can charge more for the customers who are willing to pay more while also maintaining customers at your existing price point.&nbsp; 
 Offer a way to beta test your feature with an audience that’s excited about the product and willing to give feedback on it.&nbsp; 
 
<p>We think of the add-on as the “power user package”—companies can charge a premium for their products because a set of power users will disproportionately benefit from that feature. That said, we have seen some other companies who package their add-on genAI features sell the add-on to the entire company when doing enterprise deals to prevent users from sharing logins, even if only a few individual users want it. This might cover costs in the short-term, but be aware that buyers might not always want to buy software packages with this mandate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One note: we’ve seen some companies include basic genAI features in a core or lower-paid tier and gate better-performing genAI features or more genAI usage in a higher tier. In these cases, the logic of segmenting for value remains the same. If a genAI feature can expand the number of users you can serve, for instance, consider offering it as a core feature. If your other, more high-powered genAI feature enables your power users, you could gate that feature and charge more for it.&nbsp;</p>
  Pricing: subscription or hybrid?&nbsp; 
<p>Because most B2B SaaS and prosumer companies sell <a href="https://a16z.com/usage-based-pricing-rule-of-thumb/">software-to-human</a> products, it makes sense to monetize through subscriptions instead of usage—no customer wants to estimate “how much” genAI they’ll use. But subscription pricing in the genAI era can exaggerate the gap between how much your customers use your product and how much revenue you actually bring in. In fact, selling seats for your genAI feature can actually put you in the position of hoping your customers don’t use your products. Power users pay the same flat fee as customers who barely use your product, which means your most important customers can eat into your margins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how can you better align your incentives with your customers’? Because we’re still in the early phase of genAI adoption, it remains an open question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we take a look at the current landscape, however, we see core and upgrade packaging priced by seat by default. GenAI is either part of a base product or an added feature in an existing subscription tier. That said, some companies are experimenting with hybrid subscription–consumption models when pricing their add-on features in order to better cover costs and monetize power users. These hybrid approaches include credit drawdown approaches (like Box) or flat-rate seats with credits for incremental levels of consumption (like Adobe Creative Cloud). (When adding a usage-based element to an existing subscription motion, consider how to <a href="https://a16z.com/customers-want-predictability-in-usage-based-pricing-heres-how-to-help-them-get-it/">provide predictability to customers</a> and <a href="https://a16z.com/overages-problem-usage-based-pricing/">handle overconsumption</a>.)</p>
  What are others doing? 
<p>We examined 31 companies with new genAI offerings to see how they’re pricing and packaging their new genAI feature. Here’s what we see in the data.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AI-packaged-as-core-offering-scaled.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AI-packaged-for-upgrade-scaled.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AI-packaged-as-add-on-scaled.jpg"></a></p>
  How will genAI pricing and packaging evolve?&nbsp; 
 Outcome-based pricing and other pricing metrics gain traction. 
<p>As genAI starts to offer customers significant productivity gains, some companies are thinking ahead to implementing outcome-based pricing, in which vendors charge companies for the outcomes of their software instead of for the software itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outcome-based pricing is harder to get right today, since founders are still figuring out how to quantify the value genAI provides their customers. But if genAI features make companies significantly more productive down the road, it won’t make economic sense to price your offerings on a contracting user base. So we see outcome-based pricing having a potentially significant impact on companies selling a <a href="https://a16z.com/usage-based-pricing-rule-of-thumb/">software-to-human product</a>, like a workflow or human resources tool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The advantage of this pricing model is getting tightly aligned with your customers’ incentives, but making sure you and your customers agree on what defines an “outcome” or “resolution” can be difficult and you’d need to trust that genAI could reliably resolve your customers’ questions. That said, we’re already seeing some companies experiment with this, like Intercom’s <a href="https://www.intercom.com/drlp/ai-chatbot?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=sem&amp;utm_campaign=20844616027&amp;utm_term=intercom%20fin&amp;utm_ad_collection=156467453916&amp;_bt=683673764875&amp;_bg=156467453916&amp;utm_ad=683673764875&amp;offer=sb-growth-trial&amp;utm_campaign_name=go_b_pm_acq_core_demo_kw-e_pros_autom_alls_alld_namer_us_en&amp;utm_ad_collection_name=us_automation_fin&amp;utm_ad_name=sb-growth-trial_rsa_24q1&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA8YyuBhBSEiwA5R3-E-b6fL-jfvUUBqi4UwsiquAD_G7GTRUnEypKcAHyA9uK6ZfM1XgcKhoC8nQQAvD_BwE">Fin Chat</a> product, and we’re excited to see how this evolves.&nbsp;</p>
 Prepare to be nimble with your pricing. 
<p>The cost of inference is stabilizing, open source is booming, and different model providers are constantly driving down the price of their models in a bid to attract more users. Given this, companies should be ready to adapt their pricing models as model providers continue to lower the cost of APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For now, it’s probably wise to price at a level that’s at least somewhat economical for your business in the short term while expecting the cost to service to decline over the long term (as it already has!) and drive future margin expansion. That said, if you’re banking on your genAI feature to become a core part of your business and you’re not seeing results soon, don’t hesitate to revisit your pricing and packaging structure.</p>
<p>Generative AI stands to deliver an unprecedented amount of value to software end users, and the goal for growth-stage founders now is to figure out how to best capture that value while maintaining stable unit economics and solid margins. With no one-size-fits-all solution, successful founders will have to take past and real-time learnings to build a clear, nimble pricing and packaging structure that communicates the value of their product roadmap.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though best practices are still emerging, we hope these frameworks help you better navigate the pricing and packaging process for your new genAI feature.</p>

 Formed after Shipyard in 2023, the squad combined Nym with Brave to create a totally private, open source search&nbsp;engine <p>When the incentivized <a href="https://nymtech.net/learn/shipyard">Nym Shipyard privacy academy</a> wrapped up in late 2023, the top graduates formed into <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/introducing-nym-squads-e2972f70a778">squads</a>. These are autonomous groups based on camaraderie and a shared enthusiasm for building the private internet of the future. They aim to make this possible through open source development, networking, and grassroots action.</p><p>Here we are kicking off a series of squad spotlights. In the coming weeks, we will present the work of these makers and visionaries in the Nym community. Stay tuned to read about their fascinating projects and community initiatives worldwide.</p><p>The first to be profiled is <a href="http://tupinymquim.com/">Tupinymquim</a>. The squad’s name nods to the Tupiniquim indigenous peoples from pre-colonization Brazil. Today the term has come to refer to the “Brazilian” national identity.</p><p>Tupinymquim have already built an incredible poc integration of <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a> on the Nym mixnet. Let’s take a closer&nbsp;look.</p> State of privacy in&nbsp;Brazil <p>In Brazil, almost a quarter of the population has no internet access. And many of those who do are not fluent in English. This poses a problem since privacy debates and awareness are most mature in English-speaking communities. There is thus a lack of awareness of privacy violations in a country as vast as Brazil. Raising awareness is crucial in light of the corporate or <a href="https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/geral/noticia/2023-10/governo-demite-servidores-da-abin-por-irregularidades-administrativas">state surveillance</a> of <a href="https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/geral/noticia/2023-10/governo-demite-servidores-da-abin-por-irregularidades-administrativas">activists</a> and <a href="https://www.conectas.org/en/litigiopt/the-bolsonaro-governments-investment-in-digital-surveillance/">other gross intrusions</a> into peoples’ digital lives across the&nbsp;globe.</p><p>Brazil responded strongly to Edward Snowden’s 2013 revelations of the NSA’s mass surveillance of the internet. Thanks in part to Brazil’s work, we saw <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Privacy/SR/Pages/SRPrivacyIndex.aspx">the creation of a special rapporteur on privacy at the UN</a>. The country also has specific protections for digital privacy in its constitution. Nonetheless, mass surveillance continues to be an issue. Privacy International <a href="https://privacyinternational.org/state-privacy/42/state-privacy-brazil">notes</a> that government agencies have invested heavily in drones and facial recognition systems. The federal police have also made contracts with malware providers, using official court warrants to spy on&nbsp;people.</p><p>“Considering Brazil enjoys a certain democratic status, the debate on privacy is more linked to the corporate than the political scene, even if there is state surveillance in the country,” Supermeia of Tupinymquim says. “One of the biggest difficulties in the privacy debate is the very awareness of the problem.”</p><p>Part of this problem, as Supermeia notes, is a “dizzying and worrying increase” in <a href="https://g1.globo.com/tecnologia/noticia/2022/01/12/brasileiros-sao-os-que-passam-mais-tempo-por-dia-no-celular-diz-levantamento.ghtml">smartphone addiction</a>. This is influenced by “content profiling and data surveillance.” Afterall, surveillance capitalism everywhere wants to keep us locked to our screens in order to squeeze profits from us. And, of course, there are the usual issues of data leakage and breaches. Let’s recall the <a href="https://g1.globo.com/economia/tecnologia/noticia/2020/12/02/nova-falha-do-ministerio-da-saude-expoe-dados-de-243-milhoes-de-brasileiros-na-internet-diz-jornal.ghtml">images of peoples’ faces</a> that no doubt will be sold on the dark web to fuel criminal deepfakes and identity&nbsp;theft.</p><p>It’s for all these reasons that the seven tech professionals that make up Tupinymquim — Supermeia, Vitorsantanna, Itsmevitinn, Izacabral, Psydenst, and Pedroarnaldo — formed their squad. Most were first introduced to Nym at Web Summit Rio, where Nym COO Alexis Roussel and CSO Jaya Klara Brekke presented the project. And they were quickly sold on the Nym vision of privacy for all of humanity.</p> How Tupinymquim created a mixnet-protected search <p>The Nym mixnet is an essential tool for real privacy protection. To put it shortly, the mixnet scrambles your communications and shuffles traffic in its inner-three nodes. This protects the content of your message as well as your metadata and traffic patterns.</p><p>This is essential because every single online application or service bleeds metadata. Adversaries can exploit this to dox and profile you even when you’re trying to stay&nbsp;private.</p><p>By safeguarding your metadata, the Nym mixnet essentially solves a huge privacy problem on the internet. No other available privacy-enhancing tool offers&nbsp;this.</p><p>The Nym mixnet is a layer-0 privacy infrastructure so it’s basically plug and play. Importantly, Nym can privacy-enhance any existing technology, network, or digital infrastructure. This is thanks to ongoing work in the <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs">SDKs</a> and new tools like mixFetch, a replacement for the Fetch API that retrieves information privately via the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Tupinymquim has proved it with <a href="https://github.com/TupiNymQuim/Incognito?tab=readme-ov-file">Incognito</a>, their anonymous search tool that uses the <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a> API for search via Nym’s decentralized mixnet.</p><p>“Our search tool preserves the confidentiality of metadata by ensuring that each application fetch occurs across a distributed network, further reinforcing user privacy,” the squad&nbsp;says.</p><p>Essentially, the Incognito search uses <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/mixfetch-like-the-fetch-api-but-via-the-mixnet-82acfd435c62">mixFetch</a> magic to anonymize your search. Here’s how it&nbsp;works:</p><p>Check out the completely open source <a href="https://github.com/TupiNymQuim/Incognito?tab=readme-ov-file">Incognito private search on GitHub</a> and try it for yourself!</p><p>Since forming, Tupinymquim have also created six new nodes for the delegation programme. Their automated <a href="https://github.com/TupiNymQuim/NodesBot">NodesBot tool</a> helps operators check node score and performance quickly via Discord and Telegram. Plus they’re putting together translations, guides, and tutorials for operators and developers to work more efficiently with the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Next, the squad wants to further refine Incognito, including adding an image search to the tool. They also want to hold more events like privacy workshops to educate their communities on the importance of privacy and how to achieve it with&nbsp;Nym.</p><p>“Nym is still mostly unknown in Brazil,” Supermeia said. “But from the workshops we’ve conducted, which are mainly aimed at developers, we noticed the community was very interested in combating corporate and political surveillance.”</p><p>“However, in our view, Brazil is still in a moment of awareness about the issue of surveillance. Privacy is still a topic that does not circulate frequently in the public debate, making the production of curated content essential.”</p><p>Thankfully, Tupinymquim are on the&nbsp;case.</p><p>Follow Tupinymquim on <a href="https://twitter.com/tupinymquim">X</a>, <a href="https://t.me/+jO97cIbMEbowZWRh">Telegram</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/TupiNymQuim">github</a>!</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-squad-spotlight-tupinymquim-bringing-privacy-to-brazil-93a64d188d76">Nym Squad spotlight: Tupinymquim, bringing privacy to Brazil</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Partnering with nsave: Trusted Accounts, For Everyone  <p>Amer, Abdallah and their team are bringing safe, stable offshore accounts to the people who need them most.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/george-robson/">George Robson</a>	 



Published March 22, 2024
  







 
<p>In places like the U.S. and Europe, most of us take for granted the institutions that keep our financial systems functioning. From the central banks that issue currency and set monetary policy, to the regulations that ensure we can go to an ATM and withdraw what we’ve deposited—there are countless moving parts operating behind the scenes. And together, they form the bedrock of not just how we store our money, but how we build businesses, how we borrow and how we invest in growth.</p>



<p>In countries with distressed economies, though, life is markedly different. People work hard to save and build security for their future—but dysfunctional banking systems prevent them from preserving that wealth. Most families can’t access basic services such as loans and insurance, and decades of economic and political instability have driven deep distrust in the few options that do exist. With monthly withdrawals capped as low as $400, some depositors have resorted to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/14/world/lebanon-bank-heist-access-money-frozen-savings-intl-hnk/index.html">holding up banks</a> for their own money. And inflation ranges from 20% to 200% and higher—enough to rapidly erode your life savings, if not completely wipe it out.</p>



<p>In theory, the relative stability of currencies such as USD, Euros and GBP offer an escape from these runaway devaluations. But here again, access is severely limited. For the wealthy—those who can afford a million-dollar minimum deposit—such funds can be held in an offshore account. Everyone else must keep their savings either in local banks, where they’re subject to strict limits on foreign currency holdings; with relatives overseas; or literally under their mattress.</p>



<p>But now, everyday people have the same secure, stable options once reserved for the wealthy few, thanks to <a href="https://www.nsave.com/">nsave</a>.</p>



<p>Led by co-founders Amer Baroudi and Abdallah AbuHashem—two Rhodes scholars who know firsthand what it’s like to grow up in a struggling economy—the team at nsave believes everyone deserves a trusted way to store their money. Under Switzerland’s updated regulations for digital financial services, they’ve designed an inclusive verification platform that takes “know your customer” technology beyond traditional data like postal codes that don’t apply to everyone. Customers can continue to live, work and spend in their local communities, with local currency, while their funds stay safe and protected in USD, Euros or GBP. It’s a secure offshore account that everyone can afford.</p>



<p>Long before they met at Oxford, nsave’s co-founders lived through the very problems they’re now solving for their customers. Before becoming a Rhodes scholar and founding multiple companies, Amer watched his father lose his life savings to rampant inflation as their family fled conflict in Syria. Abdallah, meanwhile, made his way from Gaza to a master’s in CS at Stanford on his way to Oxford. Together, they have the perfect complementary skill sets to grow their business, and they share a burning intensity about the problem they’re solving. For Amer and Abdallah, nsave is about much more than making money. It’s a calling to create a financial system that works for everyday people.</p>



<p>We were grateful for the opportunity to lead their seed round last year and welcome them to <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/arc/">Arc</a>, Sequoia’s catalyst for pre-seed and seed-stage founders, and our conviction has only deepened as we’ve gotten to know the team. To build a product compliant with strict financial regulations is no easy task, not to mention building partnerships with banks. Yet nsave has done just that, and we are eager to see more users reap the benefits now that the app has gone live.</p>



<p>But as impressed as we are by nsave’s current offerings—including hard currency accounts, payments, fraud protection and international transfers—they aren’t stopping here. The team’s long-term roadmap includes a full suite of financial services, with the goal of further improving financial resilience and equality for people in struggling economies. Amer, Abdallah and their team are building something that could ultimately give hundreds of millions of people a new sense of control over the savings—and the future—they’ve worked so hard to build.</p>

<p>Generative AI took the consumer landscape by storm in 2023, reaching over a billion dollars of consumer spend1 in record time. In 2024, we believe the revenue opportunity will be multiples larger in the enterprise.</p>
<p>Last year, while consumers spent hours chatting with new <a href="https://character.ai/">AI companions</a> or making images and videos with diffusion models, most enterprise engagement with genAI seemed limited to a handful of obvious use cases and shipping “GPT-wrapper” products as new SKUs. Some naysayers doubted that genAI could scale into the enterprise at all. Aren’t we stuck with the same 3 use cases? Can these startups actually make any money? Isn’t this all hype?</p>
<p>Over the past couple months, we’ve spoken with dozens of Fortune 500 and top enterprise leaders,2 and surveyed 70 more, to understand how they’re using, buying, and budgeting for generative AI. We were shocked by how significantly the resourcing and attitudes toward genAI had changed over the last 6 months. Though these leaders still have some reservations about deploying generative AI, they’re also nearly tripling their budgets, expanding the number of use cases that are deployed on smaller open-source models, and transitioning more workloads from early experimentation into production.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a massive opportunity for founders. We believe that AI startups who 1) build for enterprises’ AI-centric strategic initiatives while anticipating their pain points, and 2) move from a services-heavy approach to building scalable products will capture this new wave of investment and carve out significant market share.</p>
<p>As always, building and selling any product for the enterprise requires a deep understanding of customers’ budgets, concerns, and roadmaps. To clue founders into how enterprise leaders are making decisions about deploying generative AI—and to give AI executives a handle on how other leaders in the space are approaching the same problems they have—we’ve outlined 16 top-of-mind considerations about resourcing, models, and use cases from our recent conversations with those leaders below.</p>
  Resourcing: budgets are growing dramatically and here to stay 
 1. Budgets for generative AI are skyrocketing.<br>
 
<p>In 2023, the average spend across foundation model APIs, self-hosting, and fine-tuning models was $7M across the dozens of companies we spoke to. Moreover, nearly every single enterprise we spoke with saw promising early results of genAI experiments and planned to increase their spend anywhere from 2x to 5x in 2024 to support deploying more workloads to production.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Average-enterprise-spend-on-LLMs-actual-and-anticipated-scaled.jpg"></a></p>
 2. Leaders are starting to reallocate AI investments to recurring software budget lines. 
<p>Last year, much of enterprise genAI spend unsurprisingly came from “innovation” budgets and other typically one-time pools of funding. In 2024, however, many leaders are reallocating that spend to more permanent software line items; fewer than a quarter reported that genAI spend will come from innovation budgets this year. On a much smaller scale, we’ve also started to see some leaders deploying their genAI budget against headcount savings, particularly in customer service. We see this as a harbinger of significantly higher future spend on genAI if the trend continues. One company cited saving ~$6 for each call served by their LLM-powered customer service—for a total of ~90% cost savings—as a reason to increase their investment in genAI eightfold. <br>
<br>
Here’s the overall breakdown of how orgs are allocating their LLM spend:</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Budget-allocation-scaled.jpg"></a></p>
 3. Measuring ROI is still an art and a science. 
<p>Enterprise leaders are currently mostly measuring ROI by increased productivity generated by AI. While they are relying on NPS and customer satisfaction as good proxy metrics, they’re also looking for more tangible ways to measure returns, such as revenue generation, savings, efficiency, and accuracy gains, depending on their use case. In the near term, leaders are still rolling out this tech and figuring out the best metrics to use to quantify returns, but over the next 2 to 3 years ROI will be increasingly important. While leaders are figuring out the answer to this question, many are taking it on faith when their employees say they’re making better use of their time.</p>

 4. Implementing and scaling generative AI requires the right technical talent, which currently isn’t in-house for many enterprises.  
<p>Simply having an API to a model provider isn’t enough to build and deploy generative AI solutions at scale. It takes highly specialized talent to implement, maintain, and scale the requisite computing infrastructure. Implementation alone accounted for one of the biggest areas of AI spend in 2023 and was, in some cases, the largest. One executive mentioned that “LLMs are probably a quarter of the cost of building use cases,” with development costs accounting for the majority of the budget. <br>
<br>
In order to help enterprises get up and running on their models, foundation model providers offered and are still providing professional services, typically related to custom model development. We estimate that this made up a sizable portion of revenue for these companies in 2023 and, in addition to performance, is one of the key reasons enterprises selected certain model providers. Because it’s so difficult to get the right genAI talent in the enterprise, startups who offer tooling to make it easier to bring genAI development in house will likely see faster adoption.&nbsp;</p>
  Models: enterprises are trending toward a multi-model, open source world 
 5. A multi-model future.  
<p>Just over 6 months ago, the vast majority of enterprises were experimenting with 1 model (usually OpenAI’s) or 2 at most. When we talked to enterprise leaders today, they’re are all testing—and in some cases, even using in production—multiple models, which allows them to 1) tailor to use cases based on performance, size, and cost, 2) avoid lock-in, and 3) quickly tap into advancements in a rapidly moving field. This third point was especially important to leaders, since the model leaderboard is dynamic and companies are excited to incorporate both current state-of-the-art models and open-source models to get the best results.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Number-of-model-providers-pushed-to-use-cases-scaled.jpg"></a>We’ll likely see even more models proliferate. In the table below drawn from survey data, enterprise leaders reported a number of models in testing, which is a leading indicator of the models that will be used to push workloads to production. For production use cases, OpenAI still has dominant market share, as expected.</p>
<p></p>
 6. Open source is booming.  
<p>This is one of the most surprising changes in the landscape over the past 6 months. We estimate the market share in 2023 was 80%–90% closed source, with the majority of share going to OpenAI. However, 46% of survey respondents mentioned that they prefer or strongly prefer open source models going into 2024. In interviews, nearly 60% of AI leaders noted that they were interested in increasing open source usage or switching when fine-tuned open source models roughly matched performance of closed-source models. In 2024 and onwards, then, enterprises expect a significant shift of usage towards open source, with some expressly targeting a 50/50 split—up from the 80% closed/20% open split in 2023.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Enterprise-expectations-for-open-source-usage-in-2024-and-onward-scaled.jpg"></a></p>
 7. While cost factored into open source appeal, it ranked below control and customization as key selection criteria.  
<p>Control (security of proprietary data and understanding why models produce certain outputs) and customization (ability to effectively fine-tune for a given use case) far outweighed cost as the primary reasons to adopt open source. We were surprised that cost wasn’t top of mind, but it reflects the leadership’s current conviction that the excess value created by generative AI will likely far outweigh its price. As one executive explained: “getting an accurate answer is worth the money.”</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Why-do-enterprises-care-about-open-source_-scaled.jpg"></a></p>
 8. Desire for control stems from sensitive use cases and enterprise data security concerns.  
<p>Enterprises still aren’t comfortable sharing their proprietary data with closed-source model providers out of regulatory or data security concerns—and unsurprisingly, companies whose IP is central to their business model are especially conservative. While some leaders addressed this concern by hosting open source models themselves, others noted that they were prioritizing models with virtual private cloud (VPC) integrations.</p>
 9. Leaders generally customize models through fine-tuning instead of building models from scratch.  
<p>In 2023, there was a lot of discussion around building custom models like BloombergGPT. In 2024, enterprises are still interested in customizing models, but with the rise of high-quality open source models, most are opting not to train their own LLM from scratch and instead use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or fine-tune an open source model for their specific needs.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/How-are-enterprises-customizing-their-models_-scaled.jpg"></a></p>
 10. Cloud is still highly influential in model purchasing decisions.  
<p>In 2023, many enterprises bought models through their existing cloud service provider (CSP) for security reasons—leaders were more concerned about closed-source models mishandling their data than their CSPs—and to avoid lengthy procurement processes. This is still the case in 2024, which means that the correlation between CSP and preferred model is fairly high: Azure users generally preferred OpenAI, while Amazon users preferred Anthropic or Cohere. As we can see in the chart below, of the 72% of enterprises who use an API to access their model, over half used the model hosted by their CSP. (Note that over a quarter of respondents did self-host, likely in order to run open source models.)</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Where-do-enterprises-access-their-large-language-models_-scaled.jpg"></a></p>
 11. Customers still care about early-to-market features. 
<p>While leaders cited reasoning capability, reliability, and ease of access (e.g., on their CSP) as the top reasons for adopting a given model, leaders also gravitated toward models with other differentiated features. Multiple leaders cited the prior 200K context window as a key reason for adopting Anthropic, for instance, while others adopted Cohere because of their early-to-market, easy-to-use fine-tuning offering.</p>
 12. That said, most enterprises think model performance is converging.  
<p>While large swathes of the tech community focus on comparing model performance to public benchmarks, enterprise leaders are more focused on comparing the performance of fine-tuned open-source models and fine-tuned closed-source models against their own internal sets of benchmarks. Interestingly, despite closed-source models typically performing better on external benchmarking tests, enterprise leaders still gave open-source models relatively high NPS (and in some cases higher) because they’re easier to fine-tune to specific use cases. One company found that “after fine-tuning, Mistral and Llama perform almost as well as OpenAI but at much lower cost.” By these standards, model performance is converging even more quickly than we anticipated, which gives leaders a broader range of very capable models to choose from.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/How-enterprise-leaders-evaluate-model-performance-scaled.jpg"></a><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Snapshot-of-Average-NPS-by-Model-Provider2-scaled.jpg"></a><br>
</p>
 13. Optimizing for optionality.  
<p>Most enterprises are designing their applications so that switching between models requires little more than an API change. Some companies are even pre-testing prompts so the change happens literally at the flick of a switch, while others have built “model gardens” from which they can deploy models to different apps as needed. Companies are taking this approach in part because they’ve learned some hard lessons from the cloud era about the need to reduce dependency on providers, and in part because the market is evolving at such a fast clip that it feels unwise to commit to a single vendor.&nbsp;</p>
  Use cases: more migrating to production 
 14. Enterprises are building, not buying, apps—for now.  
<p>Enterprises are overwhelmingly focused on building applications in house, citing the lack of battle-tested, category-killing enterprise AI applications as one of the drivers. After all, there aren’t Magic Quadrants for apps like this (yet!). The foundation models have also made it easier than ever for enterprises to build their own AI apps by offering APIs. Enterprises are now building their own versions of familiar use cases—such as customer support and internal chatbots—while also experimenting with more novel use cases, like writing CPG recipes, narrowing the field for molecule discovery, and making sales recommendations. Much has been written about the limited differentiation of “GPT wrappers,” or startups building a familiar interface (e.g., chatbot) for a well-known output of an LLM (e.g., summarizing documents); one reason we believe these will struggle is that AI further reduced the barrier to building similar applications in-house.<br>
<br>
However, the jury is still out on whether this will shift when more enterprise-focused AI apps come to market. While one leader noted that though they were building many use cases in house, they’re optimistic “there will be new tools coming up” and would prefer to “use the best out there.” Others believe that genAI is an increasingly “strategic tool” that allows companies to bring certain functionalities in-house instead of relying as they traditionally have on external vendors. Given these dynamics, we believe that the apps that innovate beyond the “LLM + UI” formula and significantly rethink the underlying workflows of enterprises or help enterprises better use their own proprietary data stand to perform especially well in this market.</p>
 15. Enterprises are excited about internal use cases but remain more cautious about external ones.  
<p>That’s because 2 primary concerns about genAI still loom large in the enterprise: 1) potential issues with hallucination and safety, and 2) public relations issues with deploying genAI, particularly into sensitive consumer sectors (e.g., healthcare and financial services). The most popular use cases of the past year were either focused on internal productivity or routed through a human before getting to a customer—like coding copilots, customer support, and marketing. As we can see in the chart below, these use cases are still dominating in the enterprise in 2024, with enterprises pushing totally internal use cases like text summarization and knowledge management (e.g., internal chatbot) to production at far higher rates than sensitive human-in-the-loop use cases like contract review, or customer-facing use cases like external chatbots or recommendation algorithms. Companies are keen to avoid the fallout from generative AI mishaps like the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisagarcia/2024/02/19/what-air-canada-lost-in-remarkable-lying-ai-chatbot-case/">Air Canada customer service debacle</a>. Because these concerns still loom large for most enterprises, startups who build tooling that can help control for these issues could see significant adoption.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/How-willing-are-enterprises-to-use-LLMs-for-different-use-cases_-1-scaled.jpg"></a></p>
  Size of total opportunity: massive and growing quickly 
 16. We believe total spend on model APIs and fine-tuning will grow to over $5B run-rate by the end of 2024, and enterprise spend will make up a significant part of that opportunity. 
<p>&nbsp;By our calculations, we estimate that the model API (including fine-tuning) market ended 2023 around $1.5–2B run-rate revenue, including spend on OpenAI models via Azure. Given the anticipated growth in the overall market and concrete indications from enterprises, spend on this area alone will grow to at least $5B run-rate by year end, with significant upside potential. As we’ve discussed, enterprises have prioritized genAI deployment, increased budgets and reallocated them to standard software lines, optimized use cases across different models, and plan to push even more workloads to production in 2024, which means they’ll likely drive a significant chunk of this growth.</p>
<p>Over the past 6 months, enterprises have issued a top-down mandate to find and deploy genAI solutions. Deals that used to take over a year to close are being pushed through in 2 or 3 months, and those deals are much bigger than they’ve been in the past. While this post focuses on the foundation model layer, we also believe this opportunity in the enterprise extends to other parts of the stack—from tooling that helps with fine-tuning, to model serving, to application building, and to purpose-built AI native applications. We’re at an inflection point in genAI in the enterprise, and we’re excited to partner with the next generation of companies serving this dynamic and growing market.&nbsp;</p>

 How decentralization enables the future private&nbsp;internet <p>DePIN is a novel concept that recently has been gaining <a href="https://messari.io/assets/depin">traction in Web3</a>. This blogpost will explain the concept and some of the reasons for why it is resonating across the industry. As we will see, the DePIN model is especially effective for providing privacy!</p><p>DePIN stands for “Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks.” This designates a real world infrastructure operated by a community of service providers. The model differentiates itself from traditional Web2.0 platforms by employing blockchain technology to enable decentralization.</p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/about/mixnet">Nym mixnet</a> is a DePIN that routes the traffic of your online activities securely and privately. The mixnet functions as an overlay privacy network for any online traffic, whether from a dapp, wallet, blockchain, or app (including <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">NymVPN</a>). The Nym DePIN is run by a growing, decentralized community of operators across the world. The DePIN model is particularly suitable for privacy infrastructure because it enables privacy properties like unlinkability.</p><p>Before going into how the DePIN model can enhance online privacy, let’s first walk through what a DePIN is and how it is fundamentally different from the platforms we know well from&nbsp;Web2.0.</p> What are Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs)? <p>A DePIN is a service-providing infrastructure built upon two things: a decentralized network of independent operators (a “peer-to-peer” or P2P network) and blockchain technology. What bonds them together is a token economic protocol (cryptocurrency tokenomics), incentivizing and rewarding good&nbsp;service.</p><p>The DePIN concept has gained traction recently, but DePIN projects have actually been around since the very early days of blockchain technology, with many emerging during the heyday of altcoins in 2014. Early DePIN projects include <a href="https://www.ethswarm.org/foundation">Swarm</a> and <a href="https://fil.org/">Filecoin</a> for distributed storage, <a href="https://www.helium.com/">Helium</a> for wifi connectivity, <a href="https://solarcoin.org/">Solarcoin</a> and <a href="https://prosume.io/">Prosume</a> for distributed energy production, and more recently <a href="https://bittensor.com/">BitTensor</a>, <a href="http://akash.network/">Akash</a>, <a href="https://www.thetatoken.org/">Theta</a>, and <a href="https://www.gensyn.ai/">Gensyn</a> for machine learning compute. And this is just to name a&nbsp;few!</p><p>In order to more easily understand how DePIN systems work and why they are now gaining traction, let’s consider how similar and well-known Web2.0 platforms operate.</p> The (centralized) physical infrastructure networks of&nbsp;Web2.0 <p>The idea of a platform which brings together independent suppliers to provide a service is not entirely new, nor is it unique to Web3. This was very much at the core of the Web2.0 business model. Think of AirBnB, where people put up their homes to form a network of available spaces to rent, or people driving their own cars to provide taxi services through Uber. And in many senses, services like AWS (Amazon Web Services) are also a part of this mode. Platforms like these make available a distributed network of physical resources and services: a car sitting in a driveway, or a room unoccupied, or distributed computer resources and data centers (aka “the&nbsp;cloud”).</p><p>The successes of these platforms, of course, meant undermining more traditional services like private hotels or unionized cab companies. But as we will see, they ultimately fell back into conventional and centralized models. The aim of DePIN projects has from the very beginning been to achieve full decentralization, including at the level of value, governance, and ownership. And it can do this by employing blockchain and token economics.</p><p>The idea that blockchain technology would unleash the next era of decentralization took hold not long after its invention through Bitcoin in 2008. The model of Web2.0 platforms had promised to empower everyone by becoming their own creators, vendors, and providers. But it turned out that the real winners would be the platforms themselves: the value of all this online activity was centralized into the Big Tech platforms we know today (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Uber,&nbsp;AirBnB).</p> The problem of centralized infrastructures <p>Web2.0 platforms have certainly empowered a wider and previously unactivated network of people with things to offer and share. However, their economic centralization ultimately undermined their true revolutionary potential. This phenomenon has been referred to as “the failure of the sharing economy.”</p><p>While a platform like Uber allows anyone with a physical resource (a car) to provide a service (a ride), the platform’s way of centrally monetizing the service is far from new. Individual providers do receive payments for their services, but these are ultimately based on what the central platform decides to allocate after taking their own profits and fees off the top. As it turns out, the platform model has increasingly proven itself to be a way to centralize profits while distributing risk out to service providers. Monopolies are the inevitable result.</p><p>Can decentralized technologies improve upon this centralized economic model, giving more to those whose work makes a service system possible?</p> The DePIN&nbsp;flywheel <p>The key difference between these well-known 2.0 platforms and the new wave of 3.0 DePINs is how token economic models truly enable equitable distribution of the value created. Furthermore, they encode real decentralized ownership at the core of the solutions.</p><p>The flywheel effect of DePINs seeks to accomplish this. The power of bringing together distributed assets and efforts is already evident in platforms like AirBnB or AWS. These enable normal people to profit from their unused resources and businesses to benefit from economies of scale and coverage. But with good token economic design, a decentralized community of contributors can grow to become equal partners in a communal enterprise. The more they contribute, the more they can benefit. With something like Uber, you only benefit from the minutes you drive, not from the total profits Uber makes. Community contribution is what drives the flywheel of a DePIN, leading to the potential of an “exit to community” where full ownership is distributed to the ecosystem.</p>Diagram of Nym privacy&nbsp;DePIN<p>It is important to note that what drives the DePIN flywheel is not simply some technical feature or architecture. It is first of all the communal adoption of a vision and protocol. DePINs are only successful if a community recognizes the value of this vision and takes it up as their own, invests in it, and helps to generate further enthusiasm. Further investment and capital follow can only flow with this collective effort.</p><p>The protocol and token economics can then be launched, attracting infrastructure operators and service providers to form a strong operator community. With the DePIN then fully operational, an ecosystem of apps, dapps, and other services can be built on top to enable end users to take full advantage of the utility and services provided. This drives value back into the network.. In short, the DePIN flywheel is powered by community, coordinated via a protocol, and rewarded through good token economic&nbsp;design.</p><p>Does this mean everything should be decentralized and run as a DePIN? There are mixed opinions on that matter, but one thing is certain: decentralization serves an important function to enable actual online privacy. And this makes DePIN a great model for privacy infrastructure, enabling a new era of privacy and security for the entire internet. This is where Nym mixnet comes in, reaching a stage of maturity for dapps and apps, with the NymVPN being the first commercial app to run on the privacy&nbsp;DePIN.</p> Optimizing DePINs for&nbsp;privacy <p>Digital privacy and security are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/10/02/cybersecurity-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly/">real-world problems for everyone</a>. As our lives become increasingly digital, this opens people, businesses, and institutions up to surveillance, cyber attacks, and security breaches.</p><p>As it turns out, decentralization, and therefore the DePIN model, is an excellent solution for a number of these risks. Here is why: one of the biggest privacy problems today is the traceability of internet traffic. When traffic leaves your device, it can be traced across the internet to a website you might be visiting, a person you might be chatting with, or a service you are using. This allows unwanted observers to link your identity to your online activities: browsing, chatting, shopping, and so on. This can potentially reveal a lot of highly sensitive information about yourself, your income, your relationships, and even your state of mind. Even when the content of traffic going in and out of your device is encrypted, the traceability of traffic frequency and linkability between sender and receiver can reveal as much as the content&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Decentralization is key for ensuring unlinkability. When using the Nym mixnet DePIN, instead of your internet traffic going from your device to a central server and service provider, imagine it is bounced around nodes all over the world. These nodes mix your traffic with other people’s traffic, making it impossible to trace. By decentralizing the routes your traffic takes across the internet, and mixing your data up, you can make your online habits unlinkable. This means decentralization is especially effective for enabling true privacy and security for everyone. Add token economics to the equation and you get a DePIN that can incentivize quality and scale while also ensuring economic sustainability across the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Real online privacy requires a collective solution. In order to hide effectively, a large network of independent service providers is needed, supplying routing and mixing services. As an increasing number of apps, dapps, wallets, and services begin to make use of the Nym privacy DePIN for traffic routing, more value will flow to the operators, enabling the network to scale and improving security and privacy for everyone. The token economic design of the Nym DePIN is thereby a virtuous flywheel.</p> How the Nym privacy DePIN&nbsp;works Nym DePIN&nbsp;stack<p>The Nym privacy DePIN is a collective solution to the widespread problem of internet traffic surveillance. It is a unique combination of two networks: an L1 blockchain (Nyx) running <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/a-breakdown-of-the-smart-contracts-that-run-the-nym-token-economics-3a61b4139f95">Nym mixnet smart contracts</a>, and the Nym mixnet itself which provides routing and mixing services to protect user traffic coming from any app or&nbsp;dapp.</p><p>Apps which run on the Nym mixnet (including the soon to launch <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">NymVPN</a>) can extend strong privacy protections to their end-users. When traffic leaves a user’s device, it will be wrapped in Sphinx encryption. It is then mixed packet by packet through five nodes in different locations across the world. Each packet takes a different route, and each node only knows where to send it next. When the data packet ultimately arrives at its destination, it is unlinkable to its initial sender. The mixnet thereby provides strong protections for user’s IP address, metadata, and other discernible patterns.</p><p>The Nym mixnet ensures that user traffic is unlinkable and secure. By distributing user data through a decentralized network of unrelated nodes or servers, the possibilities of external surveillance, metadata leaks, and hacking are greatly reduced. This is accomplished by <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/blog/decentralized-vpns-vs-traditional-vpns-all-the-differences">eliminating central servers from the equation</a>, along with their single points of attack or&nbsp;failure.</p> Nym’s flywheel <p>The token economic design of the Nym mixnet flywheel is designed as a virtuous cycle: operators ‘bond’ NYM tokens in order to enter the network. This serves as an initial reputation score. Anyone holding NYM tokens can stake additional tokens to a node doing a good job and in return receive a share of a node’s operator&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Nodes with good performance tend to earn more rewards, meaning there is an economic incentive for people to stake on well performing nodes. As apps begin to run on the privacy DePIN, a portion of user fees go to operators and delegators. The more users pay to use the network, the more value will go back to its service providers and ecosystem. This stakeholder position will incentivize better mixing and routing performance while also increasing user interest, for instance, with faster network&nbsp;speeds.</p><p>Read more about the Nym token economics <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-token-economic-highlights-90d8be1b1ab">here</a>.</p> Use cases and key technical features of Nym&nbsp;mixnet <p>Here are some key features of the Nym privacy&nbsp;DePIN:</p><p>1. Decentralization: Leveraging a decentralized network of nodes, the Nym mixnet ensures the absence of a central authority. This design choice enhances security by eliminating vulnerable central points and fostering network resilience.</p><p>2. Unlinkability: The Nym mixnet protects IP address and metadata, thereby achieving unlinkability between sender and receiver by default multi-hop routing and blockchain.</p><p>3. Resistance to traffic analysis: The mixnet design actively combats traffic analysis, a method used to deduce information by observing communication patterns. Employing advanced techniques, Nym mixnet makes it difficult for adversaries to analyze network traffic, thwarting attempts to link users to specific transactions.</p><p>4. Novel onion encryption: Nym mixnet adopts a multi-layered security approach, incorporating the Sphinx packet format and anonymous credentials. This strategy fortifies the overall security and resilience of the privacy infrastructure, ensuring robust protection against potential threats.</p><p>5. Censorship resistance: The Nym DePIN can help resistance to censorship by offering users a means to access information and communicate freely. Its decentralized architecture ensures resistance to censorship attempts, providing a lifeline for those in restrictive environments. Censorship is a continuous game of cat and mouse, however, and is an ongoing R&amp;D topic at&nbsp;Nym.</p><p>The Nym DePIN is a general purpose privacy platform, so its use-cases are quite broad. However, it is worth noting that mixnets are particularly effective for protecting message-based traffic and any type of communication (messaging, email, etc.). They are also very effective for protecting crypto transactions in transit and peer-to-peer broadcasts of blockchains and rollups. This helps to prevent things like MEV attacks and to avoid the censorship risks of <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/feed/post/1023839">centralized sequencers</a>.</p> DePIN: Exit to Community? <p>The concept of “<a href="https://www.noemamag.com/exit-to-community/">Exit to Community</a>” has emerged in the last few years to counter the Big Tech monopolies. The goal is to present an <a href="https://e2c.how/">alternative future for tech start-ups</a>: instead of seeking an exit via acquisition, the decentralization of ownership and value enables an “exit to community.” Strong decentralization, as we see with a DePIN, means that a service can be sustained and value distributed even if the founders and founding company are no longer around. As long as there is a social need for a service, there will be a network of service providers able to meet it and to be remunerated for their&nbsp;work.</p><p>Very few projects start off fully decentralized. Bitcoin is a prime exception, a project that was born decentralized pretty much from the beginning, made possible mainly through its protocol design and the disappearance of the inventor “Satoshi Nakamoto.” but for most Web3 projects, there will be a founder(s) who will have a strategy for decentralizing. Decentralization is therefore often a step-by-step journey entailing both technical, token economic, legal, and social efforts. Along this journey, several Web3 projects have adopted the model of splitting into a non-profit foundation to govern the core protocol, and a for profit entity pursuing profitable apps and services (the Ethereum Foundation and Consensys being a major industry example). The Web3 native form of organization however is the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) with <a href="https://makerdao.com/">MakerDAO</a>, <a href="https://aragon.org/">Aragon</a>, <a href="https://uniswap.org/">Uniswap</a>, <a href="https://aave.com/">Aave</a> and <a href="https://www.gitcoin.co/">Gitcoin</a> being the main examples.</p><p>At present, Nym privacy DePIN is decentralized on a technical level, enabling strong privacy.

  Partnering with Foundry: AI Compute, On Demand  <p>Jared and his team are unlocking a massive supply of GPU time for the next generation of AI.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/shaun-maguire/">Shaun Maguire</a>

Foundry’s Jared Quincy Davis



 
<p>A couple of years ago, Jared Quincy Davis had a problem. He was pursuing a Ph.D. in machine learning at Stanford, and getting the GPU time he needed to train his models was proving difficult. He and every other student who needed access to hardware had to reserve a time slot on a Google Sheet to exclusively hold a block of hardware, then wrap up in time for the next student’s window. A polymath with interests that included AI, distributed systems, crypto and economics, Jared was working with more than one advisor, each with their own GPU cluster—and he knew that if he could use those clusters at the same time despite their heterogeneity and separation, and effectively orchestrate the compute and split workloads across them, he could train models far more quickly. But there was no practical way to do so.</p>



<p>While studying for his doctorate, Jared was simultaneously working as a research scientist on DeepMind’s Core Deep Learning team—and before that, he’d been at BCG and KKR, where his work included data center projects—so his knowledge went beyond those firsthand frustrations with ML model training. He also understood the gaps between distributed systems for traditional cloud environments and what was needed for AI. And he also knew that data center hardware was changing.</p>



<p>In 2021, my partner Andrew Reed met Jared. He realized that Jared and I shared many mutual intellectual curiosities, so he connected us, and we immediately decided to make Jared a Sequoia Scout.<br><br>In early 2022, Jared was bursting with unique insights about the coming demand for AI compute and the bottlenecks beginning to emerge. Each time we spoke with him, he had refined his ideas, and in September he started <a href="https://www.mlfoundry.com/">Foundry</a> and we led the seed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two months after we partnered with Jared, OpenAI launched ChatGPT and the demand for AI compute exploded, with shortages and bubble prices highlighting the inefficiencies of the market. But luckily for all of us, these problems now have a solution: Foundry, which makes the world’s supply of compute more accessible and useful.</p>



<p>By solving the problem he once faced as a student and configuring models to run on distributed hardware, Jared and his team have opened up a massive supply of underutilized enterprise compute, which can then be aggregated and used. It’s a radical new approach to cloud computing workload orchestration, made possible by re-envisaging fundamental principles in congestion control and resource packing and scheduling, but with AI workloads in mind. Foundry realized that the AI compute ecosystem is bottlenecked not by under-supply, but by under-utilization.</p>



<p>We are proud to partner with Jared not just because he’s building a desperately needed solution to a fast-growing problem, and not just due to his impressive background, but because of who he is. We look for founders with grit, distance traveled, and irrational motivation, and it is clear when you meet Jared that he has all three. He is driven by a desire to honor the life of his mother, who was a computer scientist herself, and by a deeply held belief in technology as a path to a better world. What’s more, he has an incredible range and depth of knowledge—and we also look for founders from whom we can learn.</p>



<p>Jared’s foresight and innovation led to an exceptional 2023 for Foundry, as the company grew revenue from zero to eight figures with happy customers including the Arc Institute, Poolside and Captions. His team has unique experience in systems design for ML and, like its leader, a steadfast commitment to the hard work of making things simple.</p>
 



Jared giving his final presentation at Arc



 
<p>It has been a pleasure to watch Foundry grow as Jared joined us for <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/arc/">Arc</a>, our company-building immersion for pre-seed and seed-stage companies; as we co-led their Series A; and now as we celebrate the official launch of their groundbreaking product. We know that even after such an auspicious start, there is much more left to do, and we believe Foundry has the potential to not only make the market more efficient, but lead to breakthroughs in economics, climate and beyond. Their mission is nothing short of democratizing compute for the next generation of AI innovations, and we at Sequoia are grateful for the opportunity to support them along the way.</p>

  Social networks as compliment to AI<br>
 
<p>Adam D’Angelo: I was actually very excited about AI early on in my career. I remember trying to build some AI products in college, and it was just very difficult. The technology just wasn’t there. It wasn’t at the point where you were going to be able to make something that was ready for consumers. And meanwhile, I just watched social networking start to boom. You can actually look at a lot of social networking technology as if it’s almost an alternative to AI. So, instead of trying to get the computer to do everything, you could just connect people with other people over the internet who could do those things.</p>
<p>In the same way that globalization can be a substitute for automation, social networking is, you know, like letting people access everyone else in the world for entertainment, for fun, for communication, for whatever you want to do. I think it was just this incredibly powerful technology, and given that AI wasn’t quite there yet, [social media] was the main thing that there was to do, to apply all the technology to.&nbsp; </p>
<p>So I first got interested in social networking, and then, through my experience at Quora, we started out with a product that was entirely human-driven. People would come and ask questions, and they would put topics on them, and other people would sign up to answer questions, and they would tell us about what they knew about by tagging themselves with these topics, and we would try to route the questions to the people who knew about the particular topic. And it was all manual.</p>
<p>But we knew that at some point we were going to get to the point where software would be able to generate answers. We ran some experiments using GPT-3 to generate answers and compare them to the answers that humans had written on Quora. And a lot of the time, GPT-3 could not write as good of an answer as what the best human answer was that had been written, but it could write an answer instantly to any question. The constraint for Quora had always been the amount of time that high-quality answer writers had to answer questions. And so, the thing that was really new about LLMs was the ability to, at extremely low cost, generate an answer instantly to any question. We realized that a chat kind of experience, where you can write a question and then get an answer instantly from AI, was more likely to be the best paradigm for interacting with AI, as opposed to this publication paradigm that Quora had.</p>
<p>David George: Sure. Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Adam: And so, based on all that, we landed on building Poe as a new chat-oriented AI product.</p>
  Poe: bringing AI to the masses<br>
 
<p>David: I think many people will be familiar with Poe, but explain, just for us, how does the product work? How do you find it in the first place? How do you interact with it?</p>
<p>Adam: In the same way that Quora aggregates knowledge from many different people who have knowledge and want to share their knowledge, we want Poe to be a way for people to access AI from many different companies and many different people who are building on top of AI. You can come to Poe and use it to talk to a very wide variety of models that are available today. And then we have all these other products that people have built on top of these models. We’ve got an open API, where anyone can hook in. So, anyone who’s training their own model—any of these research teams, anyone who’s doing fine-tuning—they can take their model and put it on Poe. What we allow is for them to reach a big audience quickly.</p>
<p>We thought about, [as Quora] , what is the role that we’re going to play in this new world with AI? What are the strengths that we had, and what have we learned over the past 10 years building and operating Quora? There’s actually a lot of this consumer internet know-how that’s important in getting a product to mass market. This [includes] things like building applications across iOS and Android and Windows and Mac, localization of the interface, A/B testing, subscriptions, all these other kinds of small optimizations that you need to make a good consumer product. We want Poe to be a way for anyone who’s creating AI, whether it’s one of the big labs or an independent researcher, to get that model and make it available to mainstream users all around the world.</p>
  The future of AI is multi-model and multimodal<br>
 
<p>David: There’s a lot that you just said that I would love to go deeper on. You listed off all the models that you make available. There’s one theory that one model [or] one company is going to provide everybody the solution that they need for everything, right? There’s another theory that there’s going to be tons of different models for different use cases. The world’s going to be multi-model and multimodal. The theory behind Poe is that the future is going to be multi-model and multimodal. Why do you think that’s the case?</p>
<p>Adam: I think nobody knows how the future is going to unfold, but we think that there’s going to be a lot of diversity in the kind of products that people build on top of these models, and in the models themselves. I think there are a lot of trade-offs involved in making one of these models. You have to decide what data you are going to train on it, what kind of fine-tuning you are going to do. What kind of instructions is the model going to expect you to give as a user? What kind of expectations do you want to set with your users about what to use the model for? And in the same way that the early internet had this huge explosion of different applications, I think we’re going to see the same thing from AI.</p>
<p>So, early on in the internet, the web browser came along and made it so that anyone who was making an internet product, they didn’t need to build a special client to get distribution to people around the world. They could just build a website, and this one web browser could visit any website. And in the same way, we want Poe to be a single interface so that people can use that to talk to any model. We’re betting on diversity, just because there are so many talented people around the world who are going to be capable of tuning these models. You can tune the open-source models today. There’s also products from OpenAI and Anthropic, and I think Google’s close to having something where you’ll be able to fine-tune all these models. Everyone has their own data sets. Everyone has their own special technology that they can add to the models. I think, through the combination of all of this, we’re just going to see a very wide diversity of things you can do with AI.</p>
  Is the model the product?<br>
 
<p>David: There’s two things that I’d like to maybe go deeper on there. One is the idea of, like, what constitutes the product itself? What is it today, and then what is it going to have to become? Then second, the idea of the long tail, right? Like, bet on the long tail, incentivize them, give them a platform, abstract away a bunch of the infrastructure that they don’t know how to build, and harness really what they’re great at, right?&nbsp; </p>
<p>So, on the first idea, what is the product like? Today, many people would probably say [the AI model] is largely the product. What are the advances that you anticipate seeing that are going to sort of change the way people interact with these, [and] enable new kinds of products being built? You know, one way of thinking about that is: are the model providers themselves going to be the ones that build all the products?</p>
<p>Adam: If you’re a large model creator and you have tens of employees that you can allocate to building a consumer product, and you have the culture to do that, then you can go direct to consumer, and you can build a good product. I think that most of the people who are training these models are not in that position. If you want to take your model and bring it to consumers all around the world, you’ve got to think about [how] you need an iOS app, you need an Android app, you need desktop apps, you need a web interface. You need to do billing in all these different countries. You’ve got to think about taxes. There’s just a lot of work. You could either spend, you know, you raise some venture funding, you could either spend some of that funding on hiring out a whole team and developing all those competencies, or you can spend that on making your model even better. I think different startups will choose different paths here. But I think, for a lot of them, the right path is going to be to just set up an API, or plug into the Poe API, and use that to get to a lot of consumers very, very quickly.</p>
<p>David: Yeah. Talk about the role that the sort of long tail of creators then plays. How do you want to engage with them and what’s the incentive for them to want to build on top of Poe, as opposed to other places?</p>
<p>Adam: Yeah. So, we have a revenue-sharing program that allows people to get paid as a result of people using their bots on Poe. It costs a huge amount of money to provide inference for these models. And so almost no other platforms provide this kind of revenue share today. So if you have a model that requires a lot of GPUs to do inference on, then this is really your best place to come, and you can have a real business, you can cover your inference costs, and make more. We think a ton of innovation is going to come from these companies.&nbsp; </p>
<p>There are other companies that are building things on top of some of the big models, so, say, from OpenAI. And in that case, they have to pay the OpenAI inference cost, which is another sort of source of need for money. So the Poe revenue share model works in the same way, where it’ll let you afford your cost that you’re then paying on to any other inference provider.</p>
  Building AI infrastructure for creators<br>
 
<p>David: Yeah, absolutely. What are some of the really fun and interesting things that creators have already built on top of Poe?</p>
<p>Adam: A lot of people right now are excited about image models. There’s Stable Diffusion, SDXL, and then we let users go and do some prompting to customize it to provide art of a particular style. There are these, like, anime-style SDXL bots on Poe. Those are popular. There’s this company called Playground. They’re making a product for people to edit images. But in the process, they’ve created a pretty powerful model, and they have that model available on Poe. That’s gotten pretty popular recently.</p>
<p>David: It’s so cool that you can have a long tail of these creators make their own sort of opinionated style of these base models. But I think there’s something to that, where you provide, you know, the sort of infrastructure and support, and then let the users or creators do what they do best.</p>
<p>Adam: Yeah. I think it’s super early days right now, but I think what we’re going to see over just the next year or two is going to be incredible. This will go from being sort of useful to some people right now to being something that’s just critical to many different tasks that anyone is going to try to accomplish.</p>
<p>David: There’s a really good analogous company that you and I both know very well, which is Roblox, right? Early days, you know, creators were on there building games. They were pretty basic [in] the early days, and it was a lot of kids learning how to build games, and then it graduated eventually to people who were able to earn a living. So, I think the ideal for you would be you build enough scale, they can build large enough audiences to actually be professionals at what they’re doing.</p>
<p>Adam: Yeah. And we’re spending millions of dollars already on inference. It’s mostly going to the large model providers right now, but we want to let as much of that as possible go off to these independent creators.</p>
  Navigating platform shifts<br>
 
<p>David: Cool. I want to shift topics, and get maybe a little bit more, like, conceptual AI. You were CTO at Facebook at the time where social was emerging, and then right when the platform shift to mobile was taking place, right? I’d love your thoughts on what are the similarities to the shift to mobile in this AI wave, and what are some of the big differences?</p>
<p>Adam: You know, I think it’s very hard to say. With Quora, I think we were a little bit slow to adopt to mobile. You know, mobile was one of the things on our list of many priorities, and it needed to be the number one priority, and we needed to make tougher trade-offs to prioritize it. You know, we needed to do things like hire a set of different people who were going to focus on it, and have a period where we’ve released no new features, and we were just simplifying things because the mobile UI called for a different experience. When you have such a critical change in the platform structure, you need to rethink so much that it’s only going to happen if you have this very strong kind of top-down leadership.</p>
<p>David: And so you’ve done it differently this time around?</p>
<p>Adam: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>David: Right. Talk about some of the organizational changes and, you know, what you’ve done to actually refocus yourselves on the big thing that’s right in front of us here.</p>
<p>Adam: I think the first thing is just identifying this trend and then starting off doing some experimentation early on, just to learn. That didn’t require any kind of strong, decisive leadership as much as it just required paying attention to the market. But then from that experimentation, that got us enough conviction that too much of the Quora product has been built up around this publication model that is fundamentally premised on the idea that expert time is going to be scarce. The AI, the LLM time is not scarce in the same way. And so, we need to rethink that. This was in, I think, August of 2022, we got to this conclusion that chat is the right paradigm for this, and we need a new product. Just trying to retrofit everything into Quoraâ€¦ we thought we were going to move too slowly. So we had a small team just start working on Poe based on that.</p>
  Sharing human- and computer-generated knowledge<br>
 
<p>David: Talk about the relationship between Quora and Poe, and how you actually envision that changing in the future. And then maybe there’s even an extrapolation of Quora and Poe, and human experts and AI experts answering questions. Do they do it in the same place? Is it a different way of interacting?</p>
<p>Adam: We’d love to have all of this as integrated as possible. You know, I think if you think about the relationship between Facebook and Facebook Messenger, these are two products built by the same company, but they share a lot. I think that Poe and Quora might evolve into a similar kind of relationship. We’d love to get more of the human aspects of Quora into Poe. We’d also love to get the whole Quora data set into the Poe bots. And we’re also workingâ€¦ We’ve launched some of this already, to get some of the Poe AI to generate answers that are available on Quora. As these models continue to scale up, the quality is going to go higher and higher, to the point where it actually will be as good as human quality in a lot of cases. And so, the Quora paradigm actually becomes more appropriate for AI as the cost of inference gets higher.</p>
<p>David: Gets lower. Yeah. And model quality gets better. Yeah.</p>
<p>Adam: Yeah, yeah. So, we’ll see what the exact right relationship is, but we think of this as we’re building a network for people and AI to all share knowledge together. Sometimes the people will be getting knowledge from the AI, and sometimes the AI will need to get knowledge from humans, and we’d love to be as much of a conduit for that as possible.</p>
  Knowledge sharing on the internet<br>
 
<p>David: Yeah. And Quora—or Poe, depending on how they interact—is a place you get answers, and sometimes your answer’s going to come from an expert and sometimes it’s going to come from AI, right?</p>
<p>Adam: Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>David: What do you think about just the internet? [Can] you extrapolate that out? Are people going to be engaging with this collection of bots that have different personalities and different expertise? And will those be interspersed with real humans? You know, will real humans be interspersing in the AI? What do you think actually happens?</p>
<p>Adam: I, personally, I think that humans are always going to play some role. There’s knowledge that people have in their heads that is not on the internet and is not in any book. And so, no LLM is going to have that knowledge.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, Andrej Karpathy called the LLMs a lossy compression algorithm of the internet.</p>
<p>Adam: Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>David: And just as on the internet, there’s experts that know a lot of stuff that’s not on it, right?</p>
<p>Adam: Right, right. I think there’s a lot of potential in the kind of interplay between humans and the LLMs going forward. I think a lot of people, they… LLMs have a problem with hallucinations right now. And I think hallucinations are going toâ€¦ the rate is going to go down as the models get better, but it’s never going to get to the point where it’s 100% perfect.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I think there will be a lot of value placed on the idea that you know the source of your information, you know which human said it, or which publication originally printed it. I expect that that is going to lead to some kind of product or some kind of user experience where the LLM is helping you sort through your sources, and quoting exact experts or exact sources, as opposed to just synthesizing it all and giving you something where you can’t exactly trust where it came from.</p>
<p>David: And is that a new technology that gets built outside of the models themselves, or do you think that that’s incorporated inside of the model?</p>
<p>Adam: I could see it going either way. I mean, if you just look at a model, the raw model doesn’t have access to these other databases where it can get exact quotes. And so it’ll have to be some augmentation of the model, but how tightly integrated into the model it’ll be, I think we don’t know yet.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, I agree. I think that’s going to be critical. It’s one thing [where] we’ve started out with these use cases of companionship and creativity, and hallucinations are a feature of that, right? That makes it more fun and exciting, especially when you get into business use cases, or more utility-type stuff. You know, it’s obviously needed. What are the other big advances that you’re excited about, just broadly in the AI space for language models?</p>
  The benefits of scale for AI<br>
 
<p>Adam: I’m personally the most excited just about scale. Just continuing on the current paradigm, if you just play this forward, there’s so much further that it can go.&nbsp; </p>
<p>David: And you think the scaling laws will hold, are holding?</p>
<p>Adam: So far they have held. My prediction would be there are some issues that need to be overcome, but there’s just this incredible industry, so many talented people right now, who are trying to make this technology advance. And there’s so much money behind it. The force that’s there to help overcome any road bumps that we hit is so massive. So I expect that it’s just going to continue. I think there will be road bumps, there’ll be issues that need to be worked around, and there’ll be breakthroughs that probably need incredible creativity, but we have many of the smartest people in the world, the most determined people in the world, the most talented people in the world, all focused on this problem. I think we’re going to just continue to see the kind of exponential growth progress that we’ve had so far. I think that will go on for many years.</p>
<p>David: We talked about the last shift, right? The mobile shift that you lived through, and some of the lessons that you had from it. What do you think the ultimate market structure looks like in the genAI space?</p>
  Competing on scale or feature differentiation<br>
 
<p>Adam: In order to train these frontier models, you need billions of dollars of capital, and you need many years of investment in infrastructure. There’s a very small set of people who can do that. So that’s leading to this world where there’s only a small number of players that can be on the frontier. Right now it’s OpenAI, Google, maybe Anthropic. Maybe Meta can be there. Those who can get there, I think it’s going to be good business. You’ll be able to make a lot of money. You can have good profit margins. You’ll have to work very hard to stay on the frontier, to keep up. But it’s not a commodity. I think when you go six months behind the frontier, or definitely one year, it’s brutal.</p>
<p>There’s just way too many people that are able to get the capital and the resources to train those models. It’s going to be either fully open source, or there will be too many different competitors for anyone to make a good business at that point, on pure technology. I do think there’ll be very good businesses at that level that are not using frontier models, but are combining some other kind of unique thing with the model. So, it might be that you’re providing some tool that the model can use, or that you have some unique data that you’re using for fine-tuning, or there might be some unique product you build around the model. Then that ends up being the source of competitive strength.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I think there’s going to be this choice, where you’re either competing on scale, by being on the frontier, or you’re competing on some kind of feature differentiation. And in that case, you don’t need a frontier model. In some cases, you’ll have both. So, you know, you might be able to use the OpenAI API and combine that with some unique tool that you’re providing, and that could be a good business as well.</p>
<p>David: Yeah. Once you get beyond the foundation models, you get to more traditional forms of business differentiation, competitive differentiation, competitive advantage, you know, sources of moats and things like that, which I think totally makes sense.</p>
<p>Adam: Yeah. And I think what’s interesting about this is that it’s evolving. So, things are moving so quickly, and so every six months, the frontier moves forward. The frontier players, they have to invest more capital, but then they have much more powerful models that open up even bigger markets. But then, you know, the open source, one-year-back frontier, that’s also moving forward.</p>
<p>David: That keeps advancing. Of course.</p>
<p>Adam: Yeah. And so the markets that that can address are getting bigger and bigger. I think every year that goes by, we’re going to have this much larger market that can be addressed by the technology and all the products that are built on top of it.</p>
  Fault tolerance as a wedge for startups<br>
 
<p>David: So, yeah, that brings me to another topic, which is related to market structure. You know, incumbents versus startups. And in the seat that we’re in, we hope the startups always win. But in the last cycle, and maybe just from a B2B lens here, in SaaS and cloud, there were a bunch of things that made it really difficult for the incumbents to actually innovate. There was a business model innovation, and new talent and technology required, which opened the door pretty widely to startups.&nbsp; </p>
<p>There’s a take out there now on AI, which is, this time it’s different, and the incumbents are the real winners, right? Because the technology is available by simple API, you can plug it right in. And they have distribution, so they should be the winners. And, you know, if you just sum up Microsoft and Google’s business apps and all these things, it’s probably somewhere between $10B and $20B of revenue over the next one to two years. I’m curious if you have a take on that, if that’s consistent with how you see it, or if you see it differently.</p>
<p>Adam: Yeah, I think it’s going to vary. Definitely the incumbents, they’re going to have access to the technology and they’re going to have distribution. That’s a big advantage that they have. I think the opportunities for new players in this wave are more in the cases where the kind of product you want to build around this technology is somehow fundamentally different than what was built before. And so, as an example, the hallucination problem, that’s in some ways a good thing for startups, because a lot of the existing products out there have zero tolerance for anything that’s going to have a risk of producing something wrong. You can see this with, I think, with Perplexity getting share from Google right now. Google can’t just go and put something on all their search results where it has a few percent chance of being wrong. That would be a huge problem for them. Perplexity, that can just be the expectation when you’re using that product, that it’s almost always right, even though there’s a small chance that it’s wrong. I think that same thing is actually going to play out in a lot of other cases, where the products you build around this, they need some kind of fault tolerance, and there needs to be a user expectation that everything is not perfect.</p>
<p>David: And the cost advantage can be so great for this, right? Like, if you take a highly-paid person, like a lawyer, and you run it through an LLM, it costs cents, versus $1,000 an hour. Maybe you just should have a really high fault tolerance, and you just have to double-check a lot of the work, and that’s just a different workflow. That’s the new way of engaging, right?</p>
<p>Adam: Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, you have these entrenched companies that maybe have a very strong brand of never making a mistake, or never messing up, or always being reliable. And a startup can just come in and say, like, okay, well, this is going to cost a 10th or a 100th the price, but it’s going to have a small chance of getting things wrong. Actually, a lot of people would prefer that. But it’s a real problem for the incumbent, because they can’t compromise their brand.</p>
<p>David: Yeah. That’s a great point. I guess, just to close it out, I’m sure a big part of the audience here is founders who are building, and probably earlier stage than you. What advice do you have for people building in AI?</p>
<p>Adam: I think what I would do if I was starting a new company right now is just spend a ton of time playing with the models, and playing with integrating them with different things. You know, there’s so many different inputs you can give to the models. You can make scrapers that ingest data from anywhere. You can get data from the user’s local screen. You can get data from voice. And there’s just such a huge space of needs people have, and such a huge space of different, like, inputs you can combine to try to address those needs. I think it’s very hard to just kinda, like, think top-down about where there’s demand in the market. I think experimentation is really the way to go to generate ideas and to set up a startup that’s going to be able to build something really valuable.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, and have a place in the world, for sure. Awesome. Well, thanks for being here, Adam. I appreciate it.</p>
<p>Adam: Yeah. Thank you.</p>

<p>Today on the show we have two guests debating the merits and costs of crypto memecoins. Ledger (Brian Krogsgard) from the UpOnly podcast thinks that memecoins are financial nihilism that creates room for bad actors and grifters. Stephen Cesaro, from the Alfalfa Podcast, thinks memecoins are something to appreciate and celebrate.</p> <p>Which side are you on?</p> <p>------ 🥩PRIMESTAKED | MINT primeETH NOW <a href="https://bankless.cc/Origin-pod">https://bankless.cc/Origin-pod</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>------ 📣SPOTIFY PREMIUM RSS FEED | USE CODE: SPOTIFY24&nbsp; <a href="https://bankless.cc/spotify-premium">https://bankless.cc/spotify-premium</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>🐙KRAKEN | MOST-TRUSTED CRYPTO EXCHANGE <a href="https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2">https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; ⁠&nbsp;</p> <p>🔗CELO | CEL2 COMING SOON <a href="https://bankless.cc/Celo">https://bankless.cc/Celo</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>🗣️TOKU | CRYPTO EMPLOYMENT SOLUTION <a href="https://bankless.cc/toku">https://bankless.cc/toku</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>🛞MANTLE | MODULAR LAYER 2 NETWORK <a href="https://bankless.cc/Mantle">https://bankless.cc/Mantle</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>💸 CRYPTO TAX CALCULATOR | USE CODE BANK30 <a href="https://bankless.cc/CTC">https://bankless.cc/CTC</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🦄 UNISWAP | SWAP SMARTER <a href="https://bankless.cc/uniswap">https://bankless.cc/uniswap</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ TIMESTAMPS</p> <p>0:00 Intro 8:35 Ledger’s Memecoin Arc 11:53 Stephen’s Memecoin Arc 13:20 $DOGE vs. $BTC 18:38 Tokenization of Memes 22:28 Memecoin Intent &amp; Transparency&nbsp; 33:24 Memecoin Theory &amp; Practice&nbsp; 44:30 Investing in Brands 51:55 Reframing Memecoins 56:27 Memecoins vs. Scams 1:09:01 Closing &amp; Disclaimers</p> <p>------ RESOURCES</p> <p>Ledger <a href="https://twitter.com/ledgerstatus">https://twitter.com/ledgerstatus</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Stephen <a href="https://twitter.com/0xmagiclines">https://twitter.com/0xmagiclines</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ See our investment disclosures here: <a href="https://www.bankless.com/disclosures">https://www.bankless.com/disclosures</a>&nbsp;</p>

 Introducing Pure — The Currency 100% Backed by Verus &amp;&nbsp;Bitcoin  Pure is a decentralized currency fully backed by Verus (VRSC) &amp; Bitcoin (tBTC). Hold Pure to be exposed to both Verus and Bitcoin while accruing fees from conversions. Or use it to convert from tBTC to VRSC and vice&nbsp;versa.  ⏱️ Pure launch block: 2,975,703 (Sunday 24 March,&nbsp;2024).  ✅ Start preconverting to Pure now for an 8 day period. Read further to learn&nbsp;how.  ❓ tBTC is BTC on the Ethereum network. <a href="http://threshold.network/">Threshold.network</a> supplies a decentralized bridge for users to bridge BTC to Ethereum. tBTC is also bridged to&nbsp;Verus.  ⌨️ Join the <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Verus Discord</a> and type in /pure to see how much is in the reserves, the Pure supply &amp; its protocol&nbsp;prices.  What is&nbsp;Pure? <p>Pure is a decentralized currency launched on the Verus blockchain. It is fully backed by its reserves: Verus (VRSC) and Bitcoin (tBTC), with a reserve ratio of&nbsp;50/50%.</p><p>The currency is called Pure because it aligns with the true ideals of decentralization and transparency:</p>  Bitcoin and Verus are fully decentralized and controlled by its nodes and block producers. No single entity or company controls them. They are not a business — they are rent-free protocols.  Bitcoin and Verus had fair launches. No ICO, no premine and no developer fees or&nbsp;taxes.  Bitcoin and Verus have a limited&nbsp;supply.  Bitcoin and Verus are censorship-resistant.  <p>Hold Pure to be exposed to two decentralized cryptocurrencies upholding true cypherpunk values.</p><p>Another benefit of holding Pure is that the currency accrues conversion fees. When users convert from Pure to VRSC or tBTC (or vice versa) they pay a conversion fee of 0.025%. When users convert between VRSC and tBTC they pay a conversion fee of&nbsp;0.05%.</p><p>Half of those conversion fees (50%) stay in the Pure reserves, increasing the value of Pure since no new Pure is minted. The conversions are MEV-resistant and verified by the miners and stakers of the protocol. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/sendcurrency/">Learn more about Verus&nbsp;DeFi</a>.</p><p>Conversions between VRSC and tBTC are only possible after the preconversion period has ended on Sunday 24 March, 2024. From now on you can only add VRSC and tBTC into the reserves of&nbsp;Pure.</p><p>Users can also create subIDs which cost 0.00021 tBTC.vETH (in Pure). These costs are burned reducing Pure in circulation. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/verusid/">Learn more about VerusID and what you can do with it here</a>. If users create an identity with your subID as referral, they pay 2/3 less — you get 1/3 and 1/3 is discounted.</p> What is the preconversion period? <p>The preconversion period is an 8 day period in which users can fund the reserves of Pure with VRSC and tBTC. Depending on how much they added they will get their fair share of the 20,000 Pure after the 8 day&nbsp;period.</p><p>The initial supply of Pure is 20,000. After the initial supply has been distributed by the protocol, the supply is dynamic. When users convert from VRSC or tBTC into Pure, Pure is minted. When people convert from Pure back to VRSC or tBTC, the Pure is&nbsp;burned.</p> What is tBTC, how do I get it &amp; bridge it to&nbsp;Verus? <p>tBTC is BTC on the Ethereum network. The decentralized bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum is supplied by the <a href="http://www.threshold.network/">Threshold Network</a>.</p><blockquote>Existing solutions that bridge Bitcoin to Ethereum require users to send their Bitcoin to an intermediary, in exchange for an ERC-20 token that represents the original asset. This centralized model requires you to trust a third party and is susceptible to censorship, threatening the premise of Bitcoin as sovereign, secure, permissionless digital&nbsp;asset.</blockquote><blockquote>The second generation of tBTC is a truly decentralized (and scalable) bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum. It provides Bitcoin holders secure and open access to the broader DeFi ecosystem. tBTC v2 allows you to unlock your Bitcoin’s value to borrow and lend, mint stablecoins, provide liquidity, and much&nbsp;more.</blockquote><p>Get tBTC on Kraken, Uniswap, Curve &amp; others. <a href="https://dashboard.threshold.network/tBTC/mint">Or mint it&nbsp;yourself</a></p><p>tBTC token address: <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x18084fba666a33d37592fa2633fd49a74dd93a88">https://etherscan.io/token/0x18084fba666a33d37592fa2633fd49a74dd93a88</a></p><p>You can send tBTC to your MetaMask wallet or Verus Mobile first, and later you have to bridge it to the Verus blockchain. Bridging is done through <a href="https://docs.verus.io/eth-bridge/">the non-custodial Verus-Ethereum Bridge</a></p> Adding tBTC ERC-20 to Verus&nbsp;Mobile <p>Here is a guide to add the tBTC ERC-20 to Verus&nbsp;Mobile:</p>How to add tBTC ERC-20 to Verus&nbsp;Mobile  Press the plus-button bottom-right corner  Press “Add ERC-20&nbsp;Token”  Select checkmark to “Find using mapped PBaaS currency”, and fill in “tbtc.veth”, then press&nbsp;Continue  Press OK when a warning screen pops&nbsp;up.  <p>You have added the tBTC ERC-20 in Verus Mobile and are now ready to receive&nbsp;it.</p> Bridging tBTC to the Verus blockchain <p>You have to bridge the ERC-20 tBTC over to the Verus blockchain with the bridge website or with Verus Mobile to participate in the preconversion period.</p><p>🔔 It costs a considerable amount to bridge over to Verus. The Ethereum blockchain is quite congested and transactions are expensive because of it. Bridging costs estimation: when ETH is @ $3900 and the gas is at 60 gwei, you pay around $150 to bridge tBTC over to Verus. It can take up to 60 minutes before the tBTC arrives on the Verus blockchain.</p><p>Let’s start how to bridge with MetaMask and the <a href="https://eth.verusbridge.io/">Verus-Ethereum Bridge&nbsp;website</a>:</p>How to bridge tBTC ERC-20 over to Verus with MetaMask and eth.verusbridge.io  Connect MetaMask with this website: <a href="https://eth.verusbridge.io/">https://eth.verusbridge.io/</a>  Address: where you want the tBTC to end up on the Verus blockchain  Token: select “[tBTC v2] as tBTC.vETH”  Destination: select “[tBTC v2] as tBTC.vETH on&nbsp;VRSC”  Choose the amount you want to bridge&nbsp;over  If you use Verus Desktop don’t forget to add tBTC.vETH in the “Multiverse”-tab!  <p>You can also bridge with Verus&nbsp;Mobile.</p><p>First let’s add tBTC.vETH to your Verus Mobile&nbsp;wallet:</p>How to add tBTC.vETH currency on Verus&nbsp;Mobile  Press the plus-button bottom-right corner  Press “Add PBaaS currency”  Enter “tbtc.veth” and press&nbsp;continue  Press “ADD”  <p>Now let’s bridge the tBTC ERC-20 over to the Verus blockchain.</p>How to bridge tBTC ERC-20 over to the Verus blockchain as tBTC.vETH  Press tBTC&nbsp;v2  Press “Send” and then “Convert or cross-chain”  Press “Send off-chain”  As the recipient address fill in a Verus address you own (R- or i-address, or&nbsp;VerusID)  Fill in the amount you want to&nbsp;send  Then as “Select network to send to” choose&nbsp;Verus  Then as “Select currency to receive as” choose tBTC.vETH  <p>Now you can safely bridge the tBTC&nbsp;over.</p><p>So now that you’ve bridged tBTC over to Verus either on Verus Mobile or Verus Desktop, it’s time to preconvert.</p> How do I preconvert to&nbsp;Pure? <p>When you preconvert you put tBTC.vETH or VRSC in the reserves of Pure. After the 8 day preconversion period you receive an amount of the 20,000 Pure, distributed by the protocol.</p><p>You can preconvert with Verus Desktop and Verus&nbsp;Mobile.</p> Preconvert with Verus&nbsp;Desktop <p>On Verus Desktop click the “Convert Currencies”-button and then go to the “Advanced”-tab.</p>How to preconvert tBTC.vETH or VRSC to Pure with Verus&nbsp;Desktop  Choose amount to send (tBTC.vETH or&nbsp;VRSC)  “From Currency”: fill in tBTC.vETH or&nbsp;VRSC  “To Currency”: fill in&nbsp;Pure  “Destination Address”: fill in a R-/i-address or VerusID where you want to receive&nbsp;Pure  Check the box: “Send as pre-convert”  “Refund Address”: Sometimes a currency has a minimum or maximum amount to preconvert before it launches. For example, when the minimum preconversion amount is not met, and thus the currency not launched, you will receive your funds back. In this case there isn’t a minimum or maximum but you still need to fill it in. Can be the same as your Destination Address.  Now click “Convert Currencies”, and that’s it! You have now added a currency into the reserves of Pure and have to wait until Pure is out of the preconversion period.   Preconvert with Verus&nbsp;Mobile How to preconvert tBTC.vETH to Pure with Verus&nbsp;Mobile  Press tBTC.vETH or&nbsp;VRSC  Press “Send” and then “Convert or cross-chain”  Press “Preconvert”  As the recipient address fill in a Verus address you own (R- or i-address, or&nbsp;VerusID)  Fill in the amount you want to preconvert  Then as “Select currency to preconvert to” choose&nbsp;Pure  The network to send to is&nbsp;Verus  Now press “Send” and confirm, and that’s it! You have now added a currency into the reserves of Pure and have to wait until Pure is out of the preconversion period.  <p>Now that you have preconverted tBTC or VRSC into the reserves of Pure, all you have to do is wait for the preconversion period to be over. When that time has come you will receive Pure in your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Once you have received Pure into your wallet you can always convert it back to VRSC or&nbsp;tBTC.</p> Join the crypto revolution with Verus &amp;&nbsp;Pure <p>Pure is a unique currency backed fully by VRSC and tBTC, launched on the Verus Protocol. <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Join the Verus Discord</a> and explore what Verus has to&nbsp;offer!</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/scalability-decentralization-security-what-trilemma-8d2d6869924d">Verus solves scalability by neither sacrificing decentralization or&nbsp;security</a>  <a href="https://docs.verus.io/eth-bridge/">The Verus-Ethereum Bridge is non-custodial &amp; trustless</a>  <a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/launch-currency.html">Launch currencies (like Pure!) without any coding&nbsp;needed</a>  <a href="https://docs.verus.io/blockchains/">Launch fully interoperable, independent and customizable PBaaS-blockchains</a>  <a href="https://docs.verus.io/verusid/">VerusID: self-sovereign identities</a>  <a href="https://docs.verus.io/sendcurrency/">Verus DeFi: simple, low-cost, MEV-resistant and without any middleman</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/consensus-2024-verus-showcases-fully-completed-pbaas-blockchain-technology-0dba30607369">Verus is the protocol for builders: join the community at Consensus 2024</a>  <p>And so much&nbsp;more.</p> Join the community.

 Join to discover just how well your node can handle the pressure… <p>Nym mixnet operators are invited to participate in a series of mainnet performance tests. The first one will take place on Wednesday the 20th of&nbsp;March.</p>  Ready? Bring your mainnet Nym nodes (mixnode or gateway) to the test, by providing the node identity key&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/events/fast-and-furious">here</a>.  <p>Node operators should join in one or more of these tests, allowing Nym Core team to gain insights into the load mainnet can currently sustain. The test does not require additional NYM tokens, does not impact mainnet uptime and will provide you with valuable insights into how to improve your nodes. It is mandatory for all gateway Service Grantees and participants in the Delegations Program and to join the&nbsp;test.</p>Come test the&nbsp;mixnet Why are we doing a performance test? <p>Nym is about to release the <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">NymVPN Alpha</a> on mainnet. This is the first commercial application to run on the mixnet, so before launch we need to gain more insights into the current capacity of the live&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>The Fast and Furious performance test will show what the effect of lots of mixnet clients using the mainnet and enable the team to assess the effects of recent changes: Over the last few months new features have been added to gateways such as the Internet Packet Router (IPR) that NATs and reverse-NATs IP packet streams from mixnet clients. Also, the basic allow/deny list has been replaced with a more sophisticated deny list or port allow&nbsp;list.</p><p>Specifically, the performance tests will provide insights into the following questions:</p><p>1. How many mixnet client users can all active set entry gateways handle simultaneously? We have done a lot of benchmarking internally. However, we want to see how community operated gateways on mainnet perform with mixnet clients requesting large amounts of IP traffic from hosts all over the Internet.</p><p>2. How much sustained IP traffic can a subset of mainnet nodes sustain? Using the nym-vpn-cli we want to generate lots of TCP/IP and UDP traffic wrapped in mixnet packets. This will affect entry gateways, mixnodes and exit gateways. We want to see how the network performs!</p><p>3. How can we make improvements to the mixnode and gateway binaries to improve the throughput on mainnet? We are always looking for ways to improve the Nym network and with your help, we can see where we need to make improvements when there is a large sustained user traffic&nbsp;load.</p><p>The performance test will provide a better understanding of optimal machine spec for Nym node operators and a better understanding of associated costs of operating under high volumes of&nbsp;traffic.</p> What are we&nbsp;testing? <p>We are testing mixnodes and gateways. Bring as many of your mainnet nodes as you can to our dedicated test environment (and don’t worry — the nodes under test will still remain part of mainnet while the test is in progress).</p> When are we&nbsp;testing? <p>Wednesday 20 Mar 2024 from 1:00:00 PM GMT+0 until 5:00:00 PM&nbsp;GMT+0</p> How do I join the&nbsp;test? <p>Bring your mainnet Nym nodes (mixnode or gateway) to the test, by providing the node identity key&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/events/fast-and-furious">here</a>.</p> What happens during the&nbsp;test? <p>Your node will be added to the directory of a temporary performance test environment. And yes, this does mean your node will simultaneously be both in mainnet and the performance test directories.</p><p>Once the test starts, we will ramp up test agents that will connect to all the nodes that have signed up and are in the performance test directory and start sending 5-hop mixnet IP&nbsp;traffic.</p><p>Nym will generate a large amount of IP traffic using a fleet of instances of the nym-vpn-cli running in 5-hop mixnet mode. Each instance will request a variety of traffic from common internet sites including text, images, streaming video and large&nbsp;files.</p><p>This traffic will leave the performance test network and be routed to the public internet. Any responses will be routed back across the performance test network to the&nbsp;client.</p><p>Anyone is free to join in and add further load to the test by running the nym-vpn-cli with the performance test environment and use the Internet over the mixnet while the test is in progress.</p><p>We are very interested in real user’s feedback on the experience of using the mixnet alongside the noisy automated fleet of test&nbsp;clients.</p>  Join Nym <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#general:nymtech.chat">matrix channels</a> to tell us about your experience.   Monitor your node during the&nbsp;test <p>We encourage you to add monitoring to your own node, using your own metrics infrastructure. This will allow you to capture metrics about how your node is running, including:</p>  simple metrics such as CPU, memory and disk&nbsp;usage  Nym network metrics, such as the number of mixnet packets processed by your&nbsp;node  if you are running an exit gateway, statistics about IP packet&nbsp;routing  <p>It is important that you only connect nodes that you operate in your own node family to metrics and monitoring infrastructure. Join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#operators:nymtech.chat">Nym Operator matrix channel</a> for&nbsp;advice.</p><p>Connecting all nodes in the Nym network to a single centralised monitoring and metrics service undermines the effort to run the Nym network as decentralised infrastructure.</p> What metrics will Nym collect on my&nbsp;node? <p>We will be collecting metrics from our test agents to monitor the real performance as experienced by a&nbsp;client.</p><p>They will be made public after the test. It will take a few days to get them together in a sensible format so have patience!</p> What about metrics I collect, can I share&nbsp;them? <p>Yes please! Any metrics you collect during the test would be most valuable to Nym and others. Please share in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#operators:nymtech.chat">Nym Operator matrix&nbsp;channel.</a></p> What happens after the&nbsp;test? <p>Nym Core team will analyze the results from the test and share with the operator community in one of the subsequent weekly Operator&nbsp;AMAs.</p><p>The results will then&nbsp;inform:</p>  guidance on machine&nbsp;specs  improvements to mixnode and gateway&nbsp;binaries  project Smoosh&nbsp;timeline  improvements to Nym token economics  <p>Another test will then be scheduled as if more insights are&nbsp;needed.</p><p>Be fast. Be furious. Be ready on Wednesday the 20th of March,&nbsp;2024.</p><p>X</p><p>Nym Core&nbsp;Team</p>We don’t mean that — if you run a Nym node you are already winning of&nbsp;course! <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/fast-and-furious-nym-mixnet-performance-test-e651a178a804">Fast and Furious: Nym Mixnet Performance Test</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

EON Mainnet: EON 1.3.0 will perform a network upgrade on EON Mainnet via Hard Fork at Consensus Epoch 1405 which will occur on March 21, 2024, approximately at 18:55 UTC+1.  <p>What you need to know if you are deploying a new smart contract</p>  The solidity compiler up to 0.8.23 version is now supported. Due to the new <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3855">EIP-3855</a>, it is possible to use the new instruction PUSH0, which pushes the constant value 0 onto the stack. Please note this is used by Solidity compiler from version 0.8.20.&nbsp;  There are important changes in the deployment phase introduced by <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3860">EIP-3860</a>.&nbsp;  The introduction of a maximum size limit for smart contract initcode.  The introduction of a charge of 2 gas for every 32-byte chunk of initcode.    <p><br>List features from 1.2.0 to 1.3.0</p><p>Updated to the 0.11.0 SDK version</p>  The 1.3.0 version has been updated to the 0.11.0 SDK version. See the <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/Sidechains-SDK/blob/dev/doc/release/0.11.0.md">SDK release notes</a> for a detailed explanation.  <p>Forger reward address</p>  It is now possible to set up in the configuration the reward address that will be inserted in blocks produced by the forger. See SDK release notes for more details.  &nbsp;If using docker, you can just configure the env property SCNODE_FORGER_REWARD_ADDRESS: the config file will be automatically generated accordingly.  <p>Custom log4j file support in docker</p>  If using docker, it is now possible to configure the env property SCNODE_LOG4J_CUSTOM_CONFIG to use a completely custom log4j configuration file. See ‘Advanced logging customization’ section at this link <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/eon/blob/main/doc/howto/customlog.md">https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/eon/blob/main/doc/howto/customlog.md</a> for further info.  <p>Pause forging</p>  Please be aware that starting from this version EON block production may temporarily pause if the mainchain block production slows down: EON forgers will automatically stop to produce new blocks if in the latest 99 EON Blocks no reference to mainchain blocks is present.  <p>EIP-3651 Support</p>  <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3651">EIP-3651</a>: Warm COINBASE: with this EIP, the forger address will be loaded at the beginning of a transaction in order to save some gas for the methods that use it.  <p><br>For more information, follow the official <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/">EON Documentation</a> guide.

<p>Ever since ChatGPT catapulted generative AI into public consciousness over a year ago, we’ve been introduced to thousands of new consumer products that incorporate the magic of AI — from <a href="https://a16z.com/why-2023-was-ai-videos-breakout-year-and-what-to-expect-in-2024/">video generators</a> to <a href="https://a16z.com/the-future-of-prosumer-the-rise-of-ai-native-workflows/">workflow hacks</a>, <a href="https://a16z.com/the-future-of-music-how-generative-ai-is-transforming-the-music-industry/">creativity tools</a> to <a href="https://a16z.com/its-not-a-computer-its-a-companion/">virtual companions</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Six months ago, we did a <a href="https://a16z.com/how-are-consumers-using-generative-ai/">deep dive</a> into web traffic data to separate the signal from the noise. We ranked the most popular generative AI web products, based on monthly visits, and uncovered patterns in how consumers were <a href="https://a16z.com/how-ai-will-usher-in-an-era-of-abundance/">actually using</a> this technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>While there were a few early “winners” that captured widespread attention — namely, ChatGPT and Midjourney — new AI-native companies are emerging every month, spurring a dynamic, competitive market.</p>
<p>Now, six months later, we returned to the data to update our analysis, once again ranking the top 50 AI-first web products, according to SimilarWeb (as of January 2024). What we found was surprising: over 40 percent of the companies on the list are new, compared to our initial September 2023 report. </p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Web-Top-50-List-Inline-1.png"></a></p>
<p>However, unlike our original analysis — in which we first ranked companies according to web traffic, then added in mobile app data for those companies — this time we split web and mobile gen AI products into two separate lists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similar to the web ranking, mobile apps are ordered according to monthly active users, per Sensor Tower data (as of January 2024). This distinction allows us to examine the full universe of top AI mobile apps for the first time. There are marked differences in how consumers interact with gen AI on web vs. mobile, as we’ll get into below.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mobile-Top-50-List-Inline-3.14.png"></a></p>
<p>Beyond the inherent interest of these rankings, however, the data reveals several noteworthy trends around new and expanding categories, AI investment, and patterns of engagement. Here are some of our top takeaways:</p>
 


            
        

<p>Given ChatGPT’s impressive early growth — in <a href="https://a16z.com/how-are-consumers-using-generative-ai/">our analysis</a> six months ago, it was already the 24th most-visited website in the world — we expected the pioneering chatbot to retain its standing at the top of the list. Indeed, ChatGPT gets close to 2 billion monthly web visits, roughly five times that of the second-place company on the list,Bard(now Gemini).</p>

 
         
                     2M+ 
                <p>The number of developers building on OpenAI's API, including over 92% of Fortune 500 companies.</p>
     
            Source: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23948386/chatgpt-active-user-count-openai-developer-conference">OpenAI</a>
     

<p>Along with Gemini, companion creator <a href="https://character.ai/">Character.AI</a> and writing assistant <a href="https://quillbot.com/">Quillbot</a> retained their positions in the top five. That’s not to say the list has been static over the past six months, however: 22 companies were new to the web traffic rankings. </p>
<p>Among the so-called newcomers, those highest ranked include <a href="http://getliner.com/">Liner</a>, an AI research copilot; Anthropic’s general assistant <a href="http://claude.ai/">Claude</a>; and threeuncensoredAI companion apps: <a href="http://janitorai.com">JanitorAI</a>, <a href="http://spicychat.ai">Spicychat</a>, and <a href="http://crushon.ai">CrushOn</a>. (More on what’s behind the spike in AI companionship below.)</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Newcomer.png"></a></p>
<p>Our mobile list is entirely new. ChatGPT also leads here — but by a much tighter margin. ChatGPT is roughly 2.5 times the scale of the #2 and #3 players, Microsoft Edge and Photomath, in terms of monthly active users. For mobile products, the top five is rounded out by Microsoft’s search engine, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bing-chat-with-ai-gpt-4/id345323231">Bing</a> (now rebuilt around AI), and the photo enhancer and avatar creator <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/remini-ai-photo-enhancer/id1470373330">Remini</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, five AI companies are true “crossovers,” with both a web product and a mobile app making the top 50 lists: <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="http://character.ai">Character.AI</a>, the chatbot aggregator <a href="http://poe.com">Poe</a>, and the image editors <a href="http://photoroom.com">Photoroom</a> and <a href="https://www.pixelcut.ai/">Pixelcut</a>.</p>
 


            
        

<p>Six months ago, we noted that general, LLM-based assistants like ChatGPT made up the bulk of web traffic. In our updated analysis, we saw two new categories enter the mix: music and productivity (which includes tasks like research, coding assistance, and document summarization).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.suno.ai/">Suno</a> is the only music company to make the ranking so far. The tool generates original songs in-browser from a text prompt — complete with lyrics, in a range of styles. Suno started off as a Discord-only product, similar to Midjourney, but <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/12/20/suno-gen-ai-music-microsoft">launched</a> a standalone site and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/19/24008279/microsoft-copilot-suno-ai-music-generator-extension">Copilot extension</a> in December 2023. (Read more on where we see potential in the AI music category <a href="https://a16z.com/the-future-of-music-how-generative-ai-is-transforming-the-music-industry/">here</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several now-major consumer AI products, like Suno, started out on a Discord server — or still run primarily through Discord. The platform provides a testing ground (and community!) without requiring a full front-end product build-out. True traffic to a Discord server is near-impossible to measure, but web traffic to each server’s invite page is one proxy for this. On this metric, nine AI products or communities rank in the top 100 Discord servers by invite traffic as of January 2024, led by Midjourney in the top spot.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Discord.png"></a></p>
<p>The second notable new category on the list is productivity. AI-native platforms can uplevel people’s interactions with software, allowing them to delegate mundane tasks and cut time spent on administrative overhead. The productivity category encompasses seven companies in the ranking: <a href="http://getliner.com/">Liner</a>, <a href="http://eightify.app/">Eightify</a>, <a href="http://phind.com">Phind</a>, <a href="http://maxai.me">MaxAI</a>, <a href="http://blackbox.ai">Blackbox AI</a>, <a href="http://otter.ai">Otter.ai</a>, and <a href="http://chatpdf.com">ChatPDF</a>.*</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Web-Companies-Per-Category-Inline.png"></a></p>
<p>With features like in-flow editing and summarization, these companies focus on helping employees, freelancers, and SMB owners get things done more efficiently. <a href="http://eightify.app/">Eightify</a>, for example, provides summaries of YouTube videos, while <a href="http://otter.ai">Otter.ai</a> takes meeting notes and transcribes in real-time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Six of the seven productivity apps on this list either offer or operate entirely through a Google Chrome extension. We expect more AI productivity tools <a href="https://twitter.com/omooretweets/status/1760000618557735289">to operate </a>“in the flow” with the work users are already doing, removing the need to copy and paste a prompt and output between your workspace and an assistant like ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Alternatively, AI productivity companies may invent <a href="https://a16z.com/the-future-of-prosumer-the-rise-of-ai-native-workflows/">new end-to-end workflows</a> built around the unique capabilities of gen AI. AI workflow products can help users identify what can be improved, then automatically make those improvements.&nbsp;</p>
 


            
        

<p>Having an AI companion might seem niche, but the activity has emerged as a <a href="https://a16z.com/its-not-a-computer-its-a-companion/">predominant use case</a> for generative AI. There are already millions of people — <a href="https://x.com/venturetwins/status/1678800580490444800?s=20">ourselves included</a> — who have built relationships with chatbots. The web and mobile data signals an impending societal shift here: AI companionship is becoming mainstream.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Six months ago, only two AI companion companies made the list of 50; in this updated analysis, there are eight on web and two on mobile. <a href="http://character.ai">Character.AI</a> leads the pack of companion tools on both web and mobile, ranking #3 on the web list and #16 on mobile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Six of the eight web companion products bill themselves as “uncensored,” which means users can have conversations or interactions with them that may be restricted on platforms like ChatGPT. Users largely access these products via mobile web, as opposed to desktop — though almost none of them offer apps. On average, 75 percent of traffic to the uncensored companion tools on our web list comes from mobile.</p>
<p>For companion products that do have mobile apps, engagement is unusually high. The most successful products in this category become a core part of the user’s daily life, becoming as commonplace as texting a friend (if not more so!).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Engagement-Inline.png"></a></p>
<p>According to SensorTower data, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/character-ai-ai-powered-chat/id1671705818">Character.AI</a> draws an average of 298 sessions per month, per user, while <a href="http://poly.ai">Poly.AI</a> sees 74 sessions, on average.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mobile-Engagement.png"></a></p>
<p>We’re starting to see early signs of a much broader set of companion applications beyond AI “boyfriends” and “girlfriends,” including for friendship, mentorship, entertainment, and eventually, <a href="https://a16z.com/commercializing-ai-in-healthcare-the-jobs-to-be-done/">healthcare</a>. In fact, early studies have shown that AI can outperform real doctors in both <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/10/ai-can-outperform-doctors-so-why-dont-patients-trust-it">diagnostic accuracy</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/28/ai-has-better-bedside-manner-than-some-doctors-study-finds">bedside manner</a>. And many companion products are multifaceted: in a recent <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44184-023-00047-6">Nature study</a>, the <a href="https://replika.com/">Replika</a> chatbot reduced suicidal ideation for 3 percent of users.</p>
 


            
        

<p>Categories of AI use differ significantly on mobile apps vs. web. In general, web products support more complex, multi-step workflow products around content generation and editing —for now!These include products like the AI voice toolkit <a href="http://elevenlabs.io/">ElevenLabs</a>, the AI art generator <a href="http://leonardo.ai">Leonardo</a>, and the AI presentation builder <a href="http://gamma.app/">Gamma</a>, all of which rank in the top 20 among web-based gen AI products.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Web-Unique-Visits-1.png"></a></p>
<p>Mobile app usage, meanwhile, skews toward general assistants, many of which mimic ChatGPT. In perusing the list of top mobile apps, you may notice that there are 10 companies with names that are remarkably…similar to ChatGPT. This is partially because ChatGPT was comparatively slow to launch its own app, creating an opportunity for copycats to quickly gain an App Store-optimization advantage, especially if they pay for ads.</p>
<p>Some of the mobile apps that mimic ChatGPT have been called out as <a href="https://www.sophos.com/en-us/press/press-releases/2023/05/fake-chatgpt-apps-scam-sophos-reports">“fleeceware</a>.” They trick users into believing they are providing access to ChatGPT’s premium models with a similar title and logo, but, in fact, charge for access to the same model that is freely available from ChatGPT. These apps frequently change their names or descriptions, making it difficult for the app stores to “police” this behavior.</p>
<p>Other popular gen AI mobile app categories are tailored to the phone’s unique features. There are seven dedicated avatar products on the app list; the many selfies saved on most people’s phones serve as readily available training data. In addition, three of the top apps — <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/facemoji-ai-emoji-keyboard/id1103138272">Facemoji</a> (#9), <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bobble-ai-keyboard-assistant/id972432964">Bobble</a> (#31), and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genie-ai-chatbot-keyboard/id1658377526">Genie</a> (#37) — are mobile-specific keyboards that allow users to send texts with help from AI.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mobile-Companies-Per-Category-Inline-4.png"></a></p>
<p>Edtech is another popular category on mobile, where users can scan homework problems with their phones (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photomath/id919087726">Photomath</a>) or learn a language through live conversations (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/elsa-speak-english-learning/id1083804886">Elsa</a>). Notably, while the majority of the top gen AI mobile apps are bootstrapped, meaning they raised no outside funding, four of the seven ranked edtech apps have raised upwards of $30 million, according to PitchBook data.&nbsp;</p>


            
        

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/15/ai-cerebral-valley-hacker-house/">Cerebral Valley</a> may be the epicenter of AI, but hugely popular products are being built all over the world. This is particularly true of mobile apps. Though over 30 percent of the gen AI web products on our list originated in the Bay Area, only 12 percent of the mobile apps’ developers are based there. Similarly, though over half of the top gen AI web products were developed in the U.S., less than a third of the mobile apps originated stateside.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some mobile developers have had multiple hits:&nbsp; Istanbul-based app studio Codeway, for example, created the AI photo animator <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/face-dance-ai-photo-animator/id1589749730">Face Dance</a>, the chatbot app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chat-ask-ai-by-codeway/id1668787639">Chat &amp; Ask AI</a>, and the AI art generator <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wonder-ai-art-generator/id1621278575">Wonder</a>, all of which are on the list of top gen AI mobile apps. <a href="https://hubx.co/products">HubX</a>, also based in Turkey, developed the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ai-chatbot-nova/id1669007652">Nova</a> chatbot, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/davinci-ai-image-generator/id1630366866">DaVinci </a>art generator, and the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photoapp-ai-photo-enhancer/id1596089614">PhotoApp</a> enhancer.</p>
<p>These app studios often benefit from shared expertise across products on how to launch, draw traffic to, and monetize apps. Some of them raise no funding and focus on generating revenue as efficiently as possible. Others do pursue a venture path — <a href="https://bendingspoons.com/">Bending Spoons</a>, the Milan-based tech company behind the video editor Splice and the photo enhancer <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/remini-ai-photo-enhancer/id1470373330">Remini</a> (#5 on the mobile list) recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/15/evernote-and-meetup-owner-bending-spoons-raises-155m-in-equity-financing/">announced</a> a $155 million equity fundraise.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>It’s clear that a new generation of <a href="https://a16z.com/how-ai-will-usher-in-an-era-of-abundance/">AI-native </a>products and companies are growing faster and engaging users more deeply than ever before. We believe that over the coming decade, AI will underpin category-defining companies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this fireside chat from the <a href="https://a16z.com/american-dynamism-summit/">American Dynamism Summit</a>, a16z Cofounder and General Partner Marc Andreessen sits down with economist, podcaster, and polymath Tyler Cowen to discuss the state of innovation in America, from recent AI advances to growing support for nuclear power. They’ll explain why the future many people claim to want — a better economy, better quality of life, and a safer world — is only possible if America leads.</p>
<p>Here is a transcript of their conversation:</p>
<p>Tyler Cowen: Now, Marc. If your entrance music were to be Beethoven, which symphony and why?</p>
<p>Marc Andreessen: For those of you who do care and know who Tyler Cowen is, this is how his podcasts start. This is how he intimidates his guests into submission. First of all, I just wanted to say, thank everybody for being here with us today. We’re really grateful that you were all able to spend time with us and hopefully it’s been useful. Second is, I’m gonna get new business cards printed up that say, “You either know who I am, or you don’t care.”</p>
<p>Tyler: Or both.</p>
<p>Marc: Or both. I mean, how can you possibly…let’s see, I mean, I guess we have to rule out Beethoven’s 9th Symphony because that’s the official music of the European Union, is that right?</p>
<p>Tyler: That’s correct.</p>
<p>Marc: That’s the official anthem of the European Union.</p>
<p>Tyler: That’s right.</p>
<p>Marc: Which is just such a terrible mean thing for them to do to such a great piece of music like that. We should lodge a formal diplomatic protest. I guess, probably Beethoven’s 5th in retaliation.</p>
<p>Tyler: I would peg you as the fifth.</p>
<p>Marc: Yes.</p>
<p>Tyler: Now, how will AI make our world different five years from now? What’s the most surprising way in which it will be different?</p>
<p>Marc: Yeah, so there’s a great kind of breakdown on adoption of new technology that the science fiction author, Douglas Adams, wrote about years ago. He says any new technology is received differently by three different groups of people. If you’re below the age of 15, it’s just the way things have always been. If you’re between the ages of 15 and 35, it’s really cool and you might be able to get a job doing it. If you’re above the age of 35, it’s unholy and against the order of society and will destroy everything. AI, I think, so far is living up to that framework.</p>
<p>What I would like to tell you is AI is gonna, you know, be completely transformative for education. I believe that it will. Having said that, I did recently roll out ChatGPT to my eight-year-old. And, you know, I was, like, very, very proud of myself because I was like, “Wow, this is just gonna be such a great educational resource for him.” And I felt like, you know, Prometheus bringing fire down from the mountain to my child. And I installed it on his laptop and said, you know, “Son, you know, this is the thing that you can talk to any time, and it will answer any question you have.” And he said, “Yeah.” I said, “No, this is, like, a big deal that answers questions.” He’s like, “Well, what else would you use a computer for?” And I was like, “Oh, God, I’m getting old.”</p>
<p>So, I actually think there’s a pretty good prospect that, like, kids are just gonna, like, pick this up and run with it. I actually think that’s already happening, right? ChatGPT is fully out, you know, and barred and banging all these other things. And so, I think, you know, kids are gonna grow up with basically…you know, you could use various terms, assistant friend, coach, mentor, you know, tutor, but, you know, kids are gonna grow up in sort of this amazing kind of back-and-forth relationship with AI. And any time a kid is interested in something, if there’s not, you know, a teacher who can help with something or they don’t have a friend who’s interested in the same thing, they’ll be able to explore all kinds of ideas. And so I think it will be great for that.</p>
<p>You know, I think it’s, obviously, gonna be totally transformative and feels like warfare and you already see that. You know, the concern, quite honestly, I actually wrote an essay a while ago on sort of why AI won’t destroy all the jobs, and the sort of the short version of it is because it’s illegal to do that because so many jobs in the modern economy require licensing and are regulated. And so, you know, I think the concern would be that there’s just so much, sort of, glue in the system now that prevents change and it’ll be very easy to sort of not have AI healthcare or, you know, AI education or whatever because, literally, some combination of, like, you know, doctor licensing, teacher unions and so forth will basically outlaw it. And so I think that’s the risk.</p>
<p>Tyler: If we think of AI and its impact in sociological terms, large language models, who will gain in status and who will decline in status, and how should this affect how we think about policy?</p>
<p>Marc: Yeah, so first of all, it’s important to qualify sort of exactly what’s going on with large language models, which is super interesting. And kind of this thing has happened that you kind of read about a lot in the press, which is kind of there was this general idea that there would be something called AI at some point, and then large language models appeared, and everybody said, “Aha, that’s AI,” just like we thought it would be. And then everybody sort of extrapolates out. And that’s true to a certain extent.</p>
<p>The success of large language models is very unexpected in the field. And actually, the origin story of even ChatGPT is… this is not what OpenAI’s actually started to do. They started to do something different. And then there was actually one guy who…actually, his name is, I think, Alec Radford, and he literally was like off in the corner at OpenAI, like, working on this in 2018, 2019. And then it, basically, you know, was this revolution building on work that had been done at Google.</p>
<p>So it was kind of this very surprising thing. And then it’s important to sort of qualify, like, how it works, because it’s not just like some sort of robot brain. You know, what it is, is you basically feed, essentially, ideally, all known human-generated information into a machine, and then you let it basically build a giant matrix of numbers and basically correlate everything. You know, in a nutshell, that’s what these things are. And then basically what happens is, when you ask it a question or if you ask it to, like, you know, make a drawing or something, it basically traverses. It essentially does a search. It does a search across, you know, basically all of these words and sentences and diagrams and books and photos and everything that human beings have created. And it sort of tries to find the optimal kind of path through that. And that’s how it sort of generates the answer that it gives you.</p>
<p>And so philosophically, it’s kind of this really profound thing, I think, which is basically staring… It’s like you as an individual using this machine to kind of stare at the entirety of the creation of all human knowledge and then sort of have it played back at you. And so it sort of harnesses the creativity of, you know, thousands of years of human authors and artists and then sort of, derives, you know, new kinds of answers or new kinds of images or whatever. But fundamentally, you’re sort of in interaction with our civilization in a very profound way.</p>
<p>In terms of who gains and who loses status, there’s actually a very interesting thing happening in the research right now. There’s a very interesting research question for the impact on job scale, for example, for people who work with words or work with images and are starting to use these technologies in the workforce. And sort of the question is, who benefits more? The high-skilled worker and think, you know, lawyer, doctor, accountant, whatever, graphic designer. The high-skilled person who uses these tools to become an additional quantum leap high-skilled. And that would be a theory of sort of separation.</p>
<p>But the other scenario is the sort of average or even low-skilled worker who gets upgraded. And, of course, just, you know, kind of the nature of the economy. You know, there are kind of more people in the middle. And at least there’s been a series of research studies that have been coming back that it’s actually the uplift to average is actually more significant than the uplift to the high skill level. And so actually, what seems to be happening right now is it’s actually a compression by kind of lifting people up. And so I wouldn’t… You know, social questions are often a zero-sum game of who gains and who loses. But there may be something here where just a lot of people just get better at what they do.</p>
<p>Tyler: Why is open-source AI in particular important for national security?</p>
<p>Marc: Yeah. So, for a whole bunch of reasons. So, one is, it is really hard to do security without open source. And so there actually used to be…there’s actually two schools of thought on kind of information security, computer security broadly that have played out over the last 50 years. There was one school of security that says, “You wanna basically hide the source code.” And you wanna hide the source code precisely. And this seems intuitive because presumably you wanna hide the source code so that, you know, bad guys can’t find the flaws in it, right? And presumably that would be the safe way to do things.</p>
<p>And then over the course of the last 30 or 40 years, basically, what’s evolved is the realization, you know, in the field, and I think very broadly, that actually that’s a mistake. In the software field we call that “security through obscurity,” right? It’s sort of, we hide the code, people can’t exploit it. The problem with it, of course, is, okay, but that means the flaws are still in there, right? And so if anybody actually gets to the code, they just basically have a complete index of all the problems. And there’s a whole bunch of ways for people to get to code. They hack in and…</p>
<p>You know, it’s actually very easy to steal software code from a company. You hire the janitorial staff to stick a USB stick into a machine at 3 in the morning. So, like, you know, software companies are, like, very easily penetrated. And so it turned out security through obscurity was a very bad way to do it. The much more secure way to do it is actually open source. Basically, put the code in public and then basically, build the code in such a way that when it runs, it doesn’t matter whether somebody has access to the code, it’s still fully secure. And then you just have a lot more eyes on the code to discover the problems. And so in general, open source has turned out to be much more secure. And so I would start there. If we want secure systems, I think this is what we have to do.</p>
<p>Tyler: What’s the biggest adjustment problem governments will face as AI progresses? For instance, if drug discovery goes up by 3x, all of a sudden, the FDA is overloaded. If regulatory comments are open, AI can write great regulatory comments. What does government have to do to get by in this new world?</p>
<p>Marc: Yeah. So I think for every scenario, by the way, hopefully at least the first of those two scenarios happens. Maybe also the second. For anything like this, what there should be is there should be a corresponding phenomenon happening on the other side, right? And so the government, sort of correspondingly then should be using AI to evaluate new drugs, right? And so, company shows up with a new drug design, there should be AI assist to the FDA to help them evaluate new drugs. A regulatory agency that has public comments should have AI assist to be able to process all that information and be able to aggregate it and then be able to reply back to everybody.</p>
<p>And this is kind of true of basically every possible… This is a very interesting thing about AI, sort of every possible threat you can think of AI posing, basically, there is a corresponding defense that has to get built. I’ll pick another one, cybersecurity people are quite, I think, legitimately concerned that AI is gonna make it easier to actually create and launch cybersecurity attacks. But correspondingly, there should be better defenses. There should be AI-based cybersecurity defenses.</p>
<p>By the way, we see the exact same thing with drones. You know, weaponized AI, autonomous drones are clearly a threat, as we see in the world today. And so we need AI defenses against drones. The cynical view would be this is just a classic arms race, you know, attack-defense, attack-defense. And kind of, does the world get any better if there’s just more threats and more defenses? I think the positive way of looking at it is we probably need these defenses anyway, right? So even if we didn’t have AI drug discovery, I think we should be using AI to evaluate drugs. Even if we didn’t have AI drones, we should still have, you know, defense against standard missiles and against enemy aircraft. Even if we didn’t have AI-driven cyber-attacks, we should have AI-driven cyber defenses. And so I think this is an opportunity for the defenders to not only keep up, but also build better systems for the present-day threat landscape, also.</p>
<p>Tyler: The Biden AI directive, what’s the best thing about it? What’s the worst thing about it?</p>
<p>Marc: Yeah. So the best thing about it is it didn’t overtly attempt to kill AI. So that was good. You never know with these things, you know, how much teeth they’re gonna try to put into it. And then, of course, you know, there’s always the question of whether it stands up in court. But there were things that were being discussed in the process that were much worse and I think much more hostile to the technology than ended up being in it. So I think that’s good news. I think it was quite benign in terms of its just, like, flat out directives, which is good.</p>
<p>You know, the issue with it, people have different opinions. The issue of it is it kind of greenlit essentially 15 different regulatory agencies to basically put AI under their purview in sort of undefined ways. And so, you know, we will now have, I think, a relatively protracted process of many regulators from many agencies without explicit authority in the domain, basically, inserting themselves into the space. And then, you know, presumably at some point, there will be a determination of who, you know, has purview over what. But it seems like we’re in for a period of quite a bit of confusion as a result.</p>
<p>Tyler: So how much more green energy do we need to, in essence, fuel all of this AI, and where will it come from? What do you see the prospect is like, for the next 20 years?</p>
<p>Marc: Yeah. So the good news with AI and the good news with also, by the way, with crypto, because there’s always a lot of controversy around crypto and Web3 and blockchain around energy use. The good thing with these technologies, the good news from energy is these systems lend themselves to centralization of data centers, right? And so if we need, you know, a million to go into 10 million, going to 100 million to a billion AI chips, you know, they could be distributed out all over the place, but they can also be highly centralized. And because you can highly centralize them, you can think not just in terms of building a server, you can think about building basically a data center that’s an integrated thing from the chip, basically, all the way to the building or to the complex of buildings.</p>
<p>And then the way those modern data centers are built by the leading-edge companies now is they’re sort of built on day one with an integrated strategy for energy and for cooling. And, so, basically, any form of energy that you have, you know, that you could do in a very efficient way, in a very clean way, you know, or new energy technologies. You know, this AI is a use case for developing and deploying that kind of power. And so, you know, just building on what we’ve seen from Internet data centers, that could be geothermal, that could be hydroelectric, that could be nuclear fission, that could be nuclear fusion, solar, you know, wind, big battery packs and so forth. And so I think the aspirational hope would be this is sort of another catalyst to a more advanced rollout of energy. And even if there’s sort of net energy increase, the sort of motivation to get to higher levels of efficiency will be net good in helping us get to a better energy footprint.</p>
<p>Tyler: And which of those energy sources, in your view, is most underrated?</p>
<p>Marc: Oh, I mean, nuclear fission, for sure, is the most underrated today. And so, you know, there ought to be…yes, anyway, wave a magic wand. We ought to be doing what Richard Nixon proposed in 1971, right? We ought to build what he called project independence, which was to build 1,000 new nuclear power plants in the U.S. and then cut the entire U.S. grid over to nuclear and electricity, go to all-electric cars, do everything else. Richard Nixon’s other, you know, great corresponding, you know, creation of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, of course, guarantees that won’t happen. The plan is exactly on track. But we could. And so either with existing, you know, nuclear fission technology, or there’s actually a significant number, you know, now of new nuclear fission startups, as well as fusion startups working on new designs. And so this would certainly be a great use case for that.</p>
<p>Tyler: So, if the nations that will do well in the future are strong in AI and strong in energy, thinking about this in terms of geopolitics, which countries rise in importance for better or worse?</p>
<p>Marc: Yeah. So, okay, different things. So, I would add a couple more things to that, which is, which companies are in a position to best invent these new technologies? And then there’s a somewhat separate question of who’s in the best position to deploy because it doesn’t help you that much to invent it if you can’t deploy it. And so I would put that in there. But, I mean, look, I would give the U.S., like, very, very high marks on the invention side. You know, I think we’re the best. I think we have the best R&amp;D innovation capability in the world in most fields. Not all, but most. And I think that’s certainly true of AI and I think that’s at least potentially true in energy. I don’t know whether it actually is, but it could be.</p>
<p>And so, you know, we should be able to forge ahead on that. You know, China is clearly the other country with critical mass in all of this. And you know, and you could quibble about the level of invention versus sort of fast follow and talk about, you know, kind of IP acquisition, things like that. But, nevertheless, whatever your view is, they’re moving very quickly and aggressively and have critical mass, you know, a big internal domestic market, and a huge number of researchers and a lot of state support. So I think by and large, you know, we’re looking for sure on AI. And then I think probably also in energy, we’re probably looking at primarily a bipolar world for quite a while and then spheres of influence, you know, kind of going out.</p>
<p>You know, I would say Europe is sort of a dark horse in a sort of a strange way, in that the EU seems absolutely determined to ban everything, to sort of put a blanket ban on capitalism and within that, ban AI and ban energy. But on the other hand, you know, we have this incredible AI company called Mistral, in France, which is probably the leading open-source AI company right now and one of the best AI companies in the world. And the French government has actually really been stepping up to help, you know, the ecosystem in Europe. And so I would actually like to see sort of a tripolar world. I’d like to see the EU kind of fully punch in, but I’m not sure how realistic that is.</p>
<p>Tyler: So let’s say you’re in charge of speeding up deployment in the United States, what is it you do? State level, local level, feds? What should we all be doing?</p>
<p>Marc: Of AI, specifically?</p>
<p>Tyler: Everything, because it’s all increasingly interrelated, right?</p>
<p>Marc: It is.</p>
<p>Tyler: AI, energy, biomedicine, everything.</p>
<p>Marc: Yes. Yes. Well, and AI takes you straight to chips, which takes you straight to the Chips Act, which..</p>
<p>Tyler: Exactly.</p>
<p>Marc: … is not yet resulted in the creation of any chip plants although it might someday. So yeah, I mean, look, the most basic observation is maybe the most banal, which is, you know, stagnation is a choice, decline is a choice. You know, as Tyler’s written at great length, you know, the U.S. economy downshifted its rate of technological change, you know, basically since the 1960s. And technological change as measured by productivity growth in the economy was much faster prior to the last 50 years than the most recent 50 years. And, you know, that’s just the result of just sort of, you know, you have big argument as to exactly what caused that, but a lot of it is just an imposition of just, like, you know, blankets and blankets and blankets of regulation and restrictions and controls and processes and procedures and all the rest of it.</p>
<p>So, yeah. You know, and then you could start by saying, step one is, do no harm, and so, you know, this is our approach on AI regulation, which is, you know, don’t regulate the technology. Don’t regulate AI as a technology any more than you regulate microchips or software or anything like operating systems or databases. Instead, regulate the use cases. And the use cases are generally regulated anyway. It’s no more legal to field a new AI design drug without FDA approval than it is a standard design drug. And so apply the existing regulations as opposed to hamstringing the technology.</p>
<p>You know, so that’s one, you know, energy exploitation. Again, and energy is just pure choice. Like, you know, we could be building, you know, 1,000 nuclear plants tomorrow. My favorite idea there, which always gets me in trouble, and so I can’t resist is, so the Democrats administration should give Koch Industries the contract to build 1,000 nuclear reactors, right? Everybody gets revenge on everybody else. The Democrats get Charles Koch to fix climate change, and then Charles gets all the money for the contracts. And so it’s kind of, everybody ends up happy.</p>
<p>Nobody yet has bid on that idea when I pitched it. But maybe I’m not talking to the right people. So, you know, look, you know, we could be doing that. You know, we’ll see if we choose to. Look, the chips plant thing is gonna be fascinating to watch. There was this really, you know, we passed the CHIPS Act, and in theory, the funding is available. And, you know, the American chip companies are generally pretty aggressive, and I think trying pretty hard to build new capacity in the U.S.</p>
<p>But there was this actually very outstanding article in the “New York Times” some months back by Ezra Klein, where he sort of goes through and he says, “Okay, even suppose the money is available to build chip plants, like, is it actually possible to build chip plants in the U.S.?” And he sort of talks about all of the different regulatory and legal, you know, basically requirements and obligations that get layered on top. And, you know, it was sort of speculating as to whether any of these plants will actually get built. And so again, I think we have here, we have just sort of a level of fundamental choice as a society which is, do we wanna build new things?</p>
<p>I can’t say how exciting it’s been, at least on the West Coast, how exciting it’s been for Las Vegas to get the Sphere, because, like, it’s now impossible to visit Las Vegas without… Like, everybody’s always complaining. The Egyptians built the pyramids, like, where are our pyramids? And it’s, “Ah, we have a Sphere.” And so just like flying into Vegas just gets your juices flowing, like, gets you all fired up, because, like, this thing is, like, amazing. And by the way, I’m just talking about the view from the outside. I understand the thing on the inside is also amazing. And so, you know, we clearly can do that, you know, at least in Vegas. Where Ben lives now, like, in London, I think they just gave up on building the Sphere. So that’s the other side of it. And so, you know, we do have to decide whether we want these things to happen. You know, it’s a little bit dispiriting to see the liquid natural gas decision that just came down.</p>
<p>Tyler: But are the roots of this stasis quite general and quite cultural? Because parents coddle their children much more, there are higher rates of mental illness amongst the young, young people, it seems, have less sex, along a lot of cultural variables. The percent of old music people listen to compared to new music, there seems to be a more general stagnation. So how would you pinpoint our loss of self-confidence or dynamism? Where’s that coming from?</p>
<p>Marc: Yeah. Well, so first of all, to be clear, we’re very much in favor of young people not dating, because that’s very distracting from their work at our startups. So that works out fine. Fortunately, in our industry, we have a long experience with not having dating lives when we’re young. So that works out well. So, it’s not all bad. So it is really interesting, I mean, you know, the view is an experience… And look, Silicon Valley has, like, all kinds of problems. And we’re kind of a case study for a lot of the… I mean, look, it’s not like you can build anything in Silicon Valley, right? I mean, our politicians absolutely hate us, and they don’t let us do anything if they can avoid it.</p>
<p>So, you know, we have our issues. The view from the valley is…yeah, a lot of kids are being brought up and trained to basically adopt a sort of fundamentally pessimistic or how to put it, like, stagnation-oriented inert, like, have very low expectations. You know, basically, you know, a lot of what passes for education now is kind of teaching people how to complain, which they’re very good at. The complaining has reached operatic levels lately. And so there is a lot of that. You know, having said that, look, I’m also, like, actually really optimistic, and in particular, I’m actually quite optimistic about the new generation coming up. I think that Gen Z, and then I think it’s Gen Alpha, and then it’s, whatever my eight-year-old is.</p>
<p>We’re seeing more and more kids that are coming up and they’re being sort of exposed to a full load of basically, you know, programming, sort of cultural programming, education programming that says you should be depressed about everything, you should be upset about everything, you should have low ambitions, you shouldn’t try to do these things. And they’re coming out with sort of a very radical, you know, kind of hard shove in the other direction. And they’re coming up with just basically tremendous energy and tremendous enthusiasm to actually do things. And so… which is very natural, right? Because kids rebel.</p>
<p>And so if the system is teaching stagnation, then at least some kids will come up the other way and decide they really wanna do things in the world. And so I think entrepreneurs in their 20s now are a lot better than certainly my generation, and they’re frankly more aggressive than the generation that preceded them, and they’re more ambitious. And so, no, you know, we’re dealing with a minority, not a majority. But I think there’s quite a bit… Like, yeah, every hour I get where I can spend with 20-year-olds is actually very encouraging.</p>
<p>Tyler: One emotional sense I get from your walk on music, Beethoven’s 5th Symphony, is just that the stakes are remarkably high. Now, if we’re looking for indicators to keep track of whether, in essence, things are going your way, greater dynamism, freedom to build, willingness to build, American dynamism, what should we track? What should we look at? How do we know if things are going well?</p>
<p>Marc: Yeah. So look, you know, I do not come here and do not come to the world with, like, comprehensive answers. I mean, so, you know, the overall answer is productivity growth in the economy, you know, is a great starting point. Economic growth is a great starting point. You know, so the overall questions are there. You know, most of our economy is dominated by, you know, incumbent institutions that, you know, have no intention, I don’t think, of changing or evolving unless they’re forced to. You know, certainly, most of the business world now is one form of oligopoly or another that sort of has various markets locked up.</p>
<p>And so I don’t think there’s some magic bullet to hugely accelerate things. Having said that, I think attacking from the edges is the thing that can be done, which is basically what we do, what Silicon Valley does. And then, you know, when you attack from the edges the way that our entrepreneurs do… You know, look, a lot of the times they don’t succeed. You know, it’s a high-risk, you know, occupation with a lot of risk of failure. But when they succeed, you know, they can succeed spectacularly well. And a lot of our… I mean, we have companies in the American economy that were ventured backed in the 1970s, and actually even some that were ventured backed in the 1990s and 2000s, you know, that are now bigger than most national economies, right? And so, you know, when this…was it Apple? I think Apple’s market cap is bigger than the entire market cap of the German stock market.</p>
<p>Tyler: I think that’s right.</p>
<p>Marc: Just one company. And, you know, Apple was a venture-backed startup, two kids in a garage in 1976, not that long ago. It’s bigger than the entire German basic industrial public market. And so, you know, attack from the edges. Sometimes you can get really, really big results, sometimes, you know, you just prod the system. You know, sometimes you just, you know, spark people into reacting, and that pushes everything forward. And then the other question always is just, like, what are the tools, you know, from our standpoint, what are the tools that startups have in order to, sort of, try to really change things? And, you know, there’s a bunch of such tools, but there’s always two that really dominate. And one is just, what’s the magnitude of the technological change in the air that can be harnessed?</p>
<p>And so we’re always looking for kind of the next super cycle, the next breakthrough technology, in which you can imagine 1,000 companies doing many different things, all kind of punching into incumbent markets. And AI certainly seems like one of those. And then, yeah, the other is just the sheer sort of animalistic ambition, energy, animal spirits of the entrepreneurs and of the teams that get built. And like I said, I think those are even… I think the best of the startups today are more aggressive, more ambitious, more capable. The people are better, they execute better than at least I’ve ever seen. So, I think that’s also quite positive.</p>
<p>Tyler: Who’s a social thinker who helps you make sense of these trends?</p>
<p>Marc: Yeah, my favorite is…James Burnham is my favorite who…</p>
<p>Tyler: And why Burnham?</p>
<p>Marc: Why Burnham? Yeah. So Burnham is a famous… Burnham is not famous, but he should be famous. He was a… Burnham is a fascinating story. He’s a thinker in the 20th century who talked a lot about these issues. He started out life as a lot of people do in the 1920s and ’30s as a dedicated Trotskyite, full-on communist. But he’s a very special guy. Burnham was a very brilliant guy. And so he was such a dedicated communist that he was close personal friends with Leon Trotsky, which is how you really know you really know how you’ve made it when you’re a communist.</p>
<p>And he would have these, like, huge arguments with Trotsky, you know, which is not the safest thing in the world to do. But apparently, he got away with it. And a very enthusiastic communist revolutionary through the ’30s. And then sort of in the ’40s, he is, you know, a very smart guy and he started to figure out that was a bad path. And he went through this process of rethinking everything. And by the 1950s, he was so far to the right that he was actually a co-founder of “National Review Magazine” with William Buckley, who always said he was the intellectual kind of leading light at “National Review.”</p>
<p>And so, you know, he’s got kind of works that he wrote that will accommodate the full spectrum of politics. But in his middle period, where he was trying to kind of figure out, this is like in the 1940s, he was trying to kind of figure out where things were going. And there were enormous questions in the 1940s because it was viewed as like a three-way, basically war for the future between communism on the far left, fascism on the far right, and then liberal democracy kind of floating around there somewhere.</p>
<p>His best, most well-known book is called “The Managerial Revolution” which talks a lot about the issues we’ve been discussing. And it was written in, like, 1941. And it’s fascinating for many reasons, part of which is, he was still mad about communism. So a lot of it is he debunks communism in it. But also, you know, they didn’t know who was gonna win World War II. And so it talks about this battle of ideologies as if it were still an open topic, which is super interesting. But he did this very kind of sort of Marxian analysis of capitalism, and he made the observation that I see every day, which is there are fundamentally two types of capitalism.</p>
<p>There’s the original model of capitalism, which he calls bourgeois capitalism, which you could think, like, Henry Ford is the archetype of that. So, a capitalist starts a company, runs the company, name on the door, ownership of the company, control of the company, you know, sort of dictator of the company, sort of, complete alignment of a company with an individual.</p>
<p>And then he talks about this other emerging form of capitalism at that time called managerial capitalism. And in managerial capitalism, you think about today’s modern public companies, right? Think about Walmart or whatever, any public company where, you know, in theory, there are shareholders. But really what there are is there are millions and millions of shareholders that are incredibly dispersed. You know, who own small…everybody in this room owns some, you know, three shares of Walmart stock in a mutual fund somewhere. You don’t wake up in the morning wondering what’s happening to Walmart. It doesn’t even occur to you to think about yourself as an owner. And so what you get instead is this managerial class of, actually, both investors like fund managers, and then also executives and CEOs who actually run these companies. And they have control, but without ultimate responsibility, right? Without ultimate ownership.</p>
<p>And the interesting thing he said about that is he said, “Look, managerialism is basically… it’s not that it’s good or bad. It’s sort of necessary because, you know, companies and institutions and governments and all the rest of it get to the point where they’re just too big and too complicated for one person to run everything.” And so you’re gonna have the emergence of this managerial class that’s gonna run things.</p>
<p>But there’s a flip side of it, which is the people who are qualified to be managers of large organizations are not themselves the kind of people who become bourgeois capitalists. They’re the other kind of person. And so they’re often good at running things, but they generally don’t do new things. They generally don’t seek to disrupt, or seek to create, or seek to invent.</p>
<p>And so, one way of thinking about kind of what’s happened in our system is, capitalism used to be bourgeois capitalism, it got replaced by managerial capitalism without actually changing the name. That won’t necessarily lead to stagnation. And by the way, that may be necessary that that happens because the systems are too complicated, but that won’t necessarily lead to stagnation. And then what you need is basically the resumption of bourgeois capitalism to come back in and kind of, at the very least, like, poke and prod everybody into action. And that, aspirationally, is what we do and what our startups do.</p>
<p>Tyler: Marc Andreessen, thank you very much.</p>
<p>Marc: Good. Great. Thank you, everybody.</p>

<p>We’ve gathered insights from our team of web3 experts who are eager to share their most valuable tips with you. Whether you’re just considering using blockchain or already knee-deep in the technology, our experts have got you covered. With our wealth of experience and learnings along the way, our web3 experts are here to offer you valuable insights and guidance.</p>



<p>Top web3 expert tips for web3 projects:</p>



 
 Decrease time to market 



 Ask the community to avoid mistakes 



 Address compliance at an early stage 



 Mitigate risk by decreasing volatility 
 



<p></p>



 Expert Tip #1: Decrease time to market 



<p>In the fast-paced web3 world, time is everything. New applications pop up daily, not to mention the numerous new players that enter the space.</p>



<p>By decreasing the time to market, you can launch your product before your competitors. Additionally, it allows you to receive feedback from the (web3) community early on, which can help you refine your product. But remember, this whole web3 space is also new to them. Innovation takes time to sink in. Finally, a faster time-to-market can help you avoid running out of resources before your product even gets to market.</p>



<p>Simplicity is key. By prioritising a smooth and seamless process, and abstracting away as much technical complexity as possible, you create better experiences for your customers and increase your chances of success.</p>







<p></p>



 Expert Tip #2: Ask the community to avoid mistakes 



<p>For a novel and complex technology, it is essential to have a second pair of eyes on all your software. By involving the community and asking for help, you can ensure that your project is built on a solid foundation and has the best chance of success.</p>



<p>Many projects fail because people rush into building something without asking around. Newcomers to the field may not realise the potential challenges they could encounter, many of which may have already been resolved by others. There are public forums for developers and all types of project participants, including technology-focused and business-focused groups.</p>



<p>However, in the web3 space, there remain many solutions that are new and lack proper documentation, making it even more critical to consider what works and what doesn’t work. So, how do you ensure you get the best advice?</p>



<p>Firstly, ensure that you talk to a diverse group of industry players from different budgets and backgrounds. Secondly, clearly understand your project requirements and what you need help with. Clear communication will help your community understand what it is you are trying to achieve and where you might need improvements. Finally, always be respectful and appreciative of people’s time and efforts.</p>



<p></p>



 Expert Tip #3: Address compliance at an early stage 



<p>Before spending a considerable amount on building a minimum viable product (MVP), it is crucial to at least have a quick chat with a seasoned lawyer, to explore potential legal issues. A relatively small investment will help to identify any legal challenges related to your plans. For example, regulatory issues for custodial wallets, property law for tokenisation, intellectual property for NFTs, and GDPR compliance for web3 wallets and public chains. <a href="https://zaisan.io/services/web3-consultancy/">Inserting legal know-how at an early stage</a> might save tons of costs and a lot of time. It might prevent you from completely re-developing or spending precious resources on a project doomed from a regulatory perspective. Professional legal involvement will sit well with investors too.</p>



<p>At Zaisan, we understand that the law might look like a scary beast, but that compliance is essential for the success of your blockchain project. It’s too often that this initial, relatively small spending saves the day.</p>



   



 Expert Tip #4: Mitigate risk by decreasing volatility 



<p>One common challenge faced by many blockchain projects is the lack of users, particularly those projects that rely on transactional volumes such as wallets, exchanges, and marketplaces. Furthermore, when a project has a tradable token, there is a high chance that it can become volatile, which can make the project unusable. To mitigate these risks, we suggest that you ensure your project is sustainable through budget planning and mitigating volatility risks by hedging.</p>



<p>It’s important to avoid basing your business model solely on the token on which it is running. Instead, use business logic and design the project in a way that it doesn’t have overdependence on the system token. You could mitigate the risk by using stablecoins and a variable pricing model.</p>



<p>Introducing crypto or tokens to a project has its pros and cons. On the one hand, leveraging cryptocurrency or tokens can provide a new level of flexibility and accessibility, enabling streamlined transactions and potentially unlocking new revenue streams. Additionally, it can foster community engagement and loyalty through token incentives and reward systems. However, this approach also comes with its challenges, including regulatory compliance complexities, volatility in token values, and the need for robust security measures to safeguard against cyber threats and fraud. Therefore, careful consideration and strategic planning are essential to navigate the intricacies of integrating crypto or tokens effectively into a project. </p>

In addition, Anish was also recently invited as a guest on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwhBWdn3R5M&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Epicenter Podcast</a>. The podcast focused on discussing on-chain privacy, the vision and progress of Panther Protocol, and our milestones ahead.</p> Panther Protocol testnet and rewards update <p>We’re glad to share that we’ve debuted on<a href="https://airdrops.io/panther-protocol/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Airdrops.io</a> to promote Panther testnet rewards and welcome more participants to Panther community. The testnet currently has over 1500 participants, and we’ve distributed over 500,000 $ZKP as rewards.</p><p>The team is planning to launch a Zealy-based incentivized ambassador program next week to further improve community participation and promote Panther.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our testnet rewards pot is 2 million $ZKP — have you signed up for our test dApp yet to earn your share? Grab the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">latest link</a> from Panther’s docs to join our testing group and receive your $ZKP rewards.</p> Product updates  Stage 5 developments <p>Stage 5 includes using a third party Relayer service and supports gasless transactions via an Account Abstraction Paymaster contract. The team is currently performing integration testing with the second Relayer. Overall, the team is pleased with how well the end-to-end Relayer integration process is working. The team is still working on Stage 5 in parallel with other stages and expects to release it next week for community testing.</p><p>As you might be aware, Oshiya (previously known as Miner) optimizes gas usage by processing batches of newly created UTXOs and updating a Zero-Knowledge proof in a Merkle tree, which introduces a slight delay in batch creation. This process takes place in what’s called the Bus Tree, likened to the communal efficiency of a bus ride.</p><p>For users seeking immediate UTXO updates in the Merkle tree, we offer the Taxi Tree option, which promises faster processing, similar to taking a taxi. Last week, our team successfully deployed the Taxi Tree contract on the Mumbai testnet. The user interface has been updated to allow users to choose between Regular Processing (using the Bus) and Fast Processing (using a Taxi). In Stage 6, users will also be able to compare the network costs associated with these two processing options.</p><p>In addition, we have developed an exchange contract to facilitate the payment of Relayers in native tokens. This contract enables the conversion of $ZKP to $Matic via UniswapV3 on the Polygon network, streamlining transactions and enhancing our ecosystem’s functionality.</p> Stage 6 developments <p>Stage 6 of the testnet dApp includes fee management, basic disclosures, and zAccount renewal. The FeeMaster contract has been upgraded and is currently being reviewed. We anticipate that the Fee Master review will be complete this week and ready for deployment.&nbsp;</p><p>Smart Contracts for Stage 6 is completed with final rounds of internal testing ongoing. The next two weeks will be utilized to get the dApp development close to completion and launch stage 6 for community testing by the end of the month however, we will know precise dates after a week.</p> About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in Shielded Pools; zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs; and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s Zero-Knowledge primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

<p>As technology progresses, infrastructure should be commoditised, especially in Web3, in order to avoid the creation of bottlenecks and gatekeepers. Blockchains are naturally oblivious to off-chain data, so they need oracles to fetch data. However, given their past technical limitations, oracles have failed to provide a decentralised and permissionless framework for data query. SEDA seeks to change this by creating an intent-based modular data layer, which brings off-chain data on-chain, in order for it to be available to any party, regardless of who requested it first.</p><p>We were joined by Jasper De Goojier, co-founder of SEDA Protocol, to discuss the oracle landscape and how SEDA aims to decentralise it and make data access permissionless.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Jasper’s background  High level overview of SEDA  Oracle use cases  How SEDA Protocol functions  Intent-based data availability  Verifying subjective data &amp; LLM integration  ZKPs &amp; FHE for data privacy  Interoperability &amp; bridging  Roadmap &amp; optimistic oracles  SEDA token migration  Chain abstraction  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/jasperflux">Jasper De Goojier on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/sedaprotocol">SEDA Protocol on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>At PIVX, we firmly believe in the rights of all crypto projects to make <br>their own decisions based on what they deem is right for them. We are committed to supporting the diversity within the cryptocurrency ecosystem and respecting the choices made by different projects, particularly when it comes to&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>As everyone is now aware, Binance approached Privacy Coin Projects with a request to develop a super transparent address type that would facilitate compliance with regulatory requirements. PIVX agreed to this request and made “exchange addresses” that ensure no shield transactions can be sent to these addresses.</p><p>While we understand that privacy is an essential feature of PIVX and is currently optional, we recognize the significance of exchanges maintaining compliance with regulators. Implementing the requested address type would make it easier for our users to deposit into Binance, ensuring a smoother experience for all parties involved.</p><p>It is important to note that the introduction of this address type does not compromise PIVX’s commitment to privacy. PIVX has always been about choice, offering both shielded and transparent transactions. By introducing this new address format, we aim to meet the requirements of exchanges operating in regions with stricter privacy coin regulations, such as Korea. This step would enable us to identify and engage in discussions about relistings with these exchanges, ensuring PIVX’s continued presence in these&nbsp;markets.</p><p>We want to emphasize that PIVX’s privacy protocol, SHIELD, will continue to exist and be supported by a wide variety of exchanges and payment gateways. <br> <br> At PIVX, we understand that regulation varies across the globe, and we strive to navigate these complexities while providing options for users and maintaining our principles. We believe in the strength and resilience of PIVX as we move forward, embracing collaborations that allow us to adapt to evolving regulatory landscapes while preserving the privacy choices we offer to our community.</p><p>PIVX Core</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/community-message-from-pivx-core-d5efdbce2122">Community Message From PIVX core</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

		<p>This ZenIP proposes lowering the thresholds required for:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) formally submitting both technical and non-technical improvement proposals; and&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) achieving a quorum of votes for both technical and non-technical improvement proposals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These changes would increase accessibility for community members to put forth proposals and would bring quorum requirements in line with the broader web3 industry standards. Please note that these proposed changes apply to both Zen improvement proposals (ZenIPs) and EON improvement proposals (EONIPs).</p>
<p>ZenIP 42401 aims to make it easier for community members to participate in governance by lowering the $ZEN threshold required for posting a non-technical ZenIP/ EONIP for community vote, as well as lowering the quorum threshold for a vote to be considered valid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The current thresholds for both ZenIPs and EONIPs are as follows:</p>
 
 Technical:
 
 Submit proposal for vote: 200,000 $ZEN held or delegated 
 Vote quorum: 10% of circulating supply participating 
 
 
 Non-Technical:
 
 Submit proposal for vote: 100,000 $ZEN held or delegated 
 Vote quorum: 5% of circulating supply participating 
 
 
 
<p>This ZenIP proposes the following changes to the thresholds:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Technical:
 
 Submit proposal for vote: 100,000 $ZEN held or delegated (vs. 200,000 $ZEN currently) 
 Vote quorum: 5% of circulating supply participating (vs. 10% currently) 
 
 
 Non-Technical:
 
 Submit proposal for vote: 25,000 $ZEN held or delegated (vs. 100,000 $ZEN currently) 
 Vote quorum: 3% of circulating supply participating (vs. 5% currently) 
 
 
 
<p>Again, if ZenIP 42401 passes, these changes will apply to both ZenIPs and EONIPs. There are also no changes proposed to the majority requirements for either proposal type (i.e., 67% of votes in favor for technical proposals, simple majority in favor for non-technical proposals).</p>
 ZenIP Voting Timeline 
<p>ZenIPs are public proposals for the Horizen community to approve or decline. We encourage you to join the discussions on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/z8eebsj7Sv">Discord</a>, <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Discourse</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/horizenglobal">Twitter</a> on ZenIP 42401 and share your thoughts on the proposal. We also encourage you to read the <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42401-updating-proposal-and-quorum-thresholds/440">ZenIP 42401: Updating Proposal and Quorum Thresholds</a> post on Discourse to get a complete understanding of this proposal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voting on ZenIP 42401 will start on Tuesday, March 12th, 2024 at 12pm EST and end on Friday, March 15th, 2024 at 12pm EST.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Horizen DAO voting is done on the Horizen EON chain, using Snapshot and Discourse for governance. The snapshot is taken once voting begins.</p>
 Who is Eligible to Vote?&nbsp; 
<p>Any $ZEN holder can vote on improvement proposals, and those who hold (or who have been delegated) the requisite amount of $ZEN may put forth proposals to the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voting power is determined by the amount of $ZEN you hold on the Horizen mainchain and on the Horizen EON chain. Therefore the more $ZEN you hold, the more voting power you have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To see the vote instructions detailed tutorial, please have a look to the dedicated blogpost. Below we cover an overview of how to vote.&nbsp;</p>
 How to vote – Instructions 
<p>Your vote will be weighted regarding the tokens you hold, either on the Horizen mainchain (the historic one) or Horizen EON (the EVM chain).</p>
<p>If you already linked your mainchain address for a previous vote, you won’t have to connect it again.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Connect your wallet and verify if it’s properly linked here.</a></p>
<p>The vote happens on Snapshot and is done through MetaMask and therefore via the Horizen EON network.</p>
<p>Before going through the tutorial, we assume that the Horizen EON network is properly configured on your MetaMask wallet. If not, <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/connect/connect_your_wallet/">please follow this guide</a>.</p>
 A/ You already voted and linked you mainchain address 
<p>Then it’s very simple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We still encourage you to verify if your mainchain address is properly linked on the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Horizen Governance app</a>.</p>
<p>If it’s not linked, follow the tutorial just below.</p>
<p>If it’s linked, just head to <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot on the Horizen governance page</a>, and vote for the proposal when it’s published and available.&nbsp;</p>
 B/ You have to link your mainchain address 
<p>1/ First, make sure to have some ZEN on Horizen EON, you will need some gas tokens in order to interact with the EVM chain, link your address, and vote.</p>
<p>2/ Now it’s time to link your mainchain address(es). Any ZEN on Arizen, Sphere By Horizen, ZEN wallet, Swing wallet, or multi-sig wallets, Ledger, ZEN on exchanges are usable. Here, we will focus on Sphere By Horizen. If you need assistance for non Sphere By Horizen wallets linking, please have a look to this <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/how-to-link-the-mainchain-address-to-the-horizen-eon-address/174">post on the Horizen forum</a>.</p>
<p>You’ll get a more <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address/">detailed tutorial with a screenshot in the Governance doc</a>, but here are the steps:</p>
 
 Make sure Horizen EON is configured on MetaMask and to have some ZEN on there thanks to the steps stated above. 
 Open the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Horizen Governance</a> page. 
 Click Connect Wallet. The EON wallet (MetaMask) appears in the top-right corner. Once connected, the EON address field is automatically filled with the connected EON address.
 
 Note: If the EON wallet (MetaMask) was previously connected to the Horizen Governance app, then it is automatically connected. 
 
 
 Open Sphere By Horizen and navigate to the mainchain wallet address you want to link to the EON address. Click the Information icon to view your address. 
 In the Horizen Governance app, on the Linked Addresses pane, click Link Mainchain Address.&nbsp; 
 The Link Address pop-up appears. Paste the Sphere wallet address in the Mainchain Address field. 
 Copy your EON address. 
 In Sphere, go to the Addresses pane. Click the compose icon (hand holding pencil). 
 The Sign message with address pop-up appears. Paste the EON address in the message field and click on Create signature. The mainchain signature appears below the message field. Then click on COPY TO CLIPBOARD. 
 In the Horizen Governance app, on the Linked Addresses pane, paste the signature in the Mainchain Signature field. 
 Click Link. The Pending pop-up appears stating that the transaction is being submitted. 
 The MetaMask Notification appears. Read the information details. Click Confirm. 
 The Linked Address appears showing that the EON Address and Mainchain Address are linked 
 You can repeat the process for other addresses. 
 
<p>Now that it’s linked, just head to <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot on the Horizen governance page</a>, and vote for the proposal when it’s published and available.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/PjDFYEh6SDw?si=VgQKGkl_PHj8Q0qW">We also have a helpful video tutorial here with instructions on how to vote for the Horizen DAO.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the adoption of blockchain-based payment surges, the need for on-chain privacy is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-files-for-privacy-etf-with-sec-zcash-part-of-offering.htm?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#:~:text=Crypto-focused%20asset%20manager%20Grayscale,be%20an%20industry-first%20fund">capturing the spotlight</a>. Privacy is particularly important for institutional users and high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs). And, the problem is that any public, pseudonymous blockchain reveals transaction details.&nbsp;</p><p>From wallet addresses, to gas fees, to transaction value, and the tokens traded; transaction data is public. This enables transaction linkage, which exposes a huge data exhaust that may ultimately result in wallet:identity mapping. Simply attempting to make a trade can trigger MEV front-running; even price discovery can be followed. Neither privacy nor confidentiality are a feature of public ledgers.</p><p>Let’s examine how Panther’s multi-chain privacy-preserving protocol intends to offer users access to public ledger liquidity while providing transactional anonymity.&nbsp;</p> A vision for regulatory-compliant, on-chain privacy <p>Panther Protocol breaks the links between the wallet initiating the trade and the trade itself, i.e. it enhances transaction privacy: specifically, it preserves identity, the assets traded, and value transferred. This privacy is granted by Panther’s <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Shielded Pools</a>. Shielded Pools, known in TradFi as dark pools, obscure the trade initiator whose privacy must be preserved from peer traders and external liquidity sources.&nbsp;</p><p>The Shielded Pool acts like a walled garden: only invited users and assets may enter. Assets are deposited in the Panther Vault, part of the Panther Smart Contract, in exchange for a zAsset, or Zero-Knowledge Asset. It’s the zAsset that masks the detail of the user’s trades from observation.</p> What is a zAsset? <p>A zAsset represents a digital asset that users may trade with anonymity within a Panther Shielded Pool. The technology underpinning the zAsset enables trades to be settled privately on a public ledger.</p><p>In essence, the zAsset, is a "mirror" asset that is printed when a digital asset is <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools/depositing-transferring-and-withdrawing?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">deposited </a>in the Panther contract. It’s subsequently spent when that asset is withdrawn. Therefore, the zAsset:asset always exists in a strict 1:1 ratio. Users can send, swap, receive, and pay with zAssets within a Shielded Pool.&nbsp;</p> How does a zAsset enhance trading privacy? <p>A zAsset utilizes Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs. ZK proofs are cryptographic protocols that enable the prover to demonstrate to the verifier that something is true without revealing the underlying data required to form that proof. For example, you could prove that you are over 18 without providing the birth certificate or ID used to generate that proof, nor indeed your actual age.&nbsp;</p><p>zAssets represent their underlying asset in the form of UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs). It’s these UTXOs that users trade within a <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Shielded Pool</a>. To store UTXO data on-chain, the Protocol uses ZK-SNARK (Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) proofs. This allows a user’s on-chain state to be stored privately and to ensure private state changes, i.e. the UTXO data that represents the asset on-chain is condensed and encrypted. This means that asset balances and balance changes are not publicly available should a Panther account address become known to an observer.&nbsp;</p><p>To the observing world, the only available data that results from a trade is that a UTXO was committed to the smart contract. Only the owner of the UTXO can decrypt the proof and ascertain the value and token that the UTXO represents.&nbsp;</p><p>The fact that UTXOs are not all created equal adds further support to the privacy set. The number of UTXOs created as a result of trades does not map to the number of tokens that UTXO represents. Some UTXOs may not even represent an asset, they may prove a zero balance, or null data, allowing the activity level of the protocol itself to also be shielded.&nbsp;</p> Deepening privacy <p>Panther Protocol offers two privacy layers; one is optional, and the other is a feature of the protocol. The zAsset is the protocol’s core feature, and the Panther Relayer is a protocol service provider that adds an additional privacy-enhancing mechanism.</p><p>Panther Relayers provide an additional privacy layer by breaking the link between the initiator of the transaction and the transaction itself. These ecosystem operators charge a fee for:</p>  signing the transactions with their public key  paying the gas fees  relaying bundles of transactions to the Shielded Pool contract&nbsp;  <p>Relayers, therefore, enhance privacy, since observers are unable to pinpoint the actual address that initiated the transaction because the Relayer signs the blockchain transaction with their key.</p> A brighter, more private, public-ledger future <p>Relaying alone goes a long way to confounding transaction linking by disbursing the data exhaust when compared to a peer-to-peer or peer-to-AMM transaction. Combined with zAsset trading, we believe this suite of solutions offers the most robust, and yet compliant, trading privacy mechanism created to date.&nbsp;</p><p>As the global economy migrates to a digital native medium that operates on public ledgers, the utility of on-chain protocols will largely hinge on how effectively they implement features that confer privacy where and when it is needed. We believe that Panther Protocol’s privacy-enhancing technology solves the public ledger privacy problem. Panther Protocol has developed a mature, considered solution set that allows institutions and end-users to balance their privacy and compliance needs.&nbsp;</p><p>Panther Protocol provides dedicated, customizable space, <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools/zones?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">a Panther Zone</a>, to empower institutions to trade in Shielded Pools with allowlisted assets and counterparties. Designed with the needs of compliant privacy-enabled DeFi in mind, Panther Zones deliver a chain-agnostic, fully decentralized, suite of features that provide unparalleled privacy, security, and compliance support for public on-chain transactions.&nbsp;</p><p>Interested in customizing your own trading Zone for privacy-enhanced trading?

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>February was a busy month for Panther Protocol, with the launch of testnet Stage 4 supporting internal transfers and withdrawals, alongside Stage 1 technical enhancements for improved performance and the parallel development of Stages 5 &amp; 6 of the dApp. February also saw the Panther tester community grow to 900+ testers.&nbsp;</p><p>This update covers the ecosystem’s growth, product development progress, and a peek at what’s planned for March:</p> Ecosystem updates  Testnet Stage 4 is live — supporting internal transfers and withdrawals <p>Testnet <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage-4-is-now-live-supporting-internal-transfers-and-withdrawals/">Stage 4</a> was released in February, supporting internal transfers and withdrawals. Stage 4 allows users to send zAssets from one zAccount to another. The release of Stage 4 marks a significant step towards the protocol’s mainnet release.</p> Blog: Let’s end the taboo of on-chain privacy <p>Our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/lets-end-the-taboo-of-on-chain-privacy/">latest blog</a> explores the need for a balanced approach to privacy and transparency in Web3. It stresses the importance of private transactions on the public ledgers. By comparing traditional finance’s privacy and DeFi’s transparency, we argue for a middle ground that supports global finance and compliance. Panther Protocol offers solutions to achieve this balance, aiming for a future where privacy and regulatory demands work together.</p> AMA with Panther’s Head of Product, Saif Akhtar <p>On February 8, we hosted an engaging AMA with Saif Akhtar, our Head of Product, and Joris Koopman, our Head of Community.

<p>Blockchains are, by default, public ledgers containing every transaction recorded by the network. While this ensures transparency, it also violates users’ privacy once an address is linked to an entity. Apart from creating additional risk for self-custody, institutions are also limited by what they can publicly share on a blockchain. As a result, there is great demand and utility for on-chain, compliant privacy, which still requires KYC (&amp; KYT), but protects them through cryptographic constructs. Zero knowledge proofs attest computational integrity, allowing for transactions to be bundled together and their correctness verified, without revealing each individual interaction.</p><p>We were joined by Anish Mohammed, co-founder &amp; CTO of Panther Protocol, to discuss the importance of compliant privacy for on-chain transactions, powered by zero knowledge technology.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Anish’s background  Panther’s value proposition  UX &amp; on-chain privacy  Panther’s multi-asset shielded pool architecture  KYC &amp; KYT  Shielded zones and transactions  Zone administrator  Address mapping  Roadmap &amp; Panther mainnet  Target audience &amp; adoption  Fee model &amp; tokenomics  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/anishmohammed">Anish Mohammed on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther">Panther Protocol on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of Zebra version 1.6.0. This release exposes the shielded scanning functionality through an initial version of a gRPC server. You can find the documentation outlining how to interact with this gRPC interface in the <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/shielded-scan-grpc-server.html">Zebra Book</a>. Please note that due to this new gRPC server, building Zebra now depends on <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf">protoc</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this release we have also been making improvements to simplify the Docker images that we share. We now provide a number of new docker-compose files to make it easier to run, test and develop on Zcash using Zebra. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/main/docker/docker-compose.test.yml">docker-compose.test</a> enables anyone developing on Zebra to easily run CI locally, using a similar approach to what is run through GitHub Actions. We also want to make it easy for users to use Zebra and Lightwalletd without the risk of losing their cached states, so we are now providing <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/main/docker/docker-compose.lwd.yml">docker-compose.lwd</a> to run zebrad with lightwalletd.</p>

We talk about all that, but that’s not even the main event.</p> <p>The Main Event is Ether the asset and a new reference rate he’s building on top of it. This sounds in the weeds but it’s actually actually key to unlocking trillions in new financial products.

 Introducing Nym Squad League — Dawn of the&nbsp;Nymja  Kickstarting four seasons of quests, missions and campaigns to bring strong privacy to the world — so roll up your sleeves and get&nbsp;ready. <p>In the ever-evolving landscape of the digital realm, a clandestine force known as the Nymjas has emerged, weaving through the intricate web of the internet with a singular purpose — to safeguard the privacy of individuals worldwide.</p><p>These enigmatic figures, reminiscent of ancient ninjas, are not bound by the shadows but instead thrive in the decentralised expanse of&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>In the lore of the Nymja, these digital guardians are dedicated to maintaining a network of mixnodes, ensuring the protective veil of privacy is cast over the entire internet, enabling privacy for all of humanity.</p><p>Nym is a powerful privacy system bringing network level privacy to the entire internet. What makes Nym powerful is the fact that it is decentralised. And what makes it decentralised is the Nym community of operators, stakers and creators. Last year saw thousands of people join Nym community channels across the world and more than 40 new squads created — led by an emerging collective of&nbsp;Nymjas.</p><p>Languages: <a href="https://medium.com/@NYM_Indonesia/memperkenalkan-liga-pasukan-nym-fajar-nymja-cb1f84d11411">Bahasa Indonesia</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymportugues/apresentando-nym-squad-league-aurora-do-nymja-37888c110c4c">Português</a> // <a href="https://note.com/koko_crypto/n/n87c20b78d22b">日本</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nym_ru/%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BB%D1%8F%D0%B5%D0%BC-nym-squad-league-%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82-nymja-52c8b5bf34b1">Русский</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymturkish/kar%C5%9F%C4%B1n%C4%B1zda-nym-squad-league-nymjan%C4%B1n-do%C4%9Fu%C5%9Fu-09579ebacda7">Türkçe</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nym_china/%E4%BB%8B%E7%BB%8Dnym%E6%88%98%E9%98%9F%E8%81%94%E7%9B%9F-nymja%E7%9A%84%E9%BB%8E%E6%98%8E-ef7350750531">中文</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/introducing-nym-squad-league-dawn-of-the-nymja-268b7c4b4b6a">Español</a></p><p>Now is when the community becomes stronger, more decentralised and more independent. Now is the time of&nbsp;Nymjas.</p><p>Welcome to the Nym Squad League, Season 0: Dawn of the&nbsp;Nymja!</p> What is Nym Squad&nbsp;League? <p>Once initiated into the way of the Nymja one does not exist in solitude; Nymjas unite in a seasonal gathering, a vibrant pulse of the Nym Squad&nbsp;League.</p><p>The Nym Squad League gathers Nymjas and their squads into seasonal missions to propel the success of the overall mission: to enable privacy for all of humanity.</p><p>This is not a conventional competition, but a collaborative exhibition of skill, artful dedication and innovation, where Nymjas compare notes, exchange strategies, and celebrate the collective progress made in fortifying the digital bastions of&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Here’s how it&nbsp;works:</p>  At the beginning of each Season, a set of Missions are announced that align with the goals of Nym for that quarter. The first season is for Nymja and Shinobi&nbsp;only.  People who have been active in the Nym community can already <a href="https://app.deform.cc/form/556b3376-e34a-4006-b2b3-86f2b03a3fdc/">register as a Nymster! </a>Starting with Season 1 (April 2024), Nymsters will get to compete for a dedicated prize pool by acing challenges, completing quests and achievements, contributing to seasonal objectives, and&nbsp;more.  If they prove their skills, Nymsters will be invited to become a Nymja, giving them the ability to complete Missions and access to rolling contracts, for example running community channels.  Outstanding Nymjas might be invited to join the innermost circle: the Shinobi. These are Nym community experts, more knowledgeable at times than even the core team. Shinobi run programmes and have priority access to the Nym Innovation Fund.  At the end of each Season, the Squad Wealth Fund distributes rewards to community members who have excelled at the Missions.   Dawn of the Nymja:&nbsp;Missions <p>Season 0: Dawn of the Nymjas has already begun, with Nymja and Shinobi having received their first missions via their Dojos&nbsp;already.</p><p>This season is dedicated to sharpening the tools of the core team and community to meet the demand for the upcoming <a href="https://nymvpn.com/">NymVPN</a>. From Brazil to Ukraine and beyond, Nymjas across the world are busy testing the NymVPN, providing feedback and getting their own operations ready ahead of the NymVPN alpha&nbsp;launch.</p><p>Next season will open the doors to n00bs and Nymsters alike, for rolling bounties and ways to learn about and contribute to global&nbsp;privacy.</p> Sounds great! How do I&nbsp;start? <p>In the world of anonymity, the crowd is your friend, especially when the crowd is united by a collective mission that requires the strength of a united force. The first thing you need to do is join the Nym channels:</p>  <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> (think of it as the town square with no&nbsp;privacy)  <a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat">Element</a> (this is the Nym HQ with stronger&nbsp;privacy)  <a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">Twitter</a> (the Nym bulletin&nbsp;board)  <p>Global Telegram channels:</p><p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p><p>Once you have joined one of the Nym communities, here’s how you can progress and become a core contributor:</p><p>Nymster: constructive, entertaining and helpful activity in community channels, min 50 NYM token staked or bonded. If you meet these requirements, <a href="https://app.deform.cc/form/556b3376-e34a-4006-b2b3-86f2b03a3fdc/">register&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Nymja: you need to be recommended by two existing Nymjas or core team and have submitted outstanding proof-of-work in your Nymster missions.</p><p>Shinobi: by Nym Core Team invitation only.</p><p>Nym Squad League is beyond a competition. It symbolises a community of individuals bound by a common cause — the relentless pursuit of privacy in the digital age.

The mechanics are as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Every quarter, a new <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-node-delegation-programme-is-now-open-c371c74610c5">Nym Node Delegations Program</a> begins, with official delegations going to high-performing nodes in key regions. This is to ensure good coverage and that new operators have a chance to get into the ‘active set’ of the mixnet, start mixing traffic and providing privacy.  At the end of the quarter, staking rewards are redeemed and put into the Squad Wealth Fund to support the Nym Squad League missions that have been completed that&nbsp;season.  Nym nodes in the delegation program are regularly assessed for performance, stake saturation and uptime. Completed (fully saturated) and underperforming nodes are removed on a rolling basis, refilled with queued high-quality Nym&nbsp;nodes.  <p>The first round of delegations were made in January, with rewards being redeemed at the end of March to reward Nymjas and Shinobi missions.</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/introducing-nym-squad-league-dawn-of-the-nymja-268b7c4b4b6a">Introducing Nym Squad League — Dawn of the Nymja</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Today, Brave is excited to announce the release of Leo—Brave’s privacy-preserving AI assistant built right into the browser—on all Android devices. Android users who update to version 1.63 can ask Leo questions, summarize pages, translate pages, create content, and more from both the browser address bar and within the webpage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since launching on desktop three months ago, Brave Leo has seen significant global adoption. With the chat interface built right in the browser and several large language models (LLMs) to choose from, Leo makes it easy to interact with AI in a seamless, familiar way. Leo can help users answer questions, navigate different tasks, and accomplish more each day. And the experience has only gotten better—and the answers more accurate and timely—with the addition of new integrations and <a>new models like Mixtral</a>.</p>
<p>Now, that same great Leo experience is available for users with Android phones and tablets. Brave Android users can seamlessly interact with AI without leaving the security of the browser, and maximize productivity no matter where they are.</p>

 What can Leo do? 
<p>Leo can handle any number of tasks, both in the context of the webpages you’re viewing and completely separate from this context. Among other things, Leo can:</p>
 
 Create real-time summaries of webpages or videos 
 Answer questions about content 
 Generate new long form written content 
 Translate pages, analyze, or rewrite them 
 Create transcriptions of video or audio content 
 Write code 
 
<p>So what can you do with Leo on mobile? Summarize that long webpage you meant to read at the office, but never got around to. Get help hunting for a product mentioned on that page and compare it to others. Plan a recipe for tonight’s dinner. And get smart travel tips to escape the daily grind.</p>
<p>With Leo on Android, you can maximize productivity as you move between home, office, and anywhere else you go. All with the same privacy and security guarantees of the Brave browser. With Brave Leo, there’s no login or signup required—you just open your browser and chat. Privately.</p>

 Mixtral as the default LLM brings higher quality answers 
<p>Brave Leo gives access to several high-quality large-language models (LLMs), ensuring better, more relevant answers to even niche questions, and fewer of the hallucinations that plague other AI experiences.</p>
<p>Out of the box, Leo includes access to Mixtral 8x7B, Claude Instant, and Llama 2 13B. Mixtral—the default LLM—can interact in multiple languages including English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. It can even generate code.</p>
<p>Mixtral 8x7B has quickly gained popularity and usage among the developer community since its December, 2023 release. Mixtral 8x7B currently outperforms ChatGPT 3.5, Claude Instant, Llama 2, and many others, according to the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard">LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard</a>. Mixtral also shows improvements in reducing hallucinations and biases, <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/">according to the BBQ benchmark</a>.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, <a>we recently set Mixtral 8x7B as the default LLM</a> for Leo on desktop, and we’ve seen great feedback. And while Mixtral is the default LLM for Android as well, users have the option to select from other LLMs, or to upgrade to Leo Premium for higher rate limits.</p>

 Leo Premium&nbsp; 
<p>The Brave Leo experience is free to all users. For those who’d like access to higher rate limits, however, Leo is also available as a Premium experience. Users can subscribe to Leo Premium for <a href="https://account.brave.com/?intent=checkout&amp;product=leo">$14.99/month</a>, and one subscription covers up to 5 different devices across Android, Linux, macOS, and Windows. Users log into their Brave account from their other devices with that subscription.</p>

 Smart AI, still private by default 
<p>As with all of Brave’s other features, privacy remains paramount for Brave Leo. Chats with Leo are private and secure. Leo doesn’t record chats, or use them for model training, and no account or login is required to use Leo. These specific privacy protections in Leo include:</p>
 
 
<p>Reverse proxy: All requests are proxied through an anonymization server so the request and user cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address.</p>
 
 
<p>Responses discarded: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded after they’re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers that can be linked to you (such as <a>IP address</a>), and no personal data is retained by Brave-hosted AI models. If you select a model from Anthropic and submit Leo queries, that data will be processed by Anthropic for a period of 30 days, then deleted.</p>
 
 
<p>No login or account required for access for the free version: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo (they access their Premium account if they wish to use Leo across multiple devices however).&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Unlinkable subscription: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you use to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience.</p>
 
 

 What’s next for Leo, and how to get started 
<p>Brave Leo for Android is now available to all Brave Android users who’ve updated to version 1.63. Note that it will be rolled out in phases over the next few days, so users should check back soon if they’re not seeing it today.  Brave Leo for iOS devices will be available in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Ready to try Brave Leo? It’s easy: Simply open the browser, begin typing in the address bar, and click  “Ask Leo”. For the on page chat experience, Android users can tap “⋮” and then tap Leo to get started.</p>

      Delivering Instacart’s Next Chapter         
	By Davy Rothbart	 



Published February 26, 2024
        From fishing village to Silicon Valley, Instacart CEO Fidji Simo is tackling the grocery shopping ecosystem.      



 
<p>Fidji Simo sat in a San Francisco hotel room, poring over details for the coming day. As CEO of tech upstart Instacart, the next morning—September 19, 2023—would be a landmark day. Simo was leading the company’s IPO, a historic moment that would be held at Instacart’s headquarters in downtown San Francisco. Nasdaq staff had flown in from New York City to oversee the event, and Simo’s own parents had made the journey from France. Though Simo was known for her equanimity, she was electric with anticipation.</p>



<p>Her husband, Remy Miralles, encouraged her to try to get some sleep. Miralles had been by Simo’s side throughout her journey: from a high schooler in France with big dreams to an MBA student in the United States; from helping scale Facebook, the world’s biggest social media network, to taking the helm as CEO at Instacart, where she led the company through a dramatic period of transition as she prepared it to go public. “Promise me one thing,” Miralles said. “Tomorrow, you’ll be pulled in a million directions. You’ll be focused on what comes next. Please, savor the moment.”</p>



<p>Simo knew he was right. It would be a mistake to breeze past this momentous occasion with her gaze set solely on the future. As the winds off the Bay whistled outside, Simo settled in to wait for the new day to begin.</p>



 



<p>Sète, population 44,576 (about the size of San Luis Obispo), is a bucolic fishing town in the south of France, on the Mediterranean Sea. For generations, Simo’s family, Sicilian by heritage, had worked in the fishing industry. Her grandfather, Rocco, was the captain of a fishing vessel; her father, Jacques, rose through the ranks to captain his own boat. They worked long, hard days, sometimes as long as 18 hours, heading out to sea at 2 in the morning and returning at 8 in the evening with a fresh haul of bass, sole, hake, monkfish, sardines and anchovies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Simo’s grandmother, Viviane, was a fishmonger who sold what her husband caught at a tiny shop in the center of town. Simo took pride in her family’s hard work and their crucial, if perhaps underappreciated, role in supplying food for the village and beyond. But she knew she would never follow in their footsteps. As a kid, though it thrilled her to join her dad at sea, she always got seasick, a malady she never outgrew. Simo preferred being on land and cherished her time in the city gardens with her sketchbook in hand, filling a blank page with drawings inspired by Gaudí and the Surrealists, or in her mother’s boutique, admiring her entrepreneurial spirit and the kind, authentic way she interacted with customers. Over time, Simo developed an interest in business and dreamed of one day launching one of her own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One night, the radio Simo’s grandfather kept on the dining room table crackled to life—an emergency transmission. A fishing boat was in rough seas, in desperate trouble. While her father and other fishermen scrambled into boats to aid the rescue mission, Simo stayed by her grandfather’s side, listening as the captains worked together to organize the rescue, riveted by their composure under pressure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The memory has always stuck with Simo—a demonstration of the power of leadership and community in a moment of crisis. As boat captains, Simo’s dad and grandfather often spoke of their responsibilities, not only in keeping their crews safe but making sure each person on board felt valued. They were the kinds of leaders who wouldn’t assign a task they weren’t willing to do themselves, never too regal to scrub decks or disentangle nets. “The crew comes before you, always,” Simo says, summarizing the ethos her dad and grandfather modeled. For her, this approach has been a lifelong priority. The world of tech may seem vastly distant from life aboard a fishing boat on the Mediterranean Sea, but for Simo, her childhood yielded lasting lessons.</p>



 



<p>After high school, when Simo left her hometown to go to business school at HEC Paris, Miralles went with her. The two had met as teenagers and formed a friendship that would evolve into a lifelong partnership. As she closed in on her master’s degree, Simo elected to take courses at UCLA, fulfilling a long-held dream of moving to the U.S. that she’d nurtured through an obsession with the Southern California TV drama “The O.C.” Again, Miralles joined her. Their decision to move overseas, far from their home and close-knit families, wasn’t made lightly. But Simo, like her parents and grandparents before her, had always been one to rush toward a challenge, not run away. What’s more, she had Miralles’ support, a confidence that would give her the courage to make bold decisions time and again in her career. And she was intrigued by what she viewed as a U.S. appetite for entrepreneurial risk-taking—in business and in developing new technologies.</p>



<p>On the flight to Los Angeles, she blasted the theme song to “The O.C.,” “California” by Phantom Planet, through her headphones: “California, here we come!” She knew the future would come with challenges, but sitting back in her seat, she relished the joy of it beginning.</p>



 



<p>After UCLA, Simo spent four years on eBay’s strategy team before moving to Facebook in 2011. The company had already seen explosive growth but continued to expand its scope. As VP of video, games and monetization, Simo tackled challenges with relish, defying skeptics at every turn. Few believed Facebook could monetize mobile, but Simo cracked the problem by introducing a robust advertising network to the Facebook App, which proved to be a turning point for the company. When there were doubts as to whether the company could compete with YouTube given its eight-year head start on video, Simo and her team built Facebook Live and Facebook Watch, pioneering new approaches to video streaming and generating massive engagement.</p>



<p>In time, Simo developed a powerful sponsor in CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Working alongside him at “the school of Zuck,” as she calls it, Simo learned crucial lessons about balancing long-term strategy and vision with a commitment to short-term execution. “A lot of great operators can do the day-to-day, nitty-gritty work, but don’t have vision,” Simo says. “And a lot of people have great vision, but can’t execute for the life of them. Mark has both. And that really shaped me.”</p>



<p>Zuckerberg’s faith in Simo was apparent when he gave her the reins to the flagship Facebook App, where she would manage a staff of 6,000. As Simo dug excitedly into the new challenge, however, she suddenly began dealing with a constellation of frightening physical symptoms: dizziness, nausea and frequent fainting spells. She was eventually diagnosed with a neuroimmune condition called postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS), which is not life-threatening but can be debilitating.</p>



<p>Determined to rise to the occasion of leading the Facebook App, Simo refused to let the diagnosis hold her back. Instead, she found creative ways of managing her symptoms in the workplace, like bringing a reclining chair into the boardroom to ensure her blood pressure didn’t drop during long meetings. Facebook rallied around her during this time—an outpouring of community support that echoed what she’d experienced as a child in Sète’s fishing scene.</p>



<p>Despite Simo’s successes and close relationships at Facebook, as a creative soul, she yearned to one day be a CEO herself. She viewed the CEO position as the ultimate canvas to shape a business following her own instincts and imagination. She was fascinated with the idea of solving a company’s most critical puzzles. In 2021, when she was approached by a major tech company in need of new ideas and fresh vision on its board, her ears perked up.</p>
 







 
<p>Instacart was founded in 2012 by Apoorva Mehta, Max Mullen and Brandon Leonardo. After an initial rejection, it famously secured a spot in Y Combinator when the founders ordered a six-pack of beer that was delivered to the partners. Michael Moritz, formerly a partner at Sequoia, led its investment in the company soon after.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following nearly a decade of steady growth, Instacart became essential during the pandemic as shopping went digital, and its sales surged. But as quarantine waned and people returned to shopping in person, Instacart’s growth declined. The company recognized it needed to redefine itself in a post-COVID world. Founder-CEO Mehta was the first to identify Simo for the board, noting that her scaled operating experience and product expertise would be valuable as the company navigated the path forward.</p>



<p>While maintaining her role at Facebook, Simo joined Instacart’s board in January 2021 as the company was strategizing on how to expand its ambitions. “Instacart’s mission of helping people access food resonated deeply with me,” she says. “Growing up in a family who for generations harvested food from the sea and brought it ashore, it was this ancestral, deeply cultural connection.”&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Instacart’s mission of helping people access food resonated deeply with me,”</p>
Fidji Simo</blockquote>



<p>Later that summer, Instacart and Mehta began pursuing a successor for his role to lead the company into its next chapter—someone with a vision for Instacart’s future and experience running an organization at the scale the company hoped to achieve. Moritz, impressed with Simo’s board contributions, began championing her for the role. Recognizing her CEO potential and ambition, he wryly commented to Simo that she would grow old waiting for the chance at Facebook. “Michael had the wisdom of having seen so many people navigate this career moment,” Simo says. “He told me, ‘If one of your goals is to be a CEO, to make a difference and see what you can do when you can drive your own vision, Instacart is your canvas.’”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the position’s appeal, Simo knew it came with pressure and risk. “At the time, Instacart’s gross transaction volume was declining by double digits,” Simo remembers. While Instacart’s success—and her own as its CEO—wasn’t guaranteed, Simo was drawn to the challenge of steering the company’s evolution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After a series of visits from Moritz at her home to discuss the role’s challenges and potential—and bond over her husband’s recipe for madeleines—she was about ready to accept. When she asked Miralles his opinion, he encouraged her to listen to her instincts for where she would find joy. “That’s where you’ll do your best work,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In August 2021, Simo became CEO of Instacart, a seismic industry move that made headlines around the world. Now, the hard work could finally begin.</p>



 



<p>Simo was aware of the whispers in Silicon Valley that Instacart would never be profitable. As newly minted CEO, she was determined to prove skeptics wrong, as she had throughout her career.</p>



<p>Early in her new role as CEO, Simo observed a tension between Instacart and its retail partners, the grocery stores where Instacart shoppers shopped. To the retailers, Simo says, it wasn’t clear if Instacart was a friend or a “frenemy.” She recognized that Instacart was reliant on its retailers for success and sought to strengthen these relationships in a way that was symbiotic. If Instacart could help retailers thrive, she intuited, the company would also prosper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To achieve this, Simo revamped Instacart’s company values and instituted a new leadership ethos known as Grow the Pie to help grocers improve their own processes—both in-store and online—via new technologies. Instacart partnered with over 100 grocery chains like Sprouts and Publix to build smooth, sleek, white-label websites that are individually branded but powered by Instacart. Now, whether a customer orders groceries through Instacart or a grocer’s site, both parties benefit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of Simo’s superpowers is innovating new products, and a major appeal of the CEO role was getting to push product visions forward. As part of its omnichannel strategy, Simo made the decision to acquire Caper AI, a startup offering AI-powered grocery carts. When an in-store customer places an item in a Caper Cart, the cart is able to scan it and add the price to a running tally. The screen serves as a payment terminal, so when a customer is done shopping, they can avoid the line and head for the parking lot. The cart is also outfitted with a screen where brands can suggest recipes and advertise products, a significant revenue opportunity for both Instacart and the stores.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“These changes have allowed Instacart to reach beyond its roots as a service fulfillment company into managing the full grocery shopping ecosystem.”</p>
Fidji Simo</blockquote>



<p>Once retailers were confident that their goals were aligned with Instacart’s, they found other ways to more deeply integrate, adding new online offerings that enabled customers to access every aisle of the store—including alcohol, produce and packaged goods—and to pay via a variety of payment methods, including EBT SNAP. “These changes have allowed Instacart to reach beyond its roots as a service fulfillment company into managing the full grocery shopping ecosystem, while partner stores also benefit,” Simo says. “It’s been absolutely thrilling to see.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simo recognized the critical role played not just by partner stores, but by Instacart’s shoppers. To understand their motivations and challenges, Simo tried her hand at being a shopper herself. The experiment was humbling. Finding parking at a San Francisco grocery store called Gus’s was in itself a daunting feat. Then, managing a customer’s particular dietary preferences presented another challenge. As Simo roamed the aisles trying to locate a specific brand of kombucha (a product that this fish-and-potatoes girl had never tried), a store manager came to her aid and helped her complete the order. “I got a sense for how resourceful the shoppers are and how difficult a job it can be,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simo began holding regular one-on-one meetings with shoppers, too. She notes that Instacart’s shoppers vary demographically from other gig economy workers: about two-thirds are women and approximately half are parents. Simo says the shoppers provided “a tapestry of reasons” why they were drawn to Instacart, though for most of them the flexible hours—and locations—were key. One shopper had a severely disabled daughter and was able to clock in for short stretches when someone else was available to offer support at home. Another woman had always dreamed of traveling to all 50 states. Working for Instacart allowed her to have a job on hand wherever she traveled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simo made it her mission for Instacart to introduce new technologies that would increase shopper efficiency and boost their pay. Instacart began alerting shoppers to peak earnings days; prompted customers to increase tips when they rated a shopper five stars; created batch orders so that a shopper could grab items for multiple customers on a single trip to the grocery store; and built in-app way-finding technologies that allow shoppers to navigate aisles and collect items in a more efficient pattern. These efforts have largely succeeded; Shopper salaries, on a per-hour basis, have consistently notched up. “I’m proud that shoppers are now making more than they did in the past,” Simo says.</p>

<p>Simo was chosen to lead Instacart because investors believed she could grow the company and reimagine it, but also because they felt she could ready the company to go public. In late 2021, however, the tech industry was hit by a market collapse and subsequent IPO drought. Given this difficult climate, a less ambitious person might have shelved the prospect of going public altogether. But Simo was keenly aware of the hundreds of Instacart employees who had worked tirelessly for years, for whom an IPO could be life-changing, allowing them a cash liquidity she felt they’d clearly earned. Simo promised her employees that when the market grew receptive, Instacart would be one of the first companies to go public. To do so, however, Simo “quickly realized that we needed to show the world that this was an industry that was profitable.”</p>



<p>Ravi Gupta, a former CFO and COO at Instacart who became a partner at Sequoia in 2019, became a trusted advisor to Simo as she quickly got up to speed on where Instacart had been and put a strategy in place for the future. Recalling their conversations, Gupta says, “She’s built to be a CEO. She wants the ball. She wants the responsibility that comes with leadership.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For two years, Simo worked with her team to pivot the company toward profitability. Product innovations—from batching orders to shopper way-finding—improved the margin on each order, and its revenue from advertising has grown significantly. Instacart now boasts more than 5,500 ad partners, including PepsiCo, General Mills and Unilever. It has introduced new ad formats such as shoppable display ads, and because Instacart (and its associated white-label sites) is a closed-loop platform, the company is able to serve up unique insights to partners about how their ads are driving sales. Instacart reported that ad campaigns drive an average 15% incremental sales lift—an almost unheard-of number.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the market downturn, Simo had observed other companies try to hang onto their former valuations, concerned about the optics of a lowered figure. “They buried their heads in the sand and pretended nothing had changed,” she says. “I took a different approach. I faced reality straight-up, and I’m like, ‘Okay, yep, the markets have changed. We are not worth the same. That’s totally okay. Let’s embrace this new reality and grant stock for employees at a fair valuation.’ We’re focused on doing what’s right, not the thing that looks good.’”</p>



<p>By the summer of 2023, Instacart had hit five consecutive quarters of profitability. As the markets continued to warm, Simo kept her promise to her team, setting an IPO date for September, with an opening price of $30 per share. With more than $2 billion in cash reserves, Simo says Instacart’s IPO was less about raising money (and, in fact, was non-dilutive) than making sure that the company’s more than 3,000 employees would finally realize the fruits of their labor.</p>



<p>Usually, when a company goes public and hits the Nasdaq exchange, a few lead executives show up in New York City to ring the bell and celebrate. But Simo knew the company’s success was a result of the employees who had contributed throughout the years, and she wanted all of them to have the chance to participate in the festivities. So she asked Nasdaq officials to come to San Francisco.</p>



<p>The night before the IPO, her husband’s suggestion to be present resonated deeply. The next morning, as the company gathered in the employee cafeteria, now decked out with its CART ticker symbol, Simo circulated among employees, the executive team, the founders and their families, and felt her emotions rise. She and her husband had also invited their 8-year-old daughter Willow to join the occasion, as well as Simo’s parents and grandmother Viviane—the former fishmonger—who’d arrived from her hometown of Sète. “I started seeing the scene through their eyes,” Simo says. “I hadn’t made a big deal out of it, and I don’t think they really knew what to expect. But when I saw the tears in their eyes, it flipped a switch in me.” In particular, Simo was moved by the sight of her dad, Jacques—the hardened fishing captain who could pull a hook out of his hand without flinching—now radiant, bursting with pride and tearing up.</p>



<p>Cameras rolled, broadcasting the ceremony around the world, as Simo stood on stage with Instacart’s executive team and rang the bell, marking Instacart’s emergence as a publicly traded company. For 90 seconds, she clapped along with her colleagues, sharing the joy, accomplishment and pride of the moment. “And then right after the cameras turned off,” she says, “I was just a sobbing mess.”</p>



<p>Through her tears, Simo picked up a microphone and made an impromptu toast, shining a light on Instacart’s co-founders and talented workforce. “I had this immense feeling of gratitude,” Simo says, “because I realized how much of a privilege it was to lead a team like this, and work toward a mission that can make a difference in the world.” Simo says what gives her the most joy in business is finding the magic in others and celebrating it. To have the chance to big-up her hard-working team in front of their colleagues—and even their own families—swept her with another wave of happy tears. Finally, Simo welcomed her daughter, Willow, to join her on the podium, and as a chorus of flashbulbs popped, they both grinned—dreaming of the future, but fully present in the moment.</p>



 



<p>The art studio in Simo’s home, dubbed the flower room, is a space dedicated to her personal projects: paintings, sculptures and collages. Simo takes flowers by the dozens, hangs them up to dry and then uses their distinctive natural dyes as a material in her art. Simo’s health condition makes intensive exercise a no-go, so when she wants to tune out work stress, the flower room is her sanctuary. One recent Saturday afternoon, she huddled with Willow in the flower room, sculpting magic wands out of sticks and flowers. Together, they pretended to imbue each wand with special powers: levitating objects, stopping time.</p>



<p>Though Simo’s free time is limited, she squeezes every drop out of it, cherishing moments with her daughter and the occasional dinner out with Miralles. She also, bogglingly, has found the bandwidth to create the Metrodora Institute, which opened in April 2023 in Salt Lake City. Metrodora, named after a fifth-century female Greek physician, welcomes those living with diseases that many doctors fail to diagnose and often do not know how to treat. The center offers clinical care and conducts scientific research with the goal of developing cures for complex chronic conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Challenges can spur creation,” Simo says. It’s a motto she reiterates to her team at Instacart as the company continues to work to expand its scope and prove its durability in what remains a challenging environment for many public tech companies. One of the initiatives to broaden Instacart’s horizons relates to Simo’s interest in health care and biotech. “Eighty-five percent of health care costs come from treating chronic diseases, like diabetes and hypertension, that can be caused or made worse by diets that lack key nutrients,” Simo says. “It became obvious to me that a company like Instacart, which exists at the intersection of people’s relationship with food, has a role to play in health care.” Simo conceived of Instacart Health, a program that allows doctors to prescribe food as easily as they prescribe medication. Simo imagines a future where a doctor not only recommends that a patient eat healthier, but prescribes specific meals, and by the time that patient arrives home, the ingredients for the meal are waiting on their doorstep, delivered by an Instacart shopper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But for now, here on a Saturday afternoon with her daughter, Simo’s job is to sculpt another magic wand and pass her special powers down to her own child. “I want her to see that everything is possible,” Simo says. “That’s the biggest gift that my parents gave me.” Though Simo’s family had no advanced degrees, Simo says their message to her never wavered: If you work hard and put your mind to something, you can accomplish anything. Now, Simo reflects on Instacart’s IPO, and her special moment on stage with her daughter. “I think that was when everything landed for her,” Simo says. “Like, ‘Okay, wow, this is a big moment. And Mom is right! We can do big things.’”</p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation engineering team has been working on an implementation library for <a href="https://zfnd.org/frost/">FROST</a> (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures) for Zcash. To support this we have built <a href="https://frost.zfnd.org/zcash/ywallet-demo.html">demos</a>, which are NOT to be used in a production environment nor with any secrets. The purpose of these demos are to:</p>



 
 Identify gaps in our documentation 



 Provide usage examples for developer facing documentation 



 Provide reference implementations for developers wanting to use FROST in a “real world” scenario 
 



 



<p></p>



 THREE DEMOS 



<p>We have three demos in this project covering each of the corresponding roles, which are:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Trusted Dealer: a third party or participant who is trusted to:
 
 Generate good randomness 



 Keep secret values confidential 



 Delete secret values after distributing key shares to each participant 
 
 



 Participant: a recipient of a key share 



 Coordinator: a third party or participant who is responsible for:
 
 Determining which participants will take part in generating a signature 



 Coordinating FROST signature rounds 



 Aggregating signature shares generated by each participant 



 Publishing the resulting signature 
 
 
 



 



<p>Note: We also have <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost-zcash-demo/tree/main/dkg">a demo</a> which covers Distributed Key Generation (DKG), where there is no trusted dealer role and participants generate key shares among themselves.</p>



 



<p></p>



<p>We invite you to&nbsp; test the demos for yourself by following <a href="https://frost.zfnd.org/zcash/ywallet-demo.html">our tutorial</a>, which was showcased during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvzESdDtczo&amp;list=PL40dyJ0UYTLII7oQRQmNOFf0d2iKT35tL&amp;index=37">our presentation at ZCon4</a>. The demos allow you to choose one of two journeys—either with a trusted dealer or DKG for key generation. This tutorial describes the trusted dealer journey.</p>



 



 HOW WE BUILT THEM 



<p>The method for building these demos included:</p>



 
 Reading the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852.pdf">FROST paper</a> 



 Reading the <a href="https://cfrg.github.io/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost-15/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost.html">FROST draft</a> 



 Reading documentation in the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/frost-core">FROST crate</a> 



 Reading documentation in library while building the demos 



 Referring to the draft paper to match the documentation 
 



<p>When building a protocol library from a paper, names are likely to change and you need to document the code well; it’s not uncommon to find mismatches. We tried to build the demo from the perspective of someone who had not seen FROST before, and so we went through all the documentation without any assumptions. We also started publishing releases more often so the demos could be updated as we found different API changes we needed to make. This encouraged us to properly document throughout the process.</p>



 



 NEW FUNCTIONALITY 



<p>We realized that we hadn’t created a way for the trusted dealer to accept an existing key rather than allowing the application to generate one for you. Originally we weren’t able to specify an existing secret because generate_trusted_dealer() generated a secret for you. We compared this functionality to that specified in the draft paper and&nbsp; it was discovered this was missing; so we added split_secret() to handle this functionality and trusted_dealer_keygen()would generate one instead.</p>



<p>We also took this opportunity to add serde support to our FROST library. Serde is a library that helps encoding structures into multiple formats such as JSON or XML. We’d had a request to implement serde in our FROST library and decided that the demos created a good opportunity to get this done, since they require copying and pasting structures between terminals. It was pretty straightforward and it meant we could copy structures encoded as a single line JSON object between our terminals, instead of having to copy and paste each field of each structure.</p>



<p>Working on these demos has enabled us to make the library more robust and easier to use for implementers. We’d love to know if you agree!</p>



<p>We hope that this will help anyone understand how frost works and what you can do with it. Please do let us know if you’ve found this useful by reaching out to us on the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/676527656170160146/997122644048613427">ZF Discord FROST channel</a>.</p>

<p>Confidential-DPproof uses Zero Knowledge Proofs for verifiable privacy protection, and garners Spotlight award at prestigious ICLR 2024 conference</p>
<p>by Ali Shahin Shamsabadi, Privacy Researcher at Brave&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Summary. Machine learning models trained on clients’ data without any guarantees of privacy can leak sensitive information about clients. For example, in the application of machine learning to advertising, we ideally want to learn the general patterns (“showing scientific advertisements to clients visiting scientifically related contents”), however parameters of a trained machine learning model might encode specific facts about the interest of an individual client (“Ali visited <a>https://brave.com/research/</a> on 26 Feb 2024.”). Unfortunately, some institutions may not adhere to their claim of training machine learning models with client privacy</p>
 
 Intentionally: not considering client privacy while training the models, or considering inadequate privacy safeguards to achieve better model utility; or&nbsp; 
 Accidentally: hard-to-detect bugs occurred in the implementation of privacy requirements of learning algorithms. 
 
<p>We introduce verifiable private training (Confidential-DPproof – Confidential proof of differentially private training) which enhances training with a certificate of privacy while not revealing any information about the data and model.</p>
<p><a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=PQY2v6VtGe">Confidential-DPproof</a> is accepted at the 12th International Conference on Learning Representations <a href="https://iclr.cc/">ICLR2024</a> as a spotlight (top 5%) paper. Confidential-DPproof will be presented at the conference between May 7th and 11th in Vienna, Austria. <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=PQY2v6VtGe">Confidential-DPproof</a> is available in an open-source implementation, and can be used by institutions to offer verifiable privacy protection to clients in machine learning based products.</p>

 Why should we care about client’s privacy when training machine learning models on their data? 
<p>Machine learning models that are trained without a privacy-preserving algorithm can memorize sensitive information about their training set. Publishing the parameters, or even just the outputs, of machine learning models can consequently risk the privacy of the clients who contributed to their training process. For example,&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.05820.pdf">Membership inference attacks</a>: exploit access to a model’s outputs to infer the presence (or absence) of a particular data point in its training set. 
 <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=oVn5GLyONY">Data reconstruction attacks</a>: reconstruct the original training data points through an analysis of the model’s parameters.&nbsp; 
 

 How can we protect client’s privacy? 
<p>The framework of <a href="https://www.iacr.org/archive/tcc2006/38760266/38760266.pdf">Differential Privacy</a> is the gold standard for formalizing privacy guarantees. When training machine learning models, a Differential Privacy training algorithm provides guarantees for individuals by ensuring that data contributed by each individual client has a bounded influence on the final model in a mathematically precise manner. Therefore, absence or presence of a client will not result in a significantly different model.</p>
<p>Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent is the canonical approach to training machine learning models with guarantees of Differential Privacy. Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent imposes two main modifications to vanilla Stochastic Gradient Descent to provide differential privacy guarantees: 1) clipping per-example gradients to a fixed norm to bound the algorithm’s sensitivity to each individual client’s data (assuming each client only contributes one data point to the training); 2) adding calibrated noise to gradients before they are applied to update the model to ensure indistinguishability across updates. Training machine learning models with Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent mitigates all attacks against the privacy of training data that fall within the threat model of differential privacy, including membership inference and training data reconstruction.</p>

 Why should we care about verifiable privacy? 
<p>Implementing Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent training algorithms can be challenging and hard-to-detect errors can easily occur as a result of uncommon and complex modification to the underlying training optimizer. Therefore, institutions may not adhere to their claims of training machine learning models with differential privacy guarantees intentionally (e.g., if they are trying to evade privacy regulations to maximize utility) or accidentally (e.g., if there are hard-to-detect bugs in the implementation of their private algorithm). For example, see Apple’s ambiguity around not releasing the exact privacy budget of a deployed Differential Privacy mechanism and/or other relevant details: <a href="https://www.cs.brynmawr.edu/Courses/cs380/fall2019/Papers/privacylossappleproducts.pdf">Privacy Loss in Apple’s Implementation of Differential Privacy on MacOS 10.12</a>.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important for companies or other institutions that use DP-SGD to demonstrate that they train models within the privacy constraints expressed by clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Confidential-DPproof framework 
<p>We designed a framework, called <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=PQY2v6VtGe">Confidential-DPproof</a>, that allows institutions to directly and proactively prove to any interested party–users or customers, regulators or governments–, through the execution of a Zero Knowledge Proof protocol, that their machine learning models are trained in a privacy-preserving manner (i.e., protecting the privacy of individuals who provided their data for the training).</p>


    
    

    


    




 How does Confidential-DPproof work? 
<p>In our work, we propose a zero-knowledge proof protocol to proactively generate a certificate of privacy during the training process while preserving the confidentiality of all information including training data and model parameters.&nbsp; Zero-knowledge proof allows a party to prove statements about their private data without revealing it. Therefore, the prover’s dataset or model is not revealed to external parties.</p>
<p>Parties. Consider a setting with two parties, a prover and an auditor:</p>
 
 The prover is an institution that wants to train a model on a sensitive dataset for different purposes such as providing machine learning based services. 
 The auditor is an external entity (e.g., a user or an auditor) that aims to verify the privacy guarantees of the prover’s model. 
 
<p>Desiderata.</p>
 
 Completeness. The auditor must infer the exact privacy guarantee and provide a public certificate of such guarantee. 
 Soundness. The auditor must be able to catch malicious provers who do not adhere to their claims of training machine learning models with privacy guarantees, either intentionally or accidentally. 
 Zero Knowledge. The training data and model parameters computed during training must stay confidential as institutions are not willing/allowed to share their models and data with external parties due to privacy regulations and intellectual property concerns. 
 
<p>Confidential-DPproof framework works as follows:</p>
 
 Prover publicly announces the privacy guarantees that it is planning to provide; 
 Prover and auditor agree on the Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent training algorithm and specific values for its hyperparameters. 
 Prover and auditor run our newly-proposed zero-knowledge protocol. 
 Prover obtains a certificate for the claimed privacy guarantee. 
 

 How is the performance of Confidential-DPproof? 
<p>Since we design Confidential-DPproof to enable institutions to prove the differential privacy guarantees of their model to an auditor while being able to protect the confidentiality of their data and model, our experiments consider the following questions:</p>
 
 What are the best trade-offs between utility and certified privacy guarantees that Confidential-DPproof can achieve given i)&nbsp; the respective interests of the institution (in terms of utility); ii)&nbsp; the respective interests of auditor (in terms of privacy); and iii) constraints imposed by Zero-Knowledge proof regarding the complexity of models? 
 What is the cost (in terms of running time) of verifying the training run while ensuring confidentiality? 
 
<p>

    
    

    


    



ConfidentialDPproof trains machine learning models that achieve high test accuracy with certified privacy guarantees in practical running time!</p>

 Want to improve Confidential-DPproof? 
<p>Confidential-DPproof provides many benefits to institutions and their users; however, there is still room for improvement. For example, one could further extend Confidential-DPproof to prove that no adversarial data manipulation, such as sharing information across data points, was performed prior to data commitment.</p>

<p>The monolithic blockchain era appears to be sunsetting. Among the first to contribute to this paradigm shift was Cosmos, which introduced the idea of specialized sovereign blockchains (appchains), made possible by the Cosmos SDK. Nowadays, the modular thesis employs external data availability and even execution solutions, which enables the creation of countless new chains. Each new blockchains comes with its own ‘specs’, and centralised RPC and node providers have to adapt to each chain’s setting. However, the saying ‘Jack of all trades, master of none’ applies in this scenario too - we have often witnessed RPC failures during high demand periods. Lava Network aims to provide a competitive marketplace for RPC and node providers, which would compete based on their performance and user feedback.</p><p>We were joined by Gil and Yair to discuss Lava Network’s RPC decentralisation in the modular, multi-chain landscape.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  High-level overview of Lava Network  What problem Lava Network solves  Decentralised marketplace for RPC providers  Quality of centralised vs. decentralised RPC providers  Gateways  Lava Network participants  Specs &amp; APIs  Quality of service &amp; provider optimizer  How services are priced  Relayers  Modularity &amp; chain abstraction  Magma &amp; Lava mainnet  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/yaircleper">Yair Cleper on LinkedIn</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/xgilxgil">Gil Binder on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/lavanetxyz">Lava Network on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>As transparent Central Bank Digital Currency <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/euro-backed-stablecoin-eurm-trials-spain?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">(CBDC) pilots</a> continue to gain traction, on-chain privacy has exploded into one of the polarizing issues in the Web3 industry. However, as is the nature of polarizing extremes, neither absolute transparency nor absolute privacy will serve users' real-world needs.</p><p>In fact, the privacy vs. compliance issue has existed and has already largely been solved for, across states and time. Existing systems based in the physical domain tend to operate on the principle of default privacy. As such, state-approved mechanisms are implemented to mitigate against fraud and other dishonest practices. These introduce and enforce transparency, such as mandatory financial reporting and audit requirements. Furthermore, additional privacy protections are extended to individuals and private enterprises such that their financial reporting isn’t exposed.</p><p>In contrast, those blockchain-based, public-ledger systems that underpin DeFi operate on default transparency. This means public ledgers require additional mechanisms that preserve privacy. Then, as per their physical domain equivalents, discoverability features must be implemented to prevent money laundering, tax evasion, and other forms of malicious activity from eluding the state.</p><p>The issue, therefore, is really about Web3 accepting that while DeFi does “solve money”, it must also solve for a balance between privacy and compliance, because money will always be in the domain of the state’s law enforcement (even when the state no longer prints it).</p> Going beyond early teething pains <p>Most Web3 advocates believe that blockchain ecosystems have the potential to provide the best conditions to operate an integrated global economy that is prosperous, liquid, resilient, and fair. However, institutions are never going to agree to operate in a fully transparent environment. Compliant on-chain privacy is the catalyst required to push decentralized financial players to penetrate the mass market.</p><p>To achieve this, the Web3 community must shake off the tendency to polarize DeFi privacy projects as teetering between terrorist financier and a tyrannical surveillance facilitator. While the nascent public ledger privacy sector has been met with <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tornado-cash-strong-defense-trial?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">litigation</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/monero-drops-multi-month-lows-binance-delisting?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">critical delistings</a> — it becomes clear that now is the time for a mature solution set that respects the financial privacy rights of institutions and individual users, while providing the compliance features of its physical-domain cousins.</p><p>Now is the time to get serious about adoption. And, to achieve widespread adoption, Web3 needs to engage in a more nuanced conversation about the integral roles privacy and transparency play in facilitating the fundamental process of exchange, maintaining fair and free markets, and enabling institutions to conduct daily operations. In short, these issues are a matter of existential importance to the future of decentralized systems.</p> On-chain privacy, a problem solved <p>Panther Protocol has developed the mature, considered solution set that allows institutions and end-users to balance their privacy and compliance needs.&nbsp;</p><p>With Panther, institutional players have access to a suite of DeFi tools to manage dedicated trading spaces, called Zones, to trade digital assets in Shielded Pools — revolutionizing private trades with public, on-chain settlement.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools/zones?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther Zones</a> are highly customizable, as are their disclosure mechanisms. The Panther suite empowers institutions to leverage privacy-protocol trades with allowlisted assets and counterparties. Designed with the operational efficiencies of institutions in mind, Panther simplifies portfolio and asset management with a suite of features that provide unparalleled privacy, security, and compliance support for public on-chain transactions.&nbsp;</p><p>Panther Protocol recognizes that the path to adoption isn’t about the mechanics of privacy, transparency, or discoverability, per se; it’s about providing meaningful abstraction to the end user. Panther’s Privacy Protocol is doing for the on-chain domain what the Microsoft Office suite did for the personal computer — delivering abstractions that make it usable. However, unlike Microsoft, Panther presents a Web3-native protocol based on chain-agnostic, decentralized principles.</p><p>Here at Panther, we believe that those who understand institutional operations and pain points intimately and who apply the technical know-how to develop versatile on-chain systems with refined privacy functions will be the major winners in Web3’s next major wave: the institutional onboarding process. We intend to spearhead that revolution.</p><p>Interested in customizing your own trading Zone? Reach out to us at contact@pantherprotocol.io.</p>

<p>PIVX is thrilled to announce the launch of update v5.6.1, a crucial upgrade required for all users, including exchanges and service providers. It’s imperative that everyone updates their software prior to the implementation of the new Exchange Addresses to ensure seamless operations. With the upcoming activation height set at 4281680, the network will begin to isolate older versions to facilitate a smooth transition.</p><p>For most users, the update does not introduce any significant changes, except for the inability to send Shield Transactions to Exchange Addresses. Updating is straightforward: simply replace your existing pivxd or pivx-qt application with the latest version, or install the update via our provided installer packages.</p><p>For exchanges and service providers, the update introduces a novel feature — the “Exchange Address.” This innovation aims to simplify regulatory compliance and minimize accounting challenges associated with shielded transactions sent to exchanges. By utilizing the new RPC command getnewexchangeaddress, exchanges can generate these specialized addresses, which are identifiable by the “EXM” prefix, standing for Exchange Mainnet. This command also allows for labeling the new address, functioning similarly to existing commands like getnewaddress or getnewstakingaddress.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX/releases/tag/v5.6.1">https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX/releases/tag/v5.6.1</a></p><p>Additionally, the v5.6.1 update enhances the overall user experience with various quality-of-life improvements to the PIVX Core. These enhancements include upgraded GUI features, the ability to generate proposal addresses directly when creating proposals, CoinControl for selecting inputs for master nodes, the option to lock shield notes, and more. For a comprehensive overview of all the new features and improvements, we encourage you to read the release&nbsp;notes.</p><p>Please note that by block 4281680, the new Exchange Addresses will activate on chain, which should be around Feb 29th at 12:00 PM UTC. We will be sending our upgrade spork around ~48 hours before that, so please be sure to update before that to avoid any potential forking. All MNs will need to be “restarted” (the controller wallet will need to issue a new start message) during this&nbsp;upgrade.</p><p>This update is a testament to our commitment to continually enhancing the PIVX platform for all users, exchanges, and service providers</p><p>.<br>Many thanks to Liquid369, PIVX Core Dev for writing this announcement.</p><p>PIVXDevsRock! <br>PIVX&nbsp;Core</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/pivx-is-thrilled-to-announce-the-launch-of-pivxs-core-wallet-v5-6-1-894e66a92bf3">PIVX is thrilled to announce the launch of PIVX’s Core Wallet v5.6.1!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Today we’re announcing the highly requested and long-awaited rollout of self-custody BAT payouts for Brave Rewards. An initial group of invitees—and soon Brave users around the world—will be able to receive BAT earned from Brave Rewards to a self-custody wallet address on the Solana blockchain.</p>

 Invite only to start 
<p>Rewards on Solana is launching as an invite-only feature, starting with a limited group of early participants. Brave will send out invitations via a notification in the Brave Rewards panel. This invitation will unlock the ability for users to connect a self-custody Solana address and start receiving BAT on-chain. To find out if you’re eligible, keep an eye on Brave Rewards in your Brave browser.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    
Invitees will receive a notification in the Rewards panel and new tab page</p>
<p>To connect a Solana address to Brave Rewards, you’ll use a Solana wallet to verify that you own the address. You can do this with Brave’s very own integrated wallet, <a>Brave Wallet</a>, or with a third-party browser extension like Phantom.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    
Solana address connected to Brave Rewards</p>
<p>Once connected, monthly BAT rewards will be deposited directly on-chain to your Solana address in Wormhole-bridged <a href="https://solscan.io/token/EPeUFDgHRxs9xxEPVaL6kfGQvCon7jmAWKVUHuux1Tpz">SPL-BAT</a>. That means you’ll be able to receive earned BAT without a custodial account (though the option to receive BAT rewards via a custodian will remain available).</p>

 Only possible on Solana 
<p>We chose Solana as the ideal network for the launch of on-chain Brave Rewards given its high transaction speed and low fees, which help reduce the costs associated with distributing BAT earnings to hundreds of thousands of users. For example, a single transaction on Solana costs on average $0.002 USD, while a single transaction on Ethereum, or on its most popular layer-2 scaling solution, Arbitrum, costs on average <a href="https://l2fees.info/">$1.00 and $0.10 respectively</a>.</p>
<p>This new way of distributing BAT removes many of the barriers everyday people face when onboarding to Web3. There are no withdrawal fees or limits, since the Solana wallet is entirely owned and managed by the user. Users can earn and receive BAT directly on-chain, and use it on-chain however they like. For example, here are some great ways BAT can be used on Solana:</p>
 
 Contribute directly to your favorite <a>Brave creators with on-chain contributions</a> (details below) 
 Exchange between hundreds of tokens through the swap feature in <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/13397025065357-What-are-Brave-Swaps-">Brave Wallet</a> 
 Buy a .SOL domain from <a href="https://www.bonfida.org/">Bonfida</a> 
 Earn trading fees by depositing SPL-BAT to <a href="https://www.orca.so/">Orca</a> liquidity pools 
 Mint and buy <a>NFTs</a> with SPL-BAT 
 

 Support your favorite creators on-chain 
<p>We also <a>recently announced a new on-chain contributions feature</a> as a more Web3-native way for users to support their favorite creators, including with the SPL-BAT they earn. Supporting self custody for users and creators is an important step toward a more decentralized Brave Rewards and Brave Creators experience. Together, they further our mission of providing users with greater control over how they browse, search, and transact on the Web.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on our blog, social accounts, and <a href="https://community.brave.com/">Brave Community</a> forums for the latest news from Brave, and announcements about new rounds of Solana on-chain invites.</p>

<p>Last September, we <a>released a roadmap</a> of innovations for <a>Leo</a>, Brave’s privacy-preserving AI assistant built right into the browser.</p>
<p>Today, we’re excited to announce we’ve completed another piece of the roadmap: Leo can now interact with PDFs and Google Drive files. By seamlessly integrating with these popular productivity apps and document types, Leo enables users to save time and accomplish more at school and work, while preserving user privacy.</p>

 How we built document support 
<p>Brave’s built-in AI assistant Leo has recently gained new capabilities for understanding how to help users while using web-based tools and workflows. Specifically:</p>
 
 
<p>By using the accessibility tree in a PDF’s metadata, Leo can understand the underlying semantic structure of PDF documents.</p>
 
 
<p>By leveraging a technique called Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on canvas-rendered apps, Leo can use an image of a page to extract text in Google Docs and Google Sheets.</p>
 
 
<p>In both cases, Leo can offer insights and suggestions for users working with many different productivity applications, whether at school or at work.</p>

 Use cases for Leo’s document integrations 
<p>With this novel use of the accessibility tree, OCR, and other techniques, Leo can help with several important use cases. These include:</p>
 
 
<p>PDFs: Leo can extract topics and data deep within PDF documents. This can help with understanding research papers, preparing analysis from reports, finding details in a technical specification document, and more.</p>
 
 
<p>Google Docs: When you’re editing a Google Doc, Leo can propose relevant terms or writing styles, or even review the document as a whole.</p>
 
 
<p>Google Sheets: Leo can analyze tables and data in a Google Sheet, and even suggest formulas.</p>
 
 
<p>Slack workspaces: Leo can highlight key discussion points from a thread in a Slack workspace, extracting the thread’s essential points while saving you the time of reading the entire thread history.</p>
 
 
<p>YouTube: Leo can produce video transcripts from classes, industry events, and influencer videos. These transcripts can then be summarized for useful details mentioned in the video, and allow the user to ask Leo follow-up questions about the video or the transcript.</p>
 
 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    

 Brave Leo and unparalleled privacy 
<p>As a privacy-first company, Brave is dedicated to releasing leading alternatives to popular Web tools that also protect user data and anonymity. Leo—and its document integrations—is no different. This is particularly relevant as work and school documents may contain sensitive information:</p>
 
 
<p>Reverse proxy: All requests are proxied through an anonymization server so the request and user-address cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address.</p>
 
 
<p>Discarding of responses: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded after they’re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers such as your IP Address that can be linked to you. No personal data is retained by the AI model or any 3rd-party model providers.</p>
 
 
<p>No login or account required for access: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Unlinkable subscription: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you used to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience.</p>
 
 
<p>Just as Leo utilizes these techniques to preserve your privacy as you chat, it offers the same protections when Leo is helping you analyze documents and other files.&nbsp;</p>

 How to use Leo for PDFs and Google Drive files 
<p>Leo’s support for PDFs, Google Docs, and Google Sheets is available now for all Brave desktop users on version 1.63 or higher.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To try it out, simply open a PDF, Google Doc, or Google Sheet in a tab in the Brave browser. Then click the  in the sidebar, and start asking Leo questions about the file.</p>
<p>Don’t have Leo in the sidebar yet? Just click Settings, then click Leo, and toggle on the Show Leo icon in the sidebar option.</p>

 What’s next for Leo and document / file support? 
<p>Leo will soon support other documents and file types. For example, Leo will integrate with GitHub, allowing code reviewers to summarize the purpose and impact of pull requests by analyzing code changes without line-by-line inspection. Keep an eye out for announcements about GitHub support, and for even more document and file integrations.</p>
<p>From the beginning, we saw Leo as far more than an AI chatbot (though it can handle real-time, contextual chats with ease). Rather, we saw Leo as a true smart assistant that could help you engage with the applications you use every day, to help you learn, work, and plan more efficiently. By surfacing insights from within PDFs, suggesting text for Google Docs, writing formulas for Google Sheets, summarizing YouTube videos, analyzing code in GitHub (and more), Leo saves you time and makes you more efficient and productive.</p>

							<p>On January 3, 2024, Trail of Bits reached out to us to raise <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2024/02/20/breaking-the-shared-key-in-threshold-signature-schemes/">a denial-of-service vulnerability</a> that affects different implementations of distributed key generation (DKG) protocols. Our FROST implementation was among those impacted.</p><p>This denial-of-service vulnerability introduced the possibility of an attack being carried out as follows:&nbsp;During the DKG run, a malicious participant can generate a random polynomial with a larger number of coefficients than required. In practice, this makes the key shares generated by the protocol have a threshold that is higher than intended. For example, when generating key shares with a threshold of 2, an attacker could silently increase that value to e.g. 3. Thus, two participants would never be able to successfully generate signatures since three or more would be required. Additionally, if the attacker increases the threshold to a number higher than the number of shares, then it would be totally impossible to generate valid signatures. In the Zcash context, this could mean that deposits made into a freshly-generated FROST wallet could become unspendable, leading to loss of funds.</p><p>We do agree that this is a confirmed and important vulnerability, which has been successfully remediated by adding <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost/commit/e1fb9bc953a5ea5c22304c0018f56f407163f101">a simple check</a> to make sure the polynomials generated have the correct number of coefficients. This fix is included in the recently published 1.0.0 stable release of our FROST implementation. We are not aware of any production-ready FROST Zcash deployments using our software, so no user funds should be at risk.</p><p>We thank Trail of Bits for identifying the issue, providing a test case showing our crate was vulnerable and coordinating its disclosure.</p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation is excited to announce the first stable release of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/frost-core">frost-core</a>, a reference implementation of Two-Round Threshold Schnorr Signatures with FROST, written in Rust. This implementation has been <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2023/10/23/public-report-zcash-frost-security-assessment/">fully audited</a> and conforms to the latest and final version of the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost/">IRTF draft specification</a>, which we are confident will soon make it as a final Informational RFC.&nbsp;</p>



 



 What FROST does and why it matters 



<p>FROST is a threshold multi-party signature scheme. It allows a key to be split into multiple shares (or even to be created in a distributed fashion without having to create an original unsplit key), and then enables creating a signature by aggregating multiple signature shares created by participants who hold key shares. The threshold means that a minimum number of participants are required to be able to create a signature.</p>



<p>In the context of Zcash, this means that FROST allows creating wallets where transactions have to be authorized by multiple participants. This has multiple benefits: it’s more robust, since if a participant loses a share, it is still possible for the other participants to sign transactions (and they can help to reissue the lost share); and in the same vein, if a participant gets hacked, the attacker won’t be able to solely sign transactions.</p>



<p>With the <a href="http://www.github.com/zcashfoundation/frost">frost</a> Rust library, the Zcash Foundation provides a reference implementation for the informational “Two-Round Schnorr Threshold Signatures with FROST” CFRG (Crypto Forum Research Group) Internet Draft. The CFRG is a general forum for discussing and reviewing uses of cryptographic mechanisms and is part of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), which in turn promotes research of importance to the evolution of the Internet protocols, applications, architecture and technology.</p>



<p>This release includes the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost/tree/main/frost-rerandomized">frost-rerandomized</a> variant, an adaptation to the FROST threshold signature scheme to make it unlinkable, which is a requirement for its use in the Zcash protocol. The adapted scheme generates signatures that are compatible with spend authorization signatures in the Zcash protocol, for the Sapling and Orchard network upgrades. This makes it possible for Zcash transactions to be authorized by more than one party, while preserving the privacy of individual signers.</p>



 



 Privacy-preserving threshold multi-party signatures for Zcash 



<p>Now that the frost reference implementation is production-ready we look forward to the acceptance of <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zips/pull/662">ZIP-312: “Shielded Multisignatures using FROST”</a> and its implementation in the Zcash ecosystem. We will continue to work on a set of demos to show how some of the challenges for integration into wallets may be solved, as well as to provide a reference for implementers.</p>



<p>We would like to thank the following current and past ZF team members for their contributions to the FROST reference implementation; without their work and support, we would not have reached this milestone today:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chelsea Komlo, Conrado P. L. Gouvêa,&nbsp; Natalie E., Deirdre Connolly, Pili Guerra, Alfredo Garcia, Teor, Marek Bielik, Henry de Valence, Jane Lusby, Josh Cincinnati, Antonie Hodge, Fungai Matambanadzo.</p>



<p>We would also like to thank all of the numerous external contributors to the spec and code base.</p>

<p>As the global need for environmentally conscious energy intensifies, tokenisation emerges as a groundbreaking strategy to democratise energy ownership. Amidst the growing consensus on the need for a shift to renewable resources, the challenge of accessibility and affordability persists. By leveraging blockchain technology to fractionalise ownership of renewable energy assets, tokenisation offers an inclusive pathway for individuals and communities to invest in and benefit from sustainable energy sources. This innovative approach not only aims to lower the barriers to entry in the renewable energy market but also foster a more distributed and participatory energy landscape.</p>



<p></p>



 Democratising energy: The role of tokenisation in ownership 



<p>The shift towards sustainable energy is a global priority, underscored by initiatives like the Paris Agreement, especially within Europe. This movement faces the challenge of perceived high costs and barriers to entry in the renewable energy sector. However, recent commercialisation of energy storage technologies shows significant <a href="https://www.irena.org/Energy-Transition/Technology/Energy-storage-costs">cost reductions</a> in wind, solar power, and grid stability over the past few years. This cost reduction has widened access to renewable energy, allowing a broader spectrum of individuals to benefit from these technologies.</p>



<p></p>



 How tokenisation democratises energy ownership&nbsp; 



<p>Tokenisation plays a pivotal role in further democratising energy ownership. For individuals without direct access to physical assets, such as a roof for solar panels, tokenisation offers a novel solution. Through crypto anchors and property rights encapsulated within tokens, individuals can own a share of an energy asset. This approach not only allows for the ownership of the physical asset but also enables individuals to own carbon credits, kilowatt hours, and even data rights associated with the energy asset.</p>



<p>One such initiative is <a href="https://www.sunified.com/">Sunified</a> –&nbsp; a solar technology company creating critical infrastructure to facilitate yield farming on solar infrastructure. Yield farming is the process of staking or lending cryptocurrency assets within a DeFi protocol’s liquidity pool to receive rewards, often in the form of the protocol’s governance tokens. Liquidity providers are then compensated with an annual percentage yield (APY) in real-time for their contributions as a result. The purpose behind yield farming is to promote the platform’s utilisation and compensate the community for adding liquidity, crucial for the ecosystem’s vitality and growth. Sunified’s initiative also includes storage infrastructure integration into electric vehicles (EVs) and other parts of the energy ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As energy grids undergo a gradual transformation over the next decade, tokenisation offers immense opportunities to introduce new business and ownership models through blockchain and sound crypto infrastructure architectures. This transition presents a unique chance to reconstruct the energy ecosystem, making sustainable energy ownership more accessible and flexible for a wider audience.</p>



<p></p>



 Fractional ownership of solar power&nbsp; 



<p>Fractional ownership in the context of solar power introduces an innovative approach to investing in renewable energy. This concept allows individuals to collectively invest in solar projects, such as solar parks or community solar gardens, through a blend of equity and debt financing. The essence of fractional ownership lies in the tokenisation of solar infrastructure, breaking down the investment into manageable units—whether in the form of €100 blocks or based on the capacity, such as 100 Watt blocks of a solar panel.</p>



<p>A group of experts would initially determine how to capitalise on a solar project, deciding on the mix of equity and debt to make the project investment-ready. This capital structure can then be tokenised, offering participation rights to investors. Tokenisation carves up the asset into fractional pieces, making it possible for a wider audience to invest in solar energy projects.</p>



<p>It is crucial to differentiate between owning a part of the solar park itself and having rights to the energy produced by it. While you might not fractionalise the energy output directly, fractionalising the means of production — i.e., the solar panels and infrastructure — offers a tangible way to invest in solar energy. Fractional ownership and tokenisation democratises access to renewable energy investments, enabling more people to contribute to and benefit from sustainable energy solutions.</p>



<p></p>



 How should a real-world asset, such as energy, be put on the blockchain?&nbsp; 



<p>Placing a real-world asset like energy onto a blockchain involves a multifaceted approach that bridges the physical and digital worlds. With a particular focus on renewable energy sources like solar power, the process starts by establishing a tangible connection or “hook” between the physical asset and its digital representation on the blockchain. This involves integrating a sensor directly into the asset during the manufacturing process, such as embedding it within a solar panel at the Original Equipment Manufacturer’s (OEM) factory. This sensor plays a crucial role in anchoring the asset across three realms: the physical world, the digital world, and the crypto realm.</p>



<p>The sensor enables tracking of the solar panel’s lifecycle from its inception, including its initial performance and the carbon footprint incurred throughout its supply chain journey. By activating the panel in the field, it is possible to account for its entire lifecycle, including production, deployment, and operational carbon emissions. This comprehensive approach ensures that the asset is not only represented accurately on the blockchain but also that its environmental impact is meticulously accounted for.</p>



<p>This method transcends traditional reliance on third-party verification or trust anchors, reducing the need for intermediaries. Instead, it offers a direct and trustworthy linkage between the real-world asset and its blockchain counterpart. This direct connection is essential for leveraging blockchain’s capabilities to support decentralised and distributed energy systems, which are increasingly becoming bidirectional.&nbsp; Unlike the traditional centralised energy distribution model, where power flows from a central hub to consumers, modern energy grids are evolving to support energy flow in both directions. This shift necessitates new measurement infrastructure to accommodate and accurately represent these changes on the blockchain.</p>



<p></p>



 Navigating challenges in energy tokenisation 



<p>The journey of tokenising energy assets is fraught with multifaceted challenges, significantly influenced by regulatory uncertainties, security concerns, data privacy issues, market volatility, and a general lack of understanding and readiness within the industry. A pivotal aspect of navigating these waters involves identifying the nature of energy tokens for regulators—be it as utility, payment, or governance tokens—or even advocating for a multi-use token that transcends traditional categorisations.</p>



<p></p>



 Regulatory Hurdles 



<p>Discourse within the digital asset community highlights a need for regulatory frameworks around energy tokens that must be clearly defined. This confusion necessitates a rigorous educational effort towards regulators, to clarify the distinctions and functionalities of various token types, including utility, energy, asset, and governance tokens. Without clear regulatory guidance, projects are compelled to seek jurisdictions with more favourable legal frameworks. The UK is a regulatory example of a more defined ecosystem for property rights, energy governance, and tokenisation of real-world assets. The only other option would be to work within regulatory sandboxes and project-specific frameworks to advance tokenisation initiatives without overstepping uncertain legal boundaries.</p>



<p>Moreover, the push towards standardising practices across different regulatory environments presents another layer of complexity. The UK has made significant strides in establishing clear guidelines through bodies like The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Other jurisdictions are still in the budding stages of adapting their regulations to accommodate the novel demands of tokenised energy systems. In addition to regulatory hurdles, the practicalities of offering energy tokens without categorising them as equity to facilitate easier trading, and the fundraising challenges for scaling projects across multiple locations, are critical.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 Communication 



<p>The ability to articulate the concept and clear implications of tokenising energy resources, such as solar panels, is crucial for market acceptance and regulatory compliance. This task extends beyond mere product explanation; it encompasses clear dialogue with lawmakers, consumer protection bodies, and entities concerned with data privacy. Simplifying complex technological underpinnings for a diverse audience, from regulators to the layperson at the bus stop, is essential. Failure to do so risks future operational nightmares, underscoring the importance of both education and transparency in the tokenisation ecosystem. Simplification without sacrificing essential information ensures that investors, users, and stakeholders, who will journey with the initiative for years to come, fully comprehend its value and operation, making the technology’s intricate background less daunting and more accessible.</p>



<p></p>



 Where to begin: energy tokenisation 



<p>Embarking on the journey of energy tokenisation requires a foundational understanding of the token’s purpose, its intended holders, and the value it offers. Before diving into the legal and technical specifics of token types, it is essential to address these fundamental questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This approach does not necessitate a one-size-fits-all solution. For instance, investors interested in direct engagement with energy projects can opt for utility tokens, whereas those looking for a more traditional investment route might consider security tokens tied to assets like solar parks. This flexibility allows projects to cater to diverse investor preferences, enhancing accessibility and interaction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Highlighting the significance of inclusivity and accountability in energy trading, an initiative such as the <a href="https://www.amelandenergie.nl/">Amelander Energy Cooperative</a> demonstrates the potential for democratising energy markets. Such a project demonstrates the possibility for transparent, traceable systems that ensure accountability across all levels of interaction—from investors to consumers, and from producers to the overarching financial ecosystem. Achieving this level of integration and transparency is a meticulous process to harmonise understanding and communication across various stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Tokenisation within the energy sector signifies a significant stride toward democratising access to renewable resources and fostering sustainable practices. By bridging the gap between the physical and digital realms, tokenisation introduces a new paradigm where renewable energy assets, like solar power, become attainable and manageable for a wider audience. This process not only democratises access to sustainable energy solutions but also addresses the pressing need for energy independence, resilience, and environmental preservation. As we navigate the complexities of regulatory landscapes and technological challenges, the ultimate goal remains clear: to create an energy ecosystem that is inclusive, transparent, and aligned with the principles of environmental sustainability. Through collaborative efforts, innovative approaches, and community engagement, tokenisation has the potential to reshape our energy future, making sustainable living a reality for all.</p>

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>Another week has flown by in the dynamic world of Panther – now it’s time to share our latest updates and progress with the Panther community! This week’s rundown highlights a series of key developments and testing from the past week.</p> Ecosystem updates  AMA with Panther’s Head of Product, Saif Akhtar <p>On February 8, we hosted an AMA session featuring Panther Protocol’s Head of Product, Saif Akhtar, and Head of Community, Joris Koopman.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ-NfX_4ldY&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Watch the recording</a> for full insights into our latest testnet updates, testing processes, reward systems, and upcoming testnet releases.</p> Panther testnet video guide for account creation <p>You asked – we delivered! Panther has received numerous requests to provide support materials dedicated to the account creation process. For a step-by-step video guide detailing how to make your very own testnet Panther account, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw3LhZKvM_U&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">check out our tutorial video</a>. Once you have your account set up, the video will also show you how to get started earning $ZKP rewards. All you need is a MetaMask wallet and 10 minutes!&nbsp;</p> Panther Protocol testnet and rewards update   Current testnet users: 800+  Total rewards distributed: 500,000+ $ZKP  <p>Our testnet rewards pot is 1.5M $ZKP — have you signed up for our testnet yet to earn your share? Grab the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">latest link</a> from Panther’s docs to join our testnet and receive your $ZKP rewards.</p> Product updates  Stage 5 developments <p>Stage 5 includes using a 3rd party Bundler service and supports gasless transactions via an Account Abstraction Paymaster contract.</p><p>Users will be able to submit transactions via Bundlers and pay gas fees in $ZKP instead of $Matic (on Mumbai testnet but similarly on Polygon) from the Panther Gas account that holds $zZKP.&nbsp;</p><p>Integration testing is underway, with two end-to-end Bundler providers operating successfully. Changes on the dApp side are expected to reach completion as we utilize resources from other stages of development taking place in parallel.</p> Enhancement Stage - 1 developments <p>As we continue to strive for parallel development efforts, a 2-week technical enhancement stage was slated to implement various fixes from previous stages along with a feature for Gas Management. This key feature allows users to move their $zZKP inside MASP from the regular balance to the Panther Account Gas balance and vice versa. Gas Management plays a significant role enabling users to top up their Gas balance and make sure they have sufficient $zZKP to pay for various transaction costs.</p> Stage 6 developments <p>Stage 6 of testnet is a complex stage and includes overall fee management, basic disclosures, and zAccount renewal. Stage 6 allows users to test:</p>  Fee deductions from the Panther Gas account and payment to 3rd parties such as Compliance providers and Bundler service providers.  Protocol fee deductions in a transacted token currently set to be charged on Withdraw.  Basic disclosures that allow Panther users to provide adequate transaction reporting to outside parties issuing requests that can be satisfied by independent on-chain verification.  &nbsp;A zAccount renewal function (after the expiry date). This feature functions in a similar manner to KYC renewals.  <p>Additional smart contract and testing changes are in progress, and will require one more week to complete. Following the completion of these changes, development on the dApp will begin.&nbsp;</p> About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. The Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in shielded pools; zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs; and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s Zero-Knowledge primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

  Partnering with LangChain: The LLM Application Framework  <p>Harrison, Ankush and their team are building the AI programming framework every engineer needs.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/sonya-huang/">Sonya Huang</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/romie-boyd/">Romie Boyd</a>	 



Published February 15, 2024
  



Team LangChain



 
<p>We are at the dawn of a new age of applications, with large language models (LLMs) as the enabling technology. But programming an LLM remains more art than science. The instructions that generate robust, reliable performance out of these non-deterministic models remain poorly understood. We are still in a wild west of prompt hacking, eyeballing outputs and a lot of duct tape when it comes to Generative AI.</p>



<p>We have seen this movie play out before. In Software 1.0, frameworks such as React and Next have abstracted, modularized and organized the most common building blocks of software engineering, making it fast and reliable to build and test your next mobile app or website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Generative AI, too, deserves a proper programming framework. Developers are craving a common set of best practices and composable building blocks for their LLM applications, to simplify the complex and to avoid reinventing the wheel. <a href="https://langchain.com/">LangChain</a> founders Harrison Chase and Ankush Gola have designed just that: an open-source toolkit for building sophisticated, data-aware applications on top of LLMs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Engineering teams use LangChain to accomplish a myriad of tasks: accessing datasets to power retrieval-augmented generation (LangChain boasts over 600 integrations); running “chains,” or collections of calls, to enable more complex applications (some companies run chains with thousands of links or more); giving LLMs access to external tools; and using LLMs as full-fledged “agents” capable of planning and reasoning to accomplish goals.</p>



<p>Zooming out, LangChain is a platform that allows companies to build the scaffolding of their applications’ cognitive architectures. It is paving the way for developers to build much more powerful LLM applications, going beyond simple one-shot queries to the intelligent, interconnected systems in which these reasoning engines truly shine. The more complex LLM operations are what allow for jaw-dropping results, and we at Sequoia believe that LangChain can be a force multiplier on the pace and quality of AI application and agent development.</p>



<p>Harrison was a standout machine learning engineer at our portfolio company Robust Intelligence when he started LangChain as a nights-and-weekends side project, with no plans to build a company. But after he released the first version, it quickly took off. He quickly started working with Ankush, a star colleague from Robust. From the start, they have been humble, responsive, and fast—all key ingredients for keeping up in the quickly evolving world of generative AI. And above all, they are community-first, spearheading a community of more than 2,000 open-source contributors.</p>



<p>Today, more than 50,000 LLM applications have been built using LangChain, with use cases ranging from internal apps to autonomous agents to games to chat automation to security scanners and more. And while the platform is already a mainstay at weekend hackathons, we have also been excited to see many of our portfolio companies moving their LangChain use cases into production. Soon, your delivery order or customer support or gaming experience may be powered by LangChain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And there is more to come. To continue the Software 1.0 analogy, developers benefit not just from open-source frameworks like React and Next, but also services such as GitHub, Datadog, Vercel and Heroku to deploy and monitor their applications into production. LangChain’s ambitions are similarly expansive.</p>



<p>The company’s latest “big bet” is <a href="https://www.langchain.com/langsmith">LangSmith</a>, a product that helps developers debug, test and monitor their LLM applications. As customers move from prototyping into production, LangSmith is providing the visibility and tooling they need to make their generative AI applications more performant and reliable. Elastic powers their Elastic AI Assistant for security in LangChain and leverages LangSmith for visibility helping them get to production fast. Rakuten relies on LangSmith for rigorous testing and benchmarking so they can make tradeoff decisions about their copilot Rakuten AI for Business, built in LangChain, in a systematic way. And Moody’s relies on LangSmith for automated eval, easy debugging and experimentation so they can quickly iterate and innovate.</p>



<p>Since the announcement of LangSmith’s closed beta in July, 70,000 users have signed up and more than 5,000 companies now use LangSmith every month. We look forward to seeing that list grow with the product now in GA. More recent product launches include LangServe, an easy way to deploy LangChain into production, and LangGraph, a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs.</p>



<p>Even all of this is still just a taste of what LangChain has in the pipeline. The team is building in a rich problem space with plenty to explore, and they are guided by a passionate user community with no shortage of important problems for them to solve.</p>



<p>We are thrilled to partner with LangChain and lead their Series A.</p>

  Sequoia Open Source Fellowship: Applications Now Open  <p>Calling all open source developers to pursue your projects with no strings attached.
</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bogomil-balkansky/">Bogomil Balkansky</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/lauren-reeder/">Lauren Reeder</a>	 



Published February 15, 2024
  



 
<p>Last year we introduced the Sequoia Open Source Fellowship with the goal of encouraging the development of open source software and supporting the community of open source developers. More than ever, open source serves as the bedrock and lifeblood of the world’s software, with companies of all sizes utilizing OSS. The entire ecosystem relies on libraries and software packages—often solely maintained by open source developers. While Sequoia has partnered with many companies that found success commercializing OSS, the non-commercial spirit of open source collaboration underpins almost every aspect of modern technology. The fellowship was designed to support this work without any expectation of an equity stake in a commercial project or company.</p>



<p>We started the fellowship as an invite-only program. This year, we are excited to announce that we are opening applications to the public. Starting today, any developer working on an open source project may apply for a fellowship stipend. Applications will be considered on a rolling basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Open source software is critically important for ensuring that progress continues to come from every corner of the globe and not just from a few companies in Silicon Valley. We see a pressing need for collaboration, for developers to collectively push forward what new technologies are capable of in ways that serve the entire ecosystem and the public good.</p>



<p>To apply, simply complete our brief questionnaire and we’ll be in touch if your project is a good fit. We will primarily be focused on existing open source projects. Fellows will receive a stipend to cover reasonable living expenses for 6 to 12 months. They will continue to own the fruits of their labor—any code written before, during and after the program will remain entirely the fellow’s. Sequoia will not take equity or expect anything in exchange for the sponsorship. We plan to accept 2 to 3 fellows per year.</p>



<p>If you’re building something exciting in open source, we want to hear from you. Applications are now open—see <a href="https://sequoiacap.com/oss">here</a> to apply.</p>

Metadata leaks with every single online interaction.</p><p>The mixnet achieves this by splitting data into identically sized encrypted Sphinx packets and dispersing these in three hops to ‘mix nodes’ worldwide at randomized intervals. Next, the mixnet shuffles in dummy ‘cover’ traffic, further complicating tracing. Together these features make tracking metadata patterns impossible even for powerful adversaries with a global view of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Nym and Zcash share the same vision of privacy for everyone. The invention of Zcash by the Electric Coin Company has already made great strides to defend user privacy by bringing zero-knowledge proofs to market, an innovation that many other projects are now building upon. However, like every technology, zero-knowledge proofs remain vulnerable at the transport layer of the internet — a problem acknowledged <a href="http://zerocash-project.org/media/pdf/zerocash-extended-20140518.pdf">in the original Zerocash whitepaper</a>.</p><p>Powerful adversaries can analyze traffic patterns such as the stream of TCP/IP packets used to submit transactions, which can then be used to de-anonymize users. ISPs can snoop on traffic patterns to passively record Zcash activity. And the growing crypto surveillance industry can passively spy on peer-to-peer traffic, as well as conduct active&nbsp;attacks.</p><p>Even advanced privacy protections like Zcash’s auto-shielding feature are vulnerable at the network layer. For example: if an adversary obtained a Zcash user’s transaction address, or extracted it from a unified address, they could then send a transaction to the address. Then, they could observe the user’s wallet as it broadcasts the t2z auto-shielding transaction. By repeating this process, the attacker could obtain more granular details such as IP measurements, and track these over&nbsp;time.</p><p>“We at Nym believe people deserve privacy — it is an alienable right to a dignified life free from gross intrusion and interference,” said Harry Halpin, cofounder and CEO at Nym Technologies. “But in the digital realm, intrusion and interference are simply the normal state of affairs. This is unsustainable and needs to change. With this groundbreaking integration, Nym and Zcash are working together to make real privacy online a reality.”</p><p>Josh Swihart, CEO of ECC (Electric Coin Company), said: “I’m extremely pleased to see Nym come to life on the Zcash network. Network-level privacy has been a missing piece since Zcash’s inception. This partnership between these two projects will significantly deepen protections from everyday users wishing to protect their financial privacy. It’s fantastic to see the privacy ecosystem come together.”</p><p>Jason McGee of Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) said: “ZCG is excited to support Nym’s proposal to enhance network-level privacy protections for Zcash. This effort aligns with our core mission to advance the Zcash network, and underscores ZCG’s commitment to addressing challenging issues related to privacy and security. By integrating Nym’s mixnet technology into Zcash’s lightwalletd infrastructure, Nym is laying the foundation for future integrations with Zcash nodes and wallets. Our hope is that this collaboration marks the beginning of a long-term partnership that results in significant improvements in privacy protections for Zcash&nbsp;users.”</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-begins-integration-for-complete-privacy-protection-on-zcash-ecosystem-7452d1ea7141">Nym Begins Integration For Complete Privacy Protection On Zcash Ecosystem</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  The latest version of Brave is now even faster on ARM64 Windows. This post covers how you can install it, as well as some technical information about the implementation.

<p>Brave now offers a fully native version for ARM64 Windows. When you newly install Brave on your ARM64 device, then you get an even faster browser. Read on to learn more, or skip to the end to find out how to get the new version.</p>

 What is ARM64, and why is it important? 
<p>ARM64 is a newer type of CPU, developed for speed and efficiency. Every computer has a processor (or “CPU”) that acts a little like a brain. Processors can be made in different architectures that essentially govern at a low level how the CPU works. Typical architectures are the 32-bit x86 architecture and the more recent 64-bit x64 architecture.</p>
<p>You can only run programs on your computer that are compatible with your CPU architecture. For example, you cannot run a program made for x64 on an x86 processor.</p>
<p>Software companies get around this by offering multiple versions of their programs. So you can, for example, download an x86 version of Brave if you are on an x86 CPU, and an x64 version if your computer’s processor has the x64 architecture.</p>
<p>Nowadays, most Windows computers have an x64 CPU. But recently, another architecture has entered the mainstream through products such as Microsoft’s Surface laptops. This architecture is called ARM64 and it offers better power efficiency and performance.</p>

 ARM64 and Brave 
<p>Newer CPU architectures are usually able to run programs with an older architecture. For example, an x64 CPU can run an x86 program. Likewise, ARM64 CPUs can run x64 and x86 programs. But there is a significant performance overhead. In the example of Brave, you could run x64 Brave on an ARM64 computer. But it would be slower than it should be. We therefore spent considerable effort last year to offer an ARM64 version of Brave for Windows.</p>
<p>So what’s necessary to get an ARM64 version of Brave? To create Brave, we write code in programming languages such as C++. The programming language is readable as text by us humans. But CPUs operate in their own machine language. In order for the CPU to be able to run our code, it needs to be translated to machine code with a program called a compiler. We can tell the compiler the architecture of the CPU we want to target. So, mostly, we could take our existing C++ code and tell the compiler to produce machine code for the ARM64 architecture.</p>

 On-demand updates and universal installers 
<p>Given how complex Brave is, there were of course also parts where this process didn’t work quite so seamlessly. The first problem we encountered was the following: When you type <code>brave://settings/help</code> into Brave’s address bar, you get a page that shows Brave’s version. Crucially, this page also checks for a new version of Brave with a little spinning animation. This feature showed an error in x64 Brave on ARM64 Windows. After extensive research, we realized that this is caused by a fundamental limitation in the Windows operating system itself.</p>
<p>To work around the problem, we introduced a universal installer which ensures that our users do not accidentally install x64 Brave on ARM64 Windows. Instead, they always receive a copy of Brave with the correct architecture for their system. What does this look like? When you go to brave.com and download its installer, then you get a 1 MB .exe file. When you run it, it downloads the latest version of Brave for your CPU architecture from our servers. This ensures that you don’t get the error described above.</p>

 DRM protected content and Widevine 
<p>The second main technical hurdle was caused by an optional and downloadable component of the browser called Widevine. Web sites such as Netflix use this component to protect their content. If you do not have the Widevine component installed, then Netflix (and similar sites) may only serve you low-quality videos, if anything at all.</p>
<p>Widevine is proprietary technology and its licensing terms do not allow us to redistribute it. This means that we can’t just create an ARM64 version of Widevine and include it in Brave. But an ARM64 version of the component can be downloaded from public Google servers. So we do the following: The first time you visit a web site that requires Widevine, we ask you if you agree to downloading and installing the component:</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>If you agree, then Brave downloads and installs Widevine from Google’s public servers. While Brave already worked this way for other architectures, it required a lot of extra work for ARM64. If you are interested in the technical details, you can take a look at <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/18695">pull-request #18695</a> on the brave/brave-core repo.</p>

 This sounds great. How do I get ARM64 Brave? 
<p>You need Windows 11 and an ARM64 CPU. To check if your CPU is ARM64, follow the instructions in the <a href="https://pureinfotech.com/check-if-processor-arm64-x64-64bit-windows-11/">How to check if processor is ARM64 or x64 (64-bit) on Windows 11</a> article on pureinfotech.com. If you have an ARM64 CPU, but installed Brave before December of last year, then you need to first uninstall this old copy of Brave to get the newer ARM64 build. When the uninstaller prompts you for confirmation, be sure not to select the check box that says “Also delete your browsing data?”. Once you’ve uninstalled the x64 build of Brave from your ARM64 CPU, go to brave.com, click on the Download button and follow the instructions. When you then type <code>brave://version</code> in Brave’s address bar, you should see “arm64” mentioned on the page.</p>

 Summary 
<p>More and more new Windows computers have ARM64 CPUs. In order for Brave to be as fast as possible, it needs to be optimized for this architecture. We completed this technical work last year. There were some technical challenges on the way, but we were able to overcome them. You can now install ARM64 Brave on Windows 11 by visiting <a>brave.com</a>!</p>

		<p>Horizen Labs has submitted a ZenIP Discussion topic on Discourse, <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42400-modernizing-horizen-technology-via-a-modular-proof-verification-layer/394">ZenIP: 42400 – Modernizing Horizen Technology via a Modular Proof Verification Layer</a>.</p>
<p>Note that ZenIP 42400 focuses on the modular proof verification layer. If this proposal passes, Horizen Labs will roll out subsequent phases to the Horizen community for discussion and debate as the “New Horizen” initiative progresses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ZenIP 42400 is focused solely on the establishment of a Modular Proof Verification Layer, i.e., a blockchain dedicated to verifying proofs with the ability to support any settlement layer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we dive into what this means for the Horizen Ecosystem, let’s review a few points that have been raised by the Community regarding this proposal:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Name of the Initiative: The term “New Horizen” is currently a placeholder for the system and its individual component blockchains. The designation is being used to conceptually describe the initiative until an official name is determined. 
 EON Integration: A key aspect of the development strategy is the integration of EON into the new Proof Verification Chain. The Horizen Labs teams are actively involved in exploring viable pathways for this migration, ensuring that EON remains an integral part of the Horizen ecosystem after the implementation of the blockchains that comprise the “New Horizen” initiative. 
 $ZEN Tokenomics: Currently, there are no plans to modify $ZEN’s tokenomics, and any such change would be subject to community discussion and DAO approval.&nbsp; 
 Market and User Research: The Horizen Labs team used comprehensive market and user research, aiming to design a user-friendly system capable of widespread adoption.&nbsp; 
 
 Why should the community be excited about this “New Horizen” proposal? 
<p>The “New Horizen” initiative will modernize the Horizen tech stack to better align with the broader web3 industry while building on the legacy of the Horizen Mainchain and Zendoo. This will “future-proof” the Horizen network and unlock market value to the Horizen ecosystem. New Horizen is based on current web3 market needs and addresses a problem that affects most modular web3 protocols: volatile and expensive proof verification costs for L2s (ZK-Rollups in particular).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Horizen Labs’ proposed “Proof Verification Chain” aims to substantially reduce rising security costs for L2s.</p>
<p>A dedicated Proof Verification Chain would not only make running a ZK-Rollup more economical, but also align with the anticipated shift towards these technologies becoming the dominant scaling solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, collaboration in the Web3 space is becoming increasingly important, New Horizen aims to foster this collaboration across ecosystems and expand the reach of the Horizen ecosystem. The Horizen Labs team is working to ensure that the Proof Verification Chain described above is being designed to accommodate a variety of proof types and settlement layers. By developing a solution that is versatile enough to be compatible with multiple development frameworks, proving systems, and settlement layers, this positions Horizen as a hub of collaborative innovation. Potentially reaching new audiences beyond our current community, embracing and leading the change towards a more interconnected and cooperative blockchain environment.&nbsp;</p>
 How Will this Work? 
<p>The “New Horizen” initiative is set to deliver multiple components that address the market’s current and future needs across several phases. The Proof Verification Chain (Phase 1) will focus on verifying proofs originating from other blockchains, such as rollups / appchains or applications. Initially, the focus will be on ZK-SNARK proofs, in particular zk-snarks produced by ZK-Rollups, but the plan is to expand its capabilities to accommodate a wide range of proof types in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proof verification layer aims to improve the existing process of proving state validity for ZK-Rollups and other proof-generating applications, offering a more efficient, scalable solution to handle these operations, which will reduce the costs of blockchain networks.</p>
<p></p>

 Scalability, Decentralization &amp; Security — What Trilemma?  The blockchain trilemma is a classic idea that truly decentralized blockchains need to choose between security or scalability. Verus offers a different perspective and a new approach. Together we will come to the conclusion that the Verus Protocol solves scalability by neither sacrificing decentralization or security, effectively solving the trilemma.  A Closer Look at the&nbsp;Trilemma <p>Before we dive in, let’s examine the current perceived definition of the crypto trilemma: “You can’t have a scalable blockchain that is truly decentralized and thus secure” — it is said to achieve worldwide scalability a blockchain needs to be fast so it can process all the transactions for a large population (btw, this is a false premise, you can read about that later.) And to get a fast, high tps (transactions per second) blockchain it must compromise on decentralization and thus security.</p><p>Decentralization and security go hand-in-hand. A truly decentralized protocol (open to all, many validators) is secure because it is difficult to 51% attack such a protocol. If a blockchain is less decentralized (low number of validators, permissioned access) it could be 51% attacked (by external attackers or colluding validators), and transactions can be altered or reversed, completely undermining one of the goals of blockchain — censorship-resistance.</p><blockquote>The trilemma is currently looked at from a single-chain standpoint. A false premise that does not scale to the&nbsp;world.</blockquote><p>There is truth to the fact that it is very difficult to have a decentralized single blockchain that also has a high tps. The larger the number of validators the harder it is to find consensus among them all, which makes them slower, and makes it more difficult to get them to process large numbers of transactions. To get a high tps blockchain you would need to lower the number of validators so they can find consensus more easily, and raise the hardware requirements for running a node so they can process those transactions quicker too. Yet doing so compromises true decentralization. The lower the number of validators, the less decentralized, the less robust. And the higher the hardware requirements, the less accessible it is for people around the world, the less decentralized.</p><p>The trilemma is currently looked at from a single-chain standpoint. A false premise that does not scale to the world. We will show you how Verus offers a new and better approach.</p> Scalability Does NOT Mean High&nbsp;Tps <blockquote>Transactions per second are nothing more than just a performance indicator — like GHz for computers.</blockquote><p>Cryptocurrency protocols often boast about how fast their blockchains are (transactions per second) as an indicator of their scalability. Contrary to popular belief this is a false premise. Transactions per second are nothing more than just a performance indicator. Like how we use GHz (CPU clock speed) to indicate how fast a computer is, or an even better example — how fast servers&nbsp;are.</p><p>To bring the promise of crypto to billions of people around the globe let’s make a comparison with the Internet. The Internet does not run on one single server. All websites and applications that we use daily are not connected to one single server. The Internet has not been scaled to the world by constantly upgrading the one server to a faster one. It’s millions of servers that are servicing billions of people around the world. These millions of servers are perfectly connected, and completely interoperable so that using the Internet today is a seamless experience.</p><p>Now, with this perspective in mind, let’s get back to the current situation in crypto land. Most, if not all, crypto protocols are trying to service the world with their one single, monolithic blockchain. The monolithic blockchain becomes a central hub where all smart contracts and applications revolve around. When they notice that it doesn’t scale (the transaction fees start ramping up) the industry comes up with solutions that heavily compromise on decentralization and security (e.g. L2s, semi-centralized protocols, master nodes). This is not the&nbsp;answer.</p><p>Instead of acknowledging that the Internet today is a giant, interconnected multi-server world where all applications and websites are seamlessly connected, most of the crypto industry thinks we live in a single server (single blockchain) world.</p><p>Verus acknowledged that to realize the promise of cryptocurrency and blockchain, it needed to scale for billions of people around the globe and thus it needed to embrace a multi-server, multi-chain world. And that is exactly what the Verus Protocol does today. Without sacrificing decentralization and security.</p> Unlimited in&nbsp;Scale <p>Before we start explaining how Verus is truly decentralized and secure, let’s start with how Verus embraces the multi-chain world and delivers unlimited scalability.</p><p>Most, if not all, current blockchain protocols argue that to have low transaction fees they must achieve higher transactions per second. They try to scale up — increasing the performance of their monolithic blockchains. This only gets them so far. At some point, they will bottleneck again, and in the process, they compromise on decentralization and security.</p><p>Verus offers a new approach, one in which each organization or business can launch its own highly capable, rent-free, no-coding-required blockchain. It’s called Verus PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service). These PBaaS-chains are fully independent, can be customized to the organization’s need, inherit all the same features as the Verus blockchain, and most importantly are fully interconnected and interoperable with the complete network and other bridged protocols (e.g. Ethereum). A single PBaaS-chain can do between 75 and 800 tps depending on the options&nbsp;chosen.</p><p>There is no upper limit to deploying PBaaS-chains. Just like there is no upper limit to servers being deployed. When we reach a bandwidth limit we don’t go out upgrading our single server, we put another server next to it to spread out the usage. The same thing is here, reaching unlimited scalability.</p><p>Of course, this only works when those PBaaS-chains are fully interoperable and interconnected, which they are — in a provable, trustless and decentralized way. There is no centralized entity sitting in between the PBaaS-chains regulating everything.</p><p>Cross-chain transactions and conversions, cross-chain bridging of identities (VerusID), tokens and basket currencies, even Ethereum (&amp; ERC20/ERC721/ERC1155) — it’s all built into the consensus mechanism, trustlessly bridged over by the decentralized network of miners and stakers only. This is all on mainnet now, for everyone to&nbsp;use.</p><p>We can conclude that Verus is scalable to billions of people around the world with the unlimited deployment of PBaaS-chains. But does it compromise on decentralization and thus security? Let’s dive into&nbsp;it.</p> Built to be Decentralized <p>There are a few things at play here that work in harmony to achieve decentralization and security — Verus Proof of Power (the hybrid 50% proof-of-work, 50% proof-of-stake consensus mechanism), merge-mining and the Fee&nbsp;Pool.</p><blockquote>Verus had no ICO, had no premine and had and has no developer fee or&nbsp;tax.</blockquote><p>Before we jump into the above let’s acknowledge some facts that are pivotal to being a true decentralized protocol, to being credibly neutral. Just like Bitcoin before, Verus had no ICO, had no premine and had and has no developer fee or tax. Verus is not a company or a business. Verus is rent-free and all protocol fees go to the block producers. These facts are super important to incentivize decentralization and to be a credibly neutral protocol in the eyes of the&nbsp;world.</p> A Hybrid Consensus Mechanism <p>Now let’s unpack Verus Proof of Power, the consensus mechanism of the Verus blockchain, and all PBaaS-chains. It’s a hybrid of 50% proof-of-work and 50% proof-of-stake, and it’s <a href="https://verus.io/papers/VerusPoP.pdf">a provable solution to 51% hash attacks</a>. Out of the 1440 daily blocks (on Verus, and when a PBaaS-chain opts for 1-minute block times), half is solved by mining and half by&nbsp;staking.</p><p>VerusHash, the proof-of-work mechanism which disincentivizes ASIC &amp; FPGA development, and favors CPUs, mobile phones and ARM-devices for mining. Mining with mobile phones and for example, Orange Pi 5’s are the most cost-efficient way to do it. This proves a significant leap towards a more inclusive mining environment. It’s accessible to everyone and thus creates a naturally decentralized protocol.</p>An Orange Pi 5 mining farm by community member&nbsp;DCAL4.<p>Additionally, to give even more power to miners, they can merge-mine up to 22 PBaaS-chains simultaneously without sacrificing their original hashing power. This dramatically increases efficiency and network security. So, when considering an unlimited number of PBaaS-chains on the network, each miner can choose up to 22 to mine. They can choose for profitability, or choose the ones they want to&nbsp;support.</p><p>This approach to mining is environmentally conscious. The protocol’s design allows for low-power devices to mine extremely efficiently. It lowers the entry barrier for participation in blockchain validation, especially in low-income countries, yet can also give life to phones that are old or with broken screens. Thus significantly reducing the environmental impact associated with traditional PoW&nbsp;mining.</p><p>Then we have the proof-of-stake part of the consensus mechanism. This one is really simple and powerful. Anyone can run a node and start staking. There is no minimum amount of VRSC needed (pretty unique in the world of PoS). Verus <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/how-verus-solved-nothing-at-stake-and-weak-subjectivity-proof-of-stake-problems-b4dd6a85086e">solved the “nothing-at-stake”-problem</a> therefore there is no slashing of funds. Funds staking are never locked and running a node can be done with something as cheap as a Raspberry Pi 4. All-in-all proving yet again that Verus is accessible to everyone, creating a naturally decentralized protocol.</p><p>We can conclude that Verus is truly a decentralized protocol, naturally emerging from its extremely low-barrier mining and staking. So what does that mean for security?</p> Protocol Security at Another&nbsp;Level <p>Seeing as the Verus Protocol is naturally decentralized and provable 51% hash attack resistant, it’s extremely secure. PBaaS-chains take these properties with them as they have the same consensus mechanism, and the Verus miners can choose up to 21 of them to merge-mine. It’s fair to say that there is no compromise on security given the scalability of the protocol.</p> Verus Introduces the Fee&nbsp;Pool <p>Let’s first explain the fees the protocol generates for the miners and&nbsp;stakers:</p>  PBaaS-chain launches: 10,000 VRSC (5,000 for the block producers of Verus, 5,000 for the block producers of the newly launched&nbsp;chain)  Currency launches (tokens, basket currencies, liquidity pools, ERC-20 mapped currencies): 200&nbsp;VRSC  VerusID registrations: 100, 80, 60, 40 or 20&nbsp;VRSC  subID registrations: 0.02&nbsp;VRSC  DeFi conversion fees: min. 0.0125%, max.&nbsp;0.025%  Transaction fees: 0.0001&nbsp;VRSC  <p>Builders and users pay these protocol fees for their operations and the fees are directed into the Fee Pool. Then, for each new block, 1% of the Fee Pool is added on top of the regular coinbase reward (currently 6&nbsp;VRSC).</p><p>The Fee Pool is introduced as a security measure to keep the protocol stable. We have seen in other blockchain protocols that when a block has large fees, block producers try to “snipe” the block (putting lots of hash onto the network, then pulling it out of the network, or even trying to reorder the blocks for their own gain). In doing so they destabilize the protocol. Verus mitigates this behavior by spreading the extra fees over many&nbsp;blocks.</p> Smart Contracts Are Not&nbsp;Secure <p>Most blockchain protocols use the VM-based application model — smart contracts written with Solidity. It’s full of smart contract hacks and bugs and has insecure and phishing-prone wallet approval mechanisms. On top of that MEV (maximum extractable value) is rampant, due to the serial processing of transactions on the VM-model (it’s easy for a block producer to reorder transactions inside a block for their own gain). We can honestly say that the VM-model is not&nbsp;secure.</p><p>The Verus approach is different as it follows the fundamental systems design principle — the most important security layers should be located in the protocol itself, and not coded on top via L2 (smart contracts). All operations on Verus and PBaaS-chains are directly connected to consensus, secured by the miners and stakers of the protocol.</p><p>Now you might ask yourself “But can we build dApps that are as capable as building them with the VM-model?”. The answer is yes. Developing dApps with Verus is much more straightforward than building to a VM-based application model and results in inherently more capable, secure and scalable solutions.</p> Does Verus Solve the Blockchain Trilemma? <p>A fair question. And hopefully we answered with enough detail. The answer is&nbsp;“yes!”.</p><p>Let’s summarize. Verus does not compromise on decentralization and security to reach unlimited scalability. Unlimited scalability is reached by scaling out, not scaling up. It is the equivalent not of upgrading your server but of putting an extra server next to it to spread the bandwidth around.</p><p>Decentralization is achieved by making mining and staking accessible for everyone through extremely low hardware requirements. This naturally creates a large number of miners and nodes (stakers), making the network robust against attacks of all&nbsp;sorts.</p><p>High security is not only reached through the decentralized nature of the network but also because of the Fee Pool and the fact that all operations are directly connected to consensus and thus the miners and&nbsp;stakers.</p> Now is the Time to Build with&nbsp;Verus <p>Without having to rely on smart contracts, builders can develop dApps that are even more powerful, secure and scalable. Builders can use the no-coding-required API commands, together with VerusID and its VDXF (Verus Data Exchange Format) as a controlled public storage system with multiple levels of nesting to create dApps of any&nbsp;kind.</p><p>The foundation has been laid for a true Internet of Value.

		<p><a href="https://tokenmint.global/">TokenMint</a> was originally designed and built by the Horizen Ecosystem team as a POC (proof-of-concept) sidechain, called Tokenchain, to test the scalability and durability of the Horizen network. TokenMint was a live proof of concept that permitted the team to build Horizen EON, and now that Horizen EON is successfully running, the time to deprecate TokenMint is now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the deprecation, all TokenMint users will need to remove their $ZEN from the sidechain before the deprecation date to avoid loss of funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Important Dates</p>
 
 Wednesday, February 21st, 2024 – TokenMint Testnet will be Deprecated 
 Wednesday, March 6th, 2024 – TokenMint Mainnet will be Deprecated 
 
<p>To move $ZEN off of TokenMint, users can simply send their ZEN from their Cobalt Wallet to a Horizen mainchain address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Warning: ZEN can only be sent to Horizen Mainchain Sphere addresses from Cobalt. Sending ZEN to another Horizen Mainnet address outside of Sphere could lead to a loss of funds.</p>
<p>Please open a ticket on our <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">Discord server</a> with any questions or concerns during the deprecation period and please be sure to REMOVE your ZEN from TokenMint BEFORE March 6th, 2024, as the funds will be permanently lost after that date.</p>
<p>How to Send ZEN to the Horizen Mainchain from Cobalt Wallet</p>
 
 Open your Cobalt Wallet and make sure you are connected to the TokenMint chain.&nbsp; 
 In the Assets and Activity page, click the ZEN row. The page now allows you to send ZEN. It displays the current amount available. 
 Click the up arrow to send a transaction. 
 In the Send to field, enter the desired address you want to send the ZEN to. This field will display an error, if you enter an invalid address. 
 In the Amount field, enter the amount of the ZEN you want to send. 
 In the password field, enter your password to complete the transaction. 
 Click Submit. The Sent flag appears indicating that the transaction is successful. 
 Click Back to display the transaction activity. The Send page appears. If the transaction is pending, a notification will appear stating that the last pending transaction for this address has not been confirmed. Note that it can take up to 72 hours for the transaction to show on the destination wallet, even if the transaction is confirmed on the TokenMint explorer.

Right: NymVPN session in Cholula,&nbsp;Mexico.<p>NymVPN alpha test sessions were also underway at the Swiss Free Software movement meet-up in Vaud, Switzerland — and in Lyon, France at the bitcoin meet-up, with many more planned in Kyiv, Prague, Istanbul, Rio de Janeiro and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>The alpha version will roll out in a staged launch, starting with Nym Squads and friends and then in batches to members of the <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">NymVPN waitlist</a>. Newer batches will be added based on the stability of the applications and the capacity of the network to&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Alpha and beta testers are gaining free access to the NymVPN.

It features customizable entry and exit locations for geo-blocking resistance and is launching with two&nbsp;modes:</p>  The 5-hop Nym mixnet&nbsp;mode  <p>The 5-hop mixnet mode is optimised for privacy and uses the full capabilities of the Nym mixnet, a decentralised network of servers all over the world that ‘mix’ traffic so it becomes untraceable. The <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/follow-the-packet-spoiler-you-cant-9c14380335c7">mixnet encrypts your traffic</a> in novel onion encryption, then routes it via an entry gateway, three mix nodes and an exit gateway. This makes it near impossible for anyone to link sender and receiver, ensuring advanced privacy against even government-level adversaries. It is the optimal solution for sensitive use cases like crypto transactions, messaging, and secure email, that are not timing sensitive. It protects metadata, IP addresses and patterns of communication from traffic analysis and end-to-end correlation.</p><p>Read more about the <a href="https://nymtech.net/nym-whitepaper.pdf">Nym&nbsp;mixnet</a>.</p>  The 2-hop Nym dVPN&nbsp;mode  <p>The 2-hop dVPN mode is optimised for speed.

Most VPNs don’t provide privacy at all. Instead they just shift who knows your IP address and has access to your habits from the server you are communicating with, to the VPN provider. In fact, many free VPNs take advantage of this fact and sell your browsing habits for profit. The Nym dVPN is decentralised so there can be no centralised logging of your online&nbsp;habits.</p><p>Read more on the difference between <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/blog/decentralized-vpns-vs-traditional-vpns-all-the-differences">traditional and decentralised VPNs</a>.</p> NymVPN: upcoming&nbsp;features <p>Upcoming features include split tunnelling so you can preset which of your apps should run through the low latency 2-hop mode, and which require full privacy protections of the 5-hop mixnet&nbsp;mode.</p><p>There will also be a killswitch to prevent data leakage, and censorship resistance to ensure anyone can access the internet from anywhere, even in regions with strict restrictions.</p><p>Sign up to the <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">NymVPN waitlist</a>.

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>It’s time to review what Team Panther was up to in January and our plans for February. In this month’s update, we cover ecosystem updates, team expansion, product highlights, and a glimpse of next month’s plans; here’s everything you should know:</p> Ecosystem updates  Testnet Stage 3 is now live with a new design, enhanced security, and added features <p>Testnet Stage 3 was released in January, bringing a new design, enhanced security, and added features. Stage 3 enables users to use the newly allowlisted test Matic and test $ZKPs in Panther’s Shielded Pool.</p><p>Learn more about <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage-3-is-now-live-with-a-new-design-enhanced-security-and-added-features">Stage 3 of our testnet</a>.</p> LBank lists Zero-Knowledge DeFi pioneer Panther Protocol’s $ZKP&nbsp; <p>We are excited to share that Panther Protocol’s $ZKP is now listed on LBank, a leading cryptocurrency exchange. This listing follows $ZKP’s listing on BitMart in December 2023. These listings are part of our focus on cementing strategic partnerships and a strong exchange presence before Panther Protocol’s V1 launch.</p><p>More about the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/lbank-to-list-zero-knowledge-defi-pioneer-panther-protocols-zkp/">LBank listing</a>.</p> AMA recap: Panther’s CEO, Oliver Gale, discusses $ZKP listing on BitMart and the future of privacy in DeFi <p>Following the recent listing of $ZKP on BitMart, Panther’s CEO, Oliver Gale, introduced Panther Protocol to BitMart’s community. Catch a summary of the conversation in our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ama-recap-panthers-ceo-oliver-gale-discusses-zkp-listing-on-bitmart-and-the-future-of-privacy-in-defi/">latest blog</a>.&nbsp;</p> Panther Protocol testnet and rewards update   Number of current testnet users: 634  Total rewards distributed: 500,000+ $ZKP  <p>Our testnet rewards pot is 1.5M $ZKP — have you signed up for our testnet yet to earn your share?<a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Learn more and sign up</a> to join our testnet and receive your $ZKP rewards.</p> Panther’s Co-founder and CEO, Oliver Gale on CryptoCoinShow <p>&nbsp;Our co-founder and CEO, Oliver Gale, was recently on the @CryptoCoinShow discussing Panther’s strategic direction and the future of privacy-preserving tech in DeFi. Watch the complete episode <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zM65JyReAj0&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a>.</p> Panther hires Harrie Bickle to improve product documentation <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harriebickle/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Harrie Bickle</a> has joined the Panther team as a Senior Technical Writer. Harrie brings over a decade’s experience in Documentation and Product Marketing and has been in the blockchain space since 2018. Her range spans writing and editing articles, whitepapers, yellow papers, developer portals, and API documentation.</p><p>We are delighted to welcome Harrie and look forward to seeing our documentation reach a new level, thanks to her expertise gained while editing for Starkware in the Zero-Knowledge space and building out developer portals for Qredo’s crypto trading API and Neon EVM’s Solana settlement layer solution.</p> Product updates  Stage 4 developments <p>The dApp development for Stage 4 is complete, and we expect to launch it in the first week of Feb. Stage 4 of testnet allows users to send zAssets inside the pool from one zAccount to another. Stage 4 is a feature-filled release as it is being shipped with an interesting, related feature originally from Stage 6: Withdrawals.&nbsp;</p><p>Within the Stage 4 dApp, users can also undertake UTXO selection.&nbsp;</p> Stage 5 developments <p>Stage 5 development is underway in parallel, thanks to the team’s efforts over the last two months. The team is currently working on integrating bundle services into the dApp. Stage 5 includes using a third-party Bundler service and the ability to submit gasless transactions using an Account Abstraction Paymaster contract.&nbsp;</p> Oshiya update <p>We’ve updated the code for our Panther miner, Oshiya. The latest version of Oshiya comes with an enhanced miner setting: FORCE_UTXO_SIMULATION. This parameter gives control over whether the miner should consistently add a simulated UTXO, regardless of the presence of any pending queues. When set to ‘false’, a simulated UTXO will only be added if a pending queue exists. We recommend running the updated version of the Oshiya code.&nbsp;</p> Plans for February&nbsp; <p>Following the launch of Stage 4, the team will concentrate on enabling the dApp to support users to select a transaction for the Bundler service and perform end-to-end testing of this feature.&nbsp;</p><p>In parallel, the core team will focus on Stage 6, with its revised scope offering a cohesive Fee and Rewards mechanism. In this stage, users will pay all the fees (mimicking a production experience) and receive ‘subsidies’ from the DAO for certain fees, such as for compliance checks, among others. These subsidies are part of the bootstrapping and will be limited to the initial period of the protocol launch. We wish to understand our users’ views on the fee structures and invite the community to engage with the DAO to discuss the subsidies that should be applied during mainnet launch.</p>  About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. The Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in shielded pools, zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs, and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s ZK primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p>

More broadly TradFi has entered the chat. Franklin Templeton is a TradFi company with $1.5 trillion in assets.

It’s an investment management company (think mutual funds, ETFs) that manages over $1.5 Trillion in assets. This is what we in crypto affectionately refer to as TradFi and they recently came out with a BTC ETF and have big plans for future tokenization. They also seem to be incredibly bullish on crypto and this new intersection between crypto and TradFi.

<p>The Zcash Foundation (ZF) is excited to share our vision for the next two Zcon conferences: ZconV (virtual) in May 2024 and Zcon6 (in-person) tentatively scheduled for the first quarter of 2025. Get ready for impactful presentations and outcomes at ZconV, under the inspiring theme “Zcash Unified!”&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 ZconV 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>ZconV will be a virtual conference, happening online in early May 2024. It will be a celebration showcasing how the diversity of&nbsp; individuals, organizations, and projects within the Zcash ecosystem contributes to its success and innovative spirit. Our goal is to open doors for inclusive and widespread participation from our global community, while maintaining our commitment to fiscal responsibility amidst the uncertainties surrounding the Dev Fund and market conditions.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Using the popular Whova web and mobile app, which received rave reviews during our last conference, ZconV will offer an interactive and dynamic platform for real-time Q&amp;A, discussion boards, polls, chat, and video conferencing. Keep an eye on the&nbsp;<a href="https://zfnd.org/zconv/">ZconV webpage</a>&nbsp;for continuous updates and ways to engage in these enriching discussions.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 Zcon6 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As for Zcon6 we plan to bring the Zcash Community together for an in-person event in Mexico City in early 2025. This gathering will focus on strategic planning and commitment to long-term projects, empowered by a clear understanding of available resources. The timing in Q1 2025 not only offers cost-effectiveness but also a warm and inviting atmosphere during the colder months in many parts of the world, adding an extra layer of appeal for attendees.

<p>Firstly, thank you to all our testers for your continued support, patience, and feedback: we could not do this without you.&nbsp;</p><p>Testnet Stage 3 is now complete, and it provided us with valuable insights, resulting in several updates to the codebase.</p><p>We are excited to announce that Stage 4 of our testnet is live. Stage 4 allows users to send zAssets from inside the pool from one zAccount to another. Within the Stage 4 dApp, users can undertake UTXO selection.&nbsp;</p><p>Stage 4 is a feature-filled release as it is being shipped with an interesting, related feature originally from Stage 6: Withdrawals.&nbsp;</p> Protocol rewards update: <p>Before diving into the new features supported by Stage 4, we need to announce our enhanced protocol reward mechanics:</p>  Automatic conversion of pending PRPs into available PRPs upon spending of UTXO/s during transfers and withdrawals  A flat PRP bonus upon spending UTXO/s   Wallets, accounts, and transactions <p>Stage 4 testnet now supports internal transfers and withdrawals.</p> Internal transfers (send and receive) <p>Users can transfer zAssets to other Panther users inside the shielded pool using their zAddress. Every Panther user is assigned a zAddress upon sign-up. Find your zAddress in the dashboard by clicking the Receive button, as shown in the screenshot.</p><p>You can also share your Panther account address (zAddress) via a QR code from the receive screen. </p> Withdrawals <p>Users can now withdraw zAssets from the shielded pool to their external, linked wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>This external wallet may be the wallet linked to the original Panther account. Alternatively, testers may create a new Panther account with an alternative external wallet and withdraw to an account that did not originally deposit assets.&nbsp;</p><p>The withdrawal process performs compliance checks to ensure that users own the zAccount they are interacting with. This step also verifies that the wallet accepting withdrawals has no illegal association as part of the KYT (Know Your Transactions) check.</p><p>For a complete list of Test Stages, visit the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet/testnet-stages?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther docs</a>.</p> Get started with Stage 4 testing <p>To start testing Stage 4, visit the<a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Panther Protocol documentation</a> for the updated dApp test link and follow the steps outlined.</p> Internal Transfers <p>Log into your MetaMask wallet and sign into the Panther dApp.</p> Step 1: Navigate to the Send screen <p>Send is available from:</p>  Top main menu &gt; zAssets &gt;Send tab  zAssets &gt; Portfolio card &gt; Send button  Dashboard &gt; Private zAssets section &gt; token line &gt; token management buttons   Step 2: Create the transaction <p>Enter the amount to send and choose the token from the menu. Currently, zMatic and zZKP are supported.	</p><p>	</p> Step 3: Manage UTXOs&nbsp; <p>The Stage 4 testnet dApp allows the selection of a maximum of two UTXOs in a given transaction, i.e., up to two UTXOs may define a selected balance.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: you don’t have to actively choose as, by default, UTXOs with the top two balances are selected. If the chosen UTXO/s total value exceeds the transfer amount, the balance is returned as a new UTXO in the user’s zAsset list.	</p> Step 4: Specify the destination&nbsp; <p>Provide the destination address in the Panther account format: beginning with “ZK” and totalling 42 characters.</p><p>&nbsp;Enter a new address or select from previously-used addresses.	</p> Step 5: Send <p>Press the Send button to initiate the internal transfer.&nbsp;</p><p>Congratulations, your transfer is complete!</p> Withdraw  Step 1: Navigate to the Withdraw screen <p>Withdraw is available from:</p>  Top main menu &gt; zAssets &gt; Withdraw screen  Dashboard &gt; Private zAssets section &gt; token line &gt; token management buttons   Step 2: Create the transaction <p>Enter the withdrawal amount and choose the token from the menu. Currently, zMatic and zZKP are supported.</p> Step 3: Manage UTXOs <p>The Stage 4 testnet dApp allows the selection of a maximum of two UTXOs in a given transaction, i.e. up to two UTXOs may define a selected balance.&nbsp;</p> Step 4: Specify the destination <p>Provide the destination address in the Polygon network format: beginning with “0x” and totaling 42 characters. Either enter a new address or select from previously used options.</p> Step 5: Withdraw <p>Press the Withdraw button to initiate the withdrawal.&nbsp;</p><p>Congratulations, your withdrawal is complete!</p><p>To share your feedback, kindly fill in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/e/1FAIpQLSczZNB-tvMILSo8paFjIkeeSub3cqxv7L85rCeR47ad5bs2Gw/viewform?usp=sf_link&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">form</a>.</p><p>This phase marks a significant advancement in the protocol’s capabilities and gets us ever closer to our V1 release. As always, let us know if you have any additional feedback through our social and community channels.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for participating in testnet Stage 4! </p><p>Note: An issue was reported after Stage 3 that made a specific zZKP UTXO unusable. This UTXO was created by converting PRP to zZKP. Because this UTXO was unusable, we made a custom filter on dApp to not fetch them thus avoiding confusion between good and bad UTXO.&nbsp;</p><p>Users who had those zZKP UTXO, however, will be compensated by a direct distribution to their externally owned account thereby ensuring rewards are not lost. Users do not need to perform any action on their side. </p> Not sure how to create a Panther testnet account? watch our tutorial below:

          About Panther Protocol <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. The Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in shielded pools, zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs, and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s ZK primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

		<p>On February 7th, 2024, at approximately 12:00pm UTC, ZEN 5.0.0 will perform a network upgrade on Mainnet via hard fork at block #1502800. As previous communications have stated, after this hard fork it will no longer be possible to perform any transactions involving shielded addresses. It is highly recommended to move funds out of the shielded pool before then.&nbsp;</p><p>Failure to remove shielded ZEN from shielded addresses prior to the hard fork will result in the loss of your shielded ZEN. It’s important to note that transparent ZEN is not affected by the hard fork, just shielded ZEN.&nbsp;</p><p>This move came with the successfully passed <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42207-complete-removal-of-shielded-pool-from-the-horizen-mainchain/">ZenIP 42207</a> earlier this year, which enabled the complete removal of the shielded pool from the Horizen mainchain. This change built upon the deprecation of access to the shielded pool enacted by <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/what-is-zenip-42204-deprecation-of-shielded-pools/">ZenIP 42204</a> and is a response to the evolving regulatory environment around privacy tokens, re-confirming and showcasing the project’s strategic pivot away from privacy-focused features. As a result, it will no longer be possible to conduct a private transaction on Horizen or access private addresses as of February 7, 2024.</p><p>This is a complete removal of all private payment features from Horizen, effective Feb 7, 2024. There will be no private payment capabilities in Horizen as of this change. Regular public payments, just like Bitcoin, will continue to be supported by Horizen. Horizen will not be a privacy cryptocurrency anymore when this takes effect on Feb 7, 2024.</p><p>Again, we strongly recommend that all users with existing funds in private addresses transfer their funds to their own transparent addresses using Sphere by Horizen or zen-cli before February 7th, 2024. After February 7th, 2024 it will not be possible anymore to transfer any funds inside of the shielded pool to any other address. Unshielding funds directly to exchange deposit addresses is strongly discouraged.</p><p>There is a guide on the Horizen Blog on how to De-Shield ZEN on Sphere Wallet, users will need to de-shield any ZEN in a shielded address by transferring it out from the shielded pool. Please reference the guide here: <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/how-to-de-shield-zen-on-sphere-wallet/">https://blog.horizen.io/how-to-de-shield-zen-on-sphere-wallet/</a></p><p>The Horizen Ecosystem Team remains readily available to answer any questions around this, please open up a ticket, or reach out to us on our Discord: <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">https://horizen.io/invite/discord</a></p>

<p>January 31, 2024, San Francisco, California— Today Brave Software announced the launch of Brave Ads Manager, a new platform to buy, manage, and report on privacy-preserving ad campaigns in the Brave ecosystem. The platform had been in limited <a>beta</a> since last spring and is now offering open <a href="https://ads.brave.com/">registration</a> to customers worldwide.</p>
<p>The Brave browser has grown to an audience of over 65 million monthly users while Brave Ads, which was <a>introduced in 2019</a>, has successfully run 9,000+ campaigns for 1,500+ advertisers in 200 countries. Throughout 2023, Brave Ads also expanded with the help of early adopters to ad placements on <a href="https://search.brave.com/">Brave Search</a>, the fastest growing search engine since Bing. Brave’s recent clients include Ford, Intuit, Norton, Swarovski, and Wayfair.</p>

 Reaching the next generation of early adopters 
<p><a>Brave users</a> are lead users and are passionate about their role in the future of the Web. As early adopters of emerging technologies like Web3 and AI, they value independence, quality content, and privacy above all when browsing. This makes them engaged but not easily reachable through conventional channels.</p>
<p>Brave Ads reconnects users with advertisers and enables direct relationships where users and brands meet on their own terms. Users set preferences for privacy-respecting ads, choosing when, where and how often to engage. Advertisers signal care for customers by respecting these choices, building goodwill and trust. No trackers or cookies are ever used. Ultimately, both parties benefit from Brave’s model of transparency and control over online experiences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“With over 65 million users and growing, Brave can’t be ignored by brands who want to reach the people at the frontier of the Web. What Brave users do, buy, and talk about today, the rest of the world will be doing, buying, and talking about in years to come.”</p>
<p>Luke Mulks, VP Business Operations</p>
</blockquote>

 The easiest way to advertise with privacy in mind 
<p>Customers can navigate a familiar and streamlined campaign creation process to create their Brave Ads campaigns in minutes. Once a campaign is submitted for review, customers can expect launch within 48 hours. Throughout the campaign, customers will have access to a dashboard to view campaign performance through a range of basic and advanced tools, all designed for practical use in the cookieless Web.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    
Brave Ads Manager campaign creation</p>

 Unique browser-based ad placements 
<p>Brave Ads Manager customers have the option to buy Notification and Newsfeed ad placements, two of four available ad types found throughout the Brave <a>browser</a>.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://ads-help.brave.com/ad-placements/brave-browser/notification/">Notification ads</a> were the first—and remain the most popular—ad unit to launch with Brave Ads in the browser. For acquisition-based campaign objectives, advertisers can leverage Mindset Ad Targeting, Brave’s unique ad-matching technology that delivers precision, interest-based targeting at the browser level without risks or harm to privacy.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://ads-help.brave.com/ad-placements/brave-browser/news/">Newsfeed ads</a> are native image and text placements integrated seamlessly within Brave News, a free and customizable RSS and news aggregator available in the Brave browser via a new tab page. Ads in Brave News are always 100% SOV (share of voice)—two ads will never display in the feed at the same time.</p>

<p>Brave’s two other ad placements—<a href="https://ads-help.brave.com/ad-placements/brave-browser/ntt/">New Tab Takeovers</a> and <a href="https://ads-help.brave.com/ad-placements/brave-search/keyword/">Search keyword ads</a>—are available as managed service buys and can be booked by <a href="https://ads.brave.com/contact">contacting Brave’s ad sales team</a>.</p>
<p>About Brave Ads</p>
<p><a>Brave Ads launched in 2019</a> with the goal of reforming an increasingly user-hostile Web, made worse by ever-invasive tracking from innumerable ad-technology firms competing to capture as much data—people’s data—as possible. Brave Ads are cookieless, don’t track or identify users, and offer choice in how brands engage with them as they browse and search the Web.</p>

 Consensus 2024 — Verus Showcases Fully Completed PBaaS Blockchain Technology  Verus showcases its fully completed Public Blockchain as a Service (PBaaS) technology at Consensus 2024, May 29–31, Austin, USA (booth 1245). The global event for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovations this year. Here, tens of thousands of cryptocurrency enthusiasts gather to explore the newest advancements in the industry.  The L0/1 Verus Protocol Solves Major Issues with Ethereum and Other VM-centric Networks <p>Developing dApps with Verus is much more straightforward than building to a VM-based application model and results in inherently more capable, secure and scalable solutions. The Verus Protocol solves issues with gas fees, enables unlimited scale, is not vulnerable to smart contract hacks and bugs, addresses MEV at the protocol level, provides an identity model (<a href="https://docs.verus.io/verusid/">VerusID</a>) that applications can leverage and profit from, includes provable cross-chain and multichain support, does away with insecure and phishing-prone wallet approval mechanisms, and does not require expensive Solidity developers for applications, unless they must also have an Ethereum component to&nbsp;them.</p><p>All these issues are solved with the L0/1 Verus Protocol. Verus does not use smart contracts — it uses smart transactions. Verus smart transactions [<a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-smart-transactions-vs-smart-contracts-f98079c00ed0">read more</a>] are much easier to use (no programming needed) in practice to achieve most capabilities, if not all, compared to VM-protocols that use smart contracts. Yet Verus is still fully interoperable with Ethereum through the non-custodial, trustless and decentralized Verus-Ethereum Bridge with liquidity pool currency [<a href="https://docs.verus.io/eth-bridge/">more on the&nbsp;Bridge</a>].</p> Showcasing Verus App-Development Opportunities at Consensus 2024 <p>Get ready for a new era of decentralized application development. Unlike today’s complex smart contract applications, requiring VM-based smart contracts that talk to user facing applications through server-side APIs and phishing-prone web-interfaces using public key hashes or rented names as identity, the Verus network is a Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 0 (L0) protocol with composable and powerful multi-chain core primitives, including identities, currencies, MEV-resistant liquidity baskets, updateable, even transferable ID-bound databases that can comprise NFTs and real world assets, all on a 100% fully decentralized, unlimited scale backbone, secured by the 50% proof-of-stake / 50% proof-of-work, 51% hash attack resistant Verus Proof of Power (PoP) consensus and accessible securely from mobile clients or cloud-based web-applications.</p><p>Build applications in your favorite framework for clients and access the Verus network either through QR-codes and deep-links to a client-side wallet under user control or talk directly to data-indexed, blockchain nodes, capable of providing fast access to an unlimited number of user identities and their unlimited Verus Data Exchange Format (VDXF) indexable key-value database providing provable, optionally private, worldwide resolvable data at unlimited scale over an unlimited number of blockchains. All of this power, including inherent eCommerce and markets of all types are usable by applications, and unlike yesterday’s Internet, application-owned data stays under application control, while user-owned data remains under user control and subject to voluntary, provable disclosure, protected by zero knowledge privacy, as it should always have&nbsp;been.</p><p>Write applications your way, your client frameworks, your languages, with links and RPC calls to the decentralized Internet of Value. Connect through one or more blockchains. Use, create, sell, and provision your application’s permanent IDs for secure login, KYC, commerce, and provable data at scale, all on the rent-free, credibly neutral and fully decentralized Internet of&nbsp;Value.</p><p>Builders of applications, organizations, and businesses can use the Verus Protocol to provision IDs, manage and interact with users and user state at any scale, launch currencies (e.g. tokens, liquidity baskets [<a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/launch-currency.html">see docs</a>]), even fully interoperable, independent, customizable worldwide blockchains with their own economics and fee structure, while sharing mining and economic power across the entire Verus Protocol network of unlimited PBaaS chains. All currencies, whether native currencies of a new blockchain, easily created and minted tokens, or MEV-resistant liquidity baskets are easy to launch and access with the protocol on Verus or any connected PBaaS chain. All of them, from the moment they are launched can be exported to Ethereum as ERC20s [<a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/export-to-eth.html">see docs</a>] or ERC721 currencies or any chain across the Verus ecosystem. All currencies on the network, including tokens, cross-chain currencies, and even liquidity baskets and their supplies are secured by miners and stakers according to protocol rules. On other blockchain networks, this level of security is applied to single native currencies, on Verus, all currencies on a chain are primitives known to and accounted for by the protocol, eliminating entire classes of smart contract risks that result when every contract reinvents a new way to account for its currency but has no systemic&nbsp;control.</p><p>With Verus, currencies are compatible with ERC20s. Verus applications can leverage, but do not require Solidity developers or VM-based programming. Additionally all ERC-20s can be permissionlessly bridged over from Ethereum to Verus [<a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/mapping-1:1-eth.html">see docs</a>], giving users and application builders the freedom to switch seamlessly between the Verus and Ethereum networks.</p><p>All currencies on the Verus network (also the ones bridged over from Ethereum) can be used with Verus DeFi, another primitive inherent to the protocol. Verus DeFi enables liquidity baskets of up to 10 underlying reserve currencies and can serve as a unique, self-balancing, MEV-resistant portfolio, a permissionless or permissioned ID registrar where fees go to the LPs of the basket, or an easy way to send from any reserve currency or the basket currency itself to any other without worrying about block builder reordering or MEV, as all conversions of a liquidity basket in any direction that are processed within one or more blocks are always solved simultaneously, no front and not back. Every conversion gets the same price in each direction with no spread and an ultra low fee (max. 0.05%), again, all part of the L1 consensus.</p><p>Whether you plan to build eCommerce enabled supply chains, massively scalable ownership-based games, real world asset eCommerce enabled networks, voting systems, identity management networks, communication networks, financial networks, 3D metaverses with identities, brands, and ownership or just about any application for a better Web3 on the Internet of Value, you’ll be left behind if you don’t deep dive on Verus&nbsp;first.</p><p>Join us in the next crypto revolution. Verus, with truth and privacy for&nbsp;all!</p><p>Come to the Verus booth on May 29–31 at Consensus 2024. The worldwide community is happy to get you started with a free VerusID, the easy to use Verus Mobile or any of the wide range of protocol features.</p> Amazing Verus Community <p>The Verus community united to facilitate participation at Consensus 2024 by generously contributing VRSC, ETH, DAI, MKR, Bridge.vETH and BTC. A heartfelt thank you to all the contributors! ❤️</p><p>The Verus community used the funds to secure a two-block booth at Consensus, along with other facilities that we can not disclose&nbsp;yet.</p><p>Numerous members of the Verus community are participating in Consensus 2024, and we invite you to be a part of it too! Let’s create a significant presence and showcase to the world the wide range of capabilities of Verus.

<p>San Francisco (USA), January 30th, 2023 – XRSI – X Reality Safety Intelligence is a 501(c)(3) global non-profit <a href="https://www.standardsportal.org/usa_en/sdo/xrsi.aspx">Standards Developing Organization (SDO)</a> promoting privacy, safety, security, and ethics in immersive and emerging technologies. Headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area in the United States and Torino, Italy in Europe, XRSI is the world’s leading organization dedicated to providing intelligence and advisory services and we are delighted to share a key leadership update. As the founder and CEO, Kavya Pearlman, steps away for a well-deserved maternity leave, April Boyd-Noronha, a prominent member of our board and our Global Diversity &amp; Inclusion Advisor, has been appointed as the Interim CEO for a minimum of six-month period.</p>



<p>April Boyd-Noronha, a luminary on our board and the Global Diversity &amp; Inclusion Advisor at XRSI, will be assuming the role of interim CEO for the next six months. This strategic move aligns with our ethos of promoting safety, privacy, security, and responsible innovation in the tech ecosystem.</p>



<p>“I am deeply honored to step in as Interim CEO of XRSI, a role I accept with immense gratitude to Kavya Pearlman and our team. Kavya’s trust and vision have been a guiding light, and I am committed to nurturing the path she has set forth for XRSI. Together, we’ve pioneered safety and inclusion in the emerging tech ecosystem. I am excited to lead us during this special time for the XRSI family supporting Kavya’’s journey to motherhood. I look forward to building on our strong foundation with heartfelt dedication and unwavering focus in support of the incredibly impactful work of XRSI.” – April Boyd-Noronha, Board Member and Interim-CEO</p>

Kavya expresses gratitude and enthusiasm as she invites the community to welcome April in this new role. In Kavya’s own words,&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As I prepare to embrace the joys of motherhood, I am leaving XRSI in the most capable hands. April Boyd-Noronha, with her long-standing commitment and versatile contributions to XRSI, as the inaugural President of the CyberXR Coalition, XRSI’s Global D&amp;I Advisor, and an esteemed Executive Board Member, embodies the leadership and vision essential for guiding our organization forward. Her dedication has been a driving force in our commitment to diversity, inclusion, and safety in technology, making her the ideal steward of XRSI’s mission in my absence.” – Kavya Pearlman, Founder &amp; CEO</p>

Over the past year, PIVX has reached new heights, expanding its use cases, increasing rewards, gaining listings on various exchanges, and engaging with its vibrant community.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look at the highlights of this remarkable year for&nbsp;PIVX:</p><p>Rewards Increase: <br>The most significant highlight was the rewards increase. With the mandatory PIVX v5.5.0 update in January 2023, payments to the treasury, staking rewards, and Masternode rewards all received a significant boost. Treasury payments surged by an order of magnitude to 10 PIV per block, staking payments doubled to 4 PIV per block, and Masternode payments also doubled to 6 PIV per block. These increases have incentivized more participation and further strengthened the PIVX&nbsp;network!</p><p>Use Case Expansion: <br>PIVX expanded its use cases throughout the year. PIVCards, Coinsbee, and <a href="https://www.travala.com/">Travala.com</a> embraced $PIVX as a payment option. Users can now purchase gift cards from all over the world with PIV on<a href="https://mypivxwallet.org/pivcards/"> mypivxwallet.org, PIVCards</a>, <a href="https://shopping.io/">Shopping.io</a> as well as <a href="https://www.coinsbee.com/">Coinsbee</a> offers a platform where $PIVX can be used to purchase various gift&nbsp;cards.</p><p>Listing Growth: <br>PIVX experienced significant listing growth, providing more opportunities for PIVX enthusiasts. New listings included <a href="https://whitebit.com/">Whitebit</a>, <a href="https://changeangel.io/">Changeangel</a>, <a href="https://houdiniswap.com/">Houdini Swap</a>, <a href="https://cointopay.com/">Cointopay</a>, <a href="https://swapuz.com/">Swapuz</a>, <a href="https://easybit.com/">Easybit, </a><a href="https://www.coinex.com/">CoinEx</a>, <a href="https://dex-trade.com/">Dex-Trade</a>, Securus Wallet, <a href="https://www.biconomy.com/">Biconomy,</a> Coinstore, <a href="https://nonkyc.io/">NonKYC</a>, <a href="https://changenow.io/">ChangeNOW </a>widget added to PIVX.org, <a href="https://tradeogre.com/markets">TradeOgre</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/pivx/breaking-news-9615d5416f6c">P2P payments on Binance,</a> <a href="https://www.lbank.com/">LBank</a>, <a href="https://arcticwallet.io/">Arctic Wallet</a>, <a href="https://finchpay.io/">FinchPay</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xt.com/en">Xt.com</a>.</p><p>Enhanced Trading Options: <br>PIVX gained enhanced trading options with various exchanges. In addition to the PIVX/USDT Binance trading pair, some other exchanges introduced BTC as well as USDT options, allowing for more convenient and accessible trading options for the PIVX community.</p><p>Community Engagement: <br>PIVX actively engaged with its community through various activities. These included YouTube shorts, AMAs (Ask Me Anything), the SuperBlock Report (PIVXLabs), PIVXcommunity contests, and the Privacy Roundtable, a collaborative group consisting of PIVX, BasicSwapDEX, Particl, and Firo. The Privacy Roundtable, hosts monthly Twitter spaces where trending privacy topics are discussed and other privacy projects are introduced. These initiatives are fostering a more vibrant and engaged community.</p><p>As we celebrate PIVX’s 8th birthday, we can proudly reflect on these achievements over the past year. The rewards increase, expanded use cases, listing growth, enhanced trading options, and community engagement have all contributed to the growth and success of&nbsp;PIVX.</p><p>On this special day, let us say that growth is not a destination, but an ongoing journey. As we celebrate PIVX’s achievements, we recognize that it is through the relentless pursuit of knowledge, the embrace of new opportunities, and the adaptability to changing circumstances that PIVX continues to evolve and expand. Let us come together as a community committed to learning and adapting, keeping PIVX at the forefront of innovation and progress in the pursuit of privacy and financial sovereignty</p><p>Happy 8th birthday, PIVX!

With this grant, StarShell will allow users to route wallet RPC requests through the Nym mixnet, bringing metadata protection and robust privacy guarantees to end users. The wallet will include real-time metrics and visualizations based on mixnet activity. A new API will allow web applications to route all chain-directed traffic through the mixnet via the&nbsp;wallet.</p> <a href="https://www.nodies.app/">Nodies DLB</a> <p>Grant amount: $30,000USD</p><p>Nodies DLB is a managed infrastructure provider for centralized and decentralized remote procedure call (RPC) nodes, which enable communication between applications and blockchain networks. Nodies DLB gives its clients access to thousands of decentralized nodes while maintaining best-in-class security and performance standards. However, there is currently a scarcity of decentralized privacy-preserving RPC solutions. Nodies DLB proposes integrating its software with the Nym mixnet to bring end-to-end privacy protections to its assets including advanced metadata protection.</p> Pastenym by <a href="https://notrustverify.ch/">No Trust&nbsp;Verify</a> <p>Grant amount: $3,000USD</p><p>Pastenym is a text-sharing service proposed by long-time Nym community contributors and node operators,<a href="https://notrustverify.ch/"> No Trust Verify</a>. In the manner of Pastebin, Pastenym is an online text-drop but with added privacy protections for its users via the mixnet, encrypting their data as well as their metadata when text is&nbsp;shared.</p><p>Congratulations again to these successful teams!</p><p>The <a href="https://nymtech.notion.site/nymtech/Nym-Innovation-Fund-7a1d2581a55b417bb44083fb29e12a0f">Nym Innovation Fund remains open for submissions</a>.</p><p>As these projects mature over the next quarter, we will introduce them to the venture funds that have pledged to support the Nym Innovation Fund. In addition, we’re hoping to onboard existing mature projects with their own plans for growth using Nym that can attract venture capital funding. Proposals with a business plan, a unique market proposition, and that are mature enough for seed investment will receive priority.</p><p>In addition to opening a pipeline to respected VCs, Nym will mentor successful teams to further refine their proposals.</p><p>With the VPN market alone projected to be <a href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/report/vpn">worth $151bn by 2030</a>, there’s enormous market potential for an entire ecosystem that actually respects people’s right to privacy&nbsp;online.</p><p>People are fed up with the surveillance capitalism model of web 2.0. So if you’ve got a winning idea, submit <a href="https://nymtech.notion.site/nymtech/Nym-Innovation-Fund-7a1d2581a55b417bb44083fb29e12a0f">your pitch deck to the Innovation Fund and have Nym help you bring it to&nbsp;life</a>.</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-announces-first-round-of-grants-from-nym-innovation-fund-c7811a095fb7">Nym announces first round of grants from Nym Innovation Fund</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>To our winner, Sam Richter, congratulations on this well-deserved $2,500 cash prize you can use toward tuition, books, or anything else college requires. When informed of his big win, Sam said: “I plan to put the money towards my college tuition as I pursue a bachelor’s degree in computer science at Iowa State University.” In addition to the cash prize, Sam’s photo will be seen by Brave’s 60+ million worldwide users as a featured background on the Brave browser’s new tab page throughout 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam took the picture when he and his family hiked on a trail in the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area in Nevada. His photo not only shows a remarkable moment in nature, but also his technique and creative eye.</p>
<p>At Brave, we believe in building a human-first Web, and empowering anyone to participate in that Web by creating user-generated content. The Brave new tab page is another surface where people can show their creative selves.</p>
<p>For those who submitted but did not win: Thank you! And, stay tuned—there may be more opportunities and exciting events in the near future.</p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of Zebra version 1.5.2.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This latest version is a hotfix release, to temporarily remove the experimental&nbsp;internal-miner&nbsp;feature introduced in the preceding 1.5.1 release. Following the 1.5.1 release on GitHub, we identified difficulties in publishing the&nbsp;zebra-chain&nbsp;crate to <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Unfortunately, to resolve this challenge, which involves an unpublished dependency, we had to temporarily remove the internal miner support introduced in version 1.5.1.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The 1.5.1 release includes a utility for reading results from the zebra blockchain scanner, thus finalizing a minimum viable product for scanning the Zcash blockchain with a viewing key. It also added an experimental&nbsp;internal-miner&nbsp;feature, temporarily removed with the 1.5.2 hotfix release, which can mine blocks within&nbsp;zebrad. This feature is only supported on testnet as you need to use a more efficient GPU or ASIC for mainnet mining.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We plan to reinstate the&nbsp;internal-miner&nbsp;feature once our PRs are merged and released into the&nbsp;equihash dependency. You can track development progress on this issue <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/8183">here</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As part of this release we have also improved our documentation with details on how to use the new blockchain scanning feature as well as making it easier to find documentation for all our crates in <a href="https://docs.rs/">docs.rs</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can see a full copy of the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.5.1">v1.5.1 Release Notes</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.5.2">v1.5.2 Release Notes</a> on github.</p>

 Zcash Viewing Keys 



<p>When a Zcash user creates a shielded transaction, they encrypt it to the recipient’s address. Being able to access the data hidden behind the encryption is a necessary condition for the recipient to spend the funds, but it’s not sufficient since the recipient also needs to prove ownership of the spending key corresponding to the address. To decrypt the shielded transaction, the recipient uses a so-called viewing key, which they derive from their spending key. A viewing key allows decryption of the shielded data but reveals nothing about the spending key, effectively allowing “viewing” of shielded transactions but not spending of them.</p>



 Blockchain Scanning with Zebra 



<p>All Zcash users use their viewing keys to learn about what transactions belong to them. They try to decrypt each transaction in the blockchain to see if they can unlock the shielded data. We refer to this process as scanning or trial decryption. Light clients can perform the scanning locally so that the public server they communicate with doesn’t learn anything about their transactions. However, some users operate their own infrastructure. These are typically enterprise users, such as exchanges, which are best served using a scanning service closely linked to their full node.</p>



<p>At Zcon4, the Electric Coin Company and Zcash Foundation agreed to move the Zcash ecosystem to Zebra. To be able to do so, Zebra needs to support wallets capable of replacing the wallet in zcashd. As a first step toward this goal, we decided to extend Zebra with a blockchain scanner that accepts viewing keys and performs the trial decryption of shielded transactions. The scanner then stores the results in persistent storage. This functionality should allow for an efficient implementation of wallets relying on Zebra.</p>



 Implementation Details 



<p>The current scanner is a new crate in the Zebra repository, in the form of a minimum viable product. It relies on the librustzcash library to perform the scanning, and supports only Sapling. It reads all blocks through Zebra’s internal state service and stores the TXIDs, referring to transactions that contain notes decryptable by the provided viewing keys. The storage is a separate instance of RocksDB that Zebra also uses for storing the state.</p>



<p>The current version of the scanner is documented for users in our <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/shielded-scan.html">Zebra book</a>. If you want to give it a try, you can use <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/tree/main/zebra-utils#scanning-results-reader">this tool</a> to read the scanning results. If you submit the scanning <a href="https://zecpages.com/boardinfo">key from ZECpages</a>, it will print all posts from the board to standard output. The next step for the scanner is to implement a gRPC frontend, exposing the scanner’s capabilities to Zebra users.</p>

  To kick off 2024, we're thrilled to announce a major update to the desktop version of Brave News, our privacy-preserving, in-browser news feed.

<p>To kick off 2024, we’re thrilled to announce a major update to the desktop version of Brave News, our privacy-preserving, in-browser news feed. The improved Brave News creates an even more seamless experience for catching up on personalized news, by simply scrolling down in a new browser tab. Brave News is free and the update includes a streamlined interface as well as an upgrade to the local personalization algorithms. These changes make Brave News both easier to use and smarter about the stories you see, while maintaining Brave’s privacy promise.</p>
<p>This newly optimized Brave News feed gives users more choice and control over what they see, and options for filtering content by channel or publisher. The improved local feed algorithm helps users discover new and interesting stories and provides suggestions for following channels and publishers they might enjoy. Users can also add RSS feeds, and choose to view content only from their favorite local publishers, blogs, or community sites.</p>
<p>Key updates include:</p>
 
 A For you section that shows stories based on your interests and local browsing history - while never infringing on your privacy 
 An updated top news section and story clusters 
 A filter view for viewing content by channel, source, or RSS feed 
 An easily visible news preview on the new tab page, with the latest news that may be of interest to you 
 

 One place, better control 
<p>In this update, we were hyper-focused on the way news is presented. We redesigned the Brave News space to show more articles and be more conscious about how we display images so you can get more value from a glance. We also added a side navigation panel so you can explore your favorite channels and publishers in a single click.</p>
<p>If you’re just looking for an interesting mix of daily news, then check out the For you and Following feeds. Whether you want an overview of the day’s news, or you’re looking for something specific, Brave News puts you in control of your news experience…all while protecting your privacy.</p>
<p>To find Brave News, just open Brave on your desktop, then open a new tab and scroll down.</p>
<p>

    
    

    




      
      
    
Redesigned Brave News feed page</p>

 Content that’s relevant to you 
<p>Endlessly scrolling through irrelevant news can be a real time waste. That’s why we overhauled how your feed is created and personalized, making it smarter and more attuned to your interests. The improved Brave News now prioritizes showing you content you may actually want to read.</p>
<p>Some new features take the form of new types of cards displayed in the feed. Channel cards, for example, are single-themed deep dives into the channels and topics you care about the most. And for US users, Top stories cards neatly summarize the most important events and developments happening now.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    </p>
<p>Left: Channel card: single-themed deep dives into topics you care about most. Right: Top Stories card: summaries of the most important events and developments happening now.</p>
<p>To make customizing your feed even easier, we added Customize cards to the feed. These cards will recommend new publishers and/or channels you might be interested in, based on your existing preferences and signals.</p>
<p>

    
    

    




      
      
    
Brave News customization cards</p>
<p>The customization menu is also accessible via the settings button at the bottom right, or via the Add button in the new side navigation panel.</p>

 Privacy always comes first 
<p>News aggregators are a common way to consume news. However, the way most popular aggregators work is by collecting and storing your preferences, consumption habits, and other behavioral data to determine what news to show you.</p>
<p>But the news you consume can tell a lot about you, from your political beliefs to fine-grained interests (e.g. a review about a self-help book) and more. For these reasons, we believe that the news you consume should have the same privacy protections as anything else you do online. Unlike others, Brave does not collect or store your data.</p>
<p>From how articles are delivered to how and where personalization happens, Brave News has been designed with privacy in mind. Information about your consumption habits—what channels and publishers you follow, the exact articles you click and read, and more—never leaves your computer. Because a great news experience does not require data collection, Brave’s local personalization mechanisms ensure the news in your feed is relevant, interesting, and private.</p>

		  ZEN 5.0.0 is the official Mainnet Release  ZEN 4.1.1 (previous version) is going to deprecate on Mainnet at block #1502084, on February 6th, 2024 at approximately 6:00 AM UTC. Please, update to ZEN 5.0.0 before February 6th, 2024.  ZEN 5.0.0 will perform a network upgrade on Mainnet via Hard Fork at block #1502800, on February 7th, 2024 at approximately 12:00 PM UTC.  <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0xbb8d72c088637c53cde7aa07c030b63dcdfa901ddffd5ce579b061d6064d5bb0">ZenIP-42207</a> to fully remove the shielded pool from Horizen will be implemented with this release:  All transactions involving shielded addresses will no longer be accepted at the consensus level once the hard fork activates  RPC calls z_sendmany and z_mergetoaddress have been partially disabled so that it will no longer be possible to submit transactions involving shielded addresses (transparent-to-shielded, shielded-to-shielded, and shielded-to-transparent) once the hard fork activates. Transparent-to-transparent transactions will still be accepted and submitted to the network.  Only nodes running on Mainnet have to be updated.      <p>IMPORTANT: 5.0.0.<br>After the previously mentioned Hard Fork, it will no longer be possible to perform any transactions involving shielded addresses. It is highly recommended to move funds out of the shielded pool before then. Directly depositing funds from shielded addresses to exchange wallets is strongly discouraged.<br><br></p><p>See release notes <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zen/blob/release/5.0.0/doc/release-notes/release-notes-5.0.0.md">Here.</a></p><p>Please let us know if you have any questions or if you need further support by reaching out to us on <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">our Discord.</a></p>

<p>Celebrating One Year of PIVX Rewards Increase: A Gateway to Promising Opportunities</p><p>As we commemorate the one-year anniversary of <a href="https://pivx.org/news/pivx-rewards-increase">PIVX’s rewards increase,</a> it is a moment of celebration and reflection on the positive impact this decision has had on the PIVX ecosystem. On January 22, 2023, coinciding with block 3715200, PIVX embraced the version 5.5.0 upgrade, marking a significant milestone in its financial structure. This upgrade brought forth remarkable changes, including increased payments to the treasury, staking and Masternode rewards, setting the stage for further growth, innovation, and community engagement.</p><p>Expanding Opportunities and Strengthening the Network:<br>With the rewards increase, maximum treasury payments soared to 10 PIV per block. This surge in funding allows for greater support for listings, use cases, development, marketing, and essential initiatives within the PIVX community. Simultaneously, staking rewards doubled to 4 PIV per block, providing an incentive for more PIVX holders to actively participate in securing the network. Doubling of Masternode payments to 6 PIV per block further encourages the growth of Masternodes, enabling them to vote on treasury expenditures and contribute to future PIVX applications. These advancements not only strengthen the PIVX network but also open doors to exciting opportunities for growth and development.</p><p>Conclusion:<br>As we celebrate the one-year anniversary of the PIVX rewards increase, we acknowledge the positive impact it has had on the project’s financial structure. The rewards increase is succeeding in enhancing funding, stimulating proposal submissions, expanding use cases, and attracting more listings for <a href="http://PIVX.org">PIVX.</a> It has played a vital role in supporting various initiatives and contributing to the growth and opportunities of the&nbsp;<a href="http://Discord.PIVX.org">project.</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/celebrating-one-year-of-pivx-rewards-increase-9c4146cd3e17">Celebrating One Year of PIVX Rewards Increase.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

The reasons for this are twofold: enormous operating costs and seamless user experience (e.g. social logins and account recovery), which, until recently, could only be solved through centralisation. Add to this the reluctance to change platforms as users need to re-upload their files, and you get an ossified user base.

		 Introduction 
<p>The confirmed date for full secure node deprecation is Mar 11, 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip_42206.md">ZenIP 42206</a> was introduced and voted on in November 2023 and the community overwhelmingly voted in favor of deprecating secure nodes and repurposing the coinbase reward that secure nodes were receiving to EON forger nodes.&nbsp; However, secure nodes have not yet been fully deprecated.&nbsp; This blog post outlines the steps remaining, the timeline to full secure node deprecation, additional information on EON forger nodes and a link to instructions on setting up a forger node.</p>
 Details 
<p>This date listed above represents the date that the secure node tracking system is shut off, and that changes to both EON and Horizen are implemented (and sufficiently tested) to enable the movement of the coinbase reward from Horizen to EON, and then the subsequent distribution of the coinbase reward to forgers who have forged blocks.</p>
<p>Before the end of March the secure node tracking servers will no longer accept connections, most of the tracking servers will be shut down, and two servers will remain running for the foreseeable future but will be put into an ‘archive’ mode.</p>
<p>The remaining servers will be limited to content concerning payments and earnings for tax purposes.&nbsp; API connectivity will be limited to interacting with API keys and earnings.</p>
<p>The Horizen Team would like to thank everyone who staked ZEN and ran nodes over the last 6+ years, especially those who have been here since the initial deployment of Secure Nodes in December of 2017.</p>
 Timeline 
 
 Jan 25, 2024 – changes to EON implemented 
 Feb 7, 2024 – next mainchain hardfork 
 Mar 10, 2024 – last secure node earning period ends 
 Mar 11, 2024 – last secure node payment performed, secure nodes fully deprecated 
 Mar 18, 2024 – first coinbase rewards deposited into Horizen EON 
 
 EON Forger Node Instructions 
<p>For step-by-step instructions on how to set up and run an EON forger node, please visit <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/compose-evm-simplified/blob/main/docs/FORGER.md">our GitHub repository below</a> to learn more. If you intend to run a forger node, please select ‘forger’ when executing the ‘init.sh’ script for the first time. Keep in mind that both the Mainchain node and the Sidechain node will require some time to fully synchronize the entire chains.</p>

		 What are Horizen EON Forger Nodes and Why are they Important? 
<p></p>
<p>In a Proof-of-Stake chain, the nodes are called forger nodes.&nbsp;Forger nodes play a critical role in PoS consensus by creating blocks, validating transactions, enhancing security, and promoting efficiency and decentralization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Forger nodes are critical to Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus for several reasons:</p>
 
 Block production: They create new blocks in the blockchain, with their chance of being selected often based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold as collateral. 
 Transaction validation: Forger nodes validate and add transactions to the blockchain, ensuring that only valid transactions are recorded. 
 Security: They’re financially motivated to act honestly because they’ve staked their own tokens as collateral, risking loss of rewards if they behave maliciously. 
 Energy efficiency: PoS is more environmentally friendly than PoW because it doesn’t require the same amount of computing power. 
 Sybil attack resistance: The larger the number of honest forger nodes, the harder a sybil attack becomes. 
 Decentralization: Forging nodes contribute to network decentralization, allowing a wider range of participants to be involved.

<p>Following the recent listing of <a href="https://www.bitmart.com/en-US?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">$ZKP on BitMart</a>, Panther's CEO, Oliver Gale, introduced Panther Protocol to BitMart's community. This post provides a summary of the conversation. Firstly, let's quickly revisit the BitMart:Panther partnership.</p> BitMart:Panther partnership <p>In December 2023, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bitmart-lists-zero-knowledge-defi-pioneer-panther-protocols-zkp/">Panther Protocol's $ZKP was listed on BitMart</a>, a leading cryptocurrency exchange serving a global user base spanning 180 countries.</p><p>This partnership with BitMart and upcoming listings on other trusted exchanges are part of Panther commitment to make <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/dao/token/tokenomics?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">$ZKP more accessible</a> to the wider Web3 community.&nbsp;</p> Panther's value proposition <p>Oliver Gale, Co-founder and CEO of Panther, presented his vision of how Panther Protocol solves some of the pressing pain points that act as barriers to entry to both retail- and institutional-level investors in DeFi.</p><p>Oliver asserts that, for the decentralized Web to scale and attract more users, it must first overcome several significant challenges that crypto faces. He summarized these as four key issues:</p>  Exposed investment strategies: with the rise of blockchain analytics solutions such as Nansen, institutional investors are increasingly worried about exposed investment strategies.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Fragmented liquidity: the inability to leverage liquidity across multiple chains makes it difficult for institutions to buy and sell their preferred crypto without affecting the price.  Lack of transaction security: since June 2020, MEV bots have made at least $1 billion in profit across Ethereum, BSC, and Solana chains by exploiting transaction queues.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Compliance and privacy: existing privacy-focused DeFi products lack features to comply with AML/CTF requirements amid increased regulatory scrutiny.  <p>Oliver explained how Panther's privacy-preserving infrastructure for the decentralized Web, consisting of a shielded pool, cross-chain bridges, and ZK compliance tooling, solves these issues. This means that users can send, swap, and receive shielded assets through Panther while their on-chain privacy is being protected.</p> Panther Protocol: the product suite <p>Oliver gave BitMart's audience a run down on how Zones within Multi-Asset Shielded Pools (MASPs) empower users by providing a unified privacy set for all assets within a given smart contract environment.&nbsp;</p><p>Panther allows users to trade stablecoins, utility tokens, and NFTs within a single shielded pool, simplifying trading in a privacy-preserving environment. The innovation of Zones represents the first coherent solution to enable institutional access to DeFi, as they enable AML compliance, customization, and enforcement.&nbsp;</p><p>Oliver expanded on how Panther Protocol’s rich feature set positions Panther as the go-to solution to onboard users to private DeFi in a privacy-preserving manner. Panther’s strong position is, in part, due to its integration with third-party on-chain compliance providers. This enables the protocol to authenticate users — solving for the KYC demands of regulators by offering users a unique set of credentials on completion of verification. This key innovation is that the user data is private thanks to zero-knowledge proofs generated directly within the user's browser. The credential provided allows the user to seamlessly integrate with blockchain-based DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and similar platforms.</p><p>Furthermore, due to the flexibility of its design, Panther users can access the protocol without being bound to a single compliance provider. Similarly, financial institutions can benefit from flexible zero-knowledge compliance tools or fully integrate their existing AML controls.</p> The current status of Panther <p>Oliver shared that Panther is currently deploying testnet versions of Panther Protocol in 9 Stages. Multiple protocol functionalities, such as intra-shielded pool transfers, DeFi swaps, and zTrade, are being tested during these stages. Through zTrade, users can conduct OTC transactions while enjoying unprecedented data privacy-preservation. More on Panther testnet stages <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a>.&nbsp;</p> BitMark asks: What are you looking forward to? <p>Oliver, as always, enthused about the growing interest in privacy-preserving infrastructures. He feels that, thanks to the recent paper by prominent authors such as Vitalik examining <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4563364&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Dark Pools</a>, this is a clear signal that the market is ready for such solutions. As he points out, Panther is a pioneer in the space — having been building for over 2 years, and is looking forward to releasing the V1 of the protocol once testnet rollouts are complete.</p> Want to get involved? <p>If you are interested in joining our community of testers, there is still time. Panther is rewarding engaged community members with $ZKP in return for battle-testing the testnet version of the product. Learn how to <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">get started</a> as a community tester.</p> About Panther Protocol <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther's zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

		<p><a href="https://www.horizen.io/wallets/spherebyhorizen/">Sphere by Horizen</a> is a desktop wallet created by the Horizen ecosystem team. It features both lite and full clients, offering wallet functionality that currently supports transparent and soon-to-be deprecated, shielded transactions. Sphere allows funds to be restored using a seed phrase and supports backward and forward transfers between Horizen’s mainchain and sidechains.</p>
<p>Traditionally, Sphere was able to send two different types of transactions: transparent transactions and shielded transactions:</p>
 
 Transparent Transactions: These are similar to Bitcoin transactions. The details of the transaction, including the sender’s and receiver’s addresses and the transaction amount, are visible on the blockchain. This transparency allows anyone to view and verify transactions, contributing to the network’s auditability. 
 Shielded Transactions: In contrast, shielded transactions offer enhanced privacy. They use advanced cryptographic techniques (like zk-SNARKs) to encrypt transaction information. This means the details of the transaction, including who sent or received the funds and the amount, are hidden from public view.&nbsp; 
 
 The Need for De-shielding 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42207-complete-removal-of-shielded-pool-from-the-horizen-mainchain/">Horizen has announced that ZEN will be discontinuing support for shielded transactions with the release of Zen v5.0.0.</a> Consequently, Sphere, Horizen’s multifunctional app, will also cease supporting these types of transactions. To ensure the accessibility of their funds, users will need to de-shield any ZEN in a shielded address by transferring it out from the shielded pool.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Who needs to De-shield their ZEN? 
<p>The upcoming changes to ZEN and Sphere necessitate action from all users who possess shielded addresses. If you have any ZEN in a shielded address, it’s crucial to de-shield these funds to avoid any loss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To determine if you need to take any action:</p>
 
 If You’re Using Lite Mode: If you’ve only used the lite mode in Sphere and never switched to full mode, you don’t need to do anything, as shielded addresses are only available in full mode. Your funds are secure and no action is required on your part. 
 If You’re Using Full Mode: In full mode, look through your wallets. If you don’t see any addresses with a small shield icon next to them, you’re all set. No action is needed. 
 
<p>For any address with a shield icon, you should move (de-shield) these funds to a transparent address (one without a shield icon). This is important to ensure your funds remain accessible and secure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another check is to look at the prefix of the address. Addresses start differently depending on the network and the type, so this also helps you identify your shielded addresses.</p>
<p>On mainnet:</p>
 
 “zn” for transparent address&nbsp; 
 “zc” for shielded address 
 “zs” (or rarely “zr” or “zt”) for multisig address 
 
<p>On testnet:</p>
 
 “zt” for transparent address&nbsp; 
 “zc” for shielded address 
 “zr” for multisig address 
 
 Step-by-step Guide to De-shielding Your ZEN 
 Prerequisites 
<p>As a reminder, de-shielding to an exchange deposit address is strongly discouraged. Before you begin de-shielding your shielded addresses in Sphere, it’s important to have at least one transparent address where you can transfer your funds. If you don’t already have a transparent address (any address without a shield icon next to its name, or that is not prefixed with “zc”), you’ll need to create one. Here’s how:</p>
 
 Open Sphere, login, and on the sidebar select one of your wallets. 
 Click on the “Add Address” button. 
 Give a name to the new address, and make sure that, if there’s any “Private” checkbox, it remains unchecked. 
 
<p></p>
<p>Once you have a transparent address, you can proceed with the de-shielding process for your shielded addresses.</p>
<p>You can get your new address by hovering over the information icon and clicking on the “copy” button that appears:</p>
<p></p>
 De-shielding Process 
<p>Here’s a step-by-step guide to de-shielding your funds in Sphere by Horizen:</p>
 
 Open Sphere, login, and on the sidebar take a look at your wallets.&nbsp; 
 Select the wallet containing a shielded address. If you have multiple wallets with shielded addresses, you’ll need to repeat this process for each one. 
 Within each wallet, follow these steps for every shielded address:
 
 Select the shielded address you want to transfer the funds out of. 
 Click on the “Send” tab. 
 Enter a regular, transparent address that you own, where you wish to receive the funds. 
 Click on the “MAX” button to transfer all the funds from the shielded address. 
 Click the “Confirm” button and wait for the transaction to complete. 
 
 
 
<p></p>
<p>Once the transaction is successful, you have de-shielded your funds. Repeat this process for every shielded address in your wallets.</p>

Additionally, we are announcing a formal request for comments period covering Aztec’s Sequencer Selection and Prover Coordination Protocols, key components of Aztec’s block production.</p><p>At the heart of Sidecar’s design is the decision to facilitate proving outside of the scope of the protocol, enabling integrations with various solutions, such as decentralized zero-knowledge proving marketplaces. Read the latest documentation on Aztec’s block production.</p><p>👉 <a href="https://forum.aztec.network/t/request-for-comments-aztec-sequencer-selection-and-prover-coordination-protocols/3038">https://forum.aztec.network/t/request-for-comments-aztec-sequencer-selection-and-prover-coordination-protocols/3038</a></p> Why Sidecar? <p>The Aztec Labs team, with input from various industry-leading experts, chose Sidecar over the various other proposals submitted (<a href="https://forum.aztec.network/t/proposal-cooperative-bft-proving-using-striped-redundant-binary-trees/2515">1</a>, <a href="https://forum.aztec.network/t/proposal-decentralized-prover-network-staking-reputations-and-proof-races/2489">2</a>, <a href="https://forum.aztec.network/t/proposal-when-the-levee-breaks/2457">3</a>, <a href="https://forum.aztec.network/t/proposal-cooperative-proving-network-for-fernet/2400">4</a>, <a href="https://forum.aztec.network/t/proposal-provers-bonded-prover-auction/2401">5</a>, <a href="https://forum.aztec.network/t/proposal-staking-proving-network-for-fernet/2439">6</a>) due to its simplicity and ease of integration — very similar to the reasons<a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/announcing-fernet-aztecs-decentralized-sequencer-selection-protocol-dd06194d572f"> the Fernet Sequencer Selection protocol was chosen during a previous RFP&nbsp;process</a>.</p><p>Further, the decision to not enshrine a particular prover coordination protocol enables Aztec Labs to continue iterating on proving networks or marketplaces outside of the scope of the Aztec network’s traditional upgrade mechanisms — similar in spirit to Vitalik’s notion of “<a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/09/30/enshrinement.html">minimum viable enshrinement</a>”.</p><p>Additionally, not enshrining a particular protocol in this way allows the network to be fully compatible with a broad spectrum of options to prove a given block, including:</p>  vertical Sequencer-Prover integration, or  third party zero-knowledge (zk) proving providers, or  fully decentralized zk proving marketplaces  <p>Through these various options, Aztec’s proving is fully permissionless and allows anyone to participate in a competitive marketplace for zero-knowledge proof production.</p><blockquote>“We are excited to collaborate with other projects that share our vision for decentralized zero-knowledge proving.

		  5.0.0-rc1 is a Testnet pre-release candidate in anticipation of the release of 5.0.0 to Mainnet later in January 2024.  Pre-release 5.0.0-rc1 will perform a network upgrade on Public Testnet via Hard Fork at block #1404200, on January 16th, 2024 at approximately 02:00 PM UTC.  <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0xbb8d72c088637c53cde7aa07c030b63dcdfa901ddffd5ce579b061d6064d5bb0">ZenIP-42207</a> to fully remove the shielded pool from Horizen will be implemented with this release on Testnet:  All transactions involving shielded addresses will no longer be accepted at the consensus level once the hard fork activates.  RPC calls z_sendmany and z_mergetoaddress have been partially disabled, so that it will be no longer possible to submit transactions involving shielded addresses (transparent-to-shielded, shielded-to-shielded and shielded-to-transparent) once the hard fork activates. Transparent-to-transparent transactions will still be accepted and submitted to the network.      Only nodes running on Public Testnet have to be updated.  IMPORTANT: 5.0.0 will be released in January and go live on Mainnet in February 2024. Once active it will no longer be possible to perform any transactions involving shielded addresses. It is highly recommended to move funds out of the shielded pools before then. Directly depositing funds from shielded addresses to exchange wallets is strongly discouraged.<br>  <p>See release notes <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zen/blob/release/5.0.0-rc1/doc/release-notes/release-notes-5.0.0-rc1.md">Here!</a></p><p>Please let us know if you have any questions or you need further support by reaching out to us on <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">our Discord.</a></p>

		<p>2023 was an incredible year of growth for the Horizen ecosystem! Lots of milestones were reached including:</p>  The mainnet launch of Horizen’s first EVM-compatible sidechain, EON&nbsp;  The launch of the Horizen DAO and pivot from Zen Blockchain Foundation (ZBF)&nbsp;  Passing two major ZenIPs (42204 &amp; 42206)  Onboarding new partners and projects into the Horizen ecosystem  <p>It’s an exciting time for the Horizen ecosystem and the team has hit the ground running in 2024! We will be sharing details on our 2024 proposed roadmap but before we get there, let’s dive into what happened in 2023!</p> 2023 Highlights <p></p> Community Growth <p>Discord</p><p>In 2023, we reached over 20,000 members of our Horizen Discord, a growth of over 5,000 users throughout the year. With the launch of Horizen EON and various growth campaigns on platforms like Galxe and Layer3, we have had new community members learning about the Horizen ecosystem and exploring the new integrations. We look forward to seeing more of this growth in 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>Discourse</p><p>In 2023 we established the <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Horizen DAO Discourse forum</a>, to facilitate active community discussions around the Horizen Ecosystem. In 2023, activity on this platform increased as the broader community discussed ZenIPs, shared tutorials, explored content created by the Horizen Ambassadors, and more!&nbsp;</p><p>We encourage the Horizen community to join Discourse and engage with the rest of the community on the platform!</p> 2023 Highlights – Our Technology <p>In October of 2023, Horizen EON, our EVM-compatible sidechain went live on mainnet, marking a new milestone in the Horizen multi-chain ecosystem!&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, the Horizen EON ecosystem has continued to grow, with additional partnerships, integrations, and tools launching on the platform. There has also been a significant influx of TVL and developer activity on Horizen EON.&nbsp;</p><p>The full range of dapps and partner integrations can be found on the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/ecosystem">EON Ecosystem</a> page – let’s dive into a few of the major announcements. </p><p></p><p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-eon-integrates-with-interport-finance/">Interport Finance Integration</a></p><p>At the beginning of December 2023, we announced an integration with Interport Finance, which brought cross-chain trading capabilities to Horizen EON! This integration not only boosts the efficiency and security of cross-chain transactions but also signifies a step towards a broader vision of a cohesive digital finance ecosystem, where decentralized applications (dApps) can operate fluidly across diverse blockchains.</p><p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/archon-bridge-is-live-on-horizen-eon/">Archon Bridge</a></p><p>Archon Bridge launched on Horizen EON in Q4 of 2023, bringing a new bridging protocol to the ecosystem. This protocol facilitates the transfer of various cryptocurrencies including ETH, WBTC, WZEN, USDT, USDC, DAI, and LINK, between the Horizen EON network and the Ethereum and Avalanche networks.</p><p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-eon-integrates-with-layerzero-to-boost-trustless-cross-chain-communications/">LayerZero</a></p><p>Another innovation to enhance cross-chain communications on Horizen EON saw an integration with LayerZero go live, ensuring seamless and direct communication between various blockchains via arbitrary message bridging. This integration offers enhanced interoperability, allowing data, assets, and information to be transferred across blockchains without compromising on efficiency or security. Beyond just messaging, this integration signifies a broader vision of creating a unified digital asset ecosystem, where decentralized applications (dApps) can operate seamlessly across multiple blockchains.</p><p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/spookyswap-is-live-on-horizen-eon/">SpookySwap</a></p><p>Another exciting announcement for Horizen EON came in November 2023, when we announced an integration with SpookySwap! This helped bolster DeFi innovation, bringing a DEX multichain integration and yield farming to EON. USDC is tradable against ZEN and wZEN, with additional pairs being enabled once sufficient liquidity develops.</p><p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-eon-integrates-ascent-exchange-with-simple-liquidity-opportunities-via-ichi-vault-to-boost-the-defi-ecosystem-on-eon/">Ascent Exchange</a></p><p>The DeFi ecosystem on Horizen EON was boosted with the integration of Ascent Exchange, supported by the automated liquidity management protocol, ICHI Vault, enabling simple yield opportunities for EON users. This integration allows for more seamless and secure trading experiences, facilitating asset and information transfer across the blockchain network. Ascent Exchange is the first decentralized exchange with ve(3,3) tokenomics on Horizen EON, marking a major milestone!</p><p><a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/service_providers/eon_native_stablecoin/">Stably/ZUSD</a></p><p>2023 marked the 1st native stablecoin to be launched on Horizen EON, ZUSD, which was made possible by our partnership with Stably! The collateral for ZUSD is held in liquid USD-denominated assets by a designated trustee for the benefit of verified ZUSD token holders. This ensures that each ZUSD token can be minted or redeemed at a 1-to-1 rate with USD or USDC by users who passed Stably’s KYC verification process.</p><p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/yuzu-finance-horizen-eon-unlocking-yield-opportunities-in-the-horizen-ecosystem/">Yuzu</a></p><p>Our last major partnership announcement of 2023 welcomed Yuzu Finance onto Horizen EON! This integration unlocked yield opportunities for the Horizen Ecosystem, including borrowing, lending, and yield farming (soon)! Yuzu is a non-custodial decentralized liquidity market protocol that enables users to deposit or borrow crypto assets securely. Depositors provide liquidity on Yuzu, while borrowers can take out overcollateralized or undercollateralized loans.</p> Horizen EON TVL &amp; Metrics <p>As of December 31st, 2023, Horizen EON had $3.08M in TVL (as tracked by <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Horizen%20EON">DefiLlama</a>), highlighting impressive ecosystem growth within the first few months of mainnet launch.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the mainnet launch of Horizen EON in October 2023, there have been over 900,000 total transactions across over 18,000 wallet addresses. There have also been 950+ contracts in total since Horizen EON went live on mainnet.</p> Launch of the Horizen DAO <p>In 2023 the Horizen ecosystem reached a key milestone in decentralized governance by launching the Horizen DAO! The launch of the Horizen DAO makes it easier for Horizen community members to get involved in governance and make their voices heard in the direction of the project.&nbsp;</p><p>The Horizen DAO further decentralizes decision-making for technical, non-technical, and other substantive improvements to the system. $ZEN holders are the ultimate decision-makers for the future of Horizen and exercise governance over the network’s evolution through participating in the Horizen DAO. All $ZEN holders can vote on improvement proposals, and those who hold (or who have been delegated) the requisite amount of $ZEN may put forth proposals to the community. To facilitate effective community governance, users will also be able to delegate voting power to individuals they view as effective stewards of the Horizen ecosystem guiding values.&nbsp;</p><p>Learn more about this in our <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/introducing-horizen-dao/">blog post</a>, as well as joining the <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Horizen DAO Discourse!</a></p> ZenIPs (<a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip-42204.md">42204</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip_42206.md">42206</a>) <p>Building off of the launch of the Horizen DAO, 2023 saw two very important ZEN Improvement Proposals (ZenIPs) pass with overwhelming community support.&nbsp;</p>  <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip-42204.md">ZenIP 42204</a> – Deprecation of Shielded Pools  <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip_42206.md">ZenIP 42206</a> – Redirect Horizen Secure Node Rewards into Horizen EON&nbsp;  <p>Let’s take a closer look at both.&nbsp;</p><p>ZenIP 42204</p><p>This ZEN Improvement Proposal proposed the removal of shielded transactions with transparent inputs from the Horizen mainchain, preventing shielded transaction (t addresses to z addresses) support at the consensus level. The goal of ZenIP 42204 was to ensure Horizen does privacy technology the right and sustainable way to drive ecosystem growth and minimize risk. Regulatory threats are top of mind, they are not friendly towards privacy coins and that drove a lot of the ambition to propose ZenIP 42204, which passed with overwhelming community support. Additional information can be found <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/what-is-zenip-42204-deprecation-of-shielded-pools/">here.</a></p><p>ZenIP 42206</p><p>In August of 2023, ZenIP 42206 was proposed, to redirect the portion of the Horizen mainchain block reward currently paid to Secure Nodes to an EON Forger Subsidy Fund. This will help drive the success of the Horizen EON network by increasing the security and decentralization of the network. There is a strong need for forger nodes in EON to help enhance the security of the network, and for decentralization, which the current secure node reward can be put to better use by redirecting. <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42206-explained-redirect-horizen-secure-node-rewards-into-horizen-eon/">Learn more here.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Horizen Node Network <p></p> Horizen Ambassador Program <p>Throughout 2023, we were very proud to see all of the work accomplished by our amazing Horizen Ambassadors.

We launched EON, our EVM-compatible sidechain, which significantly helped Horizen’s journey into the contemporary Web3 world. That’s especially important because it allows Horizen Labs to leverage its relationships and bring more companies, developers, and brands directly into the Horizen ecosystem. We’ve been hard at work bringing best-in-class partners to EON, from oracles like Pyth and Band to DeFi protocols like Spooky, Yuzu, and Ascent to RPC providers such as Ankr and Tatum. We’ve built a strong relationship with LayerZero as well, which will lead to many exciting things happening within the ecosystem.</p><p>Meanwhile, the mainchain saw the introduction of forward and backward transfers, a technological feat that sometimes gets overlooked but is significant. How many UTXO-based tokens can be used on EVM chains? Beyond Bitcoin and ZEN, not many! We also saw the start of the deprecation of shielded pools and ZEN’s move away from being a privacy token.</p><p>Now, as we enter 2024 we’re gearing up for what should be the most exciting year in Horizen’s history. In the coming weeks and months, we’ll announce a slew of new partners, initiatives, and focus areas relating to the Horizen Ecosystem through a significant expansion and push on DeFi to RWA programs. We’re also working hard on expanding access to ZEN and directly to the EON ecosystem, along with making sure that EON can host a sustainable, consistently growing ecosystem as it moves forward.</p><p>And the vision of a New Horizen is on the docket too. I can’t wait to talk to you all about it and the modular future that Horizen and Horizen Labs will push forward together.”</p> Additional Links:&nbsp;   <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/the-horizen-q1-2023-report/">Q1 2023 Report</a>  <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/the-horizen-q2-2023-report/">Q2 2023 Report</a>  <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/the-horizen-q3-2023-report/">Q3 2023 Report</a>

<p>Firstly, thank you to all our testers for your continued support and feedback: we could not do this without you. Testnet Stage 2 is now completed and it provided us with valuable insights resulting in several updates to the codebase.</p><p>We are excited to announce that Stage 3 of our testnet is live. Stage 3 enables users to use the newly allowlisted test Matic and test $ZKPs in Panther's Multi-Asset Shielded Pool.</p><p>On depositing $ZKP, users may divide their ZKP deposit holdings to store it as a zAsset ($zZKP) or as zAccount Gas (Gas $zZKP). The Gas $zZKP can be used to pay for Protocol fees, relayers, Oshiya, and any external services that enhance protocol services.</p><p>One of the key compliance requirements on the Panther roadmap is building different disclosure mechanisms. Stage 3 includes basic disclosures, which can be found under the History tab. We expect to improve the information within the History tab in future testnet stages.</p><p>This testnet stage comes with an enhanced circuit to improve KYT/KYC signer fields, overall protocol security through extended zAccount UTXO, and further improvements related to scaling and rewards. Supporting these updates required retrofitting previous stages and end-to-end testing, resulting in Stage 3 being released later than we initially planned. </p><p>For a complete list of Test Stages, visit the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet/testnet-stages?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther docs</a>.<br></p> Get started with Stage 3 testing <p><br>To start testing Stage 3, visit the<a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Panther Protocol documentation</a> for the updated test link and follow the steps outlined below. Here are a few additional details to consider before you start testing:&nbsp;</p>  Previously created testnet accounts will need to be reactivated for Stage 3. The protocol will treat these as new accounts. To that effect, all prior testing Rewards (ZKP and ZKP equivalent of your PRPs) will be sent to your EOA (externally owned account) used for creating the account.  You can also create a brand new account and complete the KYC process to continue. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GUvug0JhhlIUHBR4d2TZVKEUeGzvD_MIR-NrcIpptko/edit?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#gid=0">Here’s</a> a guide to creating your account.   After activating your zAccount, if you immediately go to the ‘Deposit’ or ‘Voucher’ etc. screen, you may see the action button with the status “Oshiya Processing/Syncing/Mining.” It may take a few minutes for the testnet to complete as it waits for Oshiya to process your account activation. The buttons will be active once that is done.  During the first interaction with the dApp, it downloads the ZK proof information in the background (close to 100MB). While this happens, you may see a status on your action button saying “ZK Proof downloading,” this needs to be completed before any user action can take place.   Onboarding rewards have been increased to 5000 PRPs to reflect that this stage retests the onboarding flow.  <p>Once you’ve created your new testnet account, follow these steps to make a deposit to your account:</p> Step 1: Initiate a deposit <p>Go to the Deposit screen by selecting any of the available options: </p>  Within the zAsset menu item, click on the Deposit button as shown in the screenshot below.  Within the My Public Asset section in the Dashboard, select the token; this takes the user to the Deposit screen.  The Private zAsset section; which also has the option to select and deposit  On zAsset Portfolio, click on the balance card.   Step 2: Select the token type <p>Select the token to deposit if it is not preselected, or adjust your selection via the token selection modal window.</p><p>NOTE: ZKP has its own dedicated deposit flow, which supports splitting a deposit amount between two zZKP subaccounts, zAsset and Gas. The Gas can be used to pay for relayer or verification services in a privacy-preserving way; with no direct interaction with a blockchain.</p> Step 3: Set up the deposit <p>3.1 Enter the amount to deposit.&nbsp;</p><p>3.2 Click the Deposit button and complete the transaction.</p><p>Congratulations, the deposit is complete!</p><p>You may now view the updated balance in your Dashboard, your Private zAssets section, and the adjusted balance of the deposited asset.</p><p>You can view your transaction history under the History tab.&nbsp;</p><p>This screen provides information about different types of transactions you performed within Panther, along with its transaction hash and the date/time of the transaction.&nbsp;</p><p>To share your feedback, kindly fill in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/e/1FAIpQLSczZNB-tvMILSo8paFjIkeeSub3cqxv7L85rCeR47ad5bs2Gw/viewform?usp=sf_link&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">form</a>.</p><p>This phase marks a significant advancement in the protocol's capabilities and gets us a step closer to our V1 release. As always, let us know if you have any additional feedback through our social and community channels.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for participating in Testnet Stage 3!&nbsp;</p>  About Panther Protocol <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases.

<p>What began as an AI company trying to seek solutions in order to pay remote (unbanked) workers, Near AI became, in 2018, Near Protocol. Its sharded design was inspired by modern database architecture and large language model (LLM) training. Near Protocol aimed to solve the scalability trilemma, through a modular approach, combining data availability sharding with stateless validation. By abstracting away archaic blockchain standards, Near basically enabled decentralised full stack development and, in terms of UX, a distributed custodial solution via chain abstraction and account aggregation.</p><p>We were joined by Illia Poloshukhin, co-founder of Near Protocol, to discuss Near’s journey, from AI company to high-throughput L1 blockchain, and how LLM training influenced the modular design choice.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Illia’s background in AI &amp; ML  Scaling large language models (LLMs) and the role of attention  Stochastic Parrot vs. Understanding spectrum  From Near AI to Near Protocol and the role of LLMs  How Near abstracted the blockchain away and enabled decentralised full stack development  Defining ecosystem standards to improve UX  Chain abstraction, account aggregation and interoperability  Chain threshold signature  Near’s intent layer  Near’s modularity, Nightshade sharding &amp; stateless validation  EigenLayer integration  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ilblackdragon">Illia Polosukhin on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/NEARProtocol">Near Protocol on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

		<p><a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/zenip_42207-draft/zenip-42207.md">ZenIP 42207 </a>for the complete removal of the shielded pool from the Horizen mainchain was submitted on January 4th, 2024, opened for Community voting on January 8th, with voting closing on January 11th, resulting in 99.97% vote share “for”. Here’s what it means.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This ZenIP proposed the complete removal of the shielded pool from the Horizen mainchain, achieving a wide range of various goals. This change builds upon the deprecation of access to the shielded pool enacted by <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/commit/4b34d67914d3cf76eb773a9d43949fae23f32f60">ZenIP-42204</a> and is a response to the evolving regulatory environment around privacy tokens, re-confirming and showcasing the project’s strategic pivot away from privacy-focused features.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Complete Disabling of Shielded Transactions: All functionalities related to the shielded transactions (z-addresses) will be completely deactivated, preventing any type of transaction related to the shielded pool. 
 Removal of Related RPC Calls: RPC calls specifically related to shielded transactions, such as z_sendmany and z_mergetoaddress, will be deprecated. 
 Migration Path for Users: A migration path with the necessary tools and guides will be provided to users to move their assets out of the shielded pool before the hard fork. Community support and detailed documentation will be available to facilitate this transition. 
 Network Upgrade: The deactivation of the shielded pool will occur through a network upgrade at a specified block height (TBD). Extensive testing, community preparation, and communication will precede this upgrade. 
 Communication and Timeline:&nbsp;Representatives of the Horizen ecosystem will communicate regularly with the community about the timeline, necessary user actions, and available support resources throughout the transition process. 
 
<p>IMPORTANT: ZEN 5.0.0 is expected to be released in January and go live on Mainnet in February 2024. Once active it will not be possible to send any shielded transactions, including transactions to de-shield coins from shielded to transparent addresses.</p>
<p>ZenIP 42207 goes further than the hard fork originally announced with ZEN 4.2.0-rc1, ZEN 5.0.0 will completely remove the shielded pool. We strongly recommend that all users with existing funds in private addresses unshield their funds to their own transparent addresses using Sphere by Horizen or zen-cli before February 2024. After February 2024 it will not be possible anymore to transfer any funds inside of the shielded pool to any other address. &nbsp;Unshielding funds directly to exchange deposit addresses is strongly discouraged. Failure to remove ZEN from shielded pools prior to the hard fork will result in the loss of your ZEN.</p>
 Voting Timeline 
<p>ZenIPs are for the community to approve or decline. Horizen has always believed our community comes first, we encourage you to join the discussions on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/z8eebsj7Sv">Discord</a>, <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Discourse</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/horizenglobal">Twitter</a> around ZenIP 42207 and voice your thoughts. We highly encourage you to read the <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/zenip_42207-draft/zenip-42207.md">full ZenIP on GitHub</a> to get a complete understanding of what this means.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voting on ZenIP 42207 started on January 8th, 2024, 5pm UTC and ended on January 11th, 2024, 5pm UTC. The Horizen DAO voting is done on Horizen EON, using Snapshot and Discourse for governance. At the same time that the voting began, the snapshot was also taken. <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0xbb8d72c088637c53cde7aa07c030b63dcdfa901ddffd5ce579b061d6064d5bb0">You can view the results of the vote here on Snapshot.&nbsp;</a></p>
 Who is Eligible to Vote?&nbsp; 
<p>Any $ZEN holder can vote on improvement proposals, and those who hold (or who have been delegated) the requisite amount of $ZEN may put forth proposals to the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voting power is determined by the amount of $ZEN you hold on the Horizen mainchain and on the Horizen EON chain. Therefore the more $ZEN you hold, the more voting power you have.&nbsp;</p>
 How to Vote – Instructions 
 
 Go to the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Horizen DAO Governance page</a> on the Horizen EON web app to get started. 
 Connect your web3 wallet (ex. MetaMask). <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/connect/connect_your_wallet/">Please follow this guide if you need help</a>. 
 Link your Horizen mainchain $ZEN address to Horizen EON. In order to vote with your mainchain $ZEN, you need to have $ZEN on a <a href="https://horizen.io/spherebyhorizen">Sphere</a> mainchain address and link that address to your MetaMask Horizen EON chain address. You only need to link your <a href="https://horizen.io/spherebyhorizen">Sphere wallet</a> once. You can use the same wallet for future voting rounds.&nbsp;
 
 Please see <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address/">this guide for step-by-step instructions </a>on linking Horizen Mainchain and Horizen EON $ZEN Addresses to aggregate your voting power.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Make sure you have sufficient ZEN in your MetaMask address for the gas fee. Follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFsjT069v7E">this tutorial</a> to learn how to transfer ZEN from Horizen mainchain to your Horizen EON address on MetaMask 
 Once your mainchain ZEN address is connected to Horizen EON, and you have sufficient ZEN in your MetaMask for gas fee, it’s time to vote using Snapshot! 
 Join the <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Horizen Foundation space</a> on Snapshot if you haven’t done so, to receive notifications about future ZenIP voting.&nbsp; 
 
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/PjDFYEh6SDw?si=VgQKGkl_PHj8Q0qW">We have a helpful video tutorial here with instructions on how to vote for the Horizen DAO.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We would like to thank the community for their engagement on this new ZenIP. The voting participation marks a new step in the progress of the Horizen DAO and we are glad to see that our community is involved in the project’s decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The successfully passed ZenIP 42207 enables the complete removal of the shielded pool from the Horizen mainchain, achieving a wide range of various goals. This change builds upon the deprecation of access to the shielded pool enacted by ZenIP 42204 and is a response to the evolving regulatory environment around privacy tokens, re-confirming and showcasing the project’s strategic pivot away from privacy-focused features.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next step is to unshield your ZEN on private addresses. We strongly recommend that all users with existing funds in private addresses unshield their funds to their own transparent addresses using Sphere by Horizen or zen-cli before February 2024. After February 2024 it will not be possible anymore to transfer any funds inside of the shielded pool to any other address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unshielding funds directly to exchange deposit addresses is strongly discouraged.</p>
<p>Failure to remove ZEN from shielded pools prior to the hard fork will result in the loss of your ZEN.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Through techniques like ZK rollups, multiple transactions are bundled into a single proof, streamlining the verification process. This compact form of verification reduces computational requirements and enhances the network’s overall scalability. By processing larger volumes of transactions more efficiently, zero-knowledge proofs boost blockchain network throughput without compromising security or decentralisation. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are cryptographic tools that work like magic tricks, allowing one party to prove they know something without revealing the actual details. They maintain confidentiality while confirming specific information and have a key role in web3. This article will explain what they are, how they work, their use cases in web3, and take a deep dive into how zero-knowledge proofs improve blockchain scalability.</p>



<p></p>



 What are zero-knowledge proofs? 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs, often referred to as ZKPs, are a clever way to prove something without revealing any details about it. Imagine being able to show you know a secret password without actually saying what the password is. That’s the magic of ZKPs – they allow one party to confirm they have certain information without giving away the information itself.</p>



<p>In every zero-knowledge proof, there’s a prover and a verifier. The prover wants to show the verifier that they know something without disclosing what it is. They do this by demonstrating knowledge of some facts that only the rightful owner of the information would know. It’s like solving a puzzle without showing the solution.</p>



<p>They can be used for a variety of purposes. Still, their main applications include improving data security, scalability, and privacy in blockchain transactions, safeguarding sensitive information in industries like healthcare and finance, and enabling secure authentication without unnecessary exposure of personal details.</p>



<p></p>



 How zero-knowledge proofs work (in simple terms) 



<p>While relatively simple at the surface, understanding the intricacies of zero-knowledge proofs can be complex. To explain how they work we will use a simple analogy:</p>



<p>A scientist claims to have discovered a complex mathematical proof for a groundbreaking theory. Verifying this proof conventionally requires extensive computational resources and time. Alternatively, using a zero-knowledge proof, the scientist can demonstrate the proof’s validity without divulging the entire process, significantly reducing the time needed for verification while ensuring the credibility of the discovery.</p>



<p>In essence, the zero-knowledge proof is a distilled version of the proof containing only the details necessary to prove its validity. When using zero-knowledge proofs in blockchain for improved scalability and privacy it works in similar ways. To explain how this works, consider the following scenario:<br><br>A validator has verified and put together a block of transactions that produces a certain hash value. To verify this hash (and thus the transactions inside the block), someone could verify this hash by following the exact same energy- and time-consuming process of recreating this block. However, another option would be for the validator to provide a succinct zero-knowledge proof to make it easy to verify the validity of this block without revealing the details. This proof is called a Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument, widely known as a ZK-SNARK.</p>



<p>Similar to the mathematical proof example, the validity of a statement can be verified quickly without revealing the underlying details of the statement.</p>



<p></p>



 Use cases of zero-knowledge proofs in Web3 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs have a variety of use cases within the web3 space, with some of the main ones being:</p>



 
 Enhancing privacy 



 Improving scalability 



 Enabling regulatory compliance 



 Secure authentication&nbsp; 
 



<p>Let’s look at each of these in more detail and how methods using zero-knowledge proofs differ from traditional methods.</p>



<p></p>



 Using zero-knowledge proofs for enhanced privacy 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs can enhance privacy within web3 by concealing transaction details, such as sender addresses, transaction amounts, and contract terms. Unlike traditional blockchain transactions that are transparent and visible to all, zero-knowledge proofs enable confidential transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This heightened level of confidentiality ensures that sensitive data remains protected within decentralised systems. Moreover, zero-knowledge proofs facilitate private interactions, allowing users to engage in transactions and collaborations while maintaining their privacy. This advantage is particularly beneficial in business environments where discretion and confidentiality are paramount.</p>



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs surpass traditional methods by offering a higher level of confidentiality. By concealing transaction details and protecting sensitive data within decentralised systems, zero-knowledge proofs address concerns related to data breaches and unauthorised access. Additionally, their ability to enable private interactions ensures that users can engage securely in web3 environments without compromising their privacy. Another thing that sets them apart from existing privacy solutions is their ability to offer increased privacy with similar levels of security as their non-private counterparts.</p>



<p></p>



 Using zero-knowledge proofs for greater scalability 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs are increasingly used in layer 2 scaling solutions as well as modern blockchain protocols for their ability to improve blockchain scalability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They achieve this by optimising data processing and reducing blockchain congestion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Compared to traditional methods, zero-knowledge proofs offer an optimised approach to data processing, reducing computational overhead and enhancing efficiency. This streamlined verification process improves scalability by enabling the processing of larger transaction volumes without congesting the blockchain network.</p>



<p></p>



 Using zero-knowledge proofs for better regulatory compliance 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs can be useful in ensuring compliance with data regulations. They provide a more secure way to handle user data while keeping it private. By hiding sensitive bits, zero-knowledge proofs balance showing what’s needed and keeping things secret. This helps decentralised systems follow the rules without giving away personal details. They check data without revealing everything, keeping user info safe from breaches and hacks which happen regularly.</p>



<p>In a nutshell, zero-knowledge proofs are a clever way to aid in sticking to complex privacy rules while still being open. They make sure user data stays safe in decentralised systems, meeting rules and keeping trust and privacy intact in the web3 world.</p>



<p></p>



 Using zero-knowledge proofs for secure authentication 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs offer a secure method for verifying identities or approving actions without revealing unnecessary personal information. They function by allowing individuals to prove specific credentials without disclosing the exact details.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In scenarios where secure interactions are vital, like proving age without revealing the birthdate or approving a transaction without disclosing account specifics, zero-knowledge proofs enable individuals to authenticate themselves or authorise actions while keeping sensitive information private. Amid B2B collaborations, where confidentiality is paramount, zero-knowledge proofs ensure secure interactions by permitting verifications without unnecessary exposure of private details, establishing trust without compromising confidentiality.</p>



<p>Overall, they serve as a discreet way for parties to validate identities or approve transactions securely. They enable necessary verifications while protecting sensitive information, and ensuring trusted and confidential interactions, particularly vital in B2B environments where secure collaborations rely on maintaining confidentiality.</p>



<p></p>



 Deep dive: Blockchain scalability with ZK Rollups 



<p>Let’s take a deeper dive into one of the most prominent applications of zero-knowledge proofs in web3. Scalability is a challenge as old as blockchain, and with an ever-increasing adoption of blockchain technology, there is also a constant need for increased scalability. ZK Rollups emerged as a potential solution for this challenge.</p>



<p></p>



 How ZK Rollups work 



<p>ZK Rollups function by grouping multiple user transactions off-chain and then submitting these bundled transactions as a single transaction to the main blockchain. Alongside this batched transaction, a succinct proof, derived from zero-knowledge proofs, is added to validate the correctness of these bundled transactions. To be specific, a ZK rollup follows these steps:</p>



 
 Transaction bundling: Initially, numerous individual user transactions occur off-chain, which are grouped or bundled together into a single package. 
 



 
 On-chain submission: This bundled package is then submitted as a single transaction to the main blockchain. Rather than posting each transaction separately on the main chain, ZK Rollups compress these transactions into a single entry. 
 



 
 Accompanying zero-knowledge proof: Alongside this single transaction, a concise proof is included. This proof is derived using zero-knowledge techniques, ensuring that it confirms the validity of all the transactions within the bundle without disclosing the specific details of each individual transaction. 
 



 
 Verification process: On the main chain, validators or smart contracts verify this bundled transaction using the accompanying proof. The proof allows for a swift verification process without unravelling the details of each transaction within the bundle. 
 



 
 Final confirmation: Once verified, the bundled transactions are confirmed on the main chain. The main chain acknowledges the validity of these transactions, thereby updating the blockchain’s state. 
 



<p>This method significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed and stored on the main blockchain. At the same time, it maintains the ability to verify the accuracy and integrity of these transactions. It optimises blockchain scalability by condensing multiple transactions into a single entry and facilitating a more efficient verification process using the accompanying zero-knowledge proof.</p>







<p>To make this even more clear, the above image visualises these steps.</p>



<p></p>



 The benefits of ZK Rollups 



<p>The efficiency of ZK Rollups lies in their ability to maintain security guarantees of the underlying blockchain while vastly improving its scalability. Users benefit from reduced transaction fees and faster transaction finality, making ZK Rollups a promising avenue for scaling Ethereum and other blockchain networks. This technique optimises the blockchain’s capacity to handle a higher volume of transactions, paving the way for broader adoption and enhanced usability of dApps.</p>



<p>As the development and adoption of ZK Rollups continue to evolve, ongoing research and advancements aim to further enhance their efficiency and usability. The synergy between ZK Rollups and zero-knowledge proofs showcases a promising path towards resolving scalability issues faced by blockchain networks. It offers a scalable solution without compromising the foundational principles of security and decentralisation.</p>



<p>In summary, ZK Rollups represent a significant leap forward in addressing the scalability concerns of blockchain networks. By leveraging the power of zero-knowledge proofs, they pave the way for a more scalable, efficient, and user-friendly blockchain ecosystem, laying the groundwork for a future where decentralised applications can operate at scale without compromising on security.</p>



<p></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs are complex mathematical proofs that effectively allow parties to prove information without divulging the details. They can be used in web3 to improve scalability, increase privacy, boost compliance, and allow for better authentication. They are the cornerstone to the future of web3 and will be central in existing and future web3 use cases.</p>

Manwendra brings diversified experience across industries, including as the first marketer for blockchain analytics firm, <a href="https://www.merklescience.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Merkle Science</a>. Before moving to Web3, Manwendra was a marketer at leading cybersecurity firm, <a href="https://www.radware.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Radware</a>(NASDAQ: RDWR).&nbsp;</p><p>Panther plans to further expand its marketing team with two more hires in the coming weeks.</p> R&amp;D Updates  Product Updates <p>In 2023, we made significant product development progress. We started the year with a workshop in Dubai (UAE) to evaluate our progress, examine the market fit of our product, compliance requirements, and institutional perspectives.</p><p>The workshop's goal was to strategically position Panther and our suite of products to align with the anticipated growth and adoption of the DeFi. After the conclusion of the workshop, we recognized that privacy as a feature couldn’t be a differentiator if we can’t enable practical applications of it. And, to achieve this for a DeFi protocol, compliance support is essential. We noted that privacy and compliance should coexist, but it requires more effort and innovation, particularly in leveraging zero-knowledge technology. Additionally, we aimed to enhance the efficiency of our protocol without overwhelming the user experience with an excess of Zero-Knowledge proofs.</p><p>As a result, we revamped our Product Architecture to align with industry needs, incorporating several outcomes from the workshop:&nbsp;</p>  Integrate with third-party compliance providers that can satisfy the new Panther design requirements.  Create a bank account-like on-chain identity ( zAccount) which acts as a link for all transactions users perform. zAccount is further crucial for compliance as it is activated only after a successful KYC completion.&nbsp;  Data Safe mechanism to satisfy AML requirements.&nbsp;  Introduce Zones to allow institutions to become licensed Zone Managers and run a dedicated zone to enable their customers to trade with whitelisted assets and counterparties.&nbsp;  Oshiya (referred to as Panther Miner) for off-chain zero-knowledge proof computation and to reduce the update on every transaction by batching 64 transactions into one. A concept that lets users put their transactions on a “bus queue”.  DeFi adaptors logic to align with the new architecture.  Support interchain communication, scheduled for V2.  <p>After 4-6 months of development, including smart contract development, circuit development, and integrations with PureFi, we began deploying features on the Mumbai test network. This process involved continuous and iterative development of the dApp. We further devised an incentivized testnet plan, organizing the testnet releases into 8 stages.</p><p>Initially, we estimated three weeks of dApp development. However, we encountered internal bugs and external issues during the testing phase, doubling the anticipated duration.</p> Testnet Updates <p>The testnet currently has 400 users and we’ve distributed a total of over 200,000 $ZKP as rewards. The proposed total amount of Testnet rewards is 1.5M $ZKP, with an additional 0.5M $ZKP in reserve to cover any additional rewards, if necessary.</p><p>Have you signed up for our testnet yet?<a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTB8MP6VMtJ2VMERcwLokZ3LLSHZdKn3j32QqLN1FMFRN/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Sign up here</a> to join our community and receive your $ZKP rewards.Here’s a quick recap of our testnet stages.</p><p>Testnet Stage 0</p><p>In July this year, we launched Panther Stage 0. In this Stage, we released the Panther Miner, a specialized miner designed to interact with a blockchain network. This testing stage (and activity in production) is directed towards miners, a key role in the Panther ecosystem, as opposed to DeFi users. Complete announcement <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage0-live/">here</a></p><p>Testnet Stage 1</p><p>After a successful Stage 0, in August this year, we released Stage 1 of Panther’s Testnet. In this Stage, testnet users were allowed to test two of Panther’s most anticipated innovations: third-party compliance integrations and zero-knowledge accounts. Learn more <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage-1-compliance-integrations-is-now-live-heres-how-to-test/">here</a></p><p>Testnet Stage 2</p><p>In November, we released the second stage of our testnet. This second phase was designed to test the user interaction and reward mechanisms that set the foundation for the protocol’s privacy-preserving features. More information on Stage 2 <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testnet-stage-2-is-now-live-and-its-all-about-rewards/">here</a></p><p>Testnet Stage 3</p><p>Stage 3 development is complete, and internal testing has begun. This third phase will allow users to whitelist test Matic in addition to test ZKPs into Panther's Multi-Asset Shielded Pool.</p><p>Further, when it comes to $ZKP, users can now deposit and store $ZKP either as a zAsset ($zZKP) or as a zAccount Gas (Gas $zZKP). At the time of deposit, testnet users will have the flexibility to divide their ZKP deposit amount between the two. The Gas $zZKP can be used to pay protocol fees, relayers, Oshiya, and any external services that enhance protocol services beyond the core.</p><p>Stage 3 is undergoing internal testing at the time of publishing this year-end update and will be released immediately after the tests are completed.</p> V1 Launch Updates <p>We've been working to streamline our development process, make integration testing more efficient, and possibly work on two testnet stages parallelly to ensure we meet the deadline for the V1 release.</p><p>Audits</p><p>The suggested plan is to undergo two sets of audits before the mainnet launch. A pre-audit will be done in January and then a final audit will be done once all stages are released, tested and bugs are resolved. </p><p>V1 Launch and expansion to multiple chains</p><p>V1 is expected to be live after the second Audit. After the successful launch of V1, the plan is to extend V1 to different EVM chains, subject to community voting and approval.&nbsp;</p> Research Initiatives <p>In 2023, we published two research papers in the International Association for Cryptologic Research: (1) A flexible Snark via the monomial basis, and (2) An optimization of the addition gate count in Plonkish circuits.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1255?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">first paper</a> presents a new pairing-based Snark. The principle advantage of which is, in contrast to other Snarks such as Groth16 and Plonk, it allows freedom in the choice of an elliptic curve with the consequential benefit of supporting non-native field arithmetic (a considerable bottle-neck for other Snarks). This research was also presented at the ETH Privacy Conference in Istanbul.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1264?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">second paper</a> proposes a generalization of Plonk’s permutation argument to obtain a protocol on weighted sums which has the benefit of eliminating intermediate gates from high fan-in additions in circuits with Plonkish arithmetization.</p><p>Other research work includes a survey paper (to be completed soon) that focuses on different approaches to Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) clients via snarks.&nbsp;</p>  About Panther Protocol <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that strive to meet regulatory standards and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther’s zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p>

Among many applicants, Sebastien and Brian were the only 2 Europeans, so Adam suggested that they teamed up in order to record the pilot episode. On December 20th 2013, Sebastien and Brian released ‘Regulation and the Future of Bitcoin’, which marked the beginning of a 10-year (and counting) long journey.

		  4.2.0-rc1 is a Testnet pre-release candidate in anticipation of the release of ZEN 4.2.0 to Mainnet later next January 2024.  Pre-release 4.2.0-rc1 will perform a network upgrade on Public Testnet via Hard Fork at block #1396500, on January 3rd, 2024 at approximately 12:00 PM UTC.  Only nodes running on Public Testnet have to be updated.  IMPORTANT: 4.2.0 is expected to be released in January and go live on Mainnet in February 2024. Once active it will not be possible anymore to unshield funds from private addresses to normal transparent addresses using Sphere by Horizen. Unshielding will still be possible to P2SH (multisignature) addresses, but the process to do so will be more involved.  Because of this, we recommend that all users with existing funds in private addresses unshield their funds to their own transparent addresses in Sphere by Horizen before February 2024. Unshielding funds directly to exchange deposit addresses is strongly discouraged.    <p>Main Features (from 4.1.1 to 4.2.0-rc1):&nbsp;</p>Shielded Pool Deprecation:<br>Unshielding RestrictionsPR <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zen/pull/624">#624</a> is a follow-up in the gradual path of shielded pool deprecation, it introduces a hard fork requiring the unshielding of private funds to target only script addresses. After the hard fork, unshielding to P2PKH addresses or to P2PK addresses will not be allowed. For this reason, the following RPC commands have been (partially) deprecated: z_sendmany and z_mergetoaddress (check inline documentation for additional details).<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Please let us know if you have any questions or if you need further support by reaching out to us on <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">our Discord.</a></p>

 Quality of life and bug fixes for Aztec’s local developer testnet <p>A few months ago, we released the Aztec <a href="https://aztec.network/sandbox/">Sandbox</a> at zkHack&nbsp;London.</p><p>The Sandbox is a local developer testnet intended to be a first look into how Aztec will ultimately work: as a privacy-first Layer 2 on Ethereum. It allows developers to write Aztec-native smart contracts with public and private logic, testable in Aztec’s Private Execution Environment (PXE).</p><p>In conjunction with our <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/announcing-aztec-sandbox-the-endgame-for-smart-contract-privacy/">announcement</a>, we quietly recruited multiple teams of developers to work closely with us to identify bugs in the Sandbox, expand its feature set, and begin experimenting with novel privacy primitives.</p><p>As a result of close collaboration with these pioneers, we are proud to announce a series of bug fixes, quality of life improvements, and other enhancements to the&nbsp;Sandbox.</p> Our Ambition <p>Our Sandbox announcement blog post called it “the most ambitious software release in Aztec Labs’ history.” And with great ambition comes great quality of life improvements.</p><p>So we’re thrilled to share some of the obstacles our developers have run into and the work we’ve done to improve Aztec’s DevEx in order to highlight the novel application design space enabled by our software.</p><p>Now that the Sandbox is more stabilized and feature complete, we will be welcoming folks into future rounds of feedback.</p><p>Subscribe to our newsletter to stay in the loop and get the latest with <a href="https://aztec.network/aztec-nr/">Noir</a>, Sandbox, and Aztec&nbsp;Labs:</p><blockquote><a href="https://embeds.beehiiv.com/83354329-29bf-48be-ba17-a99d72424ace">📰 Subscribe to the Aztec Developer Dispatch</a></blockquote> Developer Experience Improvements <p>Early on, developers had to update a bunch of different pieces of software every time we pushed a new update. Docker, NPM packages, dependencies in nargo.toml, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>With the volume of updates we were (and still are) shipping — weekly on Tuesday — this quickly became very annoying. In fact, one of the major complaints about the Sandbox-and the reason this wasn’t an open-invite testnet-was the speed of iteration and the number of continuous changes.</p><p>So we designed a new update flow ( <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues/2488">aztec-cli update</a>) that updates all components in one go via a <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues/2875">Docker-only install</a> experience, instead of manually juggling 4 different components.</p><p>We also bundled nargo (the Noir package manager) as WASM in the Docker image in the new update flow. This removes the extra step of installing nargo for writing contracts, so developers can get right into <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/dev_docs/contracts/main">writing Aztec.nr contracts</a>.</p><p>We’ve also implemented a slow updates tree to make it easier to read historical public storage in private functions.</p><p>Many external developers kept running into this constraint — if a private function is reading from public data, it is conceivable that by the time the private function executes, the public data has changed. This is one nuance of working with a network that has both private and public state, but we wanted to make it easier for developers to handle&nbsp;this.</p><p>So as mentioned above, we’ve implemented a <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/65bd8556875a8680bb44fc7ec9321c5df8d8ad38/yarn-project/aztec-nr/slow-updates-tree">slow updates tree</a> — this is a contract containing public data that won’t change within a predefined time interval (for example, ‘over the next epoch’ or ‘over the next 500 blocks’). As long as the transaction in question is executed before that time interval, the public data will stay constant as it’s read from the slow updates&nbsp;tree.</p><p>At any time during the epoch, devs can tell the tree to update their particular public values to a new value. This data is stored in a pending tree. Once the epoch is over, the slow updates tree gets updated to use the pending values. This should be a useful data structure for developers who want to explore the new design space opened up by public ←→ private interactions.</p> What’s in a&nbsp;name? <p>Finally, better names. We know that Aztec Labs has not historically been great at naming, so we’re trying to be better at&nbsp;it.</p><p>First, we’ve removed the term ‘commitment’ in favor of ‘note hashes’. This is just more intuitive, since the ‘commitment’ actually comes from the hashing of the note (in other words, by hashing a note, you commit to the contents of that note, since changing any of the contents will change the hash!). <br>We’ve also named the private execution environment of the network as PXE (or ‘pixie’), instead of the other candidate name that we almost went with&nbsp;(PEE…).</p> Tutorials and&nbsp;Examples <p>The challenges of working with a completely new execution environment are not lost on us, so we’ve also been creating additional references for developers exploring a new ecosystem like Aztec’s. Here are some of the improvements we’ve made for tutorials and accompanying examples:</p>  More examples of custom notes — our network abstracts away a lot of the complexities associated with UTXOs, note commitments, and nullifiers. But custom notes are still hard to grasp without examples.  So we created a few more examples!  <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/65bd8556875a8680bb44fc7ec9321c5df8d8ad38/yarn-project/aztec-nr/address-note">AddressNote</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/65bd8556875a8680bb44fc7ec9321c5df8d8ad38/yarn-project/aztec-nr/field-note">FieldNote</a> are two examples of custom notes that should help developers grasp the note structures.  Aztec boxes — our version of Truffle Boxes. Essentially, a package with a dedicated user interface showing developers how to use Aztec.js and how to write Aztec contracts. These <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/dev_docs/cli/blank_box">Aztec boxes</a> act as a reference for developers to install and see how the different components interact to help create full stack&nbsp;apps.  Portal tutorial, using Uniswap — Aztec portals are one of the most unique features of the Aztec L2. Portals allow for direct interactions with Ethereum, privately. In other words, no one can know where the transaction is coming from, besides the fact that it is coming from somewhere on&nbsp;Aztec.  <p>(Long time followers may recognize this type of functionality as <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/sunsetting-aztec-connect-2/">Aztec Connect</a>, a previous iteration of our network. The <a href="https://aztec.network/">Aztec network</a> gets Aztec Connect functionality, out of the&nbsp;box!)</p><p>Tactically, portals are smart contracts written in Solidity that are related to the Ethereum smart contract that is being interacted with. <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/dev_docs/tutorials/uniswap/main">This Uniswap tutorial</a> helps developers understand how to use these portals to interact with L1 applications from the Aztec&nbsp;L2.</p> Smashing Bugs <p>Finally, bug fixes. There are always going to be a lot of bugs in new software, and the Sandbox is no exception.</p><p>Here are a few of the bugs that we’ve fixed recently:</p>  If the <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues/3012">length of a note</a> was incorrect in the compute_note_hash_and_nullifier method, developers would just get a ‘no method found’&nbsp;error  We weren’t properly <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues/3193">deserializing arrays of&nbsp;structs</a>  Multiple things broke in the Sandbox — here is one&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues/2953">Example</a>  The sequencer would go into <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues/2502">an infinite loop</a> when duplicate nullifiers were submitted  Here are <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug">all of the bugs</a> we’ve fixed in the past 2&nbsp;months  <p>Hopefully, it’s clear that we’ve been busy making the Aztec ecosystem a more enjoyable place for developers to explore the design space opened up by programmable privacy. These improvements should meaningfully improve the quality of the developer experience for interacting with the Aztec Sandbox, and in due time, the Aztec&nbsp;network.</p><p>We are committed to improving the intuitiveness of our execution environment and continuously upgrading our documentation (look at <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+docs">this activity</a>!). All of this work is a result of listening to the challenges that the Aztec developer community is facing, fixing problems transparently, and working diligently to create a credibly neutral network with programmable privacy.</p> To our&nbsp;partners <p>We couldn’t do it without you. You chose to chew glass and soldier through weekly updates, breaking changes, bugs, all to make privacy more intuitive for others.

However, the use of language models in AI raises concerns about trustworthiness in its training and the output it generates. This leads us to the question: How can we leverage existing technologies to bridge this lack of trust?</p>



<p>This article explores the challenges surrounding trust in AI system inputs and outputs, how blockchain could be the solution to establish trust, and various integration challenges that need to be accounted for.</p>



<p></p>



 Trust challenges of AI systems 



<p>Since the launch of ChatGPT in November of 2022, organisations have made enormous strides to implement AI within their technological systems. Enthusiasm for this new technology promising productivity enhancement, has also generated discussions on whether we can trust these systems. Who has been training these AI models? How can we be sure that the information output it generates is reliable and unbiased? </p>



<p></p>



 Transparency of AI language models  



<p>AI systems require a large language model (LLM) to learn and have a basis to create outputs from. However, due to the lack of transparency surrounding what goes into the LLMs, doubts arise on data input authenticity and reliability.</p>



<p>Authenticity: If the origin, quality, and representativeness of the input data are not transparent, it raises concerns about the authenticity and reliability of the model’s understanding.</p>



<p>Reliability: Lack of clarity regarding the source of training data leads to scepticism about the model’s ability to accurately reflect real-world scenarios and diverse perspectives. This creates uncertainty on whether the model’s output can be trusted and used accordingly.</p>



<p>Explainability: There is a lack of self-explanation in AI systems on how a specific outcome is generated when prompted. This poses a significant hurdle to understanding and trusting AI’s outputs. What data did the system pool together to carry out its decision-making process when prompted?</p>



<p></p>



 Ethical standards in AI training 



<p>AI systems often make decisions based on complex algorithms and data that include principles governing the training of AI models. Thus creating the need for a standardised set of ethical guidelines governing the training of AI models.</p>



<p>One primary concern is the ethical framework guiding the selection of data used in training these systems. The opaqueness surrounding the training data raises ethical concerns, particularly related to bias. If the data used to train AI models contain biases, the model may unintentionally perpetuate those biases in its outputs. Without transparency, it becomes challenging to identify and address biases in the training data. Therefore making it difficult to avoid potential negative consequences.</p>



<p></p>



 Authenticating human vs. AI output 



<p>Another significant challenge revolves around the ability to distinguish between outputs generated by AI systems and those by human intelligence. Can we reliably identify whether the output presented is a result of human thought or an algorithmic process? </p>



<p>Authentication is particularly crucial in scenarios where information transparency is essential, such as journalism, content creation, or academia. This distinction between human and AI-generated content also carries ethical implications. It prompts discussions on attribution, accountability, and the potential influence these systems might have in shaping public opinion. As AI becomes more integrated into society, different mechanisms are needed to transparently demonstrate the origin of information.</p>



<p></p>



 Output challenges 



<p>When speaking of trust within AI, we must also evaluate the ownership and intellectual property rights of AI-generated output. The challenge lies in determining whether outputs are established through AI’s novel agency or the accumulation of various other sources that warrant intellectual property rights.</p>



<p>The artwork industry can be used to illustrate the debate on whether generative AI should give credit to artists. Since the system draws inspiration from its training model, would the new artwork’s ownership belong to AI? This debate highlights legal and ethical dilemmas, due to a lack of established frameworks that promote fair compensation for contributors. As AI systems evolve, there is a pressing need to redefine traditional notions of ownership. Acknowledgment of the collaborative nature of AI development is needed while safeguarding the rights of those involved in the generative process.</p>



<p></p>



 Role of blockchain in establishing trust 



<p>Based on the trust challenges discussed above, blockchain technology could be the solution as a trust layer for AI. Blockchain’s decentralised design, using transparent and immutable data records, guarantees universal accessibility, enhanced authentication, and verification processes for all users.</p>



<p></p>



 Ensuring transparency in data processes  



<p>One of the fundamental challenges in trusting AI, as discussed, lies in the lack of transparency regarding data input processes. Blockchain can resolve the transparency issue by recording every step of the AI training and data input process. This ensures that the origin and reliability of the data used to train AI models are traceable and verifiable to reflect real-world conditions.</p>



<p>By leveraging blockchain, organisations facilitating AI technology can instil confidence in stakeholders regarding the reliability of its AI-generated outputs. This safeguards against potential misuse and establishes a foundation for accountability in the development and deployment of AI.</p>



<p></p>



 Tracing decision-making processes  



<p>Transparency enabled by blockchain technology can address the inherent explainability challenges associated with AI’s black-box nature. Establishing a transparent trail of the data and model processes integrated enhances the reliability of AI decisions.</p>



<p>The availability of a comprehensible trail can address the lack of confidence and scepticism present in generative AI. Traceability encourages independent evaluation, empowering users to revisit and assess AI’s decision-making steps, thereby contributing to a more accountable and trustworthy AI environment.</p>



<p></p>



 Leveraging immutability to validate data input reliability 



<p>The immutable nature of blockchain technology contributes to providing security to data records and data transactions. Every piece of information entered into the blockchain is time-stamped and linked to previous data blocks, creating an unbroken chain of custody. This not only enhances the accountability of data sources but also enables stakeholders to verify the authenticity of inputs. As a result, users can confidently rely on the integrity of the data feeding into AI algorithms, knowing that any attempt to manipulate or compromise the information would be immediately detectable. On the other hand, blockchain can be used to drive sustainability goals for successful operations in the long run. For further understanding of how blockchain can sustain long-term ESG goals for organisations, refer to this ebook on <a href="https://zaisan.io/ebooks/using-blockchain-for-sustainability/">using blockchain for sustainability.</a></p>



<p></p>



 Authenticating human vs. machine contributions 



<p>Distinguishing between outputs generated by human intelligence and those crafted by AI is critical. The widespread use of AI in optimising many of our daily processes is bound to be used in other various domains, such as work-related situations and advisory roles.  This has caused increasing evaluation on whether information distributed is completely human or contains traces of AI contribution. </p>



WorldID is used as a global digital identity to anonymously prove a person’s unique identity.



<p>Thus the use of smart contracts in the blockchain ecosystem provides a mechanism for creating verifiable identities for both human and machine contributors.  OpenAI’s <a href="https://worldcoin.org/world-id">WorldID</a> initiative is an example of how smart contracts can be employed to authenticate the origin of contributions. Its application will enable a clear distinction between human and AI-generated outputs. Their initiative could address future concerns about accountability and ethical considerations in various domains such as authentic journalism and recognition.</p>



<p></p>



 Establishing auditable trails for tracing errors 



<p>In the complex landscape of AI, errors and biases in outputs can have significant consequences for end users. Blockchain-based systems can offer the solution of an auditable trail that records every transaction and interaction within the AI ecosystem. In the event of errors or biases in AI outputs, this auditable trail provides a comprehensive analysis of the training data and its parameters, facilitating the identification and rectification of issues. This auditable trail also serves as a critical tool for post hoc analysis, allowing for continuous improvement and refinement of AI algorithms to meet evolving ethical and performance standards.</p>



<p></p>



 Challenges between AI and blockchain integration 



<p>The integration of AI and blockchain technology may provide us with a starting point in establishing trust, however, there are still potential challenges that experts should address when considering this integration.</p>



<p></p>



 Scalability 



<p>One prominent concern is the scale and scope of AI applications. AI systems often work with massive datasets, and to fully integrate them with blockchain, a highly efficient, low-cost network is essential. However, the transactional and resource costs associated with blockchain networks remain a significant hurdle.</p>



<p></p>



 Cost efficiency 



<p>Initial setup costs can involve acquiring the necessary hardware, software, and infrastructure to support both AI algorithms and blockchain networks. Maintenance costs also arise as ongoing updates and improvements are essential to keep both technologies optimised and secure. Transaction costs associated with blockchain networks, such as fees for data storage and processing, can accumulate. Particularly when dealing with large-scale AI applications that require frequent interactions with the blockchain. Lastly, organisations will need to invest in skilled professionals who can navigate the complexities of integrating AI and blockchain, adding to the overall human resource expenses.</p>



<p></p>



 Interoperability 



<p>There are various blockchain platforms available, and achieving interoperability between them poses a challenge since smart contracts and AI applications might need to interact across different blockchain networks. AI models and algorithms may be developed using different frameworks and technologies. Therefore, ensuring a seamless integration with blockchain platforms can be a complicated process. </p>



<p></p>



 Regulatory Compliance 



<p>The topic of interoperability across both technologies also highlights regulatory challenges on two fronts. The decentralised and global nature of blockchain introduces uncertainty, as compliance requirements vary across jurisdictions. Simultaneously, the use of AI, particularly in sensitive domains, is subject to rigorous regulatory scrutiny with a focus on data privacy, transparency, and accountability. Combining these technologies requires a dual compliance effort of addressing regulations specific to each domain and staying up to date with technical developments, to develop a standardised process for compliance.</p>



<p></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>The widespread integration of AI technology has prompted critical discussions surrounding transparency, authentication and ethical standards in AI language models. Blockchain, through its transparent and immutable nature, emerges as a promising solution to address these concerns. It offers transparency in data processes, traceability of decision-making, and validation of data input reliability. However, the integration of AI and blockchain presents a set of challenges, such as scalability, interoperability, regulatory compliance, and cost efficiency. Thus, when leveraging this integration, a balance is needed between innovation, and ethical considerations. AI developers should ensure that the collaborative development of AI is transparent, accountable, and trustworthy for the benefit of its users.</p>

<p>1) Can you tell us a little about yourself?</p><p>I’m what everyone knows as ‘JSKitty’ — the infamous dev cat of Labs (since the SnappySnap days)! Young British dev, a never-ending interest in tech, from crypto to global-finance, game-dev and AI, I’ve pretty much touched every computer-related subject that anyone could think of — and my end interest ended up being with crypto, after I found Bitcoin around early&nbsp;2014.</p><p>Before PIVX, I worked at ZENZO, before ZENZO, I worked on multiple early projects, like the “DeepOnion” privacy coin, or “eXperience Points (XP)” back in the 2017&nbsp;bullrun!</p><p>Before all those, I was a Game Developer, with two published games, and a handful of unpublished ones, mostly solo-built, some with friends, but all of them were built in a home-schooled method, I do not have a single academic grade to my name, and I don’t need&nbsp;one!</p><p>2) When and why did you get into cryptocurrency?</p><p>In early 2013–2014 I ended up coming across (in a way that is now lost to my memories) a Bitcoin faucet, the ancient “Freebitco.in” site (which is still running today, damn!), at that point, I was just barely a game developer, had zero knowledge (hah) of Bitcoin, crypto, most of programming, and even finance in general — over the years, I collected Bitcoin, I learned about it, got incredibly obsessed over the technology from the newfound of decentralised systems and “programmable money”, I joined the BitcoinTalk forum and engaged, actually got a fairly reputable BitcoinTalk account in those days, back when coins would often do “Banner Campaigns” where BCT users would advertise a coin on their banner, fun times,&nbsp;indeed.</p><p>3) When and why did you get into&nbsp;PIVX?</p><p>This is an interesting one, around late 2017 roughly, I was effectively a serial-tipbot-dev as a kid, a surprising amount of projects used to have my Tipbots, I built them from scratch, they had various community-building features, and I would bounce from project-to-project hooking them up and watching the communities enjoy&nbsp;them.</p><p>In that time, I met Snappy and the original-ish tipbot operator (Buer), in which I poked around for the status of it, and saw that it was effectively dead — so I teamed up with Snappy, who LOVED the idea, and immediately helped me to make the ‘PIVX Tipbot’ a reality — and for those months that it ran, I remember it was a huge success, with a bot-powered Radio and DJ system that members would gather and rock with — Snappy would act as a host — that, that community spirit, is what kept me in PIVX, even if the original idea, was merely to propagate a&nbsp;tipbot.</p><p>4) What do you think sets PIVX apart from other cryptocurrencies in the&nbsp;market?</p><p>It’s teams (Core and Labs), it’s long-lived testament of surviving the harshest markets, it’s unique blend of Bleeding-Edge tech with PoS, in which a dozen “PIVX-firsts” occurred and continue to occur. — PIVX as a technology, and a currency, is an incredible feat, to say the least, one that is underappreciated by the wider&nbsp;market.</p><p>5) Can you tell us about your journey as a developer and engineer that led you to the creation of PIVXLabs; mypivxwallet and PIVCards?</p><p><a href="https://discord.gg/PjuCvCHDyp">PIVX Labs,</a> or at least the ‘soul’ and idea of it, was born of Snappy — the Catalyst of PIVX Labs as-of-today was back when me, Snappy, Kyeno and various other developers, some long gone now — decided that PIVX needed more than just a Core Wallet, the problem with 2017–2020 PIVX was that there were a severe barrier to entry, as well as a UX that is not up to the modern standards of&nbsp;‘Web3’.</p><p>Labs came to fruition from the demand of Labs being needed — we knew PIVX needed a lighter, faster, easier wallet that anyone in the world, on any device, with any experience level; could setup and use, without compromising on security. <a href="https://mypivxwallet.org/">MyPIVXWallet</a> was Labs first creation.</p><p>We also knew that PIVX needed more than wallets to thrive as a currency — <a href="https://mypivxwallet.org/pivcards/">PIVCards </a>enabled using PIV in the real-world, easier than any other platform on the market — What will we build next? I’m not sure yet, but it will be another pillar to PIVX’s real-world adoption and usage — That, is why Labs&nbsp;exists.</p><p>6) As a developer, what are some of the technical aspects or challenges you encountered while building mypivxwallet, and how did you overcome&nbsp;them?</p><p>In general, there are three-ish ‘pillars’ of MPW’s architecture to decide&nbsp;upon:</p><p>- Convenience.</p><p>- (De)centralisation and/or&nbsp;Privacy.</p><p>- Security.</p><p>Increase one, and generally, the other two decrease, how do you build something perfect in all three? Truthfully, you can’t, there are trade-offs to be made somewhere, for something.</p><p>My first and foremost priority for MPW has been Security: for example, MPW since even the first day, NEVER allowed saving a wallet to disk without an encryption password — ironically, this is a more secure practice than the Core Wallet, which does not force this measure on first&nbsp;launch.</p><p>But for Privacy? This is tough, MPW uses Blockbook explorers to sync your transaction history, which requires the app to send your Public Keys to said Blockbook to retrieve your balance — this is not fun, but the alternative: chain header sync, would lengthen the synchronisation time of MPW MASSIVELY, which is a huge hit to Convenience.</p><p>Sure, only a gone-rogue Blockbook can actually collect, store, analyse that data — but it is still a possibility, depending on your threat model, that may already be too much data exposure for&nbsp;someone.</p><p>Back to security: many platforms, like Password Managers, will encrypt your password data locally, and then upload your encrypted data to their Cloud storage — this means you can retrieve your data from the internet, or cross-sync things across your devices, which is incredibly convenient: but what if that service gets compromised? It’s a ticking time bomb before your data is decrypted by an attacker, and boom, account gone — MPW could add encrypted cloud-sync for convenience, and to give users the ability to recover their wallet even if their device exploded randomly — sure, but is it worth the&nbsp;risk?</p><p>This is our daily challenge, a balancing act of conflicting design philosophies.</p><p>7) How does mypivxwallet simplify the onboarding process for new users, particularly those who may be unfamiliar with cryptocurrency wallets?<br> <br> <a href="https://mypivxwallet.org/">MPW </a>focuses massively on: “less is more” in a User Experience sense — the default design assumption of MPW is to assume the user is the least knowledgeable in any area of the wallet, as such; complex features are walled off behind “Advanced Mode”, which hides complex things by default — users can create an MPW wallet, jot down their seed on paper, and encrypt their wallet, within just 1–2&nbsp;minutes!</p><p>8) With the recent launch of PIVCards could you share a little about this phenomenal PIVX use&nbsp;case?</p><p>PIVCards was, funnily, a completely random whim-idea I had a few months ago and decided to prototype in a single week of spare time — having gotten the ‘itch’ to do something new outside of MPW, PIVCards was a massive technological and logistical challenge, and I am surprised that such a small team managed to build it as well as we&nbsp;did.</p><p>PIVCards has processed almost 400 orders, worth a total of ~$17,500, since the initial prototyping, and we HUGELY underestimated the volume we’d be handling, so PIVCards had a full two/three weeks of additional polishing by me, to get it scaling better and with less manual input needed — now, although still imperfect, the service runs entirely autonomously, with near zero manual labour required aside from the occasional logistical ‘edge-case’ we&nbsp;hit.</p><p>9) Finally, what advice or encouragement would you give to aspiring developers and entrepreneurs who are looking to make an impact in the cryptocurrency industry?</p><p>Find what excites you, fascinates you, what grabs at you with the grasp a black hole has on the cosmos: and dive in to it, trust the&nbsp;process.</p><p>Why keep what you love, as a mere side-hobby, rather than a way of&nbsp;life?</p><p>Work doesn’t have to be ‘for someone’, nor does it have to be boring, unexciting — break the chains of being a corporate cog, find what you love, master it, and with enough time and energy (and very importantly: networking), you will make a living with it, doing what you&nbsp;love.</p><p>Sending gratitude to JSKitty for taking the time to sit down with me and share some insights into his background and experiences.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/decembers-pivx-perspectives-spotlight-shines-on-jskitty-founder-and-developer-of-pivxlabs-487e2cc3ba5f">December’s PIVX Perspectives Spotlight Shines on JSKitty, Founder and Developer of PIVXLabs.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
