  You can be an active part of the Panther community in more ways than you think. Let's look at Panther's DAO participation and other strategies.

<p>At Panther, we are lucky to have community members always eager to participate in bringing privacy to DeFi.</p><p>Different aspects of our mission require distinct but coordinated efforts and, within them, plenty of roles arise for our community to fill. Each role has its duties and rewards, which creates a crucial balance that we strive to maintain. We attempt to make all roles equally enticing. It’s up to you to decide which one interests you the most.</p><p>Let’s examine a few strategies for you to get involved in Panther right now or in the future and help us enable privacy and trust in DeFi:</p> Strategy #1: Vote on DAO proposals <p>The <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/dao/governance/dao">Panther DAO</a>, not our team, has the final say on all major decisions in Panther. As such, all $ZKP holders can vote on DAO proposals conducted through <a href="http://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth">Snapshot.org</a>.</p><p>DAO proposals range from definitions on our roadmap (e.g., <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x969138dfe31faeb2cde3b10fe4e3fe40d3ad571974d1e566b5257229488a937b">launch Staking</a> or <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x6723c96c0ded4557fc70a4a8e3be54edd2c359895df3c88e7c645fcb0447063e">deploy to Polygon</a>) to <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x5b854f288f407562265f6fd701e8e50564e4e936d36fb3784664195f763434a0">bug fixes</a> and <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/launchdao.eth/proposal/0x2440b546cecc6292c56f55539942f10108831a1d6eff3b90a3603a9a157dbeae">launch timing</a>. We request community before every move, so voting is the best way for you to take an active role in the future of Panther.</p>All $ZKP holders with staked tokens can participate in voting.<p>Your $ZKP must be <a href="https://staking.pantherprotocol.io/">staked</a> to count towards voting power, regardless of the network (Ethereum or Polygon). We always announce new DAO proposals on <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/">Panther’s blog</a> and through social media.</p> Strategy #2: Become a member of our community <p>Panther frequently relies on our community members on Discord, Telegram, and Twitter to get feedback on many of our initiatives and help disseminate the word about what Panther is building. In exchange for that, we make sure our community members are always in the loop regarding our more recent releases, undertakings, and marketing activities. </p><p>Our policy of full transparency is conducted through these official channels. We invite you to join them in order to become a full-fledged member of the Panther community:</p>  Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">https://t.me/pantherprotocol</a>  Discord: <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c">https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c</a>  Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">https://twitter.com/ZkPanther</a>  <p>We have also established a number of local Panther communities through our Ambassadors in order to reach users, investors, and believers outside the anglosphere. The local communities currently live are:</p>  French: <a href="https://t.me/PantherFranceOfficiel">t.me/PantherFranceOfficiel</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpantherFR">twitter.com/zkpantherFR</a>  Spanish: <a href="https://t.me/pantherespanoloficial">https://t.me/pantherespanoloficial</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpantherES">twitter.com/zkpantherES</a>  Turkish: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocolturkish">https://t.me/pantherprotocolturkish</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/zkpantherTR">twitter.com/zkpantherTR</a>  Japanese: <a href="https://t.me/PantherJapanOfficial">https://t.me/PantherJapanOfficial</a>  Italian: <a href="https://t.me/PantherItaliaOfficial">https://t.me/PantherItaliaOfficial</a>  Russian: <a href="https://t.me/PantherRussianOfficial">https://t.me/PantherRussianOfficial</a>  Africa: <a href="https://t.me/PantherAfricaOfficial">https://t.me/PantherAfricaOfficial</a>  India: <a href="https://t.me/PantherIndiaOfficial">https://t.me/PantherIndiaOfficial</a>   Strategy #3: Providing liquidity in Uniswap <p>Liquidity is very important in a DEX setting.</p><p>High liquidity allows investors to trade quickly, smoothly, and with less slippage. Liquidity providers earn fees from trades executed through liquidity pools. When a project has plenty of liquidity, volatility is better absorbed, making its price movements less abrupt.</p><p>Although anyone can create a Uniswap pool for any pair of assets, most of the time, it’s best to join existing pools that already enjoy some liquidity. There are currently four $ZKP liquidity pools live: a <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/0x909E34d3f6124C324ac83DccA84b74398a6fa173/ETH/3000?chain=mainnet">ETH-ZKP pool</a> (in the Ethereum Mainnet), and <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/0x9A06Db14D639796B25A6ceC6A1bf614fd98815EC/0xc2132D05D31c914a87C6611C10748AEb04B58e8F/3000?chain=polygon">USDT-ZKP</a>, <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/0x9A06Db14D639796B25A6ceC6A1bf614fd98815EC/0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174/10000?chain=polygon">USDC-ZKP</a>, and <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/0x9A06Db14D639796B25A6ceC6A1bf614fd98815EC/ETH/10000?chain=polygon">MATIC-ZKP</a> pools (in Polygon).</p><p>All of them are Uniswap v3 pools, meaning you must select a price range in which to concentrate your liquidity. You will earn fees for trades only when $ZKP is within your selected price range, and the narrower it is, the faster you will accumulate fees.</p> How to provide liquidity for $ZKP in Uniswap <p>To become a liquidity provider and earn fees in Uniswap, follow the steps below. Note that we only recommend for advanced users to do this, as you need to be aware of <a href="https://www.blockchain-council.org/defi/impermanent-loss/">impermanent loss</a>, know what you’re doing, and be prepared for the possibility of financial losses.</p><p>To provide liquidity in Uniswap:</p><p>1. Go to <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/">Uniswap’s dApp</a> and connect your wallet to the correct network.</p><p>2. Select the “Pool” tab, and click on the “New Position” button. Alternatively, follow one of the links above to the pool to which you want to provide liquidity.</p><p>3. Select the token pair you want to provide liquidity to. In this case, we selected $USDT/$ZKP. You might need to manually add $ZKP as a custom token to your Uniswap interface if you’ve never traded it in the decentralized exchange.</p><p>4. The “Edit” button (highlighted in yellow) in the screenshot below allows you to select a fee tier to deposit liquidity into. While you can choose a higher fee tier, users prefer to trade in pools with lower fees and more liquidity. For this reason, most users choose to adhere to the default option.</p>Adding liquidity to Uniswap pairs (in here, $ZKP/USDT).<p>5. As explained above, the fields highlighted in red are the bounds of the price range into which you will concentrate your liquidity. Highlighted in green is the button to provide liquidity at a full price range (zero to infinity). This is not recommended, however, as fee income will accumulate very slowly. You might want to set a wide but finite range to optimize your participation in the pool without worrying about $ZKP’s price range.</p><p>6. At last, type in how much $ZKP you want to provide. You will need to the pairing asset ($USDT in the image) in an amount that equals the same value. Uniswap will calculate the exact quantity you need to enter after you input your $ZKP amount.</p><p>7. You might need to approve your Metamask to spend $ZKP and your pairing asset if you have never used them in Uniswap. If you don’t see the “Approve” buttons, just skip this step.</p><p>8. Click “Preview” and “Add” to finish adding liquidity.</p> Strategy #4: Participate in product testing (Panther Zafari) <p>Panther Zafari is the name of Panther’s Incentivized Testnet. It <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testing-for-zkp-advanced-staking-is-now-live-19b51bc6b42b/">debuted</a> on May 19th, 2022, inviting our community to join the team’s efforts to test $ZKP Advanced Staking in the Mumbai Polygon Testnet, with rewards amounting to a total of $100,000 in $ZKP.</p>We have received an enormous amount of feedback from all participants in Zafari for Advanced Staking testing. Decentralizing testing is a powerful way to dramatically increase our testing capabilities at a manageable cost.<p>Testing happens in the Polygon’s and Ethereum’s Testnets, with instructions in each test round’s announcement. Test $ZKP tokens are provided through a faucet when necessary.</p><p>The <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testing-for-zkp-advanced-staking-is-now-live-19b51bc6b42b">first</a>, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/round-2-of-incentivized-testing-for-zkp-advanced-staking-is-now-live-94aaff689332">second</a>, and <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wave-3-of-incentivized-advanced-staking-testing-begins-on-july-7th/">third</a> testing rounds for Advanced Staking are currently closed for new participants. Later Zafari rounds and testing of other features will be made public through our blog, so keep a close eye to avoid missing the next Zafari announcement!</p> Strategy #5: Become a partner <p>Strategic partnerships are essential for a nascent project’s success in the blockchain industry. Although competition is a major force that drives innovation, cooperation can be even more impactful in this space.</p>Panther aims to be the focal point through which Interchain private transactions are made possible. We prioritize our partners to deliver this critical private infrastructure.<p>Panther is always on the lookout for <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/tag/partnerships/">partnerships</a> that contribute toward our goals for privacy in DeFi. If you’re involved with another project in the blockchain space and you believe we can mutually benefit from joining forces, you can reach out to our team through <a href="mailto:partnerships@pantherprotocol.io">partnerships@pantherprotocol.io</a>. We’re also always looking forward to hearing from:</p>  Other members of the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/privacy-finance-why-panther-is-different-and-necessary-e423b2993df9/">PriFi</a> scene.  Projects wanting to infuse their protocols with privacy.  Infrastructure/data protocols.  Builders looking to use Panther’s primitives (see our section on upcoming SDKs/APIs for more about this!)   Strategy #6: Apply to be a Panther Ambassador <p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/introducing-the-panther-ambassador-program-7cfc198a20a2/">Panther Ambassadors</a> are leaders all over the world who play a pivotal role in disseminating Panther amongst broader audiences. Thanks to them, the Panther community can continue to grow and provide feedback to improve our products, systems, and procedures.</p><p>Besides our team, Panther Ambassadors are the first to access product previews and exclusive events. Ambassadors work independently but can count on our team’s support as necessary for their endeavors. </p><p>Here are some examples of activities a Panther Ambassador can perform:</p>  Creating and moderating local communities  Organizing local events and meetups  Translating or creating Panther content, including but not limited to:  Twitter threads  Blog posts  Videos  Memes (yes, please)  Infographics  Podcasts  Assisting with the promotion and moderation of social media accounts. In fact, as of July 2022, we made a move to allow notable Panther Ambassadors to help moderate our Discord and Telegram channels, as opposed to a third-party firm. This has had the side effect of drastically increasing moderation quality and moderator knowledge!  Connect us with other players in the space for potential partnerships and collaborations.  Offer input to the Panther team on certain strategic decisions.   How are Panther Ambassadors compensated? <p>At the moment, for a few hours a month, Ambassadors may receive a monthly compensation varying on account of one’s cost of living and the extent of their contributions, among other factors. This program is designed to help motivated and driven ambassadors thrive as they increasingly support Panther.</p><p>Ambassadors can be reimbursed for pre-approved expenses incurred while representing Panther. They are also qualified to receive exclusive Panther swag you’ll receive for personal use and distribution.</p> How does one become a Panther Ambassador? <p>While Panther Ambassadors are still very much a part of our community, we are currently not actively looking for them. However, if you have a proposal for us, feel free to message the Panther team through our official <a href="https://discord.com/invite/WZuRnMCZ4c">Discord</a> and <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn">Telegram</a>.</p> A lot more is coming <p>Panther is building a whole infrastructure to enable privacy and trust in DeFi and Web3. This is done through a complex ecosystem of products and services and, as such, in the future, you will be able to participate in Panther in many more ways. Some of them will be:</p> Providing liquidity to Multi-Asset Shielded Pools <p>By using Panther’s privacy solutions, you contribute to Panther’s privacy set and assist in making shielded transactions even harder to track. Depositing assets into <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-multi-asset-shielded-pools-enabling-heterogeneous-mixing-of-assets-ec165854bf0f/">MASPs</a> is a straightforward way to participate and strengthen the privacy offered by the protocol. Here is how it works:</p><p>After locking their assets into a vault, users receive fully-collateralized zAssets with which to privately transact through Panther’s Multi-Asset Shielded Pools. As the number of transactions within a pool increases, it becomes increasingly harder to uncover the sender of any transaction. MASPs will reward those that add tokens even if they don’t make shielded transactions, as locking their assets also contributes to shielding.</p><p>MASPs are a part of Panther’s v1, which will be released sometime in 2022.</p> Advanced Staking <p>Currently, users are <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wave-3-of-incentivized-advanced-staking-testing-begins-on-july-7th/">testing Advanced Staking</a>, which is a mechanism that will help the Panther team test the way MASPs accrue and control rewards. Advanced Staking introduces the first zAsset, $zZKP. For this very reason, Advanced Staking requires a great deal of the infrastructure necessary for MASPs to be ready and deployed. </p><p>Our team has come to call Advanced Staking by the nickname “Panther v0.5,” a succinct way to describe what this feature means on Panther’s roadmap. The release of Advanced Staking is a huge milestone and just a few weeks away, so stay tuned!</p> Building on top of Panther <p>Panther is building public goods for a future where privacy is the default throughout in DeFi. By interacting with our smart contracts, developers can build more complex systems that rely on Panther as a basic building block. We commit to making this as easy as possible by releasing comprehensive and easy-to-understand <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/home/">documentation</a> on our smart contracts.</p><p>Our robust DeFi privacy suite relies on a number of state-of-the-art <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zksnarks-through-the-lens-of-the-cypherpunks/">cryptographic primitives</a> not widely available in a ready-to-use form. Our team intends to make them available through SDKs (software development kits) for developers to build privacy-oriented applications and dApps.</p> Interact with the Panther DAO <p>Since our launch, Panther has made decentralization one of our highest priorities and a key principle. The <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth">Panther DAO</a> regularly conducts votes to approve the deployment of Panther’s new developments. As time passes, the responsibilities of the Panther Foundation and Stellium will be progressively passed over to the Panther DAO. </p><p>We are currently setting up the stage for users to get more actively involved in Panther’s governance and contribute to it more broadly.</p> Become a Service/Trust Provider <p>Some of Panther’s features rely on the participation of <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf">Service Providers and Trust Providers</a>. Service Providers are entities offering applications that interact with <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol/protocol/panthers-core-components/zassets">zAssets</a> or <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol/protocol/panthers-core-components/zk-and-non-zk-reveals">Panther Reveals</a>. Trust Providers are entities capable of providing attestations (verifiable statements) in the form of Panther Reveals, revealing the least possible (or none at all) underlying information. Through these attestations, Service Providers can build trust with their users.</p><p>As these features become commonplace, the Panther team will open the door for more and more Trust and Service Providers to join the ecosystem.</p> Ask not what Panther can do for you… <p>At the end of the day, Panther can only go as far as its community takes it.</p><p>On our end, our job is to build the best system possible that aligns all incentives for Panther to <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/economic-analysis-of-private-defi/">compete with other centralized and decentralized alternatives.</a> Our ultimate goal is to build an ecosystem that supports users contributing, building, and improving their privacy without the need to be told so.</p><p>By joining early, you get to be one of the very first to reap the benefits of participating in a larger mission.</p><p>We hope to see you around our communities very soon!</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

<p>Communication is the foundation of the Internet. Social media, news, shopping, and educational platforms are all underpinned by the ability to communicate across the world, at any time, with anyone. We form relationships, we learn, we grow, and we share our lives and our secrets online – and up until now, we’ve done it by selling our identities to the most powerful companies in the world.</p>



<p>The xx network is a revolution in the way we build and use the communications platforms that make the Internet so ubiquitous in our daily lives. The xx network provides private communications infrastructure that isn’t owned by a corporation, individual, or government. On top of that, the xx network can’t scoop up your data or your identity, and it can’t be censored – nor be discovered – even by the most determined actors. Ensured by cryptography, the xx network is owned and operated by its users, meaning you can run the servers and make the decisions.</p>



<p>The xx coin represents your voice in the network. It’s used to vote, exchange value, and incentivize you to run a server or node, and it gives uncensorable access to the most private decentralized communications network in the world. The full rundown on <a href="https://xx.network/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/xx-economics-v1.2.pdf">the xx network’s tokenomics can be found here</a>, and we’ve put together a high-level overview of the xx coin below for those of you who are interested in helping build a truly protected digital society.</p>



 What is xx coin? 



<p>xx coin is the native digital currency of the xx network. This secure digital currency can be traded among individuals and institutions and all xx coin wallets are embedded with quantum-secure keys which will protect your assets in the event of a quantum computing breakthrough.</p>



<p>On top of that, xx coin plays an essential role in incentivizing network participation and decentralized governance through xx network’s multifaceted, tokenized reward structure.</p>



 xx Governance &amp; Rewards 



<p>The xx chain uses a Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) protocol to secure the network economically. The network’s decentralized governance mechanisms allow every xx coin holder to propose, second, and vote in the referendums that shape the network. These referendums may modify the code of the network, add new features, change economic structures, and control just about every aspect of the platform.</p>



<p>More specifically, the xx network will use nominated staking to incentivize all coin holders to participate in node selection, operation, bonding, and governance. There are four main ways to contribute to the xx network and start earning xx coins:&nbsp;</p>



  <a href="https://xx.network/nodes/">Run an active node</a>: xx coin holders can become an xx network node operator and earn xx coins in exchange for helping secure the network. Prospective validators must stake a minimum of 5,000 xx coins and attract nominations and stakes from the community to be elected. Once elected, every validator is equal, meaning their xx coin staking rewards are not proportional to the validator’s stake, but rather determined by a point-based system that measures each validator’s relative blockchain performance (uptime, block production, etc.). Today, it takes over 100k xx in nominations to become a node on the xx network blockchain.  <a href="https://xxnetwork.wiki/How_to_Nominate">Nominate an active node</a>: xx network users who do not want to become validators can stake their coins and nominate validators in order to vote on governance proposals and nominate nodes in the network. These Nominators earn interest on the tokens they have staked on active nodes every “era” according to an interest rate curve and the specific commission and performance of the node.  <a href="https://xxfoundation.org/archive/xx-foundation-announces-the-xx-dapps-grant-program/">Build an xx app</a>: The xx Foundation has launched a special grant initiative to jumpstart the development and deployment of privacy preserving&nbsp; dApps using the xxDK. The program will award individual grants of up to 1,000,000 xx coins for each successful submission, from an initial pool of 10,000,000 xx coins, and the Elixxir team will also be involved as advisors for every grant project accepted at this stage.  <a href="https://xx.network/welcome/">Grow the xx ecosystem</a>: the xx network’s treasury was created to fund bounties and rewards for ongoing development of the xx ecosystem through activities proposed by the council, the tech committee, or the community at large. <a href="https://discord.gg/Y8pCkbK">Join the xx Discord</a> and <a href="https://t.me/xxnetwork">Telegram</a> to learn more about new community initiatives and contribute new ideas for how to grow the xx ecosystem.  



<p>xx nodes are essential to the security and core operations of the xx network, and node rewards are composed of a share of the fees paid into the network plus an inflationary reward of newly minted xx coins. That said, we understand that running a full node requires some expertise, time, and money to acquire and maintain the requisite computing hardware and minimum bond amount. That’s why we’ve incorporated node nominations and other reward mechanisms – so every active xx user has the ability to participate in xx network’s governance and development and earn xx coins for their contributions.</p>



 xx coin Ecosystem Usage 



<p>The xx network was founded on the belief that no matter where you are in the world, you should be able to communicate and transact privately without worrying about whether your digital footprint can be viewed or compromised by any external party. That’s why our open-source technology is designed to enable two primary functions: private communications and secure payments, both of which are planned to rely on a mix of free and paid “postage,” the unit that quantifies the amount of computing power and bandwidth required to transmit data privately across the xx network.</p>



  Private communications: Usage of the xx network’s private communication layer is designed to be accessible to anyone with a suitable mobile phone. The system is currently designed to be free to use for xx user accounts who stake or burn a small number of xx coins in order to acquire free postage.&nbsp;  



<p>This allotted free postage is sufficient for most users’ day-to-day messaging needs. However, organizations and independent developers who want to deploy and operate dApps and smart contracts on the xx network will need to pay for additional bandwidth using xx coins. In the future, we will roll out additional mechanisms for acquiring and using free postage in order to benefit regular xx users, but the demand for xx coin will continue to grow as more privacy-minded businesses and builders use the xx network to communicate en masse.</p>



  Secure payments: Every xx coin on the network is held in an account or wallet that is seeded with the strongest type of quantum-secure cryptography known. This ensures that, unlike traditional banking or other cryptocurrencies, not only are your individual coins protected from the rapid development of quantum computers, but just as importantly the infrastructure securing your coins is protected from systemic risk.  



<p>While xx network messaging is currently free to use, the xx community may adopt a postage system in which all xx coin holders would have rate-limited access to the network depending on their needs. As envisioned, all xx accounts would automatically accrue free postage gradually over time to ensure that xx network remains universally accessible. Advanced messaging functionality, enterprise adoption, and integration with other blockchains or dApps will require additional postage gained by purchasing xx coins. The xx network’s unique network architecture is structured in a way that enables every new node to provide additional transaction processing power and relay capacity. This means that as the number of xx nodes increases, both security and performance improve. These scaling characteristics thereby enable a virtuous cycle of growth, in which validator revenue increases as network utilization increases, which then allows the network to onboard and support additional nodes and further increase capacity.</p>



 xx coin Distribution 



<p>One of the xx network’s goals is to broadly distribute coin ownership in order to enhance network security and establish egalitarian incentives across the xx network’s entire privacy-enhancing ecosystem.</p>



<p>1 billion xx coins were created during genesis following the xx network’s mainnet launch on November 16, 2021. Less than 5% of these were immediately put into circulation at genesis, and token distribution was allocated according to the below distribution.</p>



<p>xx coin Distribution</p>



Allocation% SupplyVestingPurposeBetaNet Rewards5%Coins earned have a 1-year lockup from the month they are earnedAllocated to BetaNet node operators and community airdrops. All remaining xx coins will be used to pay nodes running the canary test network.Staking Rewards30%No lockup or vest but are subject to a 28-day unbonding period when unstakedAlgorithmically distributed to stakers in the xx network to incentivize users to stake in the MainNet.&nbsp;Coin Sales30%1-year lockup for coins purchased during BetaNetAllocated for public and private sales. Roughly 12% have already been sold or used to fulfill obligations to early SAFE and options holders, and all remaining coins after the public sale will be re-allocated towards staking rewards (70%) and the Foundation (30%).Team &amp; Partners25%3-year vesting period, 10% of locked coins are stakeable for rewards on the MainNetAllocated to project creators. Many team coins will initially be used to stake members of the BetaNet node community.Foundation10%20% initial vesting period; 3-year vesting for remaining 80%Allocated to grow the xx network ecosystem via partnerships, marketing and promotions, exchange listings and distribution, dApp development and events.



<p>From the start, over 90% of the xx network coin holders voluntarily locked their coins into 6-12 month vesting schedules starting at genesis and are staking those coins for rewards. xx coin will follow a deflationary supply curve for the first 5-6 years it is in circulation, with a small percentage of coins automatically burned at regular intervals in the xx network’s on-chain treasury. Afterwards, the xx network will gradually transition to an inflationary model with a maximum annual coin supply inflation rate of 6.5%, which will be distributed via block rewards to all xx coin holders staking on active nodes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>xx coin’s inflation rate will follow a curve, starting with higher inflation to support the early network before tapering down to maintain the network. The majority of the inflationary reward is given to the nodes and coin holders and a portion is transferred to the on-chain treasury, which is controlled by xx coin holders.</p>



 xx coin and the Future of Privacy 



<p><a href="https://xx.network/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/xx-economics-v1.2.pdf">xx network’s economic model</a> is designed to accelerate the inherent utility of a scalable, quantum-secure coin and leverage the growth and versatility of the platform’s native private messaging functionalities. In that respect, we believe the xx coin is essential to the future of online privacy.</p>



<p>We believe that your financial life and activity should be enriched and not threatened by technology, and our entire privacy-enhancing ecosystem is underpinned by xx coin, in terms of both on-chain governance and dApp development and usage. The positive flywheel effects made possible through the xx network’s quantum-resistant, stake-based consensus protocols enable the user growth and scale required to create a truly global, truly decentralized community of users.</p>

         New Economies, New Stories                 <p>By Allison Keeley</p><p>Photography: WENDY HUYNH</p><p>Published July 28, 2022</p>            <p>How Trevor McFedries is creating new incentives for creatives</p>       



 
 
   
<p>Trevor McFedries’ ’89 light-blue BMW was a mess. Standing at a garage in the West Adams neighborhood of Los Angeles, he was waiting for an update on repairs he knew he couldn’t afford when his phone buzzed. His heart leaped. It was 2017, and this call could change his life. McFedries was almost broke. He’d run through his savings while pitching his big idea to 60 investors who’d gone cold, and one who’d given him a few hundred thousand dollars, which was quickly disappearing into keeping his big idea alive. The caller was Stephanie Zhan, a partner at Sequoia Capital. McFedries hurried into the parking lot away from the shop noise and he started talking.</p>



<p>He told Zhan that he wanted to explode out the opportunities for art and culture to be monetized, changing everything about how creative work is done and who is compensated—from the incentives to create, to the mechanisms for making art, to the distribution of wealth. He would start with his own company, Brud, which he envisioned as a more modern Marvel, where stories are shaped and told by communities empowered to co-produce content and share in the profit, all built on a new version of the web. McFedries told her he based Brud’s first project on his years working as a producer and DJ, collaborating with stars like Katy Perry and Steve Aoki and working at Spotify and JJ Abrams’ production company, Bad Robot: Brud would reinvent celebrity. Not to replace McFedries’ famous friends entirely, but to build a more egalitarian system alongside them.</p>



<p>He already had a solid proof-of-concept for how to do this, he told Zhan. He’d designed a character named Lil’ Miquela, or Miquela Sousa, a 19 year-old creative based in Downey, California, that Brud launched on Instagram in 2016. Her account followed a proven influencer formula: candid selfies of her eating ice cream and going to the movies, and confessional videos talking about falling in love or venting about the challenges of making music. At the time of the parking lot call, it was not totally clear to fans that Lil’ Miquela was CGI. Lil’ Miquela was a modest, mysterious Instagram presence with a sprinkle of freckles and notably full lips. Zhan had heard about her as a low-key phenomenon: Was she real? Was she fake? Did it matter? And why were her bangs such an awkward length?</p>



<p>Awkward was the point, explained McFedries. Lil’ Miquela had been designed anticipating a new kind of relationship between celebrities and the public, one in which a celebrity is aspirational, but the artifice is clear. The bangs are both a signifier of authenticity, like magazine spreads reading, “Stars: They’re Just Like Us,” as well as somehow too perfect and air-brushed. Her ethnically ambiguous look was intended to resonate with a diverse generation that expects to see itself reflected in culture like no previous one. “I knew from the beginning that Trevor was special—he had a deep understanding of consumer psychology and an instinct for creating pop culture,” Zhan says. “He was often ahead of the game, and always had a sense for what was next.”</p>


 Lil’ Miquela 2022 


<p></p>



<p>What was next, according to McFedries, was actually going to be two innovations. The first was this new kind of celebrity. McFedries saw, and still sees, some celebrities as auteurs, with powerful new ideas, but he also sees many celebrities as the center of an ecosystem in which the real value comes from the edges: songwriters, designers and writers. But celebrities, and the companies they work with, keep most of the value. If you replaced the middleman celebrity with a virtual celebrity, McFedries imagined, you could distribute value to the people on the edges. By 2016, he knew the technology to create a believable, relatable avatar like Lil’ Miquela existed, and he sensed that consumers would be willing to interact with her. From the manufactured stars of his childhood—he cites the cartoons Alvin and the Chipmunks and Jem and the Holograms, and the human duo Milli Vanilli—McFedries saw that people could love an illustration or a band with a fake backstory. And now that interactions with “real” celebrities were almost exclusively through phone screens—perfect for an avatar—he saw that technology and consumer psychology had converged.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second innovation was a new kind of process. McFedries was into cryptocurrency by 2013 and felt like its ability to assign value to new kinds of products, services and transactions made it uniquely suited for his ultimate goal: To distribute wealth to people on the edges. He figured the how of it all would be worked out as he went, but McFedries had a vision for digital goods running on a blockchain that could allow this virtual celebrity, or any piece of creative work, to be made by a collective working collaboratively as part of an organization across platforms and benefiting directly from the content’s sales or licensing. McFedries’ vision was more opportunity and wealth for the armies of creatives who currently make a fraction of the wealth that a movie, album, TV show or celebrity generates. “I’m really concerned with building better futures for innovators and creative people,” McFedries says. He bet that those improved futures would be built atop virtual economies. He felt that the economies themselves were inevitable—digital tokens were already being accepted as money—and became obsessed with making sure these new economies would not incentivize the same dynamics of traditional economies. He wanted to shift value to the edges of creative communities, even if he wasn’t yet totally sure how that would happen. “There are so many talented people that don’t have a shot,” McFedries says, “so I think about it every day.” Zhan could see the trajectory from Lil’ Miquela to Marvel, but more so, she said she trusted McFedries to create something that could appeal to many.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And she was right to. Today, Lil’ Miquela, who McFedries created alone before joining with collaborator Sara Decou, has 3 million Instagram followers. She is repped by the Hollywood agency CAA, appearing as a CGI avatar in a Calvin Klein video kissing Bella Hadid, modeling for Prada on her Instagram, and releasing singles on Spotify with millions of streams. Sequoia came in as an early investor, backing Brud in 2018, the same year Lil’ Miquela was named one of Time magazine’s most influential people on the internet. By 2021, Brud was valued at $125 million before it was acquired by blockchain game designers Dapper Labs. Today, Lil’ Miquela is one of many avatars creating a new ecosystem of content. But for McFedries, she was his first crucial step toward the new creative economy that he’s building now.</p>

<p>As a skateboarding, X-Men-loving Black kid growing up in Davenport, Iowa, McFedries said he was both a “techno-optimist” and “socio-anarchist.” Davenport is a port town on the Mississippi River; McFedries’ grandfather drove a tugboat and his other grandparents were auctioneers. His mother had tried to make it in Los Angeles as a model and actress, but after McFedries was born, she and his dad split up and she returned home to the Midwest with her 1-year-old. A single mom, she worked in factories for years before studying nursing at community college and later working as a nurse. McFedries remembers how Davenport was so completely defined by its economy—even down to its smell. “Often at night in the summer, you would just smell rotting pigs in the sewers,” he remembers, a result of runoff from the Oscar Mayer plant. That was oddly coupled with the pleasant, familiar smell of the Wonder Bread factory that he would pick up on cross-town drives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>McFedries loved Davenport. He started coding as a hobby and helped his grandparents auction items on eBay, but he had to go to Iowa City to find his scene at a record store. He knew the world was so much bigger outside Davenport, and he wanted to be part of it. Through pop culture—the movie “Hackers,” the WIRED writing of Kevin Kelly—McFedries immersed himself in the nascent internet culture of the ’90s: information wanted to be free, technology could change the world for the better. He was also drawn to more anti-capitalist ideas, listening to a lot of Rage Against the Machine and hardcore punk. He was listening to bands that emphasized overthrowing systems and empowering the poor, “literally eco-terrorists were like playing punk rock about tearing it all down,” he says. Then, in 2002, in the middle of high school, his mother suggested he move to Los Angeles to live with his father. He was a talented athlete, and she said he’d have more opportunities to play sports in college if he moved to a big city. “It was always clear that Davenport wasn’t the center of what’s happening,” says McFedries. “I think I wanted to participate in that center, but I think the only vehicle for me to understand how to do that as a young person was through athletics.” So, at 16, he started making friends and playing football at Beverly Hills High School.</p>



<p>His new friends invited him to their homes, and suddenly he found himself sitting on the couches of the West Coast elite. Some of his friends’ parents were helming massive companies shaping American fashion and culture. He says at first, “there was still this kind of idea that these titans of industry surely must have a skill set that you didn’t.” But, listening to them tell stories, McFedries realized the key to getting paid to be creative was capital, not skills. He saw that they already had money to cushion them by the time they took creative risks. “And so I was like, okay, I need capital,” he says, “and I need the opportunity to take those kinds of risks. I feel like I’m as capable as they are.”</p>



<p>After high school, he received a football scholarship to San José State and began studying software engineering, but he dropped out to move back to Los Angeles and build a reputation—social capital— that he could leverage for actual capital. Like many L.A. strivers before him, McFedries wanted to be seen as a man who had vision, who could forecast a trend or choose the right music or art before, or better than, anyone else. And he could. He DJed Katy Perry concerts and the entire 2008 Warped Tour. That same year he put out a top 10 album as a member of the group Shwayze. He worked in A&amp;R for Photo Finish Records and directed music videos for Steve Aoki and NERVO. He hosted an iHeartRadio show for Dim Mak Records and became a spokesman for VitaminWater. He worked with singers BANKS and Ke$ha. He was an artist advocate at Spotify and an entrepreneur-in-residence at Bad Robot. As McFedries closed in on 30, he decided he’d generated enough social capital to start trading on it. At the same time, he’d developed a new understanding of celebrity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Celebrities are “a team sport,” he says, but only players connected to the biggest names win. The limited opportunity for financial success in creative industries broadly disincentivizes people from joining creative fields, McFedries says. If only a tiny segment of poets, artists or fashion designers can make a living, why try? Why create, especially without a cushion of capital to fall back on? McFedries says flourishing in a creative field is about where you live, and who you know. McFedries can name friends who might’ve been great art directors but, without a path to opportunity, they ended up hanging drywall in Iowa. He can think of bands that might’ve been on par with Red Hot Chili Peppers, but without the social capital of Southern California to propel them, they stalled in Davenport. McFedries doesn’t just see this as a problem for artists; he sees it as a problem for American culture writ large.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This idea of capitalizing on talent, this idea that, as a nation, we should be identifying people who are talented and maximizing their skillset, obviously is one that we fall short of where we should be in the United States.” Without incentives to create, “there are no new ideas,” he says, no new stories from new kinds of people with new perspectives. Instead, old ideas are repackaged, retold and resold by those who own the rights, with the same traditional narratives and limited cast of characters. “All I’m thinking about all day is how to create better incentives for creative people,” McFedries says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Rihanna or Ariana Grande, or whoever they are,” he explains, are “effectively the vehicles for a lot of creative people, whether it’s choreographers or songwriters or producers.” He figured if you could create a digital vehicle, and have it collectively owned by its creators, “there actually would be more margin for creative people and for the business itself.” He envisioned a future of virtual stars who speak any language, with stories and styles built not around the tastes of a few industry executives, but curated by countless creative people, all with a financial and artistic stake in the virtual celebrity. “You could create these celebrities that could create a ton of value,” McFedries says. So he founded Brud in 2014 to prove that avatars could connect with fans and drive value for collaborators.</p>



<p>And it worked. By April 2018, Lil’ Miquela had almost a million followers, enough to beget brand sponsorships and account monetization. She’d shown that, unlike one celebrity who only needs so many makeup artists or choreographers, Lil’ Miquela could do endless work on any number of platforms, creating exponential opportunities for people to work on projects featuring her. McFedries started to expand his team, and in 2018, he invited Nicole de Ayora on board as director of operations. The two bonded over having grown up in small towns and how that shaped their understanding of the internet. “We both really relied on the internet as a way of connecting with people outside of our small communities,” says Nicole. “It was a way of escaping a lot of what we were experiencing at a young age.” She was eager to join McFedries and his small team, now working to grow Lil’ Miquela so the avatar could do more than work with brands and post compelling selfies. The team at Brud wanted her to be able to tell meaningful stories to more people around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brud filled its offices with photographers, writers and CGI artists, and Lil’ Miquela’s online identity grew more elaborate, with new friends and more complex stories. At the same time, she was bumping up against the limits of her world—the platforms on which she was interacting with her fans. The influence of algorithms was becoming more obvious to consumers, hemming in people’s experiences by choosing what they would see, as opposed to people just seeing what popped up in a chronological timeline, or via their own curiosities. McFedries saw this as creating distance between creators and fans. The platforms themselves were increasingly seen as the new economy’s new middlemen, shilling ads, collecting data and soaking up profits. There was pushback against these practices, in the form of laws focused on protecting consumers’ data. In 2018 the General Data Protection Regulation law went into effect in the E.U. and in 2020 California followed suit with its own Consumer Privacy Act. McFedries and de Ayora were looking for a solution that let fans connect and participate more directly. They imagined a future where contributors and fans owned Lil’ Miquela and her projects outright, as a collective, where a limitless amount of creative work could be done across the world, simultaneously and collaboratively. He needed an online cooperative system, not a company, one that could serve thousands of people making all kinds of contributions.</p>



<p>He knew there was a work model for this, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization or DAO. A DAO is a collective that uses cryptocurrency tokens to vote on how to run itself, from putting value on anything created or contributed, to deciding how any profits are distributed. Today, there are thousands of DAOs, some controlling up to billions of dollars in assets, focused on topics including sports gaming, cryptocurrency and governance. The DAOs could solve these collaboration and ownership needs. But as he’s wont to do, McFedries had an even bigger idea. He wanted to enable people to be paid for work typically seen as intangible or non-monetizable. He wanted people to get paid for things like being fun at a party, offering a suggestion on a photo shoot or encouraging a friend with a smart insight.</p>



<p>To bring these ideas together and test them, McFedries co-founded the Friends With Benefits DAO in 2020. He wanted to see if, by inviting the right people to make the right vibes and creative projects, many more people than the DAO could accommodate would want to join, thus driving up the value of the tokens and giving those vibes a tangible worth. “Having a point of view is hard to measure,” says McFedries, “and should be valued. And we should create economic systems that value those things, because otherwise, we’re just perpetuating the same structures of the past.” McFedries has compared a DAO to a Facebook community where the people posting content, those responsible for making the platform interesting and attractive to more people, also share in the value those posts create—rather than that value accruing to a central corporate entity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To flourish financially, the DAO must flourish creatively. McFedries knows creative work is most likely to surface in spaces where people have real relationships and feel supported to try new things. He is working to foster trust and engagement by setting up community principles, organizing people around potential creative projects, with chapters in London, New York and Los Angeles. Today Friends With Benefits has a waitlist and about 6,000 active members, including musicians Erykah Badu and Azealia Banks, as well as lawyers and software engineers. So far, they’ve collaborated to make real-world art and digital art in the form of NFTs. They’ve started a fellowship program for creatives from underrepresented communities, which will offset the entrance free of more than $3,000, and they’re discussing launching a beverage businesses, writing essays on the history of decentralized “benevolent anarchic” organizations (like Alcoholics Anonymous) and forming friendships, all value that McFedries says is being captured in the DAO’s token.&nbsp;</p>


 Trevor McFedries stands against whitewash in Paris. 


<p><br>But even as Friends With Benefits proves his value-to-vibes idea, building new things is always going to get messy, McFedries admits. In 2021, the service that hosted the Friends With Benefits cryptocurrency token was hacked and the token lost 99 percent of its value, essentially making the collective worthless. But the members regrouped, issued a new token and today its price is $11.80, down from a high of just over $186. That, coupled with how Friends With Benefits has been labeled “<a href="https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/greater-la/trash-electricity-cryptocurrency-backyard-restaurant/friends-with-benefits-tokens">the digital Soho House</a>,” means it’s under pressure to live up to the hype. If it doesn’t create notable work, or it’s not fun, the tokens will lose their worth and the DAO becomes just another Discord chat with some meetups. But living near this edge, where value is being assigned to new things in new ways, some of which are still being tested, doesn’t faze McFedries. After reading “Debt: The First 5,000 Years of Money” by the late anarchist anthropologist David Graeber, he found himself asking, “like what the fuck is value?” and he followed that destabilizing thought to a liberating conclusion: It’s whatever we collectively decide it is. “One of the reasons that I love crypto, or an internet of value, is that we have really antiquated vehicles for representing value,” he says. He believes crypto enables better instruments for assigning value to all things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Web3 proponents are sometimes dismissed as wanting to decentralize the web just enough to get some of the power that corporations and celebrities now have for themselves. For example, some people dismiss Lil’ Miquela as just another spokesmodel, and Brud as manipulative of her fans. But with Dapper Labs’ purchase of Brud, McFedries has a mandate to figure this out and help build the tools and habits to make DAOs mainstream enough to realize their promise. He’s the CEO of the new Dapper Collectives. A near-term order of business is handing Lil’ Miquela over to her fans. McFedries and his team are turning Brud the company into Brud the DAO, which he says is scheduled to open to the public at the end of August. Lil’ Miquela will be at its center. Brud will ask members to help write her storylines and contribute to her computer-generated design and 3D artwork. Fans, now collective members, will receive writing and design credits tracked through on-chain resumes. There will be incentives for DAO members to share content to be sold, and then all token-holders will get a cut. As de Ayora, now CPO of Dapper Collectives, puts it, “At the end of the day, we created Lil’ Miquela but they gave her value and meaning.”</p>



<p>For the next while, McFedries cautions, things will look much as they do now, with platforms like TikTok or Instagram capturing a lot of the value of the DAO’s creative work. But if DAOs and other components of Web3 take off, “there will be virtual goods and economies that would be bigger than (people) could ever dream of…we’re starting to cross that chasm now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of this is taking McFedries, and maybe the rest of us, toward his biggest goals: sustainable financial futures for creative people and connecting everyday people, like the ones he grew up with in Davenport, with the kinds of opportunity he saw when he moved to Beverly Hills. “If you can…reach out across the divide, and give them the opportunities and the language…, we can have this improved capitalization of talent,” he says.</p>



<p>There are success stories in these new budding economies: an FWB artist went from being broke to buying a house during the pandemic. A writer sold an NFT of his essay for about $150,000. Outside FWB, artists have found that DAOs have kept them in the creative game longer than they’d imagined possible. McFedries knows this is just the start of something, a potential alternative to the systems that he sees countless people trapped in. He also knows it’s an urgently needed alternative. He thinks constantly about all the people who never earn the real value of the work they do. All the people who can’t afford to take the big risks his high school friends’ parents did, or who never left Davenport and instead watched its factories close. He knows he got lucky when he moved to L.A., to the center of a scene he fit into and shaped—and that most people never get that chance. Ask him how often he’s hit with the realization that his friends back in Davenport might’ve been just as successful as the creators he knows in L.A. and he doesn’t hesitate: “It really happens every day,” he says. “And that’s why I want to make big things.”</p>

<p>As we mentioned in our <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-1-0/">last blog post</a> regarding release 5.1.0, the Zcash network is processing a significantly increased number of shielded transactions. The network remains stable and secure, transactions are being processed normally, and we are making additional performance improvements to both the <code>zcashd</code> wallet and full node as part of release 5.2.0.</p>



<p>We also have a cross-functional team working on performance improvements to our mobile wallet SDKs. Upcoming releases will focus on performance improvements in the SDK, which should translate to improved performance of third-party mobile wallets.</p>



 Node performance improvements 



<p>Transactions are fully checked by nodes when they are received on the network, whether they appear first in the mempool or in a block. However, some of these checks are expensive, so it’s best to perform them once and cache the results. If the checks are successful, they are not performed again.</p>



<p>As of this release, Sapling and Orchard zk-SNARK proofs are now leveraging this caching mechanism to avoid redundant verification costs and reduce block-verification time. This speeds up block propagation on the network (as this release is adopted by users) and improves the performance of nodes which produce block templates for miners.</p>



<p>In addition, this release backports more efficient caching and SHA256 implementations from upstream Bitcoin.</p>



 Wallet performance improvements 



<p>The wallet now performs trial decryption of Sapling outputs in batches and parallelizes these batches to improve scanning performance.</p>



<p>In addition, some inefficiencies in the <code>zcashd</code> wallet were identified and fixed in this release.</p>



 RPC interface changes 



<p>This release adds a version field to the <code>gettransaction</code> RPC call so that users do not need to make an extra <code>getrawtransaction</code> call just to receive the version of a transaction.</p>



<p>The<a href="https://z.cash/support/schedule/"> Zcash Schedule page</a> will be updated to reflect the 5.2.0 release.</p>

In the second iteration, a combination of the Internet, the “Cloud” and the Software as a Service (SaaS) became the leading business&nbsp;model.</p><p>This meant the growth of large technology companies with proprietary platforms, which created ‘walled gardens’, locking in users and their data. It prevented competition and choice for users and created economic and security challenges.</p><p>Our data is left in the hands of corporations with special interests — exploiting and monetizing it, making fortunes from information that isn’t their own to&nbsp;sell.</p><p>Data is censored at the whim of the controller and transparency around collection and governance is opaque. Future regulations to de-monopolize these services may even entrench tech oligopolies. Siloed data stores and APIs are in the hands of a&nbsp;few.</p><p>The collective result? A lack of respect for our digital property rights, with the data not serving its owner. In the Web2 environment, there was little we could&nbsp;do.</p><p>It’s important to note, big tech’s products have set our standards high, particularly in terms of User Experience. We’re willing to give up our privacy and control in exchange for better UX. This is an opportunity for designers and developers to build competing alternatives — truly inclusive solutions we can all benefit&nbsp;from.</p> Web3: Decentralized, portable &amp; permissionless <p>This is the era of the shifting power disparity, from platforms to people, from companies to&nbsp;workers.</p><p>Blockchain technology has inspired decentralized apps (dApps) and a new privacy-preserving era of the internet, for the people, governed by the&nbsp;people.</p><p>Web3 has the ability to shift companies away from making money by collecting and selling user data without consent. It has a more equitable model for all — users, developers, and communities.</p><p>Verida is one such&nbsp;example.</p><p>Part of the emerging Web3 stack, Verida empowers users to drive a stake into the ground to own and control their data and identity.</p><p>Verida redefines this value exchange, where users access hyper-personalized experiences and are fairly compensated for use of their data via tokens. This provides a revenue stream for users to fund the infrastructure, which simultaneously empowers the app developers.</p><p>Compensation is openly documented, data is decentralized and portable, and there can be true, healthy innovation to process society&nbsp;forward.</p><p>Decentralizing personal data is vital for a democratic digital&nbsp;future.</p><p>No more gatekeepers, changing the rules on a whim. Everyday people will earn ownership simply by joining, using, and sharing services. This isn’t just a reinvention of the internet. It’ll change the society as we know it, for the better. With power for all people, rather than a select&nbsp;few.</p> Personal data is ours to&nbsp;reclaim <p>Taking our data and online history ‘with us’ wherever we go on the internet, rather than surrendering it to singular platforms like now, requires a paradigm shift. To distill the Web3 philosophy into a single phrase, it would be self-sovereignty.</p><p>As Web2 natives, the idea that we can be in full control of our data and even earn money with it is hard to comprehend.</p><p>What we need to realize is it was ours all along.

<p></p><p>In order to reach its long-term goal of becoming a universal currency, bitcoin needs to acquire two qualities that are essential to every form of sound money: privacy and fungibility. In the case of privacy, it’s important that the identities of the BTC transaction sender and receiver remain unknown to every unwanted third party. For fungibility, every bitcoin amount needs to have the same degree of acceptance for payments, regardless of the money’s origins. In other words, we need to make this global digital currency work just like physical cash.</p><p>This article will explain the current asymmetry between privacy and fungibility, while also introducing the ways in which the new Wasabi 2.0 wallet can bridge the two worlds. The problem: privacy vs fungibility.</p><p>Given the open ledger architecture of the Bitcoin network, watching all transactions is one of the features which guarantees the integrity of the financial policy. Seeing the amount getting sent in every transaction reassures every node that nobody breaks the rules by introducing unwanted inflation into the monetary system. And in some cases, revealing the identity behind an address creates an extra level of trust – as is the case of big exchanges, investment funds, charity foundations and fundraisers. Yet the issue is that every time &nbsp;the identity of an active address is revealed, everyone else’s privacy gets damaged. This is why obfuscation mechanisms are required.</p><p>CoinJoins are a great way to increase the privacy of bitcoin senders, as they break the link between the current owner and the previous transactions. However, this obfuscation technique is observable on the public blockchain, almost always finds itself in a numeric minority as compared to other transactions and can therefore create fungibility issues.</p><p>In a perfect world, privacy should improve fungibility. But if there are only a few privacy users, then they can get rejected by other participants. In order for privacy to create fungibility, a certain tipping point needs to be reached: bitcoiners must mix their coins in an overwhelming majority and thus successfully obliterate any claim that using privacy hides criminal actions. Similarly, Bitcoin at large has managed to break away from its Silk Road reputation by onboarding more users with no criminal record, who transact in good faith in a completely legal way.</p><p>Another side of the debate concerns the fact that fungibility is a pretty utopian concept for technical, practical and economic reasons. Technically, not all bitcoins are created equal: they carry different cryptographic hashes, get added to the supply by different competing miners and change hands in different patterns that may please some users while displeasing others. Practically every Bitcoin node has its own blacklist and every miner can choose to not include transactions that come from unwanted addresses. Bitcoin enables censorship by design and it’s only through incentives and social norms that fungibility can work.</p><p>But then again, cash also gets tainted by every user’s fingerprints and may get censored according to serial numbers. Yet it’s thanks to everyone’s agreement that a one - dollar bill is equal with every other one - dollar bill &nbsp;regardless of its origins that we have economic fungibility and privacy is one of the socially-accepted benefits.</p><p>Last but not least, there’s the economic dimension of BTC fungibility. There are two extremes involved in this debate: the users of non-custodial wallets and the regulated custodians (exchanges, banks, and mutual funds). If all the coins get withdrawn from custodians, then there won’t be any government-controlled entities to undergo financial censorship – and therefore bitcoin becomes fungible within the technical and practical limits described above. On the other hand, the coins can also become fungible is the custodians get their hands on every unit – ironically, centralized KYC exchanges like Kraken and Coinbase are actually pretty good mixers which also grant the funds a fairly certain degree of fungibility. But fungibility must not come at the expense of turning bitcoin into an Orwellian money system, in which custodians have absolute control.</p><p>The bad news is that the amount of bitcoins deposited on exchanges has been constantly high for the last 5 years. These exchanges have become increasingly draconian in terms of rejecting specific transactions, and established policies against transaction privacy even in the absence of clear regulatory frameworks. The good news is that there is balance between the custodially-owned and the sovereign bitcoins and the amount of coins on exchanges doesn’t seem to increase too greatly. But since none of the ownership extremes is winning and we want a situation in which privacy generates fungibility, we need to start building bridges. In this design, we must consider the properties of cash and build both the tools and the social norms which help us always agree that every bitcoin unit is equal to any other one. Wasabi 2.0 marks a promising beginning in this direction. </p> Bridging Bitcoins with Wasabi 2.0 <p>Launched in 2018 on the 10th anniversary of the Bitcoin White Paper, Wasabi 1.0 has proven to every privacy enthusiast that BTC is the only currency that they should be using. The combined power of the non custodial experience, the automatic routing of the internet connection via Tor, the sovereign setup which puts users in control of their public key without having to trust a third party and the easy CoinJoins still makes blockchain analysts scratch their heads in an attempt to make guesses. Furthermore, users can also access their hardware wallets in Wasabi – thus granting them a greater amount of privacy than most of the native applications. Nonetheless, the design of Wasabi 1.0 isn’t perfect. Users can still make privacy-damaging mistakes such as reusing addresses or combining private UTXOs with tracked ones for disastrous outcomes that reveal a lot of information. Another big mistake is also that of recombining UTXOs after a CoinJoin – it basically defeats the purpose as the previous state of the coins gets reconstructed and a careful analyst will simply bypass the CoinJoin part to keep on following the money. Then there are the deterring reasons which have &nbsp;kept users away from Wasabi. The biggest one being the minimum amount to CoinJoin: back in late 2018, 0.1 BTC was approximately $400; but at the new all-time high of $69k, one tenth of a bitcoin was equivalent to $6900.</p><p>Many users didn’t CoinJoin with Wasabi specifically because they could not afford to but thanks to the WabiSabi protocol that’s embedded in version 2.0, smaller amounts are welcome to get mixed with the bigger ones coming from whales. Also, there’s the privacy FUD which made bitcoiners fear the idea of mixing. It’s exactly the “your BTC might get dirtier” argument that influencers such as Trace Mayer have been pushing for years. The idea behind CoinJoins is to make every monetary unit just as clean and just as dirty – and therefore fungible. Wasabi 2.0 definitely makes it easier for every user to CoinJoin, thanks to the auto-pilot experience which automatically makes the best decisions for your privacy. The software is open source and you’re strongly encouraged to verify it, so every ounce of trust gets replaced by the certainty of good faith.</p><p>Last but not least, the issue of zkSNACKs' censorship-friendly CoinJoin coordinator needs to be addressed. This is where everyone must understand the difference between the free open source software and the company behind it. Wasabi 2.0 is a non-custodial privacy wallet which doesn’t know who you are and empowers any individual or organization to run their own coordinator. If the default coordinator must abide by certain rules that don’t please certain privacy advocates, it doesn’t mean that these privacy advocates can’t tailor the software to suit their needs. As a matter of fact, having multiple coordinators for CoinJoins is largely beneficial for bitcoin privacy.</p><p>To zkSNACKs, the main priority is to be able to incentivize the 80+ developers and code contributors to keep on working towards building the best privacy wallet technology. Everyone is free to use Wasabi 2.0 however they please, there are certainly use cases that a registered company can’t support or endorse, and this is why you can switch the CoinJoin coordinator without needing to fork the code or make any other modifications. The bootstrapping of alternative Wasabi 2.0 CoinJoin coordination servers is instantaneous and easy.</p><p>As a side effect of the blacklisting of certain UTXOs that are associated with criminal activities, the fungibility of the mixes might get boosted. Previously, exchanges and other regulated businesses would flag incoming transactions whose immediate history is associated with CoinJoin rounds specifically because they needed to verify that the money doesn’t come from illegal activities. Now that the ZK Snacks coordinator will automatically decline UTXOs that exchanges don’t like, the exchanges themselves will have no excuse to reject any CoinJoins from this coordinator. This means that the CoinJoins will have the potential to go mainstream and help users transferring BTC from Coinbase to Kraken without informing the two entities about the ways in which some of the money might have been previously spent.</p><p>Wasabi 2.0 is a bridge for three reasons: it makes privacy easier, more affordable, and more acceptable. Anyone will be able to use the wallet correctly without making rookie consolidation mistakes that ruin the CoinJoin effort. Everyone will be able to use the open-source software with the CoinJoin coordinator that they like the most and poses the smallest amount of compromises. And thanks to a &nbsp;less popular move, exchanges will have no valid reasons to reject or even flag CoinJoin transactions.</p><p>Wasabi 2.0 bridges regulated institutions and cypherpunks. It bridges privacy advocates with the software that they’re going to want to use to coordinate their own mixes. And ultimately, it bridges privacy and fungibility. Thanks to Wasabi 2.0, bitcoin might just become as private and fungible as physical cash.<br><br></p>

<p>As cryptocurrencies opened the door for a new generation of users of financial products, we’re witnessing the increasing extent of regulations that are gradually coming into play. On one hand, the crypto ecosystem and participants see KYC/AML practices as a threat to privacy, data security, and <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-road-to-decentralization-part-1-setting-our-foundations-2e7e3874c09e/">decentralization</a>. Meanwhile, regulators are more concerned with terrorism financing and other activities that involve money laundering.</p><p>Regulatory compliance is an everyday discussion for those working in crypto and the traditional financial sector. As the rate of financial crimes <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/04/05/2416357/0/en/Feedzai-s-Financial-Crime-Report-233-Increase-in-Online-Fraud-Attack-Rates.html">continues to rise</a> and financial systems progressively digitalize, governments are trying to eradicate money laundering, terrorism financing and prevent financial breaches.</p><p>In this article, we will make a case for and against the concept of two of the most well-known regulatory practices, KYC and AML, and explore innovations that restore the public's trust in regulation and achieve compliance without sacrificing users’ right to privacy.</p> What are KYC/AML practices? <p>KYC and AML practices are standard regulatory policies guiding the operations of financial institutions. They are part of the laid-down rules for businesses that offer financial services to the public within a particular geographical area, e.g., cryptocurrency exchanges.</p><p>KYC and AML are terms often used interchangeably, yet they do not share the same meaning. KYC is only one of the several steps that financial institutions and businesses in general take to comply with AML regulations.</p><p>KYC, short for Know-Your-Customer, refers to the checks and steps that a business conducts/takes to know who their customers are, confirm their identities, and understand the risk that each customer poses to the business. Usually, the first phase of KYC procedures requires collecting customer information, followed by customer due diligence, which involves identity verification, watchlist screening, and risk assessment. For high-risk customers or high-value transactions, KYC via enhanced due diligence policies comes into play.</p><p>AML, short for Anti-Money-Laundering, is the wider set of steps that financial institutions and businesses take to prevent bad actors from moving their illicit gains. Principally, AML regulations hinder global criminal activities like terrorist financing and block the movement of funds owned by drug rings, human traffickers, and other criminals. Typical AML programs involve transaction monitoring, Know-Your-Customer practices, identifying and reporting suspicious transactions to regulators, record keeping and auditing, etc.</p> Why are crypto believers often against KYC/AML? <p>KYC and AML practices are common in crypto, with centralized exchanges readily adopting them to comply with global financial regulations. It is not unusual for big exchanges like Coinbase or Binance to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/05/12/so-many-locked-out-binance-users-say-their-accounts-have-been-frozen-for-months/">suspend accounts</a> and pause withdrawals for some users due to suspicious account activity under the pretense of complying with these regulations.</p><p>These measures, as well as the large amounts of data users need to provide to comply, as well as data breaches in the space, have raised concerns in the crypto space, where user privacy and decentralization are founding concepts and seen as the highest standards. However, critics have a hard time explaining how else bad actors could be discouraged from 'cleaning' illicit money through cryptocurrencies.</p> Arguments for &amp; against KYC/AML <p>As the popular saying goes, every coin has two sides. The common KYC/AML practices solve many regulatory and compliance issues for financial institutions but create problems with data laws, data security, and privacy.</p> In favor of KYC/AML  Regulation <p>Money laundering and other financial crimes usually have to go through banks, and one way to prevent or combat these crimes is to regulate the money flowing through institutions. Without KYC/AML, bad actors would have a field day when moving proceeds from illegal businesses. Because of this, most jurisdictions frown at platforms that require no identity disclosure.</p> Compliance <p>As regulators in the financial sector and governments seek to combat financial crime, terrorism financing, and the movement of illicit money, they hold banks and exchanges responsible for their customers' actions. When a financial institution partners with individuals or organizations without being fully aware of their past and present business dealings, it leaves them prone to being hit by lawsuits and fines. Between 2008 and 2018, financial institutions have had to pay over $25 billion in <a href="https://go.fenergo.com/global-regulatory-fines-2018.html">penalties</a> due to KYC/AML violations and other slipups related to global sanctions.</p><p>No business has the ultimate goal of losing money to such avoidable incidents; hence, the strict implementation of KYC/AML. If only for their own benefit, institutions try to remain compliant with financial laws. In this sense, you could say that incentives are set in place for marketplaces, banks, and crypto exchanges to stay on top of the activity going on within them.</p> Against KYC/AML  Privacy <p>Most of the benefits of effective KYC and AML practices go to the businesses enforcing them, while users are left with several doubts and questions. Today, many see KYC and AML requirements as data harvesting endeavors, with concerns over data safety, security, and usage growing. Many believe that in providing personal information to pass KYC verification exercises, users give away their privacy rights.</p><p>Once too often data breaches from these platforms have ended up in the hands of malicious actors. Users’ sensitive data getting <a href="https://www.upguard.com/blog/biggest-data-breaches">hacked</a> or leaked from big organizations has become almost a <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/data-breaches-are-almost-the-norm-for-many-businesses-these-days">norm lately</a>. Because of this, many have genuine concerns regarding data protection and questions about the rationale of KYC practices.</p><p>In the crypto space, pseudonymity is precious, but most big exchanges require customers to fulfill KYC verification to access their services or increase their capabilities. Most users also believe these businesses leverage their personal information in untoward ways, such as to sell them to advertisers.</p> Data Security <p>As we have seen above, data breaches are fairly common. This worries more than one user, as criminals can access sensitive information like credit card details or addresses by hacking into financial institutions' databases. </p>The top 50 biggest data breaches from 2004 to 2021. (<a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/visualizing-the-50-biggest-data-breaches-from-2004-2021/">Source</a>)<p>Since KYC/AML practices require users to provide sensitive information to third parties, individuals are worried over companies' ability to keep their data safe and away from the reach of fraudsters. It’s worth noting that data is often not just reviewed once and then discarded, but goes on to form part of data bases forever.</p> Data Laws <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>) law came into force in 2018, forcing regulated institutions to review their operations regarding customer data. <br></p><p>On the surface, the GDPR appears to contradict KYC/AML practices. Yet, the regulation only insists on the right ways to collect, use, and secure customer data, in which some KYC/AML procedures fail the compliance test. In other words, these procedures often do not store and handle user data following legal specifications.</p>Scope of GDPR. (<a href="https://www.onelogin.com/compliance/gdpr">Source</a>)<p>The seven principles of the GDPR are as follows:</p>  Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency.  Purpose limitation.  Data minimization.  Accuracy.  Storage limitation.  Integrity and confidentiality (security).  Accountability.  <p>KYC and AML practices depend on data sharing, especially between companies and third parties, e.g., foreign entities. Also, some businesses outsource their KYC procedures. </p><p>Data sharing and KYC outsourcing directly contradict the GDPR, which only permits data transfers for important reasons of public interest. Some institutions alo hold customer information for unspecified periods after their partnerships have ended, directly contradicting the storage limitation principle of the GDPR.</p> ZK proofs &amp; decentralized identifiers: The future of KYC/AML <p>As the concepts of KYC/AML practices and privacy concerns continue to be debated, organizations are beginning to devise new methods to remain compliant with KYC, AML and GDPR laws. Companies have begun to deploy innovations like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption">homomorphic encryption</a> and secure multi-party computation to enhance customer privacy and allow access to the information needed for KYC and AML procedures.</p><p>The crypto space, however, continues to be skeptical about these new methods, as they fail to give users control over their digital identity. Instead of them, other more decentralized options are under development, some of which can allow users to gain more control over their data.</p><p>For example, self-sovereign identity on the blockchain has been endlessly quoted as &nbsp;“the future of digital identification”. Other cryptographic innovations like <a href="https://hackernoon.com/eli5-zero-knowledge-proof-78a276db9eff">zero-knowledge proofs</a> (ZK Proofs) and <a href="https://tykn.tech/decentralized-identifiers-dids/">decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs) also lead the way in the race to replace traditional KYC/AML procedures.</p> How ZK Proofs will replace KYC/AML <p>Popular for its successful implementation in creating privacy on the blockchain, the concept of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) is a proven way of confirming a transaction/ownership without revealing sensitive information about its underlying data. Identity solutions based on this, such as Polygon’s <a href="https://blog.polygon.technology/introducing-polygon-id-zero-knowledge-own-your-identity-for-web3/">Polygon ID</a>, utilize ZKPs.</p><p>ZKP-based KYC solutions are superior to their traditional counterparts in that traditional KYC solutions require users to share their information across several platforms repeatedly. With ZKPs, users can present all needed documents to a trusted KYC provider to verify their identities and issue a ZKP. This proof can then be used for subsequent KYC verification exercises without sharing the information therein.</p>Proving a true statement without revealing the data by leveraging zero-knowledge proofs. (<a href="https://anteelo.com/zero-knowledge-proof-its-role-in-the-blockchain-world/">Source</a>)<p>ZK Proofs are on-chain activities, and blockchain ledgers are immutable, which implies that whatever information the zero-knowledge proof holds is true and has remained unchanged since its verification. Trust is restored between KYC providers, businesses, and the end-users, and individuals can remain in full control of their data. </p><p>ZKPs also allow for selective disclosures: in special circumstances only, and with users' consent, a KYC provider may disclose users' information to a trusted third party like law enforcement agencies. For example, <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Panther Protocol</a> enables users to leverage features such as Panther <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol/protocol/panthers-core-components/zk-and-non-zk-reveals">Reveals</a> which generate zero-knowledge reports to voluntarily disclose compliance with select counterparties.</p> How Decentralized Identifiers can replace KYC/AML <p>A decentralized identifier, DID, refers to a cryptographically verifiable framework that consists of information (documents, certificates, and other personally identifiable information) unique to an individual or organization. With a <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/03/05/decentralized-identity-using-blockchain/">DID</a>, users can store identifiers like government-issued identity documents, etc., in a private wallet built on a public blockchain.</p><p>Traditional KYC practices require users to submit information which in turn is verified by a centralized registration authority. Decentralized identifiers do a similar job, with the difference that the user can control how much information they give out. Entities can then verify the information provided via a blockchain-based ledger to determine its authenticity.</p>The standard elements of a DID doc. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_identifier">Source</a>)<p>With DIDs, users can prove they are above a certain age limit, for instance, without disclosing their exact date of birth. Since users can create identifiers using trusted systems on the blockchain, private data exchange between individuals and businesses is possible. Thanks to this, traditional KYC/AML practices can give way to a more practical framework, where businesses can remain compliant with regulations and collect data without threatening privacy, data security, and breaching data laws.</p> Closing Thoughts <p>Most crypto users are increasingly concerned with identity verification or KYC procedures. However, most importantly, they are concerned with whatever happens to their data after it is collected. Especially when it comes to users’ sensitive data associated with their financial transactions, KYC procedures are being questioned by privacy and security advocates. </p><p>With cryptographic concepts like zero-knowledge proofs and decentralized identifiers (DID), individuals can pass KYC checks without giving out sensitive information and yet achieve regulatory compliance.</p><p>By leveraging zero-knowledge technology, banks, cryptocurrency exchanges, and other regulated institutions can access customer information without violating their privacy, prevent data breaches, and stay compliant with data protection laws — a win-win situation for everyone.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

<p>Privacy in DeFi is much needed. </p><p>In an ecosystem that grows bigger and more composable every day, the possibility for attackers to take advantage of blockchains' transparency to attack users increases. In contrast, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/miner-extractable-value-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly/">automatic MEV attacks</a> become more common by the day. If we want adoption to increase by orders of magnitude, users need to be guaranteed a base degree of privacy.</p><p>So, why has nobody succeeded (<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/privacy-finance-why-panther-is-different-and-necessary-e423b2993df9/">yet</a>) in providing a base level of privacy? In this article, based on <a href="https://twitter.com/anishmohammed">Anish Mohammed</a>'s (Panther Co-Founder, CTO, and Chief Scientist) <a href="https://youtu.be/_6O_C6fiuQg">talk at EthCC Paris 2022</a>, we'll look into:</p>  The economic challenges behind private DeFi.  How to price privacy correctly.  The adversarial games that keep the clock ticking for blockchain privacy.  What a solution to the current challenges might look like.  <p></p> Illustrating the base difficulties of privacy in DeFi <p>To understand why DeFi privacy is inherently challenging, let’s look at one of the most widespread, straightforward models –Automated Market Makers.</p><p>In an <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-an-automated-market-maker-amm">AMM</a>, there are two pools of assets, which users trade against. By withdrawing assets from one side of the pool and adding to the other, users drive price fluctuations for both assets, which stabilize the system through arbitrage opportunities.</p><p>Privacy for AMMs is difficult because obscuring balance and trade amounts from possible attackers is insufficient: by looking into on-chain data, it’s still possible to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.01193.pdf">reconstruct</a> the history of transactions.</p><p>To mitigate this, some proposed strategies include:</p>  Batching: It’s possible to merge a set of transactions into a batch. Rollups are essentially batching mechanisms with scalability and possibly privacy advantages.  <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html">ZK rollups</a>, which can provide privacy and batch transactions by default. In a batching scenario, an attacker doesn’t have information about individual transactions anymore, only about their average.  Adding randomness in price: Akin to a noise-generation function, adding an element of uncertainty —essentially an error margin— can increase privacy. This occurs on each block, as a random offset is added to the price the constant function would give based on the pool’s parameters. An attacker would be <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1101.pdf">no longer able</a> to estimate the pool’s balance or trade amounts from the price difference between two blocks. This solution's costs mainly affect liquidity providers, as the user exchanging assets would know the price before making the trade.  Differential privacy: <a href="https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~franklin/ecs289/2010/dwork_2008.pdf">Differential privacy,</a> similarly to added randomness, muffles information about individual transactions while guaranteeing that the general properties of the dataset are not changed. This could be applied to many parts of the DeFi algorithm, with one <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1101.pdf">implementation</a> already theorized. Large trades within a block could be broken down into smaller trades and reordered, maintaining the average impact and protecting a user against being front-run.  <p></p> Problems with batching (including batching in rollups) <p>One obvious issue with batching is that, by being unable to execute in real-time, DeFi users miss out on time-critical strategies, which become unfeasible with batching. In other words, in the time that it takes for a batch to gather all participants’ transactions, MEV attacks or other traders get a larger-than-usual window of opportunity.</p><p>Additionally, due to averages and the inability of traders to know the order of transactions in a batch, some participants will enjoy better prices than others. We can think of this as an associated inefficiency.</p>Graphical representation of the problem discussed above. While, on average, users within a rollup or batch cause the same overall impact on the system, their personal outcomes can be very unpredictable and vary wildly.<p></p> Problems with differential privacy in decentralized settings <p>Privacy under a decentralized setting has inherent cost disadvantages against privacy in centralized systems. It is harder to achieve privacy in decentralized systems because:</p>  Decentralized consensus has a cost. In a setting with no trusted parties, efforts need to be concentrated on making sure that the system is attack-proof. In other words, centralized systems only need to worry about executing a task and maintaining public trust, while decentralized systems have to bear the non-negligible cost of keeping decentralized.  Unlike what is usually believed, communication overhead can also have a significant cost, especially for time-critical applications. Decentralized consensus requires that all participants are informed of everything going on, while a centralized service provider simply keeps a single, efficient internal database. The former requires constant communication between hundreds or thousands of participants, while the latter is virtually free of that overhead. An aggravating factor is that, at times, communication costs <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.04234.pdf">do not rise linearly</a>; they worsen as the number of participants in a system increases.  <p>The above considerations create an economic dilemma: assuming either no regulatory requirements such as GDPR, or that their impact is negligible, the cost of maintaining a private system is higher than that of maintaining a system without privacy. Similarly, decentralized privacy is more expensive to achieve than centralized privacy, albeit a centrally-controlled private system creates obvious less-than-ideal power dynamics.</p><p>Adversarial dynamics can be seen in <a href="https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/ai/adversarial-machine-learning">technology</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08862">healthcare</a>, and other areas of daily life. Corporations that (advertently or otherwise) collect data from users <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/10/20/how-is-big-data-analytics-using-machine-learning/">get to benefit</a> from machine learning applications to improve their products and targeting.</p><p>Because of this, even in centralized competition, the honest competitor faces a disadvantage. However, there is a hope that, in a decentralized solution, the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ciocentral/2012/04/16/the-big-cost-of-big-data/">lack of overhead</a> and cost spread can drive the “privacy disadvantage” to be lower than the added costs of collecting and processing data.</p><p></p> The need to price privacy <p>To succeed, at least from an economic standpoint, a decentralized privacy system must:</p>  Spread its costs as much as possible. It’s possible that a decentralized private system will never be the cheapest option available, but the cost could become bearable enough for its advantages to beat the associated costs (e.g., if the cost would be $0.1 per transaction). Users need to bear these costs for the system to be truly decentralized.  Privacy comes in many layers. The costs of privacy will naturally be higher in extremely private applications. Nonetheless, each user’s risk tolerance will determine whether a weaker privacy solution is sufficient to shield them against their most likely attackers. Privacy tools should ideally be as flexible as possible to allow this privacy price discovery and maximize participation.  Derive its privacy from user-driven actions. Similar to how Bitcoin miners earn from verifying blocks, a decentralized ecosystem can reward users for participating in a protocol, which aids overall privacy. In this system, users being rewarded for “feeding” a privacy algorithm substitutes the need to add artificial randomness.  <p>In the condition set above, private system users “pay” for the rewards that the rest receive for creating the right conditions. As such, it’s even possible to devise a system in which there are several “tiers” of privacy, each with a separate cost, to create even more desirable conditions. This is illustrated in the table below, following the example of how data could be used to improve targeting and products:</p>While a “sweet spot” can be desirable for most, there are certainly cases in which a user may desire no privacy. Or, on the opposite, they might desire for their data to be fully scrapped of all utility to gain privacy.<p></p> A tool to solve seemingly contradicting needs <p>The privacy problem in DeFi presents the need for a tool that satisfies radically different –even contradictory– needs. </p><p>On the one hand, the radical transparency of Layer-1 blockchains has helped them arrive at their current growth stage in a decentralized fashion. On the other, privacy is the only way users can be fully safe utilizing them. </p><p>There is one way in which DeFi users can access total privacy that is fully compliant while retaining full control and ownership of their data. And as this technology and its game-theoretical design are no small feature, they are often referred to as moon math.</p><p></p> Introducing zero-knowledge proofs <p><a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Proof%20Systems/The_Knowledge_Complexity_Of_Interactive_Proof_Systems.pdf">First introduced in 1989</a>, zero-knowledge proofs are a relatively new concept in the context of mathematics, cryptography, and computer science. In the last decade, the advancements in this field have been numerous. These breakthroughs allowed many practical applications to be developed, especially in the cryptocurrency space.</p><p>For those not already familiar with the term, a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a proof for a statement that does not convey more knowledge than the mere fact that the statement is true. </p><p>Imagine magician A wants to prove to person B that A can leave a room without using the only door, but doesn’t want to reveal his secrets. A can simply ask to be let inside the room, for B to lock the door and keep an eye on it from outside, and then somehow A will appear outside the room. This proves the claim was correct, but no extra information about A’s methods was revealed: a zero-knowledge proof.</p><p></p> What are ZKPs good for? <p>Zero-knowledge proofs have been some of the most powerful tools to build crypto privacy solutions. Currently, they’re being utilized to scale blockchains by applying ZKPs to batch transactions off-chain, having privacy as an auspicious side-effect. Although, as we have seen, rollups create issues of their own.</p><p>The gains in scalability due to using rollups can be significant, as demonstrated by the table below:</p>Currently, ZK rollups are the scalability solution that affords the highest transaction output. (Source: <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html">vitalik.ca</a>)<p>The current applications for zero-knowledge proofs have just barely scratched the surface of what’s possible for them. As a general-purpose tool, ZKPs can be used in any situation that requires users to provide proof of status/ownership. They also enable them to prove the above without disclosing the underlying data, which from an economic and privacy perspective means that:</p>  DeFi users can be protected by default privacy (or access it in different layers) and then progressively pay for subsequent disclosures.  These solutions can be accessed in a scalable, more affordable manner.  A system with the right incentives can rely on ZKPs to create private batched transactions.  <p>It remains a matter of speculation what the creation of such a system can achieve in a real-world setting. However, if executed correctly, it could result in an end-to-end private experience of utilizing DeFi for users, as well as a mechanism to put a price on privacy organically.</p><p></p> Conclusion <p>As we have seen, there is no such thing as a free lunch when it comes to blockchain privacy.</p><p>Competing on price with centralized systems is non-trivial, as existing privacy-preserving tech applications are not efficient enough. Alternatives like zkSNARKs and scalability solutions, however, make it more likely that this problem can be solved when approached from the right angle.</p><p>In a race to the bottom between privacy-preserving and non-privacy-preserving solutions, incentives are key to making the former stand a chance against products that can grow and iterate faster, becoming stronger.</p><p>Along with incentives, a dynamic pricing of privacy is also vital. If users have incentives to pay extra for higher privacy (therefore incentivizing strategies that provide privacy to others), it’s possible to lower the price of privacy for all, making the system more robust and attractive.</p><p>We are at a breaking point for the development and application of ZKPs. The next few years will be key in determining how far privacy in DeFi goes when aided by them.</p><p></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

 Introducing Coinbase Security Prompt — a safer and easier way of signing into&nbsp;Coinbase <p>Siyu Liu, Senior Product Manager; Chetan Rane, Product&nbsp;Manager</p><p>Tl;Dr: We are excited to introduce the Coinbase Security Prompt: a faster and safer way for our users to verify their identity &amp; activities when interacting with the Coinbase ecosystem.</p><p>At Coinbase, we believe that our users need to have access to the best security possible without sacrificing ease and convenience. Providing a safe, secure, and easy-to-use platform that users trust is our continuous commitment to all of our current and future customers. That’s why, we require all Coinbase accounts to use 2-Factor Authentication (2FA). 2FA is a security layer on top of username and password. Accounts with 2FA enabled require users to provide their password (first “factor”) and a 2FA code (second “factor”) when signing in. While Coinbase offers both hardware key and authenticator app support on both web and mobile for 2FA, many customers appreciate the convenience of&nbsp;SMS.</p><p>Thinking about that, we’re now going one step further in keeping our users’ accounts secure via Coinbase Security Prompt, a simpler, faster and safer 2FA method that improves overall account security. How? Instead of sending an SMS code, the new Coinbase Security Prompt sends users a push notification to their Coinbase mobile app, asking if they are trying to sign in. Now with Coinbase Security Prompts, users can authenticate a login action with a simple tap on their&nbsp;phone:</p><p>Our customers will automatically have a stronger security without losing the ease and convenience of using their phones, from anywhere. Security Prompt is resilient against <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hL_uMHnb7GQ&amp;list=PL0zEUTVaoPOzxJvrFFNwpNyCoi_M-k3DE&amp;index=5">SIM Swap </a>attacks by removing the mobile carrier as an intermediary from the authentication process. It also reduces the risk of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHnaz-qWvJs&amp;list=PL0zEUTVaoPOzxJvrFFNwpNyCoi_M-k3DE&amp;index=3">phishing attacks</a> by providing detailed information about where the request is coming from, such as the location or browser&nbsp;type.</p><p>Starting in July through the rest of 2022, all of our eligible* users will gradually start to be automatically enrolled to complete their 2FA via Security Prompts. Users who are still receiving SMS codes as their 2FA method can get access to Coinbase Security Prompts by <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/other/what-mobile-devices-does-coinbase-support">downloading the Coinbase&nbsp;app</a>.</p><p>*Eligible users are those who have an active mobile login session, trying to login from a second device and are using our latest Coinbase app&nbsp;version.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/introducing-coinbase-security-prompt-a-safer-and-easier-way-of-signing-into-coinbase-502d7b377c64">Introducing Coinbase Security Prompt — a safer and easier way of signing into Coinbase</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com">The Coinbase Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

         New Partnership: From Spring Reflections to Summer Health            <p>Ellen and her team are making health care accessible with one simple text.</p>  <p>By Alfred Lin</p><p>Published July 25, 2022</p>       



      Alfred and Ellen at Sequoia Base Camp.      



 
 
   
<p>We had heard about a young powerhouse executive at Hims &amp; Hers, but we didn’t get to meet Ellen DaSilva until April 2020. Our originally scheduled coffee meeting, planned to discuss her potentially joining Sequoia’s Scout program, moved to Zoom in the midst of the chaos and lockdowns of COVID. It would have been understandable if she had canceled or postponed. It also would have been understandable if the tone of the meeting was pessimistic, awkward or dark. But that wouldn’t be Ellen. Even with a bunch of curve balls thrown at her, her effervescence came through Zoom. She spoke with enthusiasm for consumer health businesses and clearly believed people were being underserved by most current options. We were blown away by her clarity of thought, and invited her to be a Scout.</p>



<p>A year later, Ellen and her husband welcomed their second child. A casual reach out to send warm wishes to her and her family led to a mutual gripe session over Zoom about our health system, and in particular, pediatrics. As a mother, Ellen has spent hours at urgent care and waiting by the phone for her primary pediatrician’s office to call her back for a quick consult. Again, it would have been understandable for her to feel dejected—but that wouldn’t be Ellen. All she saw was opportunity.</p>



<p>Ellen observed, researched and asked, “Why?” During that brief conversation with her, we learned that the average American waits more than two hours at the emergency room, and—as Ellen had recently experienced firsthand—two weeks to see their primary doctor. Particularly for families with young children, the time adds up quickly: the average parent accesses their pediatrician an average of <a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/health-management/Pages/Well-Child-Care-A-Check-Up-for-Success.aspx">10 times per year in the first two years of their child’s life, and 4 times per year thereafter</a>. As she dug into these stats and more, Ellen was full of enthusiasm about finding a better solution.</p>



<p>After those spring reflections in 2021, Ellen continued to learn more about our health system from both parents’ and pediatricians’ perspectives, speaking to as many people from each group as she could find. By summer, she was asking herself two questions: Was she ready to dedicate her life to helping people access care, perhaps starting with pediatrics? And if so, how could she best accomplish her mission? These were the musings of Ellen DaSilva on maternity leave.</p>



<p>Fall was back to work at Hims &amp; Hers, an organization where she had started as employee #8 and helped it grow into a public company. At first, she was glad to be back, seeing familiar faces and getting some professional​​—and adult—interactions. (We all love our kids, but they drive us nuts, too.) While it was energizing to reunite with friends and colleagues, the same nagging question kept popping up in Ellen’s mind. How can we radically simplify access to pediatrics care?</p>



<p>As the cold November winds settled into NYC, Ellen asked herself what she would regret more: Pursuing that dream and striking out, or continuing her steady climb in the world of major public healthcare companies but never taking a swing? Founding moments start with the daring to overcome your fears—and Ellen knew she would regret not trying far more.</p>



<p>After telling her family and friends around Thanksgiving, Founder Ellen incorporated Summer Health in December 2021, and Sequoia was fortunate enough to become the company’s first outside shareholder. With that initial check of $1M, Ellen built out the alpha version of her product to test her hypotheses, recruited co-founder Matthew Woo and a small crackerjack team of seven, and rebuilt and launched the beta product while onboarding the first parents and pediatricians. Just more than six months in, families in all 50​​ states are now able to connect with a Summer Health provider via a simple text message—and get treatment, prescriptions, referrals and more in just 15 minutes. This velocity in execution speaks for itself, both for Ellen as a highly effective founder and for Summer Health as a highly compelling offering that’s instantly seen clinical and customer demand.</p>



<p>Today, we are thrilled to <a href="https://www.summerhealth.com/">make the product available to everyone through the public beta</a> and announce that Summer Health has raised $7.5M in total seed funding, co-led by Sequoia Capital and Lux Capital. But while this is a milestone worth celebrating, we are most excited to see how Ellen and her team will continue working toward a universally powerful mission: to radically simplify access to care.</p>

<p>Tl;dr: Search engine phishing exploits the trust we have in search engines and the convenience of searching for something rather than remembering the domain. The following piece outlines what search engine phishing attacks may look like and how Coinbase users can avoid&nbsp;them.</p><p>By Coinbase Security&nbsp;Team</p><p>How do you log in to Coinbase? If you’re like many people, you open your preferred browser and type “Coinbase” or “Coinbase login” in the address bar. You expect to get results like&nbsp;this:</p><p>But sometimes you may get results like&nbsp;this:</p><p>The second set of screenshots show an example of phishing links. This is called search engine phishing and it has become a trend for attackers targeting Coinbase accounts.</p><p>When most people think of phishing, email or SMS phishing comes to mind. However, phishing can take many forms. Search engine phishing exploits the trust we have in search engines and the convenience of searching for something rather than remembering the&nbsp;domain.</p><p>We all do it, but this opens us up to potential search engine phishing attacks if we are not diligent about checking our links and protecting ourselves online. Here are some tips to prevent this from happening to&nbsp;you:</p> Double-check our naming conventions <p>Coinbase uses a uniform naming convention for our websites and pages. The convention follows this pattern: [page].coinbase.com. For example, here are some of our&nbsp;pages:</p><p>One way to avoid this type of scam is to bookmark the above Coinbase pages that you frequent. Bookmarking removes the need to search for, or manually type, a domain name. Here is a quick <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/bookmark-all-tabs-chrome-firefox-edge-brave-safari/">tutorial</a> on how to create bookmarks in the most popular browsers.</p> Know common scam naming conventions <p>It takes a good amount of work for anyone to get their website ranked high in search engine results. This is called Search Engine Optimization (SEO), which is the process of improving the traffic from search engines to a website. Some website services, including Google Sites and Microsoft Azure, offer built-in SEO functionality.</p><p>As seen in the screenshots above, attackers tend to exploit website services like Google Sites and Microsoft Azure — building a false sense of trust in the phishing link.. The naming conventions might follow a pattern like one of the following:</p><p>sites.google.com/[phishingpage].com<br> [phishingpage].azurewebsites.net</p><p>These phishing websites will typically then redirect to another phishing page after a victim clicks a button on the site. The redirect will take the victim to a second phishing page where the actual phishing attack happens. Using a second phishing site is a way for attackers to protect the first phishing site and maintain its SEO ranking. So, be aware of redirects as an indication that you may be visiting a phishing website. A typical flow may look like&nbsp;this:</p> Look for these red&nbsp;flags <p>Here are some indicators you can look for to protect yourself from search engine phishing:</p>  Does the naming convention of the search result follow this pattern: [page].coinbase.com? If not, it is likely a phishing&nbsp;page.  When you click on a search result, are you redirected to a website with a different domain than what you expected? If so, it is likely a phishing&nbsp;page.  When you click on a search result, does the website look different than the last time you logged in to Coinbase? If so, this could be a phishing page which is using an older version of our website&nbsp;theme.  When you visit the website from the search results and click on a button, are you redirected to a website with a different domain than the first page? If so, it is likely a phishing&nbsp;page.  After you enter your credentials, are you prompted to call Coinbase because of some sort of error? Does a live chat box automatically open? This tactic is commonly paired with phishing attacks and is known as a “support scam”&nbsp;attack.  <p>Here is an example of what a scam error may look like and a live chat box which may follow the&nbsp;error:</p><p>Remember, think before you click!

     The Cobalt wallet is Horizen’s new web extension wallet that enables you to create, receive, and send tokens on TokenMint!&nbsp; 
<p>In this guide, we show you how to send ZEN to your Cobalt wallet to process your transactions and create your own tokens. ZEN is used as gas for TokenMint transactions.</p>
 About TokenMint 
<p>The TokenMint platform is designed to provide a seamless, simple, and intuitive user experience. In the alpha version, there are four components available to launch your token:</p>
 
 TokenMint Chain – a sidechain built on the Horizen network 
 <a href="https://tokenmint.global/">Token Generator</a>&nbsp;– a web app that allows a streamlined and easy process for anyone to create and mint a fungible token with custom tokenomics. 
 <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Cobalt wallet</a>&nbsp;– a web browser extension wallet that stores and manages tokens created on TokenMint 
 <a href="https://explorer.tokenmint.global/">TokenMint Block explorer</a>&nbsp;– a block explorer that tracks and displays all transactions on the TokenMint Chain.&nbsp; 
 
 Send ZEN to a Cobalt wallet 
<p>When sending ZEN from your Sphere wallet to a Cobalt wallet, you are actually sending a transaction to a sidechain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before you begin the send transaction, make sure that you have the Cobalt wallet’s address to send ZEN and the password to confirm the transaction.</p>
<p>Perform the following steps:</p>
<p>1. In your Sphere Wallet, click on the wallet you wish to send ZEN from.</p>
<p>2. Select the appropriate address by clicking on the info icon to copy it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are two icons: one to Receive and the other to Send.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Click the Send icon. (Red Up Arrow) The Send page appears.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. Make sure that the Sidechain transaction toggle is enabled, which displays the Sidechain field.</p>
<p>5. In the Sidechain field, use the pull-down menu to select the appropriate sidechain.</p>
<p>6. In the Send to field, paste the Cobalt wallet’s address.</p>
<p>7. In the Amount field, enter the amount of ZEN you want to send.</p>
<p>8. In the Transaction Fee pane, the Standard radio button is enabled by default. Click Custom if you want to specify a custom fee.</p>
<p>9. Optionally, in the Description field, enter a brief statement about this transaction.</p>
<p>10. Click Confirm. Then enter the wallet password to confirm the field appears.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note: If you enter the wrong password, an error message will appear.</p>
<p>11. Enter your Sphere wallet password. The Send page displays a success notification.</p>
<p></p>
<p>12. Click View on Blockchain to verify that the transaction is successful. The <a href="https://explorer.zensystem.io/">Block Explorer</a> webpage appears.</p>
<p>13. Click the Search button on the top of the page using the search criteria of address, transaction, or blocks if your transaction is not displayed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>14. Check the Cobalt wallet for the newly received transaction. You should see a transaction of received ZEN from Horizen mainchain.</p>

     TokenMint makes tokenization streamlined and accessible to everyone. Anyone can create their own token now! 
<p>TokenMint is a platform that allows anyone to easily and quickly create a token with custom tokenomics. No programming knowledge is needed for creating a token using TokenMint. The alpha version of the TokenMint platform offers the basics for creating a fungible token.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 About TokenMint 
<p>The TokenMint platform is designed to provide a seamless, simple, and intuitive user experience. In the alpha version, there are four components available to launch your token:</p>
 
 TokenMint Chain – a sidechain built on the Horizen network 
 <a href="https://tokenmint.global/">Token Generator</a> – a web app that allows a streamlined and easy process for anyone to create and mint a fungible token with custom tokenomics. 
 <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Cobalt wallet</a> – a web browser extension wallet that stores and manages tokens created on TokenMint 
 <a href="https://explorer.tokenmint.global/">TokenMint Block explorer</a> – a block explorer that tracks and displays all transactions on the TokenMint Chain.&nbsp; 
 
 How to Use Token Generator to Create a Token 
<p>To begin the process of creating a token, you MUST:</p>
 
 <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt-by-horizen/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Install the latest version of Cobalt wallet</a>, or you will not be able to use the token generator 
 Have <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/cobalt-wallet-user-guide-2/">ZEN in your Cobalt wallet</a>, or you will not be able to connect your wallet to the TokenMint website.&nbsp; 
 
<p>The TokenMint token generator is very easy to use.&nbsp; Simply head to the <a href="https://tokenmint.global/">TokenMint website</a> and follow these easy steps:&nbsp;</p>
<p>STEP 1. Launch the token generator from the <a href="https://tokenmint.global/">TokenMint website</a> by clicking Launch The App.</p>
<p></p>
<p>STEP 2. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt-by-horizen/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Download the latest Cobalt wallet</a> and connect your Cobalt wallet.</p>
<p>You must install the latest Cobalt wallet. Otherwise, the token generator won’t connect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have previously installed a Cobalt wallet, make sure you update the extension from your web browser settings menu. Please follow<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/cobalt-wallet-user-guide-2/"> this guide</a> if you need help.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You must have sufficient ZEN in your Cobalt wallet to pay for network fees. <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/cobalt-wallet-user-guide-2/">Follow this guide if you need help to know how to send ZEN to Cobalt</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>STEP 3. Once your wallet is connected, click Create a token and follow the steps shown on the app to create your token.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>STEP 4. After you create your token, you will be able to see your token in your Cobalt wallet and the <a href="https://explorer.tokenmint.global/">TokenMint block explorer</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p>You can now find your tokens on the TokenMint site. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Step 5. Mint your token! After your token is created, you will need to mint your token to the wallet of your choice. To begin, select Mint token. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Step 6. On the Mint token page, enter the desired amount of your token to mint and the wallet address you would like to mint to then select Confirm. Minting tokens currently cost 1 ZEN. The transaction can take up to 5 minutes to complete the minting of your token.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once the confirmation is complete, you will receive the identified quantity of tokens to your designated wallet and you are ready to send your tokens to the world!</p>

<p>By Paul Grewal, Chief Legal&nbsp;Officer</p><p>Tl;dr: Coinbase does not list securities on its platform. Period.</p><p>We have said it before, but given today’s events, it bears repeating.</p><p>Earlier today, following a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/three-charged-first-ever-cryptocurrency-insider-trading-tipping-scheme">Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation</a> into a former Coinbase employee’s misuse of confidential Coinbase information related to listing decisions, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) separately filed securities fraud charges against this individual related to this wrongdoing. The SEC alleges that nine digital assets involved are securities. The DOJ reviewed the same facts and chose not to file securities fraud charges against those involved. As CFTC Commissioner <a href="https://twitter.com/CarolineDPham/status/1550159347984044033?s=20&amp;t=9wle9vvn1J7GoZYs39fOug">Caroline Pham</a> stated, this is “a striking example of ‘regulation by enforcement’” by the&nbsp;SEC.</p><p>We agree with Commissioner Pham and, respectfully, 100% disagree with the SEC’s decision to file these securities fraud charges and the substance of the charges themselves. Let me explain&nbsp;why.</p><p>Seven of the nine assets included in the SEC’s charges are listed on Coinbase’s platform. None of these assets are securities. Coinbase has a rigorous process to analyze and review each digital asset before making it available on our exchange — a process that the SEC itself has reviewed. This process includes an analysis of whether the asset could be considered to be a <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/privacy-and-security/other/asset-legal-review">security</a>, and also considers regulatory compliance and <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/privacy-and-security/other/asset-security-review">information security</a> aspects of the asset. To be explicit, the majority of assets that we review are not ultimately listed on Coinbase.</p><p>We cooperated with the SEC’s investigation into the wrongdoing charged by the DOJ today. But instead of having a dialogue with us about the seven assets on our platform, the SEC jumped directly to litigation. The SEC’s charges put a spotlight on an important problem: the US doesn’t have a clear or workable regulatory framework for digital asset securities. And instead of crafting tailored rules in an inclusive and transparent way, the SEC is relying on these types of one-off enforcement actions to try to bring all digital assets into its jurisdiction, even those assets that are not securities.</p><p>Just this morning (and with no prior knowledge of the timing of the charges discussed), Coinbase filed a <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/the-crypto-securities-market-is-waiting-to-be-unlocked-but-first-we-need-workable-rules-c0ba63eabab3?source=collection_home---5------0-----------------------">petition for rule making</a> with the SEC calling for actual rule making so the crypto securities market has a chance to develop. We worry that today’s charges suggest the SEC has little interest in this most fundamental role of regulators.</p><p>But in the absence of a concrete digital asset securities regulatory framework from the SEC, we remain confident that Coinbase’s rigorous review process keeps securities off Coinbase’s platform. We remain eager to share our perspective with the SEC, especially through a formal rule-making process desperately needed.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-does-not-list-securities-end-of-story-e58dc873be79">Coinbase does not list securities.

<p>TL;DR:</p>  Coinbase filed a petition asking the SEC to begin rulemaking on digital asset securities.  The existing rules for securities just do not work for digital&nbsp;assets.  Our petition calls on the SEC to develop a workable regulatory framework for digital asset securities guided by formal procedures and a public notice-and-comment process, rather than through arbitrary enforcement or guidance developed behind closed&nbsp;doors.  <p>By Faryar Shirzad, Chief Policy&nbsp;Officer</p><p>Today, there is a robust crypto market in the U.S. That market includes thousands of different digital assets, crypto companies, and decentralized financial products, and is regulated at every level of government, including by multiple federal agencies in the United States. Yet despite the growth that has happened in recent years, close examination reveals a glaring deficiency in this market. Even with billions of dollars invested toward crypto innovation, and the passage of more than 13 years since the introduction of Bitcoin, there is still no meaningful crypto securities market in the United&nbsp;States.</p><p>Many factors can positively influence how a given market develops, but when it comes to crypto securities there is a significant, foundational hurdle that has prevented that market from maturing. That hurdle is the fact that the securities rules simply do not work for digitally native instruments. They don’t work for tokenized debt. They don’t work for tokenized equity. They don’t work for crypto. And that’s a major&nbsp;problem.</p><p>The consequence is that the United States is falling behind in digital asset innovation. Most of the digital assets traded today have the characteristics of commodities, and in many instances, were specifically designed to avoid the securities laws. In other words, as the crypto market develops, it is deliberately steering clear of the securities market — one of the principal financial markets in the United States. At Coinbase, we believe that digital asset innovation offers a number of profound, market-enhancing benefits — like real time settlement, the ability to trade safely without needing to go through costly intermediaries, and a transparent record of all transactions. But the full weight of those benefits will not come to pass if they are excluded from a market as big and impactful as the securities market.</p><p>Crypto assets that are securities need an updated rulebook to help guide safe and efficient practices. Crypto assets that are not securities need the certainty of being outside those rules. Anything short of that will have the effect of entrenching incumbent technologies at the expense of innovation and ultimately, consumers. That’s why we have submitted a <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/c5bd0wqjc7v0/5NRidtW8lvwVEfSHpndWQm/78f95afa4f0ebaaefb303e1a4f172d03/Coinbase_petition_for_SEC_rulemaking.pdf">petition</a> to the SEC to request that it develop rules that work for digital asset securities. Here’s a little more on the problem as we see it, and how we hope to work toward a solution:</p><p>The Problem</p><p>Modern securities law was put into place by the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The most well-known securities are stocks and bonds, but most other assets that are considered securities are classified as such because they are “investment contracts” or “notes.” The Supreme Court set forth how to determine whether an asset is an investment contract or note in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. and Reves v. Ernst &amp; Young. The former case created a test for determining whether an asset is an investment contract; the latter created a test for determining whether an asset is a note. These tests play a large role today in evaluating whether a crypto asset is a security.</p><p>It is often difficult to determine what a jurist was thinking when they drafted a given piece of law, but I think it is reasonable to assume that none of the authors who drafted these securities statutes from the 1930’s, or the subsequent Supreme Court tests interpreting those statutes, did so while thinking of a day when a decentralized, cryptographically-based, automated financial instrument would be adopted en masse by millions of people in the United States and around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Put simply — when these authors were writing rules to regulate square pegs, they did not account for how those rules would impact the unpredictable round holes of the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Securities law is thus not well-suited to govern digital assets. Attempted application of such ill-fitting laws to crypto creates a number of problems, including:</p>  Lack of regulation for the subset of crypto assets that are securities;  So many different steps and intermediaries that there is no way trades can settle in real&nbsp;time;  It is effectively impossible for individual investors to trade directly, without using a broker;&nbsp;and  Blockchain technology is not able, under the current rules, to be used as a reliable record of transactions, even though this is the innovation that makes distributed ledger technology so powerful.  <p>The SEC has thus far been unwilling to write new rules for crypto securities. Instead, the Commission recently announced that it will double the size of the enforcement unit that handles crypto and cyber cases. This enforcement-first approach has stifled development of the crypto securities market and prevents entrepreneurs from using crypto to raise money for their companies. It also prevents investors from using crypto to invest in those ventures.</p><p>Perhaps worst of all, the SEC’s approach has created enormous risk for investors. We saw this in vivid detail when the Commission brought an enforcement action against Ripple, after years of taking no action against them, claiming that XRP is a security. The value of XRP dropped immediately, costing investors huge sums of money. The XRP case is especially notable because there was disagreement even within the federal government about whether XRP was a security or not: FinCEN had determined it was not a security, and then the SEC said that it&nbsp;was.</p><p>If the SEC were to write rules permitting the tokenization of securities, the opportunities for innovation would be significant. The crypto markets could be expanded to offer crypto securities, subject to SEC regulation and governance, thereby giving investors new ways to invest in crypto. And opening debt and equity securities to tokenization would promote efficiency and resiliency in traditional markets.</p><p>But the SEC has not done&nbsp;this.</p><p>While the SEC has refused to develop new rules for digital asset securities, several governments and other organizations around the world are well on their way to new, workable crypto rules. The list is significant, and includes the European Union, United Kingdom, Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, and Brazil. Action taken last month by the EU on their Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, for example, demonstrates the world’s largest economy — made up of 27 different countries — putting in place a clear, comprehensive set of rules for&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>We believe the SEC should follow the lead of these jurisdictions by helping to develop a robust and vibrant crypto securities market, with all of the excellent protections that investors have come to expect from American financial markets. That is why we filed our petition with the SEC that requests such a rulemaking to take&nbsp;place.</p><p>Coming Up With a&nbsp;Solution</p><p>With this petition, we are asking the SEC to start a process where the public and key stakeholders can transparently provide input into the agency’s work on crypto. We also hope the petition will launch a broader conversation where members of Congress — many of whom also see the need for the regulations to evolve — will provide their views. Doing this right will help to avoid one-off, arbitrary decisions that provide little clarity or guidance to the industry, and will instead result in a clear set of comprehensive rules, much like important jurisdictions around the world are working&nbsp;toward.</p><p>Coming up with such comprehensive rules will require a genuine examination of how crypto works differently from traditional financial securities and what provisions would actually protect investors who trade in crypto securities.</p><p>That examination should look at current crypto trading. Crypto trades differently from securities in a number of ways, and these differences must be weighed when writing rules for crypto securities. Consider:</p>  Traditional financial exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ have set trading hours, but crypto trades 24/7/365.  While traditional financial exchanges require that investors trade through the services of a broker, crypto lets you buy, sell, and trade assets directly, without going through an intermediary.  Finally, traditional securities exchanges only trade securities; they do not trade commodities or any other type of assets. Crypto investors seek to trade across types of tokens — buying stablecoins to store value, and then buying other crypto with those stablecoins, for example — all on one platform. This kind of trading is not recognized under existing rules for securities exchanges, but could offer tremendous capital efficiency gains.  <p>Another way crypto is different from stock exchanges has to do with custody — or how securities have to be held and kept safe by brokers and exchanges.</p><p>Traditional securities transactions are permitted up to two days to settle. This delay is designed to accommodate trades going through a number of intermediaries before the securities are finally in the hands of the buyer, and the cash with the seller. Using existing technology, these intermediaries are needed to help make sure a trade goes through as promised. The buyer must actually pay the money, the seller must actually give up the assets, the trade must be properly recorded, and there must not be any errors or unauthorized actions. The broker also has to hold the securities in a certain way to ensure that it has “possession” and “control” over the assets. These rules ensure that the broker keeps the customer assets safely, and also ensures that the broker completes customer trades appropriately.</p><p>This system of intermediaries, and the specific custody rules governing them, fail to leverage the benefit of blockchain technology and do not work for&nbsp;crypto:</p>  First, crypto investors expect trades to happen within seconds — one of the key innovations of crypto. But the current rules have too many steps to allow for immediate settlement.  Second, in order for trades to happen that fast, the securities and the money have to be held by the exchange so the exchange can effect the transaction as soon as it happens. But a crypto exchange cannot custody assets the same way that a broker can and still effect an immediate trade.  Finally, the rules for how to keep assets safe — to show possession and control — are based on how you would keep a stock or bond safe, not how you might hold a private key for crypto securities.  <p>Let’s Work Together on This&nbsp;Solution</p><p>Coinbase believes that effective regulation benefits everyone — buyers, sellers, exchanges, and the U.S. financial system. The SEC has a long history of creating and enforcing regulations that have enabled the development of deep, liquid, and transparent capital markets in the U.S. These markets have, in turn, fueled incredible innovation and helped entrepreneurs build companies that have transformed the lives of billions of&nbsp;people.</p><p>Thankfully, the SEC won’t have to start from scratch when figuring out how to move forward. We laid out the questions that we think the Commission should be asking stakeholders and itself in determining the right path forward — our petition was written with the input of some of the best securities lawyers and economists in the country. If the Commission starts an open process where all of us can provide input, we look forward to sharing our thoughts on how to answer the important questions our petition raises, and we would encourage others to do the same. We may not agree every step of the way, but it’s critical that this is an open and transparent process, where the public has a chance to offer their views. Policymaking at this level is far too important to be made in a black&nbsp;box.</p><p>Crypto represents the next wave of innovation within the markets themselves — and whatever country encourages that innovation while also keeping investors safe will reap enormous benefits. We need the SEC to once again write the rules that will unleash the potential of U.S. capital markets, this time fueled by the benefits provided by&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>If they don’t, others will — and the U.S. may not be able to catch&nbsp;up.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/the-crypto-securities-market-is-waiting-to-be-unlocked-but-first-we-need-workable-rules-c0ba63eabab3">The Crypto Securities Market is Waiting to be Unlocked.

 Coinbase Ventures Q2 recap and market&nbsp;outlook <p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/aroundtheblock/home">Around the Block</a> sheds light on key trends in crypto. Written by <a href="https://twitter.com/Cdempsey44">Connor Dempsey</a>, sourced from the work and insights from the entire team at Coinbase Ventures &amp; Corp&nbsp;Dev</p><p>TLDR:</p>  Coinbase Ventures deal activity reflected the overall pace of the venture landscape, down 34% QoQ. Activity remained up 68% YoY, reflecting the steady growth of our venture practice over the past&nbsp;year  Among the key trends observed, we believe that Web3 gaming will onboard the next massive wave of crypto users, with experienced founders from Web2 gaming continuing to pour into the&nbsp;space  We’re excited about Web3 user applications working to upend the captive models of Web2 and give users control over their audiences and communities  The Solana ecosystem continues to show impressive momentum and developer traction  Massive UX improvements are coming to crypto that will obfuscate away complexity and deliver experiences on par with&nbsp;Web2  The United States continues to be home to the bulk of companies in our portfolio, with Singapore, UK, Germany, and India all establishing impressive innovation hubs  Where CeFi lenders faltered this year, DeFi lending platforms were resilient  Current price action aside, we remain convinced that the opportunity within crypto and Web3 are far greater than most&nbsp;realize.  <p>The first half of 2022 was turbulent for all markets. The Dow and S&amp;P had their worst first halves since 1962 and 1970. The NASDAQ had its worst quarter since 2008. Bitcoin had its worst quarter since 2011, DeFi TVL ended down 70% from its high, and June NFT sales slumped to levels not seen in a&nbsp;year.</p><p>A core part of the crypto market chaos stemmed from the collapse of the $60B Terra ecosystem in May. This contributed to the implosion of a $10B crypto fund (Three Arrows Capital) that had leveraged exposure to Terra along with a few other trades that moved against them (GBTC, stETH). Next, it was revealed that Three Arrows Capital had borrowed heavily from some of the largest centralized lenders in crypto. Unable to recoup these loans, several of these lenders were forced into bankruptcy.</p><p>The <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/the-crypto-market-downturn-explained-a-macro-outlook-bfbeddf69d44">macro market downturn</a> seeped into the venture landscape as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Venture landscape</p><p>The broader venture market began to show signs of cooling <a href="https://twitter.com/Cdempsey44/status/1517237072469405701?s=20&amp;t=dkXRFii5OBr6CjdU8p2m8g">in Q1</a>, with total funding dropping for the first time since Q2 2019. That trend continued in Q2, with total venture funding <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q2-2022/?utm_campaign=marketing_state-venture_2022-07&amp;utm_content=214755164&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;hss_channel=tw-110171914">dropping 23%</a>, marking the largest dip in a decade. The quarter also saw later stage companies like<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/01/fintech-klarna-reportedly-raising-at-a-6-5b-valuation-giving-new-meaning-to-the-phrase-down-round/"> Klarna raising down rounds</a>; a further sign of the&nbsp;times.</p><p>Crypto venture funding still saw a record Q1, but as we wrote in our <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-ventures-q1-recap-and-market-outlook-f84488b25ae9">last letter</a>, we’d already begun seeing signs of a slowdown that we expected to surface in Q2. Sure enough, <a href="https://twitter.com/dantwany/status/1547612614540214272?s=20&amp;t=c-uEcsziW2S4C94BKM7P_Q">data from John Dantoni at The Block</a> showed that crypto venture funding dollars decreased 22%: the first down quarter in two&nbsp;years.</p><p>In Q2, Coinbase Ventures continued to rank among the <a href="https://www.theblockresearch.com/an-overview-of-the-most-active-blockchain-investors-in-q222-157820">most active investors in crypto</a>, but also saw deal place slow, with the total count decreasing 34% QoQ, from 71 to 47. Despite the slowdown compared to the fervent pace of late 21 and Q1 22, our Q2 activity still increased 68% YoY; indicative of the overall growth of our venture practice.</p><p>The decline largely reflected the overall market conditions — with volatility in the markets, we saw many founders rethink or put their rounds on pause, particularly at the later stages. We’re seeing that many companies are foregoing a fundraise unless absolutely necessary, and even then, only if they feel confident that they can show the growth needed to justify a new&nbsp;round.</p><p>Gloomy macro environment aside, there are still plenty of high quality founders raising at the seed stage, where we’re most active. Looking beyond the price action at the areas that we invested in shows the range of real utility that’s continuing to be built and paints a promising picture of the future: one with a vibrant array of Web3 user applications, improved UX, robust DeFi markets, scalable L1/L2 ecosystems, and all of the tools developers need to build the next killer&nbsp;app.</p><p>Here’s how our activity broke down over&nbsp;Q2.</p><p>Now, let’s look at some themes that stood out. (* denotes Coinbase Ventures portfolio company)</p><p>The coming era of blockchain gaming</p><p>With the meteoric rise and subsequent fall of Axie Infinity activity, many pundits have been gleefully quick to dismiss blockchain gaming as a passing fad. As we wrote in <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/axie-infinity-yield-guild-games-the-play-to-earn-economy-e73ac6b39e6c">September</a>, Axie was experiencing a positive feedback loop that could turn negative should the fervor driving the game die down, which is ultimately what happened. Regardless, Axie posted nearly $1B in sales in a single month and attracted 2M DAUs with essentially zero marketing budget. This put the entire gaming world on notice to the power of this new vertical.</p><p>With an estimated <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/293304/number-video-gamers/">3.2B+ gamers</a> in the world, we strongly believe that Web3 gaming will onboard the next massive wave of crypto users. Web3 gaming remained a sector of heavy investment in Q2, with The Block estimating that <a href="https://twitter.com/dantwany/status/1547612614540214272?s=20&amp;t=c-uEcsziW2S4C94BKM7P_Q">$2.6B+</a> was raised. Our activity over the last few quarters only strengthens our conviction.</p><p>As we saw in Q1, founders with strong track records in Web2 gaming continue to embrace this category. For example, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220519005264/en/Founded-by-Game-Industry-Vets-Azra-Games-Raises-15M-in-Seed-Round-Led-by-Andreessen-Horowitz-NFX-to-Unlock-the-Power-of-web3-for-Mainstream-Games">Azra games</a>*, was founded by the creators of the $1.4B+ mobile blockbuster <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/news/77482/star-wars-galaxy-of-heroes-14-billion-dollars-100-million-downloads/">Star Wars Galaxy Heroes</a>. Their goal is to build a combat RPG game with a robust in-game economy that can still garner mainstream appeal. The space has also attracted Justin Kan, co-founder of the game streaming platform Twitch, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/25/amazon-will-buy-twitch-for-over-1-billion/">sold to Amazon for $1B</a>. Kan’s new company, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/04/01/justin-kans-fractal-raises-35m-for-game-focused-nft-marketplace/">Fractal</a>*, is building a marketplace for NFT gaming&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Companies like <a href="https://www.venly.io/post/venly-raises-21-million-euros-in-series-a-to-bring-more-users-into-web3">Venly</a>* will add fuel to the fire with a suite of tools that let Web2 game developers seamlessly make the leap into Web3. Established gaming powerhouses are even starting to come around, with Fortnite creator Epic Games now allowing <a href="https://blockworks.co/web3-watch-epic-games-store-adds-first-nft-game-binance-sponsors-the-weeknd-tour/">NFT based games</a> into its game&nbsp;store.</p><p>It will take some time for this sector to mature, but it’s growing increasingly clear that blockchain gaming will be a massive category in the future. Expect an increased focus on sustainable economics and gameplay that infuses NFTs with more familiar Web2 gaming experiences.</p><p>Rewiring Web2</p><p>Beyond gaming, the next generation of Web3 user applications are working to upend the captive models of Web2 and to give users control over their audiences and communities. One company we’re particularly excited about is <a href="https://www.farcaster.xyz/">Farcaster</a>*: a sufficiently decentralized social network founded by Coinbase alumns <a href="https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1546887156198649857?s=20&amp;t=z2cDrkt5nR_x35yyQ4r6Ew">Dan Romero</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/varunsrin">Varun Srinivasan</a>. Their early product resembles Twitter, but with the key difference of letting users own the relationship with their audiences.</p><p>Farcaster is an open protocol, similar to email (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol">SMTP</a>). While Farcaster has built the first social app on the protocol, other developers can build competing clients, just like we have Gmail and Apple iCloud. While you can’t take your Twitter followers with you to TikTok, someone could build a TikTok equivalent on the Farcaster protocol, and Farcaster users can take their followers with them to a new, differentiated platform. Not only can users maintain better ownership of their audience, but it also opens the door for more aligned monetization. Where most advertising spend goes directly to Twitter, Instagram, etc, Farcaster users with large followings can monetize their audiences directly across platforms.</p><p>Another investment we’re excited about is <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/10/katie-hauns-firm-leads-11m-round-for-web-3-community-platform-highlight/">Highlight.xyz</a>*, which sits at the burgeoning intersection of Web3 and music. Highlight will let musicians create their own web3-enabled fanclubs / communities (no coding necessary), complete with token gating, access to NFT airdrops, merchandise and more. Highlight joins other CBV portcos like Audius*, Sound.xyz*, Mint Songs*, and Royal*, all offering musicians new avenues for connecting with and monetizing their fanbases.</p><p>All told, we remain excited about Web3’s potential to reimagine entrenched Web2 models for social media, music, and more, and ultimately return power to creators.</p><p>Solana sunrise</p><p>Noticeable in our Q2 activity was the continued momentum behind the Solana ecosystem. While Ethereum and the EVM remain king as far as developer traction and compatible apps, we’re noting a clear trend in early teams placing importance on Solana. All in, we did 10 deals building on Solana in&nbsp;Q2.</p>Source: <a href="https://messari.io/article/state-of-solana-q1-2022">Messari</a><p>Given that Solana smart contracts are coded in Rust as opposed to the EVM’s Solidity, founding teams often choose between building in one or the other. Increasingly, we’re seeing teams opt to support both the EVM and Solana from the onset — like recent additions in <a href="https://coherent.sh/">Coherent</a> and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/11/coinbase-ventures-among-backers-as-web-3-platform-moralis-raises-40m/">Moralis</a>. We’ve seen others start on EVM and opt to fully transition to Solana while the above mentioned Fractal opted to build on Solana from the&nbsp;onset.</p><p>Add in the fact that multiple large funds have publicly expressed support for the ecosystem, and it suggests that Solana’s staying power is real. Chain liveliness however (the ability for Solana to remain online) remains an issue that is paramount for the Solana team to&nbsp;solve.</p><p>The UX of Everything</p><p>An overall clunky and disjointed crypto user experience has long been a hurdle for adoption. Think of what a user has to do to execute a typical transaction: convert fiat to crypto, transfer crypto to a wallet, bridge crypto to their network of choice, and then finally execute a transaction.</p><p>In Q2, we’ve invested in multiple teams (not yet announced) working on streamlining and verticalizing the entire retail transaction journey. Soon developers building in crypto and Web3 will be able to deploy the entire transaction stack with a few simple lines of code and standard set of&nbsp;APIs.</p><p>The end result will be a future where, for example, a user can execute a DEX transaction in a single click. In the background, fiat will be converted into crypto, moved to a wallet, bridged to an L1/L2, before executing the swap and custodying the asset in their wallet of choice. All of the complexity will be obfuscated away and we’ll have user experiences on par with Web2 — a massive&nbsp;unlock.</p><p>Where are the buidlers?</p><p>This quarter we took a look at where the founding teams we’ve invested in are based. While crypto is a global industry, somewhat unsurprisingly, the largest concentration of our founding teams hail from the United States — home to 64% of our 356 portfolio companies; all the more reason for regulators to foster rather than inhibit this fast growing&nbsp;sector.</p><p>Singapore has established itself as the base of many of the teams building in Asia. Meanwhile, the UK and Germany are home to growing hubs, with policy makers proactively working towards <a href="https://medium.com/the-coinbase-blog/building-across-europe-c4ef51f62509">regulatory clarity</a>. We continue to be impressed by founding teams in <a href="https://medium.com/the-coinbase-blog/namaste-india-8eb5136541c8">India</a>, who we expect to play a major role in the future of crypto adoption (CBV portfolio company <a href="https://frontier.xyz/">Frontier</a>, with 30 engineers in India has built a wonderful mobile-first DeFi aggregator supporting 20+ chains and 45+ protocols).</p><p>This quarter, we were also excited to back five teams founded by former Coinbase employees, including the aforementioned Coherent and Farcaster, as well as three others not yet announced. We’re proud to continue to support employees who receive a world class crypto education at Coinbase and go on to found world class companies and projects.</p><p>Wrapping up</p><p>While there’s plenty to be excited about in the future, there are also plenty of lessons to be learned in the present. The current crypto crises is similar to those we’ve seen play out in traditional finance. The opaqueness that centralized lenders and Three Arrows Capital operated under resulted in an inability for lenders to properly evaluate the risk of their counterparties. Lenders didn’t know how much the others had lent to 3AC, nor did they know how much leverage and risk 3AC was taking on. Investors didn’t know how much risk they were exposed to altogether. When the market moved against both the lenders and 3AC, lenders were left with massive holes in their balance sheets, and investors were left holding the&nbsp;bag.</p><p>However in contrast to the centralized lenders facing insolvency, it’s important to note that blue chip DeFi lenders Aave, Compound, and MakerDAO operated without a hitch. Every loan and its terms remained transparently on-chain for all to see. When collateralization levels fell below thresholds, collateral was sold via autonomous code and lenders were paid back. This same code also dictated that Celsius was forced to <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_pantera/status/1547276927597256705?s=20&amp;t=8eX_W0ZKqFRKjjgkeXMjQA">pay back $400M in loans</a> to Aave, Compound, and MakerDAO — no court order needed (though overcollaterization played a role). All told, it served as a powerful proving point for decentralized finance.</p><p>That’s just to say that it may be easy to get discouraged by the current price action while forgetting just how far we’ve come in a short period. When the last bear market hit, the most popular user application was Crypto Kitties. These days, there are more profound, impactful innovations than we can count. DeFi, <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/the-coinbase-ventures-guide-to-nfts-db1ad58b4e0d">NFTs</a>, a rich <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/daos-social-networks-that-can-rewire-the-world-128b73732547">DAO</a> ecosystem, all came about in the last two years, and even came together to make a <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/cryptos-emergence-as-a-geopolitical-force-30f29d62e562">real impact on the world stage</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/scaling-ethereum-crypto-for-a-billion-users-715ce15afc0b">layer2 scaling solutions</a> are finally here, and can take us from the dial-up to broadband phase, capable of supporting a rich array of user applications with simple UX to&nbsp;boot.</p><p>As in previous downturns, detractors are once again confidently pronouncing <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1527121134562385920?s=20&amp;t=E68Hp9cyqDYchnksQk2ZhQ">crypto dead</a>. However, from our seat in the industry, we’re invigorated by the brilliant founders we see working tirelessly to move this technology forward. As the entire financial system and world digitizes itself, we remain convinced that the opportunity within crypto and Web3 are far greater than most&nbsp;realize.</p><p>This website does not disclose material nonpublic information pertaining to Coinbase or Coinbase Venture’s portfolio companies.</p><p>Disclaimer: The opinions expressed on this website are those of the authors who may be associated persons of Coinbase, Inc., or its affiliates (“Coinbase”) and who do not represent the views, opinions and positions of Coinbase.

   <p>They said that Bitcoin isn't private, that you couldn't use it without telling everyone about your payments. They said that you had to be an expert before you had a chance to protect your sensitive financial information.</p><p>Well, what if I told you that they were wrong and that it’s gotten super easy to make Bitcoin payments without anyone being able to link them all to you? Interested ? Keep reading.</p><p>First and foremost, you have to download the latest and greatest Wasabi Wallet 2.0. For many that’s the actual step one, but hey, I know you’re cool and are already running the mighty Wasabi, so you can skip and reclaim your privacy that much quicker.</p><p>Maybe you’re a whale, or maybe you’re a pleb, but anyone worth a sat has got a wallet these days, so type in your recovery words to import your keys to Wasabi. If you’re one of those future-coiners who hasn’t got a wallet yet. First, slap yourself and try to wake up. But don’t stress it, you can easily create a new wallet in Wasabi directly. Write down the 12 words and you’re good to go!</p><p>Now comes arguably the toughest part. You gotta convince someone to send you some magical internet money. It ain’t easy, ‘cause nobody has enough sats, and everyone wants to stack some more. But I’m sure you’re a fine entrepreneur, so go be productive and earn yourself some treasure worth protecting. That part is easy as pi in Wasabi. Just click “Receive”, write who is sending you that hoard and show him that address. Voila, you've now got more sats than yesterday, that’s what I’d call a good day.</p><p>Earning sats is already difficult enough; if you think about it, waiting to spend it can be even more difficult. I know you really wanna have that delicious steak, that fast boat and that hidden citadel. But patience is a virtue (that most of us lack); however it’s all you need at this step. While you are dreaming about how delicious that steak is gonna be, Wasabi is doing magic for you in the background. Who knows what exactly is going on under the hood but the crazy thing is, in just a short amount of time, the coins that other people knew were yours are gone and you got new coins that nobody knows are yours. Magic indeed.</p><p>Now that you are fully equipped with truly anonymous money, you can frivolously spend it without worrying that those who paid you sats, know where you spend them. But oh well, maybe, just maybe, that short lesson in waiting has made you realize that indeed, you could continue fasting a little more, not buy that steak but hold on to those precious sats just a little longer instead. Who knows, your great grandchildren could buy themselves a spaceship to the stars with those sats.</p><p>Earn sats, wait, spend sats. Wasabi is made to help you do that and just that, without revealing your important financial data to everyone in the world.</p><p>Reclaim your privacy. Effortlessly. With Wasabi 2.0.</p>

<p></p><p>Nowadays, ring signatures and zero-knowledge proofs are two of the most used and known privacy enhancing technologies applied to cryptocurrency. And, as cryptography is the heart and soul of the crypto scene (and the only reason scarce digital goods are possible), this is no small feature.<br></p><p>The top Layer-1 privacy blockchain networks, <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/">Monero</a> and <a href="https://z.cash/">Zcash</a>, both have adopted these tools — with Monero embracing ring signatures and Zcash employing zero-knowledge proofs.<br></p><p>Both zero-knowledge proofs and ring signatures have proved effective at maintaining user anonymity and privacy. Their sustainability and ability to remain ahead amidst fierce competition and innovation are celebrated among blockchain privacy enthusiasts. <br></p><p>To wade into the debate on which of them does a better job and is more cost-effective, we will look at the technology behind their operations, their applications on the blockchain, and their advantages and disadvantages.</p> An overview of ring signatures <p>Ring signatures are one of the earliest cryptographic inventions and, to date, one of the most effective. As its name implies, a ring signature involves a group in which all members own keys. These members form a ring, banding together to aid each other’s privacy.<br></p>Working of ring signatures in Monero, (<a href="https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5880940">Source</a>).<p>One of the earliest scenarios used to describe the way ring signatures work is the White House dilemma, which goes as follows:<br></p><p>Imagine there is a sensitive information leak from the Oval Office. The leaked information has no source, so everyone who works in the government house immediately becomes a suspect. Mr. President then points out that the information could only have been leaked by a staff member, but he has no idea of who it was. The secret is in the open, but no one can tell how it got out or who leaked it. If every staff member enjoys plausible deniability (i.e., there’s no proofs against them), then the outcome is akin to ring signatures.<br></p><p>With no clear suspects, there can be no culprits.</p> How do ring signatures work? <p>Ring signatures need an existing group of people on both sides of each transaction. One signature is enough to send a ring signature message, while the other group members function as decoys. Using our previous example, the sending group of people would be “the White House personnel” and the receiving one “the general public”, as the data leak was not sent to any one single individual. Since it is not computationally possible to single out the participants in the transaction through their keys, ring signatures preserve anonymity.<br></p><p>Although they bear similarities to group signatures, ring signatures differ on two grounds. First, the anonymity of the individual keys involved in a ring signature is irrevocable. Then, no additional setup is needed to determine a signing set, which means that any random set of keys can act as decoys with or without the knowledge of the key owners. In other words, any member of the network can form part of a decoy group with or without their knowledge.<br></p><p>Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Yael Tauman Kalai introduced the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_signature">ring signatures</a> in 2001 at ASIACRYPT. Since then, ring signatures have been used for several real-life applications, including privacy enhancement on public blockchain networks.<br></p>This video by Monero showcases how ring signatures work in the context of Monero, a privacy cryptocurrency that uses them. Real-Life Applications of Ring Signatures <p>When Ron Rivest et al. released the original ring signature paper in 2001, they mentioned a few real-life <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/user-types-and-use-cases-who-is-panther-for-how-can-they-use-it-c11ccafa4bbf/">use cases</a> of ring signatures. Here are a few suggested real-world applications.</p> Whistleblowing <p>As we saw in the White House dilemma, whistleblowing is tremendously helped by plausible deniability. However, if this were to be facilitated by technology, it could potentially be a lot safer for leakers.<br></p><p>Using ring signatures, individuals and victims can expose documents and materials that prove particular government and private cover-ups without exposing their identities. Even when you can tell that a government official was behind the leak, the exact identity of the signer will remain unknown.</p> Offline e-cash <p>One variant of the fundamental ring signature structure involves linkability to avoid the double spending problem. This concept allows observers to determine if one group member (for example, a bank) was responsible for any ring signatures, giving them legitimacy. <br></p><p>In this structure, while the sender's identity remains uncompromised, verifiers can determine if the signer has signed any previous or future messages, linking each ring signature to another under the same private key. With linkability, ring signatures can be used for offline e-cash transactions, keeping both sender and recipient anonymous while eliminating the double spending problem.</p> Deniable Signatures <p>Although deniable signatures are not mainstream, they have been outlined as a possible way to send and receive messages with third-party encryption. This kind of signatures would not be transferable to anyone except their original recipient, and observers would not be privy to information about both the sender and the receiver.</p> E-Voting Systems <p>E-voting uses ring signatures with both linkability and <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/are-bitcoin-transactions-traceable-coin-security-privacy/">traceability</a>. Not only will verifiers link to ring signatures from a particular private key, but they will also be privy to the signer's public key. Individuals can cast votes without compromising their identities to parties other than a trusted electoral umpire.</p> Private Cryptocurrencies <p>Monero is a <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bitcoin-tumblers-privacy-coins-and-prifi-private-crypto/">private blockchain</a> network that uses ring signatures along with Ring Confidential Transactions (an advanced form of ring signatures that also involves stealth addresses) to drive private crypto transactions.<br></p><p>Monero uses several public keys pulled with a triangular distribution method, and the signer's keys create a ring of possible signers. All the possible signers are equally valid, making the transaction output untraceable. This creates plausible deniability for each transaction output. <br></p><p>Monero also utilizes a cryptographic technique called the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9SOk9dIOCk">Pederson commitment</a> to obscure transaction amounts, senders’ and receivers’ addresses. This helps Monero offer its users high privacy with reasonable efficiency and verifiable, trustless coin generation.<br></p> zk-SNARKs <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">Zero-knowledge proofs</a> are one of the most commonly adopted privacy protocols. A few privacy enhancing technologies have derived from it but, in particular, zk-SNARKs have recently been highlighted in the blockchain space, driving anonymity and scalability.<br></p>Working diagram of zero-knowledge proofs (<a href="https://appinventiv.com/blog/zero-knowledge-proof-blockchain/">Source</a>).<p>Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) proofs allow users to prove their ownership of specific information or that they have done something without disclosing underlying details. Individuals or entities can prove an action (e.g., having over $5,000 in the bank) without telling the third party what action they took (e.g., their exact balance), the recipient of such actions, and the item or items exchanged. <br></p><p>Zk-SNARKs do not only provide zero-knowledge proofs, but they also do it in such a way that signers and verifiers do not need to establish any interaction to prove or confirm transactions. Commitments that establish the authenticity of zk-SNARK transactions are published as hashes.</p> How do zk-SNARKs Work? <p></p>Securing a blockchain with a non-interactive ZK proof. (<a href="https://www.altoros.com/blog/securing-a-blockchain-with-a-noninteractive-zero-knowledge-proof/">Source</a>)<p></p><p>To understand the concept of <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zksnarks-through-the-lens-of-the-cypherpunks/">zk-SNARKs</a>, we first have to consider how zero-knowledge proofs work. Imagine a world in which people can prove that they own something or did something without telling you what they own or have done. Yet, you, as a third-party observer, can confirm that they truly own that item or that they are behind the action they claim to have carried out.<br></p><p>Zk-SNARKs use zero-knowledge proofs and ensure no interaction exists between the proving party and verifiers. With zk-SNARKs, users can convince the verifier that, in addition to showcasing that the information within the hash exists, they also know what lies therein.<br></p><p>After proving the existence and knowledge of the information, the succinct nature of zk-SNARKs implies that they can be verified in milliseconds and with a proof length of hundreds of bytes. In the early days of zero-knowledge proofs, both parties (provers and verifiers) had to communicate multiple times to establish trust. <br></p><p>With a non-interactive construction, only a single piece of information is sufficient to establish trust between both parties. Zk-SNARKs are also computationally sound statements, and they cannot be constructed without access to the private input that proves the transaction.</p><p>Let’s illustrate this all in a mundane example:<br></p><p>A zk-SNARK is alike owning a bracelet that certifies your belonging to a secret multi-billionaire society: if you wear it out on the street, other members would be able to identify you easily. However, they would not need to interact with you, you would not need to interact with them, and the information conveyed by the bracelet (e.g., your social status and other conditions to join the exclusive group) are immediately transferred to the “verifier”.<br></p><p>For example, <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Panther</a> leverages zk-SNARKs to restore privacy in Web3 and DeFi while providing financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in decentralized finance. Using zk-proofs, Panther enables users to prove their regulatory compliance without sharing underlying data. Panther does this through <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol/protocol/panthers-core-components/zk-and-non-zk-reveals">zk- and non zk-Reveals</a> that generate zero-knowledge reports for selective disclosures.<br></p>A realistic zk-SNARK example (<a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/zk-snarks-a-realistic-zero-knowledge-example-and-deep-dive-c5e6eaa7131c">Source</a>). Real-world applications of zk-SNARKs  Blockchain privacy <p>Several privacy-centric blockchain protocols have adopted zkSNARKs to enable user and transaction anonymity across the main chain, sidechains, and bridges. Zcash is one of the most popular, using shielded zero-knowledge proofs to keep users anonymous as they transact on-chain. <br></p><p>Another popular project that adopts zkSNARKs is <a href="https://horizenlabs.io/">Horizen</a>. In addition to driving privacy in the crypto space, these projects have also employed zkSNARKs to establish trust between users and law enforcement agencies.<br></p><p>Furthermore, <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io">Panther</a> also leverages zk-SNARKs to restore privacy in Web3 and DeFi while providing financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in decentralized finance.</p> Blockchain-powered auditing <p>zkAudits are gaining popularity, allowing auditors to independently verify information without disclosing the identities of senders and receivers. The now-bankrupt Celsius Network used <a href="https://horizenlabs.io/zkaudit/">zkAudits</a>, powered by Horizen, to prove liquidity and revenue in real-time without the help of third-party validators while also keeping the underlying transaction information anonymous.</p> Blockchain scalibility <p>With zk-SNARKs, blockchain networks can outsource an expensive computation and validate that the result is correct without redoing its execution. This opens up a category of trustless computing and an innovative way of blockchain scaling.<br></p><p>Similarly, zk-SNARKs can also allow change a blockchain model from everyone-computing-everything to one-party-computes-the-rest-verify.</p> Ring signatures versus zk-SNARKs <p>Ring signatures and zkSNARKs have both received fair criticism since going mainstream. While new developments have addressed most detected design flaws, a few linger on. The ring signature tool that Monero uses, for example has been faulted by research in recent years. Allegedly, Monero’s ring signature scheme could result in users potentially losing their <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/is-privacy-a-human-right-philosophy-economics-legality/">privacy</a> through tracing analysis. However, no one has ever been shown to crack Monero’s cryptography.

<p>Brave’s multichain crypto wallet makes it easier for users to onboard to Web3 with new integrations from Beefy.finance, Elk Finance, Elpis Battles, Lido, Tulip, and Venus Protocol</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Last month we announced our <a>Wallet Partner Program</a> and a roster of six inaugural partners who integrated Brave Wallet connection in their DApps (ApeSwap, Arken, Bogged, DODO, Open Ocean, and Skiff). We are thrilled to announce six additional leading DApps (decentralized applications) spanning over 10 networks joining the program in July.</p>
<p>Partnering with the most widely-used decentralized applications in Web3 underlines Brave Wallet’s ease of use and rich set of features. These include decentralized swaps, multi-chain portfolio view, simple fiat-to-crypto purchases with Ramp and Wyre, and continuous updates and additions to make Web3 more accessible. Importantly, partners in the program benefit from co-promotion of their DApps among Brave’s 62+ million users via our blog, community channels, social media, and Brave Ads.</p>
<p>We are excited about the opportunities these partnerships can create for BAT utility and Brave Wallet users, including better access to decentralized finance (DeFi), privacy tools, lively social communities, and more. Each new addition deepens our commitment to providing the leading secure, multi-chain wallet, that we hope will onboard millions of users to Web3.</p>

 Beefy 
<p><a href="https://beefy.finance/">Beefy</a> is one of the largest and most-used yield-aggregators, with smart contract vaults that help users earn more yield on their liquidity positions across 16 different networks and dozens of decentralized exchanges. They hold the top position in terms of total value locked (TVL) among yield-aggregators on several major EVM-compatible chains and Ethereum Layer 2 solutions, including Polygon, Arbitrum, and Cronos.</p>
<p>“Integrating Beefy’s services into a platform like Brave with a community of millions is a perfect use case for increased adoption. Earning APY through DeFi opportunities shouldn’t just be for the few, and tapping into Brave’s ecosystem will help more people earn than ever before,” said Weso, Beefy’s Lead Developer and Strategic Partnership Coordinator.</p>

 Elk Finance 
<p><a href="https://elk.finance/">ElkNet</a>, the core product offered by Elk Finance, is a multi-chain bridge network that connects 19 EVM-compatible chains, allowing users to quickly and safely move their tokens from one chain to another. In addition to moving assets, Elk is adding cross-chain swaps, which offers users the choice to receive their bridged assets as a different token. “Our motto is Any chain, anytime, anywhere,” said the Elk Team.</p>

 Elpis Battle 
<p><a href="https://elpis.game/">Elpis Battle</a> is a turn-based RPG NFT Game implemented on the Binance Smart Chain network, which is developed by ZEGO Studio—a gaming studio in Southeast Asia. By combining cryptocurrency, NFT gaming, and DeFi, Elpis’s developers want to create a new kind of gaming experience for Elpis Battle players. Elpis is a world where players can not only explore stories about an imaginary kingdom but also create value, exchange, buy, and sell assets as participants in the economy of Elpis.</p>
<p>“A common vision toward bigger goals is the foundation of our partnership. We envision this cross-platform partnership will help users be able to manage, grow, and swap their crypto portfolio from a single wallet securely and comfortably,” said the Elpis Battle Team.</p>

 Lido 
<p>With over $5 billion in value locked between Ethereum and Solana alone, <a href="https://lido.fi/">Lido</a> is by far the most widely used liquid staking protocol available today. Lido makes it easy for anyone to participate in the proof of stake consensus while simultaneously allowing users to interact with DeFi protocols. This liquidity lets users find the best DeFi strategies for themselves while also securing some of industry’s biggest blockchains: Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Polkadot, and Kusama.</p>
<p>“A platform like Brave with a community in the millions will be critical for Lido to bring DeFi to the next generation and increase the resilience of the systems it is built upon. This was the entire reason that Lido and liquid staking was created in the first place and what has helped Lido become the leading liquid staking provider globally,” said Jacob Blish, Head of Business Development at Lido.</p>

 Tulip 
<p><a href="https://tulip.garden/#home">Tulip Protocol</a> was the first yield aggregation platform built on Solana with auto-compounding vault strategies. The DApp is designed to take advantage of Solana’s low cost, high efficiency blockchain. It allows vault strategies to compound frequently—which benefits yield farms with higher APYs—without&nbsp; requiring active management. It also has lower gas fees. Tulip now offers a wide variety of strategies for its users: Lending, Auto-compounding Vaults, Leveraged Yield Farming, and their newly launched Strategy Vaults.</p>
<p>​​"Tulip believes in simplifying yield for all end users. A partnership with Brave brings us closer to our ideals as we can help Brave Wallet users tap into single-click yield generation with our protocol. We’re excited to continue to work with Brave in the future," said Senx, Co-Founder at Tulip Protocol.</p>

 Venus Protocol 
<p><a href="https://venus.io/">Venus</a> is the leading DeFi market for lending and borrowing, and second largest decentralized application in terms of TVL on BNB Chain. Users can use their many pools (including XVS, BTCB, ETH, BNB) and a variety of stablecoins to borrow and lend assets at variable interest rates. Borrowers can benefit from on-demand access to a range of tokens with low interest rates, while depositors can earn yield on their idle assets. Venus currently supports 22 different cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>“By integrating Venus with Brave, two DeFi leaders come together to fling open the doors of financial inclusion to millions of users. It’s just the beginning for making open finance a reality around the globe,” said Brad Harrison, CEO of Venus.</p>
<p>For the current phase of the Brave Wallet Partner Program, Brave is approaching leading DApps in each vertical to invite them to the program. We also aim to adapt and scale the program to become public-facing later this year. Once this happens, additional DApps can submit requests to participate.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you’re a developer interested in simply integrating Brave Wallet into your DApp, we’ve created <a href="https://wallet-docs.brave.com/">detailed developer documentation</a>.</p>

  Read the proposal for Polkadot's next-generation governance system - currently known as Gov2 - to discover how it aims to advance the decentralization of the network.

<p>Polkadot’s first decentralised governance system was pretty interesting at the time: a tri-cameral (three-chamber) structure with a technocratic committee managing upgrade timelines, an approval-voted, elected executive “government” to manage parameters, admin and spending proposals as well as a general voting system for everything else which rewarded long-term stakeholders with increased influence. It was loosely based on parliamentary democracy and has been functioning reasonably well over the first 2–3 years of operation, helping ensure good use of treasury funds, keeping a fast clip with the rollout of upgrades, and managing the deployment of more critical fixes in a timely fashion. However, it has its drawbacks.</p><p>The elected executive (known as the Council) is centralised and generally not anonymous. This puts both the protocol in some degree of risk as well as the individual councillors who may find themselves pressured to act one way or another. The Technical Committee, while wielding substantially less power, has similar exposure and greater centralisation. In a world where authorities across society (both benign and malevolent), decentralisation is increasingly needed for both the safety and security of all participants.</p><p>Furthermore, there exists only a single “all or nothing” referendum model — all referenda carry the maximum amount of power. Partly due to this, there can only be one referendum voted at a time and these votes last multiple weeks by default. This, and the limited bandwidth of the Council means that overall the system favours deep consideration of very few proposals rather than broad consideration of very many. Rather than leveraging the power of the crowd, it inadvertently limits it in its efforts to manage the volume of potential decision throughput.</p><p>The nature of coarse-grained delegation means that the system has a degree of exclusivity built-in to it. Barriers to entry within the effective political framework are high, reducing inclusivity and diversity, hurting turnout and legitimacy.</p><p>It was always clear that the first version of Polkadot’s governance was just that: something to be iterated on over time. Now, I’m happy to be able to describe in detail our proposal for the next generation of governance within the Polkadot ecosystem.</p> Introducing Gov2 <p>Polkadot’s next-generation governance system, known while in development as Gov2, aims to solve the issues with the current system. First, what it doesn’t change: it does not break from the original Polkadot governance tenet, which holds that 50% of the total stake in the system should, if they have sufficient strength of conviction in their opinion, be able ultimately to command the system’s future. Similarly, it doesn’t break away from the Conviction Voting pioneered in Polkadot giving greater weight to those who are willing to lock their tokens into the system for longer. Furthermore, there is still use for a technocratic collective, albeit it is somewhat different in importance, size, composition and membership mechanics than the current Technical Committee.</p><p>Where it differs most is how it manages the practical means of day-to-day decision-making, making the repercussions of referenda better scoped and agile in order to dramatically increase the number of collective decisions the system is able to take. Let’s look a little deeper into how it works.</p> Lower the Barriers <p>Gov2 is actually a lot simpler in many ways than the current governance. There are no additional bodies which act as “first class citizens” in the governance such as the Council and Technical Committee. There is no alternating timetable of proposals. There is no public proposal queue. Instead, we only have one first-class decision-making mechanism: the referendum. The main difference in Gov2 is that there can be lots of them — perhaps even thousands —all happening simultaneously.</p><p>In Gov2, anyone is able to start a referendum at any time, and they can do this as many times as they wish. Anyone can also vote on these referenda. There are no explicit limits on the number of referenda which are open to vote on at any time.</p><p>But this could result in more things to vote on that a normal person with a reasonable amount of time could possibly evaluate. This could reduce both inclusivity and security. So, in order make this potential plethora of things to vote on manageable for mere humans, we introduce some interesting novel features to the referendum process.</p> Origins and Tracks <p>All referenda are based on a proposal, which is really just another way of saying “an operation” in Polkadot. This is the same kind of thing as what gets described and executed when you make a transaction and it gets included in a block. There are all kinds of operations which Polkadot can do, but a couple which you’re probably already familiar with are <code>transfer</code> which can move assets between accounts and <code>stake</code> which lets an account stake. There are very many others. The thing that makes this governance functionality special is not these proposals/operations, but rather the Origin with which they are executed.</p><p>You can think of an Origin as a sort of rich descriptor for a privilege level. It gets passed in when an operation is executed, and the operation’s logic will usually check that it is what it should be. When a regular transaction executes, the Origin parameter is set to a variant known as Signed. This implies that a specific account in the system authorised (generally through signing the transaction) the operation to happen, and it runs with this privilege, further implying e.g. that funds controlled by this account and this account only may be spent.</p><p>Governance-level stuff works to allow operations to run with other, more privileged, Origins. The most privileged of them all is the Root Origin, which is all-powerful. This is the Origin from which the proposals of all approved referenda in the old governance system were dispatched. In Gov2, we have many different Origins, all enjoying some exotic privileges, but with many being significantly less powerful and more niche than Root.</p><p>In Gov2, we allow the proposer to specify which Origin they would like their proposal to be executed with. Every supported Origin is associated with a single referendum class (i.e. a type of referenda), and most of these classes will correspond to exactly one origin, but there might be some which are comprised of multiple Origins. Each class has its own Track, which is basically a pipeline in which the proposal lives in and proceeds through, and it is completely independent from other class’s tracks.</p><p>Having independent tracks allows us to tailor the dynamics of referenda based upon their implied privilege level. Referenda which execute their proposals from more powerful (read: dangerous!) Origins will have more stringent safeguards, higher thresholds and longer consideration periods. The Root Origin has the highest such thresholds and safeguards. Those Origins which convey relatively little power (e.g. the Tip Origin, able to spend at most 10 DOT from the treasury), have accordingly shorter consideration periods and lower thresholds for approval.</p> Kicking off <p>When a referendum is initially created, it is immediately votable by anyone in the community. However, it is not in a state where it can end, or otherwise have its votes counted, be approved and summarily enacted. Instead, referenda must fulfil a number of criteria before they are moved into a state known as Deciding. Until they are in this state, they remain undecided.</p><p>The criteria which need to be met are threefold: Firstly, all referenda have a lead-in period. This is an amount of time which must have elapsed after proposal before deciding can begin. This provides for an initial notice period in which votes can be submitted to mitigate against the possibility of “decision sniping” where an attacker controlling a substantial amount of voting power might seek to have a proposal passed soon after proposing it, not allowing the overall voting population time to consider and vote.</p><p>Secondly, there must be room for the decision. All tracks have their own limit on the number of referenda which can be deciding simultaneously. The more potent the Origins allowed on the track, then the lower this limit. The Root level Origin has a limit of one, implying that only a single über-dangerous proposal may be being decided at once. Conversely, the rather underpowered Tipping track has far less stringent limits since any damage done through over-population of is minimal and it is far more useful to have many tips being decided at once over many Root-level calls. When there is space available, then it is the (otherwise eligible) referendum of the class which has the most votes in favour of approval which is elevated into the deciding state.</p><p>Finally, a Decision Deposit must be paid. Creating a referendum is cheap, with the deposit needing to be paid relating only to the on-chain storage needed to track it. However, having a referendum be decided upon carries greater risk and uses up limited space since we limit the number of referenda which can be being decided simultaneously on each track. Thus a larger (though refundable) deposit must be paid to mitigate against spamming or bloating the system.</p> Deciding and Confirming a Proposal <p>Once a referendum enters the state of deciding, then it is eligible to be approved. This eligibility lasts only a finite time (28 days on Polkadot), at which point if it is not approved then it is rejected by default. To be approved, it must fulfil two criteria (in which case we say it is passing) and it must continue fulfilling these criteria for a minimum of the Confirmation Period. Different tracks have different lengths of Confirmation Period, with the more powerful ones taking longer to confirm. This is additional defence against a whale voter attempting to “snipe” the referendum by placing a large enough vote that approval criteria are hit unexpectedly.</p><p>The two passing criteria relate to approval and support. Gone is the adaptive quorum biasing of past referendums. Now we have a more flexible system where these requirements may be customised at a much more fine-grained level. Approval is defined as the share of approval vote-weight (i.e. after adjustment for conviction) against the total number of vote-weight (for both approval and rejection). Support is the total number of votes in approval (i.e. ignoring any adjustment for conviction) compared to the total possible amount of votes that could be made in the system.</p><p>Each class of referendum has different requirements for these values. However what is most interesting is that these requirements are able to reduce over time on a well-defined schedule. What this means is that as the voting proceeds over the 28 days, we can configure things so that an increasingly lower amount of support and overall approval for the proposal are needed for it to pass. In general, they will always begin and end in roughly the same way, starting with the highest thresholds and ending with the lowest which are still in line with the overall tenets: at least 50% approval.</p><p>What happens in between determines how easy it is for an approval to be made before the 28-day deadline. With proposals which use less privileged origins (e.g. the Tip class, which is only able to command a payment from the treasury of up to 10 DOT) it is far more reasonable to drop the required turnout to a more realistic amount earlier than those which use highly privileged classes such as Root. Similarly, classes which command more political significance will tend to accept less controversy (and thus require a higher approval) early on.</p> After Approval <p>Proposals which are not approved after 28 days are considered rejected by default. At this point, the Decision Deposit can be refunded. If, on the other hand, the proposal manages to become and remain passing for the Confirmation Period during these 28 days, then it is considered approved and it is scheduled to execute from the origin is was duly proposed with, after some Enactment Period.</p><p>The Enactment Period is also specified when the referendum is proposed but is subject to a minimum value which is dependent on the track. Some of the more powerful tracks force a larger Enactment Period to ensure the network has ample time to prepare for any changes that the proposal might bring.</p> Interventions <p>Sometimes it becomes apparent that a proposal which is already being voted on (and perhaps is already passing) contains a problem and it is desirable to cancel it. An example of this would be a chain upgrade which was later discovered to contain some sort of issue. While this is not very common, it is also not entirely unheard of.</p><p>In Gov2, there is a special operation for intervening in this way known as Cancelation. This operation immediately rejects an ongoing referendum regardless of its status. It actually comes in two forms, with one just doing the bare operation and the other also slashing the initial proposer of the deposit(s) paid for the referendum.</p><p>Cancelation is itself a governance operation which must be voted upon by the network in order to execute. This poses a possible problem of timeline, and in order to be useful, getting a cancelation proposal passed must generally be quite a lot faster than any possible target proposal passed. As such, cancelation comes with its own Origin and track, which has a low lead-time and approval/support curves with slightly sharper reductions in their thresholds for passing.</p> Agile Delegation <p>In a perfect world, where everyone had unlimited time and virtuosity, everybody would research, discuss, consider and carefully vote on every proposal. However, in a perfect world we do not live. Not everyone has the time or inclination to make a well-researched vote on every matter. Out of this realisation, the Council was born into Polkadot’s original governance: a body delegated by voters to make up for the fact that many of them did not want to take part in the day-to-day of governance. However, with the Council gone in Gov2, we need an alternative means of ensuring “passive” voters are heard.</p><p>The original governance system had a feature called Vote Delegation, which we have retained and improved upon in Gov2. For those not familiar, this is similar to premise of liquid democracy: you are able to delegate your voting power to another voter in the system. When your delegate votes, they wield not just their own voting power but yours too. This works with conviction voting, allowing you to lock up your tokens in order to increase the level of voting power your delegate wields on your behalf. Of course the tokens in question never leave your control and you are free to switch delegates or regain direct control back whenever you please.</p><p>Gov2, however, improves on this with a rather special feature called Multirole Delegation. This allows you to specify a different delegate for every class of referendum in the system. If you do not want to delegate for a particular class of referendum then you can also retain direct control for that class.</p><p>This means you can delegate to one individual for any referenda on dealing out small tips to ecosystem contributors, another entity for referenda on more substantial treasury spending, another entity for purely technical network upgrades and parameterisations and finally retain direct control for any other decisions!</p> The Fellowship and Whitelist <p>Well-informed “expert” opinion plays an important role in any well-functioning governance system. A technocracy comes with its own rather serious flaws and thus we would not want “experts” to be placed in a position of command: it introduces risks of centralisation, unaccountable authority and lays the groundwork for what could become ultimately a ruling cabal. It was for this reason that Polkadot’s original governance’s Technical Committee has no “deciding power” but only the ability to reduce the voting period.</p><p>That all said, oraclising well-informed opinion and allowing it to help optimise the decision-making process, even if it has no direct effect on the decision-making outcome seems like a reasonable goal to strive for. Crucially, and for the sake of all involved, it must not be possible in any way for the expert body to subvert the overall stakeholder decision.</p><p>Root-Origin proposals are the sort which are needed for upgrades, fixes and rescues, but which necessarily have the power to arbitrarily break and corrupt the system. In Gov2, because they are so dangerous, we err on the side of safety and have extremely high levels of approval and support needed for early-passing and which reduce to their final levels only slowly. The lead-in and enactment periods are also large. In general the process is slow, and this is to give everybody in Polkadot the maximum amount of notice to ensure that bad proposals don’t make it through.</p><p>However, there are occasions where it is important to roll out a fix, upgrade or rescue logic in a shorter period of time. We may be able to assume there is broad consensus in these times, but the safeguards on the voting process above mean that executing such a fix can be difficult or impractical due to time constraints alone. Oraclising the idea that “the experts agree: this is both safe and time-critical” can be a very useful tool in forming a clear process which is well-considered in the general case but able to make decisions on a tight timeline when there is good reason to believe that circumstances require it.</p><p>There remain two big questions to answer here: how could the chain (a deterministic blob of logic with no inherent ability to express or observe concepts as “safe” and “time-critical”? And even if it could know of such circumstances, how do we adapt our logic without compromising our overall tractability and simplicity?</p> The Fellowship <p>The answer to the first question lies in a new governance body. For those familiar with the old governance system, this body can be thought of as the logic successor to the Technical Committee.</p><p>It is named the Polkadot Fellowship, and in totality is a sufficiently rich and sophisticated structure that it will form the subject of a whole other article. It will initially run on the Kusama network, since Gov2 will be deployed there for live-testing purposes, however it will be migrated over to Polkadot with the final Gov2 deployment and once there it will serve both networks via the Polkadot/Kusama bridge.</p><p>The Fellowship is a mostly self-governing expert body with a primary goal of representing the humans who embody and contain the technical knowledge base of the Polkadot network and protocol. Unlike the current Technical Collective it is designed to be far broader in membership (i.e. to work well with even tens of thousands of members) and with far lower in barriers to entry (both in terms of administrative process flow and expectations of expertise). Becoming a candidate member in the Fellowship is as easy as placing a small deposit.</p><p>In order to help ensure a high quality of collective decisions in light of such a broad membership, members are associated with a rank to designate the degree to which the system expects their opinion to be well-informed, of a sound technical basis and in line with the interests of Polkadot. The members of the Fellowship can vote on any given Fellowship proposal and the aggregate opinion of the members (weighted by their rank) constitutes the Fellowship’s considered opinion.</p><p>Beautifully enough, the technical means by which the Fellowship votes is actually exactly the same code (Substrate pallet) as the means by which the Polkadot stakeholders vote in a referendum and it has exactly the same facilities (multiple tracks, agile delegation, &amp;c).</p> Ranks and Pitfalls <p>Introducing the concept of rank is fraught with pitfalls. However, we are presented with relatively few options if decentralisation, accountability and safety for all involved are our requirements. We believe it is reasonable to utilise the openness, transparency and corruption-resistance that decentralised consensus brings to ensure that any “rulers” are not themselves above the “rules” and that rank comes with clear expectations, rules and accountability. The downsides of rank are not just bad for the network but also, in light of some recent decentralised-technology policy positions of politicians, are also bad for the participants: if rank allowed a small group of participants to have effective control over the network they could be considered in effective control of it and thus responsible for what happened on it.</p><p>As such, we adhere to three principles: firstly, the Fellowship must never have hard power over the network: it cannot change parameters, conduct rescues, or move assets. Concerning governance over the network, the only thing in its power is to reduce the effective timeline on which a referendum takes place.</p><p>Secondly, the rank system and weights must be designed so that we would not expect small groups of individuals to be able to capture and control overall decision-making capacity. While the Fellowship weights those with higher rank more in the aggregate opinion, the weight should not be so high as to make a small number of higher members’ opinions be insurmountable when compared to a coherent opinion coming from lower-ranked membership.</p><p>Thirdly, the Fellowship should be designed to grow and develop its membership and their aggregate levels of expertise and in doing ensure that its overall decision-making capacity gets stronger over time. For long-term success, the Fellowship must be an effective meritocracy where those with commitment, talent and expertise rise to greater levels of influence. To achieve this, we must give clarity and transparency to the process of entry and promotion through the ranks. To the highest degree possible, an individual’s identity should not form a consideration, only their ability.</p><p>In light of this, the Fellowship will have a constitution which describes in specific terms the requirements and expectations for individuals to attain and retain any given rank. Higher ranks are able to vote and promote lower ranks voting based on this constitution. Demotion happens automatically after a period in which a member is unable to defend their position to their peers. Suspension can happen only through general (Polkadot) referendum, providing a means of ensuring that controversy or unpopularity within the Fellowship does not (necessarily) result in expulsion. Furthermore, to guard against the chance of the Fellowship becoming a cabal, entrance into the top tiers of ranks also requires a full (Polkadot) referendum and cannot be bestowed merely by ones Fellowship peers.</p> The Whitelist <p>While the Fellowship may be able to represent Polkadot’s body of human experts on-chain and provide a piece of deterministic logic from which to source their aggregate opinion, it may be unclear how we can integrate this into the overall referendum system. In fact, this is achieved using a combination of concepts we already know and a wonderfully simple piece of on-chain logic called the Whitelist pallet.</p><p>The Whitelist pallet does one thing: it allows one Origin to escalate the privilege level of another Origin for a certain operation. In terms of Gov2, it allows the Fellowship to authorise a new origin (which we will call Whitelisted-Root) to be executed with Root-level privileges. You can think of it as a sort of Unix <code>sudo</code>, except that it only works with specific commands that the Fellowship have pre-authorised. What this means is that we can have a new track in Polkadot’s governance which is for proposals which will have been whitelisted by the Fellowship. If the referendum passes, then they will be executed inside of the Whitelist pallet with this Whitelisted-Root origin. The Whitelist pallet verifies two things: that this origin really is the Whitelisted-Root (i.e. that the referendum passed on this track) and that the proposal has indeed been whitelisted by the Fellowship. If so then it goes ahead and executes the operation with Root-level privileges.</p><p>With this we don’t need to change anything about how the referendum system works (yey!). We now have a new track (for the Whitelisted-Root origin) whose parameters allow for a shorter voting turnaround, safe in the knowledge that through an open and transparent process, a body of global experts on the Polkadot protocol has determined that this is both safe and time-critical.</p> Timeline &amp; Future work <p>Gov2 is set to launch on Kusama imminently, following final professional audit of its code. Once tested on Kusama, a proposal will be made for the Polkadot network to vote on.</p><p>An update to this overall governance system, codenamed “Gov2.5”, is planned for eventual deployment some months afterwards. It will two bring key features: firstly a “collect-call” feature for vote delegation, essentially allowing users (via their wallets) to offer their funds up for delegation without paying any transaction fees; instead the delegate would be able to optionally pay the transaction fees to get the funds delegated. Secondly, a free undelegation transaction will be introduced, able to be used in a limited capacity by all delegating users. Together these features enable wallets to offer a highly streamlined and zero-cost governance integration to their users, which we hope will entice more involvement in the overall governance process from users.</p>

<p>Tl;dr: In recent weeks, some firms have struggled to remain solvent due to insufficient risk controls. See how Coinbase implements secure and comprehensive risk management practices that enable institutions to successfully navigate the cryptoeconomy.</p><p>By Brett Tejpaul, Head of Coinbase Institutional, Matt Boyd, Head of Prime Finance, and Caroline Tarnok, Head of Credit and Market&nbsp;Risk</p><p>The shocks to the crypto credit environment over the last few weeks are likely to be a major inflection point for the industry. Solvency concerns surrounding entities like Celsius, Three Arrows Capital (3AC), Voyager, and other similar counterparties were a reflection of insufficient risk controls, and reports of additional struggling firms are fast becoming stories of bankruptcy, restructuring, and failure. Notably, the issues here were foreseeable and actually credit specific, not crypto specific in nature. Many of these firms were overleveraged with short term liabilities mismatched against longer duration illiquid&nbsp;assets.</p><p>We believe these market participants were caught up in the frenzy of a crypto bull market and forgot the basics of risk management. Unhedged bets, huge investments in the Terra ecosystem, and massive leverage provided to and deployed by 3AC meant that risk was too high and too concentrated. These events are, unfortunately, more common in traditional financial markets than we would hope. We are reminded frequently of Long Term Capital Management in the 1990s, Lehman Brothers in the 2000s, and even Archegos Capital Management in&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Coinbase had no financing exposure to the groups above.¹ We have not engaged in these types of risky lending practices and instead have focused on building our financing business with prudence and deliberate focus on the client. Now, more than ever, our leading institutional clients demand a high-quality financing counterparty.</p><p>Our goal is to be the safest, easiest, and most trusted bridge to the cryptoeconomy. We offer the most secure, comprehensive, and scalable products and services — including financing — and our multifaceted risk management programs are designed to protect our clients, our shareholders, and the broader cryptoeconomy.</p><p>Prudent risk management is key to our long-term strategy.</p><p>At Coinbase, risk management is a first principle in our product design. <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/setting-the-record-straight-your-funds-are-safe-at-coinbase-and-always-will-be-f8cf2b588fd8">We hold customer assets 1:1</a>. Any institutional lending activity at Coinbase is at the discretion of the customer and backed by collateral, which serves as a first layer of protection against potential default contagion. Our standard practice is to require 100%+ in collateral, and we always measure risk against a substantially higher stressed price&nbsp;move.</p><p>As a result, we have a record&nbsp;of:</p>  no losses from our financing book,  no exposure to client or counterparty insolvencies,  no gating for client loan recalls or withdrawals, and  no changes in access to credit for our trading&nbsp;clients.  <p>We use the following principles to understand and manage counterparty credit&nbsp;risk.</p><p>This time isn’t different. This environment isn’t different. That’s why we rely on our risk team, which consists of professionals with decades of experience risk-managing financing businesses across a range of economic cycles. Specifically, our&nbsp;team:</p><p>Conducts rigorous due diligence. Counterparties are complicated relationships. Financial, business, and structural considerations form the baseline for credit risk management. Beyond that, a company’s behavior and actions must ultimately match their financial statements and stated business objectives. A management team should be experienced and competent and should, critically, implement checks and balances inside the organization.</p>  It is important to look the team in the eyes — figuratively, if not literally. A company is a group of people; don’t underestimate the importance of trust (but&nbsp;verify).  Base hits are more sustainable than home runs. Big wins are great, but in another market environment, could those have been big&nbsp;losses?  <p>Stress tests our exposures. Exposures take a variety of forms, so we evaluate them from a variety of perspectives: size, tenor, directionality, volatility, liquidity, concentration, and correlation to our counterparties’ health. We run Monte Carlo simulations to several standard deviations. Further, in a portfolio, assets and liabilities need to be matched together to mitigate liquidity risk and ensure there is no misalignment in the duration of our borrowing vs. loan making. And all this needs to happen continuously as the environment can change. When it does, the risk has&nbsp;changed.</p><p>Understands how things go wrong. Every product, trade, and counterparty has at least one potential point of failure. Every single one. We work to find it, calculate how bad it can be, and target our mitigants to the point of&nbsp;failure.</p><p>Anticipates internal deficiencies. The information we have about the future is always imperfect. There are no perfect models, and there are no perfect decisions. Reporting can be incomplete. People miss things, or give the benefit of the doubt. Processes fail. We manage our “known unknowns” and keep a buffer for “unknown unknowns.”</p><p>Anticipates external surprises. A mitigation plan is critical. As is knowing what might bring you back to the negotiating table. Leave room for Murphy’s law — and limit the size of risk wherever possible.</p><p>We think our careful risk management explains why institutional clients continue to diligently and actively explore our financing products, including during the recent market&nbsp;stress.</p><p>A healthy and well functioning financing market is essential to the expansion and sustainability of any economy. We believe well-designed risk management programs will help usher in new waves of capital and fuel the next expansion. A leading prime broker, whether in crypto or other asset classes, should understand and effectively manage counterparty and liquidity risk for the safety of their clients, shareholders, and the market. We&nbsp;do.</p><p>Ultimately, it may still take time for the broader industry to learn the right lessons from the systemic deficiencies we have seen.

 BlueYard x EthCC — (On|Off) Chain: Final&nbsp;Agenda <p>We are looking forward to welcoming an intimate group of portfolio family and guests to join us along with some of the leading thinkers and implementers in web3 to BlueYard x EthCC — (On|Off) Chain in Paris this Wednesday, July&nbsp;20th.</p><p>All participants will have received a confirmatory email and calendar invite by now — and unfortunately the event has reached capacity and we are unable to accept any further registrations. We appreciate your understanding if we were unable to host you this time, and hope to see you at the next&nbsp;one.</p> Final Agenda <p>15:00: Decentralized computation, storage, and the cutting edge of smart contract system design. Where is the line between smart contract virtual machines and other decentralized computation and data storage systems? What can and should run and be stored on-chain in the future? How do we choose? Lightning talks and group discussion with:</p>  Brooklyn Zelenka,&nbsp;<a href="https://fission.codes/">Fission</a>  Adrien Laversanne-Finot, <a href="https://massa.net/">Massa</a>  Ally Haire, <a href="https://fil.org/">Filecoin Foundation</a>  Dragan Zurzin, <a href="https://fvm.filecoin.io/">FileCoin&nbsp;VM</a>  <p>16:00: Demystifying ZKs and providing next steps for developers (reprogramming the brain).

What data should be on-chain vs off-chain? What are the tradeoffs being made between transparency and consent? What technologies and frameworks should we use to enable ownership of our data and how we represent ourselves online?

Verida Q2 2022&nbsp;Update<p>It’s been another huge quarter at Verida as we push the envelope of what’s possible in Web3. While the crypto market has been extremely volatile which has introduced new challenges across the sector, we remain incredibly optimistic and excited for the&nbsp;future.</p><p>As infrastructure builders, we’ve developed the rails to make the transition from Web2 to Web3 possible. One of the most fascinating parts is talking to projects at various stages on this spectrum, from early-stage through to large enterprises. These exciting conversations aren’t slowing&nbsp;down.</p><p>There are so many opportunities to assist Web2 companies transition to Web3, disrupt incumbents or create whole new industry verticals. Verida is proudly supporting an ever-growing pipeline of partner-led projects across a wide range of industry&nbsp;sectors.</p> Engineering  Vault <p>The Verida Vault is now available in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/verida-vault/id1546599632">iOS App Store</a> as a developer preview. There have been significant performance improvements made with the incorporation of faster encryption implementations. Operating speeds have improved from around 15 seconds to less than 2 seconds in some instances.</p><p>We launched our Web2 data onramp proof of concept where users can pull data from their Facebook and Twitter accounts. We’ll share more information on this in the coming&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>In addition, we&nbsp;have:</p>  Added support for additional testnet chains (NEAR and Ethereum)  Wallet Connect support on Ethereum and&nbsp;Algorand  Resolved critical issues that prevented an Android release (expected shortly)  Updated core application architecture to easily support more blockchains and increase&nbsp;security  Enhanced user onboarding options for developers integrating with the SSO&nbsp;SDK  Made significant improvements on testing capabilities.  <p>See this demo of current Vault capabilities:</p><p>In Q3, we’ll be working on expanding our multi-chain support to include Polygon and Polkadot blockchains, and further improving our user experience.</p> Protocol <p>The Verida protocol testnet is now running with first nodes operating in the USA and Australia. This is an important step in enabling truly decentralized and region-aware data storage to ensure regulatory compliance of personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>We’ve also been working iteratively to research, design and implement key components on our protocol&nbsp;roadmap.</p><p>This includes&nbsp;the:</p>  Design and implementation of the decentralized DID registry (release expected in&nbsp;Q3)  Research, design and implementation of meta transaction architecture for all Verida smart contracts (release expected in&nbsp;Q3)  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@verida/client-ts/v/1.1.15">Verida SDK release&nbsp;v1.1.15</a>  <a href="https://github.com/verida/vue-starter-kit/">Verida Vue starter kit</a> in developer preview  Adding a demo of requesting a user’s bridged Web2 data to the <a href="https://vault-examples.demos.verida.io">Vault Examples&nbsp;demo</a>.  <p>Looking forward, we’re working hard to release the decentralized service registry and naming service on testnet in&nbsp;Q3.</p> Developer Experience <p>We continue to expand our <a href="https://developers.verida.io/">developer documentation</a> and the <a href="https://developers.verida.io/docs/tutorial/introduction">interactive tutorials</a>. We’re also creating additional developer-friendly content such&nbsp;as:</p><p>Single Sign on developer walk-through video:</p><p>Data Storage developer walk-through video:</p><p>We also have a broad library of resources. For example, <a href="https://news.verida.io/where-should-web3-data-be-stored-4cb174a427">how to choose data storage for&nbsp;Web3</a>.</p><p>We’re always open to feedback and conversations, so we can improve our developer experience. Please share your insights and ideas with us in&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.verida.io">Discord</a>.</p> Ecosystem Growth <p>Verida is continuing to <a href="https://www.verida.io/ecosystem">grow our ecosystem</a>. We proudly welcome our new partners including:</p>  <a href="https://www.ettle.com/">Ettle</a> — Ettle is launching an Australian Dollar cash backed stablecoin (AUDE) that is fully banked and redeemable  <a href="https://www.cheqd.io/">cheqd</a> — cheqd is a decentralised network for data ownership and value creation, enabling individuals and organisations to take control of their&nbsp;data  <a href="https://debtdao.finance/">Debt DAO</a> — Debt DAO is creating a decentralized, permissionless marketplace to buy, sell, underwrite and manage debt for the DeFi&nbsp;economy  Verify My Signature — Verify My Signature directs customers to a provider of signature guarantees.  <p>Chris, Nick, Eric and Iryna from the Verida team travelled across the US from Consensus in Texas and Graph Conference in San Francisco to Polkadot in NYC. During the five weeks of travel, we met over 150 contacts, including ecosystem partners, VCs, and key Web3 thought leaders. These introductions are already leading into meaningful conversations and partnership opportunities.</p><p>Closing off Q2, we announced the launch of our <a href="https://news.verida.io/announcing-the-verida-credentials-incubator-the-inspiring-first-projects-coming-to-market-9ad8f1856e6b">Credentials Incubator</a>, providing a composable tech stack bringing together an ecosystem of partners innovating on credentials in&nbsp;Web3.</p> Operations <p>The crypto market has been volatile through Q2, with the collapse of Terra followed by liquidity and solvency issues with major centralised lenders. Verida didn’t have any exposure to Terra or these lenders and continues to maintain strong risk management practices in regards to custody and management of our&nbsp;funds.</p><p>We take our risk management practices seriously at Verida. Effective risk control, helps us control future issues by acting proactively rather than reactively. In a nascent sector like Web3, we believe this is an important capability to build project resilience and confidence for our stakeholders and community.</p><p>We recently undertook an independent risk review of our practices to assess our processes, internal controls and mitigation strategies. The intention was to identify gaps in our coverage across key risk areas in our business. The outcomes of the review will help us further strengthen our risk management practices.</p> Marketing and Community <p>Verida sponsored our first hackathon at Graph Hack in San Francisco.

 The Veil community is dear to us 

<p>At the Veil Project we consider all contributors to be part of the Veil family, whether an Original Generation team member, or one who joined us later, and they are very welcome to contribute again to Veil, whenever possible.</p>

<p>There are some staff who are no longer able to be involved as team members. codeofalltrades, dango and mados, we appreciate the work they have done, especially most recently, codeofalltrades, who has made significant contributions to the robustness of Veil’s core software. Cavespectre also has had to curtail his active development, as you may notice if checking Github.</p>

<p>While this blog has evidently been sadly neglected, it should change from this time onward. To catch up on other  staff changes, please welcome us77ipis (Github ID) Johns5937 (on Discord) for his recent and ongoing contributions as an evidently motivated Bounty Developer. We are currently considering a reduction in the ProgPow DAG GPU memory size and are aware of arguments for and against this. If you would like to weigh in on the subject, please feel free to join our Discord mining channel, and/or our Veil-Dev Discord if you are able to contribute to writing code and testing submissions on our test and development networks.</p>

<p>Also please welcome Zannick. Although we have not yet got around to creating a staff page for him, he has been a developer in the team since 2021, contributed some important bug fixes, reviewing other devs’ code submissions, and is working on the future RingCT staking upgrade.</p>

<p>Steel97 (Github ID) IVAN (on Discord), also no staff profile page yet, should be recognised for his neat replacement of the Veil block explorers, which brings efficiency improvements.</p>

 Light wallet is coming (with the Zelcore desktop wallet — later will be the mobile wallet) 

<p>Blondfrogs currently has a  major upgrade in progress for the inclusion of Veil in the awesome Zelcore wallet. This is a light wallet, so it does not require the Veil user to maintain the full blockchain history on their own computer. Furthermore, Veil’s inclusion will be using RingCT anonymous transactions! When this is available, it will be announced in our NEWS updates. Although Blondfrogs is an OG Veil developer, this submission he is working on is done in his capacity as a developer for the Zelcore team, so he is not expected, although is very welcome, to do other regular contributions to Veil’s code.</p>

  Brave's new system STAR protects user privacy by ensuring the data users contribute are never unique to that user. This property, sometimes called k-anonymity, ensures that the data collector can only see a submitted value if the same value has also been submitted by some number of other users.

<p>This is the nineteenth post in an <a>ongoing, regular series</a> describing new and upcoming privacy features in Brave. This post describes work done by Alex Davidson, Peter Snyder, eV Quirk, Joseph Genereux, Benjamin Livshits, and Hamed Haddadi. This post was written by Senior Director of Privacy Peter Snyder.</p>
<p>Researchers at Brave have developed <a>STAR</a><a>1</a>, a system that allows users to participate in private data collection, under cryptographic guarantees that their data will be readable only if other users have contributed the exact same values. Such systems are important for performing privacy-protecting, Web-scale measurements of software (sometimes referred to as analytics or telemetry).</p>
<p>STAR’s main goals are to provide strong privacy guarantees while still being usable and affordable for small-to-medium sized companies. Existing systems<a>2</a> are extremely expensive to deploy (making them unusable for all but the largest companies), require trusted third-parties or special hardware, and/or require millions of users to achieve useful results. STAR, by contrast, provides privacy guarantees similar to, or better than, existing systems, while being practical and affordable for projects and organizations serving anywhere from dozens to millions of users.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10074">STAR system</a> will be presented at the <a href="https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2022/">2022 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS)</a> in Los Angeles, and is being discussed for possible standardization in the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-dss-star/">IETF</a>. STAR is available in an <a href="https://github.com/brave/sta-rs">open source Rust implementation</a>, and will be used to protect user privacy in many current and future Brave products.</p>

 Privacy-preserving data collection through k-anonymity&nbsp; 
<p>Collecting data on how software is used in detail can be helpful for both developers and users. Developers can use this information to fix bugs and optimize code; users benefit from better software.</p>
<p>But capturing this user data carries the ethical and often legal responsibility of collecting it in a privacy preserving way. We emphasize that collecting data in a privacy-protecting manner is a necessary, but not sufficient, part of ethical data collection. Users should always be in control and aware when contributing data.</p>
<p>Brave’s new system STAR protects user privacy by ensuring the data users contribute are never unique to that user. This property, sometimes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity">k-anonymity</a>, ensures that the data collector can only see a submitted value if the same value has also been submitted by some number of other users. K-anonymity (and thus the STAR system) prevents the data collector from ever seeing values that are unique—this means the values can’t be used to identify users.</p>
<p>K-anonymity is one of many approaches for ensuring privacy during data collection<a>3</a>, each with different strengths and weaknesses. STAR adopts k-anonymity because:</p>
 
 It embodies an easy to understand approach to privacy. 
 It successfully allows the data collector to learn the “heavy hitters” (i.e., the most commonly shared values) without requiring very large user bases. 
 The applications targeted by STAR are not the kinds of cases where k-anonymity systems have been attacked in the past. 
 

 A simple k-anonymity example: ice cream 
<p>As an example of how k-anonymity protects user privacy, consider this fake example:</p>
<p>An organization wants to learn about their employees’ favorite ice cream flavor. But people only want to participate in this ice-cream survey if they’re assured the organization can’t learn whether they voted. Participants want anonymity.</p>
<p>People who cast ballots for chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry (or other common flavors) aren’t at risk—many&nbsp; people like these flavors, so the organization can’t learn much about who voted, if they voted for a common flavor.</p>
<p>However, votes for uncommon flavors of ice cream do risk revealing who gave that answer. If everyone knows a person’s favorite flavor of ice cream is olive—and if that person completed the survey—the organization will be pretty confident about who submitted that answer.</p>
<p>With k-anonymity, the “olive” answer would be removed before the data is ever analyzed.</p>
<p>At essence, k-anonymity is an approach to data collection that builds on the ice cream example: It allows the party collecting data to see common, popular values, but does not allow the data collector to see rare (and therefore potentially identifying) values.</p>

 K-anonymity is difficult in practice 
<p>K-anonymity is simple in concept, but difficult to build in practice. For example, who decides (and how) which values are common or rare without revealing the potentially identifying values in the first place?</p>
<p>One sub-optimal option would be to let a neutral third-party count the values first, before those values are shared with the data collector. But that only introduces a “shell game” of trusting privacy to the third-party instead of the data collector; the same privacy risk still exists.</p>
<p>There are many other similar difficulties when trying to implement real-world k-anonymity systems.</p>
<p>With STAR, we’ve found a way to achieve k-anonymity without these suboptimal verifications.</p>

 STAR achieves k-anonymity cheaply and securely 
<p>STAR is a practical, effective, and cheap way to build data collection systems that protect k-anonymity. STAR differs from existing systems by being the first deployed system to achieve each of the following goals:</p>
<p>Cheap to deploy: STAR is extremely fast and does not require special hardware. This means that STAR can be deployed by everything from small hobbyist projects to large, multi-million-user software projects. In our simulations, STAR is 24 times cheaper than the existing state-of-the-art approach<a>4</a>.</p>
<p>Easy to understand: STAR uses a unique combination of existing, vetted, and well understood cryptographic tools (i.e., symmetric encryption to encrypt data, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir's_Secret_Sharing">Shamir secret sharing</a> to enforce k-anonymity, and verifiable oblivious pseudorandom functions to boost randomness). Using existing cryptographic tools (rather than relying on novel cryptographic primitives) means more people can safely implement, deploy, and audit STAR systems.</p>
<p>Strong privacy guarantees: STAR delivers privacy similar or superior to existing state-of-the-art systems, including fallback protections in the case of server compromise<a>5</a>.</p>
<p>Accurate results with small user bases: STAR provides strong accuracy guarantees, even with small numbers of users. This is unlike other existing approaches<a>6</a> that provide accurate results only when thousands or millions of users contribute results.</p>
<p>Doesn’t require special hardware: STAR runs on standard computing hardware, and can thus be deployed on personal servers, standard cloud infrastructure, or any other stock hardware. This ensures STAR can be used by more projects, especially those with smaller budgets (unlike some existing systems that rely on special “trusted” hardware, such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/">AWS Nitro</a> or <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/software-guard-extensions/overview.html">Intel SGX</a>).</p>

 Using STAR to protect user privacy 
<p>Brave has developed STAR as a practical, real-world focused system for improving user privacy. While we hope others will use STAR to protect privacy in their own projects, the primary aim was to allow users to share data with Brave in a way that still preserves privacy.</p>
<p>To that end, Brave is making three commitments with STAR:</p>
<p>First, Brave will use STAR in its own products, in cases where we give users the option to allow data collection. For example, Brave’s <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409406835469-What-is-the-Web-Discovery-Project-">Web Discovery Project</a> uses a form of STAR to allow users to share browsing information to help build the Brave Search index. Similarly, we’ve incorporated STAR into the <a>“Privacy Preserving Product Analytics” (P3A)</a> system that allows users to share browser usage data with Brave.</p>
<p>More important, even with STAR’s protections, Brave users will always have the option not to share data with Brave. STAR is intended only to add additional privacy protections to data that users want to share, rather than to allow Brave to collect more data about users.</p>
<p>Second, Brave is developing STAR in the open, for other projects to use, adopt, or modify as they choose. Brave maintains both <a href="https://github.com/brave/sta-rs">Rust</a> and <a href="https://github.com/brave/sta-rs/blob/main/star-wasm/src/lib.rs">WASM</a> versions of STAR, and both are published under the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/">Mozilla Public License v2</a>.</p>
<p>Third, Brave is working to standardize STAR in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as part of the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/ppm/about/">Privacy Preserving Measurements</a> working group. Our goal is to ensure that there is a standards-based way for small organizations to collect data in a privacy-respecting way.</p>
<p>For specifics on how STAR works, and how it delivers k-anonymity protections safely and efficiently, <a>please see our full research paper</a>.</p>

<p>This tutorial will guide you through the process of becoming a validator. Shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/EasyNode">EasyNode</a> for helping us put together this brief tutorial. Here’s a link to <a href="https://easynode.pro/links">learn&nbsp;more</a>.</p><p>Hardware Requirements:</p><p>To run a node, here are the basic requirements you’ll need to meet with your&nbsp;machine.</p>  Minimum: 8GB RAM, 2 Core CPU, 100GB Hard&nbsp;Disk  Recommended: 16GB RAM, 4 Core CPU, 300GB Hard&nbsp;Disk  <p>Recommended Computing Requirements</p><p>Many people recommend cloud computing because they have backup systems and emergency systems in place in case there’s a loss of power or some other malfunction. Using a cloud service ensures you’re always running and won’t suffer slashing penalties for being off-line. Otherwise, you’ll need to tend your node or nodes and make sure they are constantly online and&nbsp;running.</p><p>Here are the recommended parameters:</p>  AWS T3 t3.2xlarge  AliCloud g6 g6.2xlarge  GCP n2 n2-standard-8   <a href="https://wiki.findora.org/docs/guides/auto-setup">Automated Setup</a>  Step 1 — Docker <p>You need to install Docker onto your server before you can do either an Auto or Manual&nbsp;install.</p> Step 2 — Set up the Findora Node&nbsp;Tool   fn: Download the Findora Node Setup (fn) which is a CLI tool with sub-commands necessary to set up a validator node and stake/unstake FRA.  <a href="https://wiki.findora.org/bin/linux/fn">Linux version</a>  <a href="https://wiki.findora.org/bin/macos/fn">MacOS version</a>  <p>Download Instructions:</p><p># download and move to your&nbsp;path</p><p>wget <a href="https://wiki.findora.org/bin/linux/fn">https://wiki.findora.org/bin/linux/fn</a></p><p>chmod +x&nbsp;fn</p><p>mv fn /usr/local/bin/</p> Step 3 — Download Wallet and Generate a Private&nbsp;Key <p>Staking and validating on Findora will require a <a href="https://wallet.findora.org/">Findora Wallet</a> where you can store and stake your&nbsp;FRA.</p><p>Once you have downloaded your wallet and safely stored your mnemonic phrase and private key, generate a new, random pair of public and private keys for your node which will get used for staking your&nbsp;FRA:</p><p>fn genkey &gt; tmp.gen.keypair</p><p>View the contents of your tmp.gen.keypair file via the command&nbsp;below:</p><p>cat tmp.gen.keypair</p><p>Note: Before proceeding further, the staking private key should be stored in file /data/findora/{network_name}/{network_name}_node.key. This will be the sec_key in your tmp.gen.keypair file. You will need to create this directory if it doesn’t&nbsp;exist.</p> Step 4 — Download and run the automated setup&nbsp;script   <a href="https://wiki.findora.org/assets/files/node_init_testnet-7b83468109bd605cb2551040b81943e2.sh">node_init_testnet.sh</a>  <a href="https://wiki.findora.org/assets/files/node_init_mainnet-423a36f2adaaeab9de7ff63e61d3d4c1.sh">Node_init_mainnet.sh</a>  <p>Code to&nbsp;copy:</p><p>`example: bash -x node_init_testnet.sh`</p> Step 5 — Setup fn CLI&nbsp;tool <p>To configure fn for use on&nbsp;Mainnet:</p><p>fn setup -S <a href="https://prod-mainnet.prod.findora.org">https://prod-mainnet.prod.findora.org</a></p><p>Connect your staking key (now stored inside `node.mnemonic`) to fn. This allows fn to sign transactions on your behalf. For&nbsp;example</p><p>ex)</p><p># fn setup -O ${ROOT_DIR}/node.mnemonic</p><p>fn setup -O &lt;Path to the mnemonic of your node&gt; || exit&nbsp;1</p><p>Connect your Node Key to fn. For&nbsp;example:</p><p># fn setup -K ${ROOT_DIR}/tendermint/config/priv_validator_key.json</p><p>fn setup -K &lt;path to validator key&gt; || exit&nbsp;1</p> Step 6 — Fund Your Validator <p>Findora validators are required to stake a minimum of 10,000 FRA to register as a validator. Before you can stake FRA to your validator, you must first transfer FRA to the Findora Address (i.e. UTXO wallet address) of your validator.</p>  Transfer FRA from an existing Findora wallet to your Findora Address). If you want to buy FRA, <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation/tutorial-1-how-to-buy-smart-fra-on-kucoin-beneficial-to-findora-760190ebd483">here’s a tutorial breakdown of how to buy FRA from&nbsp;Kucoin</a>  Only the top 100 validators (with the most FRA staked) will earn FRA&nbsp;rewards.  Before staking, wait for 100% data synchronization of your validator node or else, you may be charged a ‘validator node offline’ penalty&nbsp;fee.   Step 7 — Node Operations <p>Besides node setup, the fn tool is also used for general validator staking operations such as staking FRA into the validator, setting the commission rate the validator charges, transferring FRA balances on the validator to another wallet address, and claiming FRA&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>To see the list of all subcommands under fn use the — help&nbsp;flag:</p><p>fn — help</p><p>To get detailed info about a specific sub-command, like stake, use the — help&nbsp;flag.</p> Step 8 — Stake Initial FRA and Set Commission Rate <p>After receiving FRA to your validator’s Findora Address, you must stake a minimum of 10,000 FRA to be a validator. Only the top 100 validators (with the most FRA staked) will earn FRA&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Tips:</p><p>Before staking, wait for 100% data synchronization of your validator node or, you may be charged a ‘validator node offline’ penalty&nbsp;fee.</p><p>For example:</p><p>To stake 999,999 FRAs with a commission rate of 2% (and validator name of Validator_Pool_A) your Staker Memo file should be like this (Note: that is 999999 * 1000000 FRA&nbsp;units):</p><p># -</p><p># -</p><p>cat staker_memo</p><p>{</p><p>“name”: “ExampleNode”,</p><p>“desc”: “I am just a example description, please change&nbsp;me.”,</p><p>“website”: “https://www.example.com",</p><p>“logo”: “https://www.example.com/logo"</p><p>}</p><p>fn stake -n $((999999 * 1000000)) -R 0.02 -M “$(cat staker_memo)”</p> Step 9 — Stake Additional FRA <p>You can always stake more FRA. Below is an example of how to increase your stake with 2,000&nbsp;FRA:</p><p># To stake an additional 2,000 FRA to your validator</p><p>fn stake -a -n $((2000 * 1000000))</p> Step 10 — View Node Information <p>To find information about your validator node, use the fn show command. Sample output is&nbsp;below:</p> Step 11 — Claim FRA&nbsp;Rewards <p>The top 100 validators will earn block rewards. If your validator is a top 100 validator, it will earn rewards which will show up in the rewards: section of fn&nbsp;show.</p><p>If your reward balance is greater than 0, you can claim your earned rewards via the fn claim sub-command</p><p># fn claim -n &lt;the amount of FRA units you&nbsp;want&gt;</p><p># ex)</p><p># If you have a reward balance of 20 FRA (i.e. “rewards: 20000000”)</p><p># and wish to claim 10 FRA (out of 20 FRA), issue the command&nbsp;below:</p><p>fn claim -n $((10 * 1000000))</p> How to Unstake Your&nbsp;FRA <p>Unstake Some of Your FRA&nbsp;by:</p><p># fn unstake -n &lt;the amount of FRA units you&nbsp;want&gt;</p><p># ex)</p><p># To unstake 900 FRA (ie. 900 *&nbsp;1000000)</p><p>fn unstake -n $((900 * 1000000))</p> Close Validator and Unstake All of Your&nbsp;FRA <p>NOTE: This operation will unstake all of your FRA and remove your node from the Findora&nbsp;Network.</p><p># fn&nbsp;unstake</p><p>Please visit <a href="https://wiki.findora.org/docs/guides/auto-setup">Findora Wiki</a> for additional information.</p><p><a href="https://guides.easynode.one/findora">Easy Node</a></p><p>The Findora DAO’s mission is to help our community to understand and utilize Findora’s ecosystem tools.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation/findaora-validator-tutorial-d708c7c9f253">FinDAOra | Validator Tutorial 💜</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation">Findora Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Coinbase secures Crypto Asset Service Provider approval in Italy&nbsp;🇮🇹</p><p>Tl;Dr: By meeting the regulatory requirements, Coinbase will continue to offer crypto services in Italy, and has a clear path to bring new products and features to market in the&nbsp;country.</p><p>By Nana Murugesan, Vice President, International and Business Development</p><p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/building-across-europe-c4ef51f62509">As discussed in our recent blog post</a>, Coinbase is committed to bringing the power of our full product suite to customers across Europe. Today, we’re able to announce a key milestone in that journey: securing approval from Italian regulators to provide ongoing crypto services to its residents. The new requirement implemented by the Organismo Agenti e Mediatori (OAM), mandated that all companies offering crypto trading, custody or other services, meet set criteria. We’re proud to be among the first companies to meet these benchmarks.</p><p>Coinbase serves customers across almost 40 European countries through dedicated hubs in Ireland, the UK, and Germany. We are in the process of strengthening our presence across Europe and have registrations or license applications in progress in several major markets in compliance with local regulations. In each of these markets, our goal is to grow our customer base by launching the Coinbase suite of retail, institutional, and ecosystem products.</p><p>“Building a constructive relationship with regulators in every jurisdiction in which we operate is incredibly important as we march toward our mission of increasing economic freedom in every corner of the world. Gaining this regulatory approval is a testament to our close collaboration and positive working relationship with the Italian financial regulators. As we continue to grow across Europe and other regions, maintaining our strong regulatory relationships will ensure that we will continue to bring to market the products that our customers want, through the most trusted and secure platform in the cryptoeconomy.” Nana Murugesan, Vice President, International and Business Development.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-secures-crypto-asset-service-provider-approval-in-italy-6cc78516bf66">Coinbase secures Crypto Asset Service Provider approval in Italy 🇮🇹</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com">The Coinbase Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>If you are acquainted with the everyday actuality of the crypto space, you surely have heard of staking. You likely also hold some staking misconceptions that need to change ASAP.<br></p><p>Besides being one out of several ways to earn passive income in crypto, staking is a vital piece of the blockchain puzzle. It keeps blockchain networks secure, allows the average user to participate in governing crypto ecosystems, and (as we’ll see below) much more.</p> What is staking in crypto? <p>The average observer who comes across the term 'staking' may assume it is a concept related to gambling. Indeed, the word 'stake' is used in betting circles to describe monies or properties placed on a bet. When you stake a certain amount on an outcome, you stand to earn rewards in multiples of the amount staked if your bet wins. If you remove the stake, on the other hand, the bet is canceled, and you will not earn any returns even if the bet wins.<br></p><p>Staking is a tad different in the crypto space. The term staking first emerged from the concept of the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/">proof-of-stake</a> consensus mechanism. However, it is worth noting that the term staking is increasingly used in a flexible, somewhat confusing way. This article will focus on clearing out staking misconceptions, confusion, and different meanings associated with the term staking.<br></p><p>Let's start with understanding the concept of proof-of-stake, where it all originated.<br></p> The origins –staking in proof-of-stake (PoS) networks<br> <p>Proof-of-stake is one out of several consensus mechanisms through which the participants of a distributed ledger can achieve the consensus needed to secure a common state of the network. A proof-of-stake blockchain network has several kinds of participants, such as users, delegators, validators, developers, etc. Staking involves validators and delegators.<br></p><p>To become <a href="https://phemex.com/academy/blockchain-validator-process'">validators</a> (and receive rewards for it) in a proof-of-stake network, users are required to lock up the network’s native asset in a smart contract. This process is called staking. Besides locking up their assets, validators are also required to store a copy of the network’s ledger and keep it updated as per network rules. <br></p><p>Additionally, there are often a number of assets required to be locked to participate as a staker. For example, in the upcoming Ethereum proof-of-stake network Beacon chain, users are required to lock at least 32 ETH to become validators.<br></p>Diagram showcasing the rewards associated with the staking process (<a href="https://cryptolad.co/how-to-stake-crypto/">Source</a>).<p>Validators are rewarded with tokens issued by the protocol’s inflationary mechanism. Similarly, validators can be penalized for not following the rules of the network. Thus, the process of staking incentivizes the validators to act honestly and follow the network’s protocols.<br></p><p>To directly participate in staking, a user needs to hold coins in a <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/get-started/custodial-non-custodial-bitcoin-wallets/">non-custodial wallet</a> and enter them into the staking contract, sometimes for a fixed period. <br></p><p>Users can also participate in staking indirectly through centralized exchanges (we’ll dive into this in a bit), which pool together funds from different users. It’s worth noting here that staking on centralized exchanges is done in a custodial manner. This means that the centralized exchanges act as a third-party responsible for the safety of tokens. Centralized staking can be both convenient (since it reduces the minimum entry level for users) and inconvenient (since users need to pay a commission and transfer ownership of their tokens), depending on each person’s preferences.<br></p><p>However, even in PoS staking, there’s a common misconception that all networks follow the same structure.<br></p> Staking misconception #1: not all PoS staking is equal<br> <p>So far, we’ve covered PoS staking focusing on Ethereum as an example. However, this is far from being the only model.<br></p><p>Some protocols also offer soft staking, where users do not need to lock their coins to earn rewards (e.g., <a href="https://www.algorand.com/">Algorand</a>). The protocol distributes rewards to active stakers according to an estimated annual percentage yield/rate. Algorand users are paid staking rewards for each new block by simply holding ALGO tokens in their wallets.<br></p><p>Some blockchain networks that use a PoS consensus mechanism also allow validators to participate in governance decisions that drive progress in the ecosystem. Crypto staking has evolved from a method of securely recording transactions to also facilitating governance and other features.<br></p><p>We should also note that to participate in staking to secure a network, users don’t necessarily need to actively participate in block validation. They in turn delegate their stake to validators in a non-custodial manner to earn staking rewards without active participation. This is called delegated proof-of-stake (dPoS).<br></p> Governance staking<br> <p>Governance staking requires users to “invest” in a protocol –a blockchain network, a DeFi protocol, etc– by means of purchasing its governance token. Users can then earn rewards for staking their coins, which also entitles them to governance votes, often directly proportional to the number of tokens staked. <br></p>Diagram showing blockchain governance process (<a href="https://www.mphasis.com/home/thought-leadership/blog/crypto-governance-adopting-a-decentralized-approach-to-governance.html">Source</a>).<p>Governance staking offers users a chance to participate in the governing of the projects they believe in, taking an active role in decision-making. By participating in governance, average users can shape the future of their favorite <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io">crypto projects</a> and still earn rewards for staking. Governance staking can happen in PoS and dPoS networks, protocols hosted on top of them, and even in centralized protocols. As you’ll see, this is key to understanding the many shapes the word “staking” can take.<br></p> Other common staking misconceptions <p>One of the main misconceptions of staking is, as we’ve mentioned, thinking that all staking is exactly the same. <br></p><p>You may have encountered mechanisms inspired by proof-of-stake staking in <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/institutional-defi-the-next-big-thing-a5b07193232b/">DeFi protocols</a>. Concepts like liquidity staking (staking to earn rewards for providing liquidity) and yield farming (staking one asset, sometimes interest-bearing assets, to earn rewards in another) draw inspiration from PoS staking and have become mainstream in the crypto space, with <a href="https://defillama.com/">billions of dollars</a> committed to protocols globally. <br></p><p>Although many might know exactly what each protocol refers to when mentioning staking, there are still a few misconceptions about the concept and what it entails.<br></p> Staking misconception #2: same name, different uses<br> <p>As we saw above, even in PoS chains, not all staking opportunities are created equally.<br></p><p>Even though the term staking originated from the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, the term staking has various meanings nowadays. For example, you could stake MATIC to earn rewards on Binance (a centralized exchange), stake ETH to become a validator on the Ethereum network, or even stake Curve tokens to participate in their protocol’s governance. Therefore, it’s important to clear up what each of these different projects actually mean.<br></p><p>On a broader level, the main difference between the many types of staking lies in the nature of each protocol. Blockchain networks incentivize users to stake to secure the network and validate transactions, issuing rewards to those helping validate news blocks. On the other hand, DeFi protocols do not need to validate blocks but strive for liquidity and <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/total-value-locked-tvl">total-value-locked</a> (TVL), so they encourage and incentivize liquidity staking. Centralized exchanges care about making a profit, and they can do so through fees, commissions, or finding creative ways to leverage the assets you deposit in them. <br></p>Risks of liquidity and lending staking vs. protocol staking. (<a href="https://www.figment.io/resources/misconceptions-about-staking-protocol-staking-vs-liquidity-lending">Source</a>)<p>All of the different mechanisms above utilize the same name and issue rewards, but they have different structures and ultimate goals. Therefore, you can define staking as a system in which a protocol issue rewards to users in exchange for them putting their holdings of selected tokens in stake. As we have mentioned this could be for any of the different purposes each protocol may have.</p> Staking misconception #3: losing and making money<br> <p>Another common misconception is that you can’t lose money through staking. Users tend to equate a staking program with the idea that, even if their assets depreciate, staking rewards will ultimately cover any reduction in the initial value of the coins staked. Not only is this belief misleading, but it is also financially irresponsible. You can earn valuable passive income, but also lose money in crypto staking.<br></p><p>This is true even when it comes to dPoS or PoS staking. If a validator fails to maintain network security or behaves dishonestly, they may lose a percentage of their stake through slashing. Also, crypto prices experience high volatility, and most proof-of-stake protocols do not allow immediate unstaking. To name a famous example, users who staked <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/4-valuable-lessons-from-terras-collapse-opinion/">LUNA</a> before the coin's price fell dramatically lost billions of dollars and could not unstake in time to not sell at a loss.<br></p> Is staking crypto safe? Benefits and risks <p>Just like all endeavors in the crypto space, staking has its upsides and potential downsides. Some of them are: <br></p> Benefits of staking   Governance: From voting on Treasury distributions to new hires, token holders can have a say in determining the project's direction and help shape its future. This, in theory, should inform protocols to make better product decisions and serve its community better over the long term.<br>  Rewards: Users can earn rewards proportional to the value of the staked coins. Projects incentivize staking as if to say 'thank you for continuing to be a part of this project and believing in us.' Some staking programs also give users access to tokens they can then use to unlock their staked principal or even deploy to the DeFi ecosystem.   Staking risks   Crypto prices are highly volatile. Therefore, in staking, users need to worry about potential downward price swings that may result in significant losses, outweighing any earned rewards.<br>  Staking and unstaking periods, which can cause liquidity problems for some users.<br>  In the case of centralized staking, not holding control over one’s coins.<br>  In the case of delegated proof-of-stake systems, users risk losing their tokens to slashing if their designated validator misbehaves.<br>  Just like in every crypto project, users run a risk of their designated project (centralized or decentralized) being hacked, exploited, or disappearing. <br>   Is staking crypto taxable? Let’s look at the precedents <p>Crypto staking generates passive income for users. Yet, the authorities have not finished deciding on whether staking rewards are taxable or how they should be taxed. Firstly, regulations differ from country to country. In the United States, the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/02/25/why-we-still-need-guidance-on-staking-rewards-taxation/">Internal Revenue Service</a> does not have a definite position on the tax regulations specific to staking rewards. However, the regulator has a clear stance on earnings that should be classified under an individual's gross income.<br></p><p>According to the Internal Revenue Code, paying for services and interests is part of an individual's gross income. Now, the IRS views staking rewards as compensation for validating a network or interests received for participation. Either way, staking rewards are classified as gross income and are therefore, taxable. <br></p><p>In the famous <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/shehanchandrasekera/2022/03/07/crypto-couples-victory-against-the-irs-comes-at-the-cost-of-regulatory-clarity/?sh=2fcb7ac748f9">Jarretts case</a>, the IRS refunded taxes collected from Tezos staking rewards. The Jarretts' lawyers argued that staking rewards were neither compensation for validating networks nor interests earned. Instead, they claimed that staking rewards were newly created assets. This, they argued, made the tokens alike an artist's painting, which is also taxable when sold, not upon receipt.<br></p><p>However, while several crypto accounts on social media used the Jarretts' case as a reference to prove that staking rewards should not be taxed, certain factors may render the judgment meaningless in the long run. <br></p><p>Firstly, a District Court heard the case, not a Tax Court. Also, since the Jarretts did not accept the refund, the case will go on trial in 2023. The IRS will push for clearer legislation, which may set a federal precedent that could render the Jarretts' argument null and void.<br></p><p>The discussion around tax laws on staking rewards will continue. The IRS, on one side, believes that staking rewards count as gross income upon creation. Crypto stakeholders (conveniently) argue that these new <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/the-bull-case-for-zkp-from-token-agnostic-privacy-to-full-user-empowerment-in-web-3-2af9c6b0010b/">tokens</a> are created, not earned as interest or compensation, which makes them only taxable when sold.</p> What else is staking good for? <p>As we described throughout the article, there are many other things that can be done by staking. Since staking is basically locking up your tokens in exchange for rewards (whether they come in the form of tokens, governance participation, or something else) this showcases your commitment and investment in a project.<br></p><p>The novelty of staking as a concept and of the crypto ecosystem as a whole makes it likely that we will continue to discover new functionalities of staking. The possibilities are, in a sense, infinite. For example, Panther aims to release a staking system through which users can mint private versions of their assets in MASPs (Multi-Asset Shielded Pools), allowing users to break the on-chain link and transact privately. &nbsp;If you’d like to learn more about this system and participate in Wave 3 of Incentivized Advanced Staking, you can do so by reading this <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wave-3-of-incentivized-advanced-staking-testing-begins-on-july-7th/">blog post</a>.</p> In summary: staking misconceptions won’t go away, but now you know better. <p>As networks like Ethereum transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, it’s unlikely that staking will ever go away. Staking in crypto has its fair share of benefits and risks, yet, it is a reliable passive income generator for users with long-term goals and helps drive active participation in the crypto space. It also helps projects incentivize users to hold on to their tokens as opposed to selling them, which in turn encourages healthier market dynamics.<br></p><p>When it comes to staking misconceptions, it is unlikely that they will fully go away –after all, the diversity of staking solutions will likely continue to increase. However, we hope this article served its purpose: informing you of a powerful general-purpose tool, its background, and how to interact and benefit from it.<br></p><p>If you’re interested in more articles like this, please sign up to receive the Panther newsletter!

<p>Yesterday I was feeling frustrated with the digital world and picked up a book that had just come in the mail:&nbsp; Alexandra Rutherford’s “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Beyond-the-Box-Skinner-Technology-of-Life.pdf">Beyond the Box: B.F. Skinner’s Technology of Behavior from Laboratory to Life, 1950s-1970s</a>.” As I got to the chapter on token economies at <a href="http://www.carolyar.com/Illinois/Misc/Anna.htm">Anna State Mental Hospital in Illinois</a>, it all became crystal clear – the dopamine hits of social media are the tokens. They use them to program us.</p>
<p>So, I decided to back-off my social media footprint even further and rework what I imagine “success” to be. I keep telling myself it’s not a numbers game; it’s an intention game. My friend Cliff taught me that; he’s a smart guy, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKR1kKh86sA">check out his channel</a>. So now I have to have the gumption to put that belief into practice, even though I’ll admit it’s hard letting go of the idea that you have some big audience out there somewhere. None of it it is real, though, just a reflection.</p>
<p>I’m in the process of downloading an archive of my 20,000+ Tweets and will be deactivating @philly852 this weekend. Let people know if they wonder where I went. I do quietly hope some people will notice that I’ve gone despite the intense shadow-banning. Jason is working on a space housed on the blog where people who really want to unpack what I’ve been researching regarding mixed reality and gamified social impact finance can gather to compare notes. We’ll do a video about it once we have it up and running. I’m hoping we can store my tweets on the blog, because there are a lot of good links to primary source material for those who may be inclined to follow the trail we’ve been blazing.</p>
<p>The video below is a bit of a grumpy outpouring, but I do go on to read two of the chapters of the book aloud with commentary. The comment section is very lively, too! This is actually really important stuff and highly relevant. We don’t have to look to China or Tel Aviv or London – a lot of this mess was cooked up right in Cambridge, MA by the likes of Fred and his many colleagues intent on devising technologies to manipulate rats, pigeons, and beagles to do their bidding. Sometimes that involved steering bombs and being irradiated to death.</p>
<p>If you want to read it yourself, the link above is to a PDF of the book.</p>

<p>We would like to congratulate Cody Burns for his election to the Zcash Community Grants committee. Professionally, Cody is an enterprise blockchain architect at a professional technology consulting firm where he focuses on multi-party systems, digital identity, and works on implementing zero-knowledge systems at scale. Cody has worked with distributed systems since the early 2000’s in the US military (leaving government service in 2009) and he has worked publicly with cryptocurrencies since 2014. Cody is currently a board member of the Ethereum Classic cooperative and a participating member of the Ethereum Enterprise alliance. Cody’s stated motivation for candidacy in the ZCG committee is to advance projects which are legitimate in business purpose, technical aptitude, and are an advancement to the Zcash ecosystem. Cody is familiar with the needs and requirements of enterprise blockchain and security considerations and he views Zcash as being at the bleeding edge of distributed systems funding. All of us at the Foundation are looking forward to working with Cody.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Foundation would like to thank Hudson for his contributions to Zcash. Hudson is a talented individual who has played an active role within the Zcash ecosystem, sitting on the ZCG committee (previously known as the Zcash Open Major Grants) for two terms. Hudson has been instrumental in helping the committee form and we look forward to his continued engagement in the Zcash ecosystem.</p>
<p>The Foundation would also like to thank all <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/37e58fc6-f224-11ec-bf24-f6d18567a65e/voters/list">ZCAP members that participated in this election</a> process. This poll had the highest turnout (92%) of any ZCAP poll to date, and we hope we can continue this trend as we work to expand the ZCAP.</p>

         The Listeners                <p>By Lacy Warner</p><p>Photography: MARK DAVIS</p><p>Published July 14, 2022</p>            <p>For Deepika Bodapati and Tanay Tandon of Athelas, paying attention is a superpower.</p>       



 
 
   
<p>Four years ago, Deepika Bodapati was up late, staring at her computer and doing something rather unusual for a founder of a startup soon to achieve unicorn status: she was reading all the support tickets that came through her company, Athelas’, website. “Once in a while, we’ll have our employees’ parents write in,” Bodapati says with a laugh. “But I read every single thing because I just thought it was super interesting.” As Bodapati waded through the queries and suggestions, studying how her sales team handled issues, she noticed one woman, Dr. Deanna Kelley, writing in again and again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She was very persistent,” Bodapati recalls. Dr. Kelly, Chief and Director of the Treatment Research Program at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center, was asking to study the Athelas One device, claiming she could help Bodapati further develop and test the machine. Bodapati knew that she and her co-founder, Tanay Tandon, were looking at an arduous application process for their second FDA clearance and would need all the support they could get. So Bodapati did what she was best at: she picked up the phone and listened to what Dr. Kelly had to say. This approach has come to define her ability to build both a better product and a better business.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Listening has always been central to Bodapati’s creative process. Listening closely to both the data and her intuition led to the Athelas One, which is the only FDA-approved, internet-connected finger-prick device that tests white blood cell and neutrophil counts at home and then shares that information directly with healthcare providers. The Athelas One is a small black cylinder, similar in appearance to an Alexa device. In a traditional lab, pathologists take a drop of blood, put it on a slide, smear and stain it and place it under a microscope to determine cell counts. Athelas One uses computer vision and machine learning to automate the process, and then sends the information to a healthcare team. Athelas is a leader in producing portable devices for remote patient monitoring (RPM), a growing sector of the global healthcare market that may be worth more than $175.2 billion by 2027. The need for such an industry was revealed during the pandemic, but RPM can benefit anyone from patients with chronic diseases who need to consistently track their medical data, to elderly or disabled individuals for whom a trip to the doctor’s office can be cumbersome.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As lifelong scientists, the founders knew Athelas One needed data proving, beyond doubt, that it worked consistently and accurately; as entrepreneurs, they knew a trial, as soon as possible, would be essential for the company’s development. When the duo participated in Y Combinator, they found themselves among a handful of potential competitors—but none of them had run a clinical trial yet. Bodapati and Tandon knew this could make them stand out to potential customers, partners and collaborators. “There was no option,” Bodapati says. “There would be no company if there was no trial.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Setting up a clinical trial is complicated, and, through an acquaintance, Bodapati had a lead on a hospital in Juarez, Mexico, a city of 1.5 million across the border from El Paso, Texas. In 2016, Bodapati and Tandon conducted their first clinical trial for Athelas One.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bodapati says that the hospital instantly saw the value in the Athelas One device for their patients. “We were able to set up a table, where, on one side we had our device, and on the other side was the nurse who was drawing blood to compare with the Athelas One samples (to make sure they were accurate). And then we told them, ‘Free blood testing for anyone for the next three days.’” Bodapati sat at a table in the hallway with the Athelas One and its finger-pricking lancets and glass test strips, and Tandon sat in another room reviewing the results on a computer monitor. The response was overwhelming. Patients came from all over, alone at first, and then the next day with their families. One patient, at the hospital for a routine appointment with their doctor, had blood drawn at the Athelas table on a whim—a whim that would be life altering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Tandon saw this patient’s blood cell images on his laptop, he knew instantly that something was wrong. Over several days, he’d been reviewing hundreds of blood test results, all displaying the normal range of white blood cells, between 6,000 and 8,000, but this patient had a count of well over 40,000. Tandon immediately got up to show Bodapati the results. The two also saw that the cells were immature, which indicated mass proliferation of leukocytes, a type of white blood cell. Tandon and Bodapati knew what this meant: the patient had leukemia. But because Athelas One had yet to receive FDA approval as a diagnostic tool, they couldn’t speak directly to the patient. They were, however, able to alert the hospital staff that the patient needed to be tested for cancer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bodapati remembers flying back to California days later and sitting quietly next to Tandon, both of them struck by the force of what had happened. She felt the weight of the results, presented in such a personal way to someone they’d seen face-to-face. Though the two were mainly silent on the flight, Bodapati was listening to something—an inner voice describing not only the future of her company, but possibilities for the good she could do, the change she could drive in the healthcare industry more broadly. “Imagine if you could do that all the time with really cheap tools?” Bodapati asks. “You go in, you sign your name, you prick your finger. You get told right there. You don’t have to go to your appointment, then go to a different place and get your lab drawn.” It took another three weeks for the hospital to confirm the patient’s leukemia diagnosis that Bodapati and Tandon saw in minutes. Tandon was haunted by the fact that the patient had come in for a regular doctor’s appointment, “But because healthcare today is not quantitative, it’s traditional, you come in, you get some symptomatic analysis and they’ll tell you to go home and rest.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That’s when it clicked,” Bodapati recalls, referencing that solemn flight. “It’s this concept of making tools so cheap, so usable, that people can do it all the time. Only then can you actually get preventive care.”</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Alfred Lin, a partner at Sequoia Capital who collaborates closely with Athelas, happened to already be questioning the landscape of available medical testing technology when he met the co-founders while they were participating in the Y Combinator startup accelerator. Lin’s father was undergoing chemotherapy, and Lin was frustrated that the most reliable method of testing whether his father had an infection was to take his temperature. If a chemotherapy patient has a fever that spikes above 101.3, they’re told to go to the emergency room. But to Lin, the thermometer felt like an inadequate diagnostic tool, based on what always happened next. “I just found that so silly. What if it’s 101.2 and it’s not .3?” Lin asks. “The first thing that happened every time I took my father to the emergency room was they take his temperature, his blood pressure and look at his vitals. And then the next immediate thing they did was to take a full blood count.” Lin, like Bodapati and Tandon, felt there had to be a faster, more accurate way of putting the needs of the patient first: “Tanay and Deepika were on a mission to figure out a more comprehensive test than a thermometer,” Lin says</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Sometimes the signals Bodapati is listening for come from places like support tickets; other times they’re literally knocking on the door. The company wouldn’t be where it is today had Bodapati and Tandon not been pursued by their first test user, a Stanford University student and basketball player named Michael Morris. “Michael was an inventor at heart,” Tandon tells me, “A lot of the ideas around how we could make the device user-friendly came from him.” Morris was also a cancer patient who needed constant monitoring of his white blood cell count. When he heard about how two of his college classmates were experimenting with a machine that might help him, he showed up at their office in Mountain View—a barely refurbished liquor store—ready to be their guinea pig. Tanay and Bodapati had been building since their high school science fair days, and—with Tanay’s background in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and Bodapati’s time spent internering at her uncle Dr. Sanjiv Gambhir’s molecular imaging research lab at Stanford—the two friends were able to make a prototype for an in-home blood testing kit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“[Morris] brought this energy with him that would just take over the office,” Tandon says. “And it was so helpful for the early team of 4 or 5 people to see an actual patient talk about how important this was, and how much you wanted to track these critical metrics.” Using Athelas One consistently over the next couple of months, Morris noticed a disturbing trend in his cell count. His cancer therapy wasn’t working anymore. “He asked us to go to a doctor’s appointment with him,” Bodapati reveals. “It felt so personal because he was showing the doctor his results, and telling him that the cancer was back.” In that office, supporting her friend—a sick man holding tightly to his wife’s hand—Bodapati saw again how valuable Athelas could be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Soon after this moment, the FDA sent Bodapati and Tandon an additional information request for Athelas One, a kind of auditing the agency does to further analyze efficacy. The Jaurez trial proved to Bodapati and Tandon that Athelas One worked, and that they were right to believe in their new business. But the FDA wanted more, including other trials. Though it’s fairly standard to receive such a request, the 40-plus line questionnaire was daunting, demanding another 8 months of data collection and an additional trial, which still wouldn’t guarantee FDA approval. Yet Bodapati says Morris’ belief in the device kept them going, with the paperwork and the eventual second trial that led to their FDA approval. His constant presence energized the staff, and his input on how to better Athelas One for its users was crucial, she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2017, Michael Morris passed away. “Michael really believed in it,” Bodapati says, naming him as one of their first true advocates; a guiding light urging them forward. “He told us, ‘It’s too late for me, but make sure you bring it to other people.’”</p>



<p>Bodapati has been hearing those words ever since.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Flights have been their own recurring theme during Bodapati and Tandon’s long friendship. They first bonded on a flight as teenagers when competing on the elite science fair circuit, an extracurricular they participated in with such intensity that they joke about it being a competitive sport. (As a preteen Bodapati even invented a test strip that could detect whether vegetables were contaminated with salmonella and E. coli. It was her first foray into microfluidics, working with and studying how fluids move in miniature devices and the spaces within them, which later came to play a large part in the development of Athelas One.) The experience of going from competitors to friends and collaborators eventually brought Bodapati and Tandon together as co-founders. “I know his strengths. He knows my strengths. We knew one another when we were competing, so it was the rawest form of each other,” Bodapati says. Lin even recalls the two of them finishing each other’s sentences, describing Tandon as verbose while Bodapati is a grounding presence. If Bodapati is the listener, then Tandon is the talker.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bodapati has been honing her listening skills since childhood—both in her family home and in her uncle’s Stanford research lab. Her parents were small tech business owners with companies in the United States and India, and because of the time difference, they were often on the phone with their teams abroad while dropping Bodapati off at school. Sitting in the backseat, Bodapati could hear the chatter of business deals considered, strategies debated, negotiations made. Bodapati’s brother, Sunil, also remembers, “After dinner, we would hear them get on the phone to kick off early meetings with the India team, and we were able to listen to how they approached deals, how they structured them. We were there when deals went through, there when deals fell through, there when employees quit. So we got to see what it was like to go through the highs of the lows [of running a business] in a very visceral way.”</p>



<p>Bodapati tells me that sometimes the training was more explicit, though; her father would encourage the family to have what he called “pitch night,” teaching the kids how to really sell their latest science experiment. “My dad would always tell us, ‘You can’t just explain the science; convey it in a way that is compelling—what’s the practical implication of the project?’” Sunil, who is the CEO of his own healthcare startup, Enable Medicine, says that while he and his sister learned business from their parents, it was their beloved uncle, Dr. Gambhir, who instilled in them a love of science.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Gambhir, chair of radiology at Stanford and a pioneer in advancing techniques for molecular imaging and early detection of cancer, died of cancer in 2020 at 57. Bodapati tells me that she believes if her uncle were still alive he would be awarded for his work with a Nobel Prize. He wanted not just to innovate, she says, but also to truly improve the lives of those affected by cancer. Bodapati’s years spent working in her uncle’s lab and listening to his stories and advice, led her to want to revolutionize preventive care, to improve people’s lives holistically.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2013, Dr. Gambhir’s work and research became deeply personal: his teenage son, Milan, was diagnosed with the aggressive brain cancer glioblastoma multiforme—the exact tumor type Dr. Gambhir had been studying. Tragically, Milan died two years later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bodapati shares the story his uncle told the lab the first time he returned after Milan’s death and how she internalized it, becoming ever more motivated to create positive change, even from terrible loss. Dr. Gambhir gathered his staff at the office and told them a fable credited to several Native American tribes: a grandfather is teaching his grandson about life and reveals that every person has two warring wolves within them. One wolf represents resentment, petty jealousy and sorrow, while the other is hope, compassion and faith. The grandson asks his grandfather which wolf wins in the end; the grandfather responds, “Whichever one we feed.” With that, Dr. Gambhir turned to his colleagues, bowed his head and said, “Let’s remember that’s what we’re doing here.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Dr. Gambhir continued to research early cancer detection, he became a leader in developing tools that could passively monitor patient health by collecting data in minimally intrusive ways, like a smart toilet that tests stool and urine for early signs of disease. Gambhir dreamed of a proactive healthcare system, one preventive and holistic, rather than focused on fixing problems individually as they arise. Today, Bodapati is working to make this a reality. “Part of who I am now is because of the work that I did with him and his lab,” Bodapati says. Sunil underscores his sister’s feelings: “You know that if you can move the needle in a significant way for human progress, then you kind of have an obligation to do that.”</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>On the opposite side of the country, in the suburbs of Baltimore, Dr. Deanna Kelly, Director and Chief of the Treatment Research Program at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center, was trying to develop or find a point-of-care device that would help her treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients gain access to the antipsychotic drug clozapine. One of clozapine’s side effects is neutropenia—too few white blood cells to fight off infection—and tracking a patient’s white blood cell count requires regular testing. When the FDA cleared clozapine for use, it did so with the mandate that patients get labs drawn every week for the first 6 months, then every two weeks for the next 6 months, then once a month for their course of treatment, which, for most patients, is a lifetime. This would be a difficult task for anyone, let alone someone suffering from paranoia and delusion.</p>



<p>For the last 20 years Dr. Kelly had been working with clozapine, and believed it would be life-changing for many people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. She believed that the drug could be the difference between a patient living in a closed facility or leading an independent life with a steady job and stable relationships. “Often doctors believe that though this drug would be life changing for their patient, it’s just too much of a liability to have them on it’” Bodapati says. “Or patients feel that even though they know the drug is good for them, they simply can’t manage all these steps.’”</p>



<p>Dr. Kelly says up to 30 percent, or more, of people diagnosed with schizophrenia are labeled “treatment resistant,” and it doesn’t take much for a patient to receive such a designation. “The guidelines tell us that [after] two failed trials of antipsychotics, someone should be considered treatment resistant,” Dr. Kelly says.</p>



<p>Dr. Kelly and her colleagues at University of Maryland College Park were experimenting with electrochemical detection for monitoring blood levels and neutrophil counts, but they weren’t getting far. “Once I heard about Athelas, I was like, I don’t know if this is too good to be true,” Dr. Kelly recalls. “Then I kept reaching out and kept thinking this is going to be a major advantage and a major breakthrough to revolutionize our care.” Fortunately for her, Bodapati listened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Kelley was thrilled when Athelas One received its second FDA clearance for at-home use. This allows the results to be instantaneously sent to a doctor and a pharmacist, who then ships the medication directly to the patient—meaning the patient has to do little more than prick their finger in the privacy of their own bedroom. Dr. Kelly says some of her patients are poor, lack transportation, or have cognitive impairments, things that make participating in a traditional healthcare system nearly impossible. “The way Athelas did it was clever: merging these results that you get back to the [risk evaluation management] system, coupled with the ability to order in a pharmacy. That’s a game changer.”</p>



<p>Bodapati and her team worked to get Athelas One in California state hospitals, specifically in forensic facilities and county medical facilities that treat a significant number of homeless patients with drug-resistant schizophrenia. By this time, HLS Therapeutics, one of the makers of clozapine, heard about Bodapati and Tandon’s work and offered the duo a rare opportunity to partner, broadening their reach into mental healthcare and beyond oncology in ways they never expected.</p>



<p>Cliff Weitzman is CEO of the text-to-speech audio reader Speechify, and has been part of a support network for a friend who hasn’t responded to most antipsychotics. Weitzman describes this experience as hopeless. “What Athelas gave us was hope. When this happens, you lose control. When someone breaks their arm you can see it, but when it’s mental it’s scary” he says. “They might stop eating, stop drinking, stop being able to function. You lose all control, and that’s very scary. And there’s nothing you can do. And then you go to doctors, and there’s nothing that doctors can do either. “&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wietzman took time off work and flew all over America to speak with top psychiatrists. After that year, he discovered the potential of clozapine in a Facebook group. “The first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth doctor you talked to does not bring up clozapine,” Weitzman says. “We went on Facebook groups of patients who have similar problems, and the only success stories we heard often were from patients who use clozapine. And we’re like, well, what is clozapine?” Weitzman believes that clozapine wasn’t even considered by the patient’s medical team because it’s not only difficult for the user, but it’s also a burden for the doctor prescribing it. “It’s a lot of work because the doctor every week has to go to the portal, click the button, make sure that the regulation is there. Doctors don’t want to do that. That’s not why they went to medical school.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Athelas One had broken down the primary barrier to doctors prescribing clozapine. “Now it’s a realistic thing that we can use,” says Weitzman. He believes the company has the ability not only to help millions of people with previously untreatable diagnoses, but also to offer relief to their support networks, helping them to reconnect with their loved ones. “You’ve gone from a state of scary, helpless, hopeless, to empowered, assisted, supported, hopeful. So it gives hope. That’s a very special thing that very few companies can say they succeed in doing.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>When the pandemic hit, Bodapati found herself listening again, this time for insight on how Athelas could transition from diagnostic to preventive care. “We realized we had an opportunity where the world is on pause, and we’ve collected all of these interesting lessons from getting this FDA clearance and then launching in some of these incredible health systems and clinics,” says Tandon. “We can continue to operate as a traditional biotech or we can synthesize this knowledge and turn it into something a lot bigger that can really serve the population that we touch and help them work through COVID, but also create this transition to preventive health.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bodapati spotted an opportunity when she was on a sales call with a psychiatrist named Dr. Gustavo Alva from southern California. Bodapati asked him to tell her about his other patients, those who weren’t on clozapine—what were their needs? Dr. Alva said he had thousands of patients, a large percentage of whom were on medications with side effects like weight gain, hypertension and Type 2 diabetes. When Bodapati asked how he was monitoring his patients’ long-term health, he replied that it was often left up to the primary care doctor. Bodapati didn’t hesitate. She asked Dr. Alva to connect her to some of his patients who would be open to chatting so she could discern if Athelas could help. On the calls, she heard that they often didn’t see a GP, just their specialist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on these calls, Bodapati and Tandon started building a suite of predictive, internet-connected tools that worked together to monitor a patient’s health. Shortly, she went back to Dr. Alva and asked him how valuable it would be if she could give specific patients glucometers, weight scales and blood pressure cuffs that all recorded the patient’s results at home and sent the results to a healthcare team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before the call ended, the two had roughed out a path toward a collaboration that led to an order for more than 800 patients. The Athelas team got to work, reaching out to potential patients, getting them the devices and onboarding them. Then the Athelas team set the patients up with a nursing team. “Once we got them on the program and they were continuously testing, [Dr. Alva]&nbsp; told us how powerful it was to engage these chronically ill patients from their homes. It was something he had been attempting for decades,” Bodapati says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bodapati and Tandon then developed an app that allows the patients to record their information and schedule appointments. “That’s how our product grew,” says Bodapati. “And overnight, our average deal size went from 10 patients to 600.” The co-founders have also created a pill tracker that works in tandem with the Athelas One for any patient for whom tracking their medication is a burden—a device that can help the provider as well as the patient to determine whether the medication is working or if it’s not being taken correctly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As soon as Bodapati attempted to bill for the remote patient monitoring Athelas was now offering, she started to wade through the insurance coding maze and realized how opaque the current medical billing system really is: “As a business, you need to know how much money you’re making, and as the CEO of the business, you need to have that information within 30 seconds. It was very clear that the doctors had no idea,” says Bodapati “You don’t really know where your money is coming from, how it’s segmented. It’s a black box.” Again, Bodapati saw a need and developed a solution; Athelas is now an innovator in remote patient monitoring and in revenue cycle management (RCM), helping private practices and provider groups bill appropriately and consistently. Now Bodapati says that RCM has become a core part of Athelas’ future, joining a $126.1 billion industry.</p>



<p>Lin sees a future of Athelas that goes beyond monitoring the sick to one connecting all people with preventive care. Now Bodapati is scaling up teams and connecting with as many hospital systems and provider groups as she can, having already partnered with Palomar Health System and Horizon Family Medical, which, she says, together represent approximately 100,000 patients. “What’s been most rewarding working with Deepika and Tanay, when they get close to their vision, they’re always very, very good at expanding it,” Lin says.&nbsp;Bodapati believes that improving the healthcare industry and making it more accessible is simply a matter of finding the people who need help and listening to them. What she doesn’t mention is the hard work, the designing, fabricating and testing that the listening leads to. This work has shepherded Athelas to become, in Bodapati’s words, the sensor and software infrastructure for running a modern healthcare business, with a unique value proposition of identifying “hard to discern” commonalities between stakeholders. Her insights are the key to this success. “We found that people are so much more willing to innovate, systems are willing to innovate, insurance companies are willing to innovate. Patients are willing to try new technologies,” Bodapati says. “We would talk to patients, asking them, ‘What can we do to make this the easiest possible experience for you?’ And they’ll tell you exactly what they need and what they want. Once you unlock that, it becomes really powerful. Because then you just keep building and building and building.”</p>

 <a href="https://tokenmint.global">TokenMint</a> is an easy-to-use platform for anyone to launch a token using custom tokenomics without having to know a single line of code. It streamlines and simplifies the tokenization process, making creating a fungible token easy and quick.&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are excited to announce that TokenMint is now live on mainnet!&nbsp; The Alpha version of the TokenMint platform offers the basics for creating a fungible token.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 About the TokenMint Platform 
<p>The TokenMint platform, comprising four key components, is designed to provide a seamless, simple, and intuitive user experience:</p>
 
 TokenMint Chain – a sidechain built on the Horizen network 
 <a href="https://tokenmint.global">Token Generator</a> – a web app that allows a streamlined and easy process for anyone to create and mint a fungible token with custom tokenomics. 
 <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Cobalt Wallet</a> – a web browser extension wallet that stores and manages tokens created on TokenMint 
 <a href="https://explorer.tokenmint.global">TokenMint Block explorer</a> – a block explorer that tracks and displays all transactions on the TokenMint Chain.&nbsp; 
 
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://testnet.tokenmint.global">TokenMint Testnet</a> remains active for anybody that wants to test and try out the platform. Over 550 tokens were created by users on the testnet, and the user feedback we received helped us improve the platform for the mainnet launch. These improvements include UX/UI features, bug fixes, and additional security measures.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Tokenization will serve as one of the main driving forces behind the wave of innovation in blockchain and growth in the adoption of decentralized applications in coming years. A platform like TokenMint can play an important role in making tokenization accessible to mainstream users. </p>
<p>Notably, no programming knowledge is required for creating a token using TokenMint so users can get started right away. Our long-term goal for the platform is to achieve provable tokenomics while enhancing user privacy, a move that will further break down the barriers between tokenization and the masses.”</p>
<p>– Rob Viglione, co-founder of Horizen and Horizen Labs.&nbsp;<br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We leverage agile methodologies to bring immediate value to our community through early and continuous delivery of our software. The TokenMint alpha release is just the beginning, as our product and engineering teams will continue to rapidly iterate on it with shorter delivery cycles that immediately address the evolving needs of Web3 and the crypto movement.&nbsp; We look forward to having TokenMint drive forth additional mainstream adoption.”</p>
<p>– Zain Cheng, VP of Engineering, Horizen Labs.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
 Token Creation Fees 
<p>Currently, it costs 10 ZEN to register a new fungible token on TokenMint and 1 ZEN to mint. We are running <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/HDE-Proposals/issues/67">a limited number of community tasks</a> on HDE that offer reimbursement on the token creation fees along with a small reward.&nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/HDE-Proposals/issues/67">Create a token on TokenMint mainnet for free now.</a></p>
<p>Future versions of TokenMint will integrate a wider range of features like NFT support and marketplace, interoperability with our EVM sidechain, and zk-SNARKs, a privacy technology that will enable provable tokenomics and preserve user privacy.</p>

 Apply for grants to run the first Nym Privacy-Enhanced Apps! <p><a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/">Welcome to Shipyard</a>, the new Beta space for Nym! Shipyard is a place to build and stress-test Privacy Enhanced Applications (PEApps), which are service providers that use the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/a-simple-introduction-to-mixnets-6783a103d20e">Nym mixnet </a>to provide anonymity for their&nbsp;users.</p><p>In order to parameterize the Nym mixnet to offer strong anonymity, we need to get some apps running via the mixnet. Many existing apps like Telegram can be privacy-enhanced, a ‘PEApp’ — but we need to run two components called gateways and network requesters to make your regular apps work with Nym. <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/gateways-to-privacy-51196005bf5">Gateways</a> are the first hop into the mixnet, and <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/tech-deepdive-network-requesters-e5359a6cc31c">Network Requesters</a> are the hop out that takes the user to an app. Scroll down to learn about grants to set these&nbsp;up.</p> Nym Shipyard is&nbsp;for… <p>INFRASTRUCTURE WIZARDS who want to run gateways and network requesters to make the mixnet accessible for a broad set of existing applications and users. These are needed to make the mixnet broadly usable and Shipyard is giving Service Grants to set these up - <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/docs/service-grants">Apply&nbsp;Now!</a></p><p>DEVELOPERS who want to build new PEApps in the Nym privacy stack and contribute to building out a vast ecosystem of usable tools where privacy is the default. Hear about the upcoming major grants program or chat directly with Nym Developer Relations: <a href="http://eepurl.com/h6uPSD">Sign up</a> or <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Join Discord</a> #peapps&nbsp;dev</p><p>EARLY ADOPTERS who are eager to take advantage of the privacy offered by Nym and are willing to try out experimental beta software (that cannot be fully relied on for strong anonymity…yet!) To learn about and try new releases <a href="http://eepurl.com/h6uPSD">Sign up</a> or <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Join Discord</a> #product-and-peapps</p> Grants for running the first gateways to&nbsp;privacy… <p>The first tranche of Shipyard grants is for gateways and network requesters — which combined allow wallets, apps and chats like Telegram to run on the&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Together, gateways and network requesters provide the bridge into the mixnet and enable ordinary users to begin using the Nym mixnet. In order to slowly onboard users, Shipyard will be granting people running gateways and network requesters for apps and wallets that already work with Nym, like the <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/">Nym wallet</a>, <a href="https://electrum.org/">Electrum wallet</a>, <a href="https://keybase.io/download">Keybase</a> and <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a>.</p><p>To qualify for a grant you must commit to setting up a gateway and a network requester that whitelists these initial applications, configure your gateway to gather minimum stats and maintain it for a minimum of 6 months. Instructions will be provided of course! (<a href="http://eepurl.com/h6uPSD">Sign up here</a>). In the meantime, get familiar with <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/overview/">Nym docs</a>, <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/gateways/">gateways</a> and <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/requester/">network requesters</a>.</p><p>The use of these applications via the Nym mixnet will be experimental at first and will gather stats on usage and traffic patterns directed towards a particular application so we can parametrize the mixnet to provide strong anonymity. (There is no other data gathered — this is a privacy system so we simply don’t have&nbsp;it!)</p>*Note: the deadline to set up and first payment date has been changed to give sufficient time for operators to download new binaries and get set&nbsp;up.<p>These first grants are essential for Nym to start being usable to a broader set of people, and for the Nym core team to stress test and optimise the&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>NOTE in order to get payment you need to get the code up and running for your app of choice by the 8th of August payment deadline! To get full monthly payment per month you need to have 100% uptime and decent performance.</p><p>The Nym network has reserved a limited budget for apps, so funding will come to whoever sets up apps first if there is an overload of applications — so apply early and get that code&nbsp;running!</p>  <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/service-grants">Apply now!</a>  <p>…and be among the first to provide mass access to network level&nbsp;privacy.</p> For Developers — Upcoming Build&nbsp;Grants <p>Shipyard also invites more ambitious service provider grant applications for integrations with a broader set of wallets and applications. These could just be apps that already have SOCKS5 support. Apps that require re-compiling and coding can of course apply for more! For the highly skilled and ambitious among you, a fork of a popular app like Signal that runs on Nym could go way above&nbsp;$3000.</p><p>Service grants are just the beginning and part of a much larger grants program that will roll out over the next quarter. Stay tuned for announcements, including large grants aimed at research and larger projects that are looking for funding on top of Nym from the Nym Innovation Fund.</p> Relevant links:   <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net">Shipyard</a>  <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/docs/service-grants">Service grants</a>  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/gateways-to-privacy-51196005bf5">What is a gateway?</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/gateways">Docs</a>  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/tech-deepdive-network-requesters-e5359a6cc31c">What is a network requester?</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/requester">Docs</a>  <a href="http://eepurl.com/h6uPSD">Sign up</a> to the Shipyard grants email&nbsp;list  <a href="https://nymtech.net/nym-whitepaper.pdf">Nym Whitepaper</a>   Socials:   <a href="http://@nymproject">Twitter</a>  <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a>  <a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a>   <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/announcing-nym-shipyard-136fcb93fcb5">Announcing Nym Shipyard</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p><p>WabiSabi is a novel communication protocol for creating bitcoin coinjoin transactions with arbitrary amounts. It is a concept with roots going back to the early days of bitcoin, even the earliest beginnings of digital payments. Over the last two years, we have researched, designed and implemented this protocol. Now that we have finally released Wasabi Wallet 2.0, here is the history of this monumental advancement in bitcoin privacy.</p><p>Wasabi Wallet 1.0 solved a lot of difficult problems out of the box. Tor was natively integrated, protecting user IP addresses. Block filters were used to synchronize wallets without anyone else learning about the transaction history. The best available zerolink coinjoin protocol with Chaumian blind signatures provided privacy on the blockchain.</p><p>However, the Chaumian blind signature protocol had limitations that lead to a bad user experience and excessive blockspace usage. The minimum denomination was too large for many users, denying them access to the service. But for others it was too small, resulting in many coins in the wallet, which is expensive. If a user wanted to consolidate many inputs in the same coinjoin transaction, he had to tell the coordinator which belonged together. Even though the coordinator could not link the inputs of one user to the equal amount output he received, it was public knowledge which non-equal change output the user received.</p><p>Some of these concerns were improved with marginal upgrades to the protocol during the Wasabi 1.0 life cycle. However, in order to truly solve these issues, a fundamental solution was required. But at this point, we did not know what technology existed that could be applied at scale.</p><p>A group of developers, cryptographers and enthusiasts got together in the Wasabi Research Club, a weekly meeting to define, discuss and solve this complex problem. Initially, a different academic paper was chosen as the topic for each week. We invited the authors of each paper to join us, and many did, giving ample opportunity to ask questions. One of the researchers, usually Aviv Milner, started the call with a short presentation to introduce and summarize the paper. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPwc75tPMdsgTYlu9dJZlosCm0s7WmIpF">recordings</a> of these calls are available on the Wasabi Wallet YouTube channel.</p><p>A breakthrough moment was when Jonas Nick suggested that keyed verified anonymous credentials might be a great fit for our specific use case. There are numerous different cryptographic schemes in this category, like Brands’ credentials, Mercurial signatures, anonymous credentials light and keyed verified anonymous credentials. The specific paper Jonas brought to our attention was <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1416">The Signal Private Group System and Anonymous Credentials Supporting Efficient Verifiable Encryption, written by Melissa Chase, Trevor Perrin and Greg Zaverucha</a>.</p><p>This cryptography allows a central server to issue tokens which can have many attributes. Each of these attributes can be blindly committed to, then selectively revealed at a later point. These tokens can be transferred anonymously. The trick we use in WabiSabi specifically, is that one attribute of these credentials is a blinded value of sats. Pedersen commitments are used so that the coordinator never learns how many sats one token has attributed, but he can still ensure that nobody is creating more money than he spent.</p><p>These anonymous digital bearer certificates are the access rights to the new bitcoin transaction that is being built. The coordinator issues tokens and gives it to anyone who provides an input. And later, any anonymous user who provides such a token, can write an output address and amount to the transaction. These tokens ensure nobody is writing more outputs than inputs, without the users having to sacrifice their privacy to the central server.</p><p>At this point, we had a pretty solid idea of the problem and how flexible anonymous eCash tokens can be used to solve it. This was a sufficient advancement to document in a new paper, <a href="https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WabiSabi/releases/latest/download/WabiSabi.pdf">WabiSabi: Centrally Coordinated CoinJoins with Variable Amounts</a>, which was peer reviewed and published. This paper was finalized mainly by Adam Ficsor, Yuval Kogman, Lucas Ontivero and István András Seres.</p><p>A crucial next step was to implement the cryptography that makes the system possible. Lucas Ontivero, Yuval Kogman and David Molnar dedicated months to building, testing and reviewing this critical part of the codebase. An independent security firm was hired to audit the code base and several outside contributors have reviewed it as well. In the following months, Wasabi’s client and server code were upgraded and sometimes entirely rewritten to support this new protocol.</p><p>With the protocol designed, the cryptography implemented and the client and server code well on its way, we realized that some of the most difficult questions are still unanswered. Now that the coordinator no longer dictates the minimum value of inputs and what output values to register, what exactly should the client do now? With great power, comes great responsibility. For the first time in the history of bitcoin coinjoin, the client can basically do whatever it wants. This turned out to be rather uncharted territory, with conflicting ideas of how to approach the subject.</p><p>Anonymity likes company meaning that it’s a good idea to hide in a crowd. So a coinjoin transaction should have many coins with the exact same amount of sats. However, every transaction should have many different equal amounts. One of Yuval’s many insights was to use low Hamming weight standard denominations. Only a few of these amounts are required to sum up to any arbitrary value. Specifically, these standard denominations are powers of two, powers of three, and 1, 2, and 5 times the powers of ten. Between 5000 sats and 1 bitcoin, there are 41 of these standard denominations. If all clients prefer to create outputs in only those standard denominations, then there are going to be a higher number of equal amount inputs and outputs.</p><p>These developments are why Wabisabi has improved upon the original Zerolink protocol of Wasabi 1.0 and how Wasabi 2.0, powered by Wabisabi are breaking records everyday for facilitating some of the largest coinjoins ever while provided even the newest Bitcoin user access to the highest level of privacy.</p>

<p>A year after taking office president of France Nicholas Sarkozy, <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/sarkozy-genuflects-to-catholic-past-in-pilgrimage-for-votes-20110304-1bhzl.html">who happens to be Catholic,</a> tapped Joseph Stiglitz to head a Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress. The center-right politician and former mayor of Neuilly-sur-Seine served as Minister of the Budget under Balladur and Mitterrand and Minster of the Interior and Finance under Chirac.&nbsp; Sarkozy is also <a href="https://www.berggruen.org/people/nicolas-sarkozy/">a member of the Berggruen Network</a>.</p>
<p>The Commission’s <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Report-by-the-Stiglitz-Commission-on-the-Measurement-of-Economic-Performance-and-Social-Progress-2009.pdf">findings</a>, which were released in the aftermath of the 2008 global economic implosion, set the stage for stakeholder capitalism and began to walk back GDP as the primary measure of economic vitality. Stigliz is a <a href="http://www.pass.va/content/scienzesociali/en/academicians/ordinary/stiglitz.html">member</a> of the Pontifical Academy of the Social Sciences <a href="http://www.pass.va/content/scienzesociali/en/about/history.html">established by Pope John Paul II in 1994</a>. Michel Bauwens is also an <a href="https://futurism.com/interview-michel-bauwens-on-peer-to-peer-economics-and-its-role-in-reshaping-our-world">expert adviso</a>r to the group that gathers at <a href="http://www.pass.va/content/scienzesociali/en/about/casina.html">Casina Pio IV</a> in Vatican City. There, ensconced in a sixteenth-century summer villa, prominent thinkers discuss the church’s social teaching in relation to current issues of concern like: globalization, democracy, and human rights. The focus of one of last year’s meetings was “<a href="http://www.pass.va/content/scienzesociali/en/events/2019-23/poor_in_spirit.html">The Science and Ethics of Happiness: Caritas, Social Friendship, and the End of Poverty</a>.” The Vatican is <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2019/06/21/doctrine-of-discovery-redux-the-vaticans-plans-for-impact-investing/">very big</a> in the social impact sector.</p>

<p>Given the information that follows, I think it’s worth considering architecture as a form of social technology. This villa exhibits a complex interplay of encoded mythological and religious themes that revolve around truth, knowledge, and memory. People with a deeper understanding of esoterica may be able to draw out additional meaning as to why this location was selected as a gathering place thirty years ago. The detailed descriptions authorized by the church are available <a href="http://www.pass.va/content/scienzesociali/en/about/casina.html">here</a> and <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Casina-Pio-IV-Historical-and-Iconographic-Guide.pdf">here</a>. Its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casina_Pio_IV">Wikipedia entry notes</a>&nbsp;of the design: “the Casina’s rich and at times obscure iconographic programme, features the efficacy of baptism, the primacy of the papacy and the welcomed punitive powers of the Church.”</p>

<p>Stigliz’s project for Sarkozy asserted that social well-being be prioritized. The era of bio-capitalism and investments in prescribed social behaviors was getting off the ground. Assisting Stiglitz in this effort was the Bengali economic theorist and Harvard professor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amartya_Sen">Amartya Sen</a> whose career centered: development finance; social choice, whereby individual preferences were guided to generate collective decisions; and capabilities, taking into consideration people’s abilities to pursue their choices. Sen has served on Berggruen’s philosophy prize selection <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/martha-nussbaum-awarded-1-million-berggruen-prize-philosophy-culture">panel</a>.</p>
<p>Read this selection from their report keeping the following factors in mind. Well-being metrics will quantify ALL our relationships, social and environmental. By assigning everything a numerical value our lives are made visible to the machine. This information will be used to inform the actions of autonomous intelligent systems in mixed reality. Everything will be compelled to interact with these systems on the basis of the data that comprises unique digital identities, digital twins. Blockchain transactions connected to cyber-physical systems will enclose our lives in mechanical energies. This is the new rule of law – smart contract law. Global financial interests, guided by artificial intelligence prediction markets, will place bets on our ability to attain indicators of “success” specified. Submission to the machine is being framed as good for society and the planet, appealing to progressives, and economically efficient, appealing to free-market libertarians. This is how the Earth may be remade as a planetary computer. This is the “wellness” economy.</p>
<p>“Another key message, and unifying theme of the report, is that the time is ripe for our measurement system to shift emphasis from measuring economic production to measuring people’s well-being. And measures of well-being should be put in a context of sustainability. Despite deficiencies in our measures of production, we know much more about them than about well-being. Changing emphasis does not mean dismissing GDP and production measures. They emerged from concerns about market production and employment; they continue to provide answers to many important questions such as monitoring economic activity. But emphasizing well-being is important because there appears to be an increasing gap between the information contained in aggregate GDP data and what counts for common people’s well-being. This means working towards the development of a statistical system that complements measures of market activity by measures centered on people’s well-being and by measures that capture sustainability. Such a system must, of necessity, be plural – because no single measure can summarize something as complex as the well-being of the members of society, our system of measurement must encompass a range of different measures. The issue of aggregation across dimensions (that is to say, how we add up, for example, a measure of health with a measure of consumption of conventional goods), while important, is subordinate to the establishment of a broad statistical system that captures as many of the relevant dimensions as possible. Such a system should not just measure average levels of well-being within a given community, and how they change over time, but also document the diversity of peoples’ experiences and the linkages across various dimensions of people’s life. There are several dimensions to well-being but a good place to start is the measurement of material well-being or living standards.” <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Report-by-the-Stiglitz-Commission-on-the-Measurement-of-Economic-Performance-and-Social-Progress-2009.pdf">Page 6</a></p>
<p>The language around establishing consistent standards of data to capture the diversity of experiences across dimensions of people’s lives is very much in keeping with the premise of developing social simulations that can be used for systems engineering of large populations. The dimensions Stigliz’s commission recommends tracking include: 1) material living standards (income, consumption and wealth); 2) health; 3) education; 4) personal activities including work; 5) political voice and governance; 6) social connections and relationships; 7) environment (present and future conditions); 8) insecurity of an economic as well as a physical nature. These are all metrics that will be used to assign and manage improvement pathways towards “equity.” Remember that the next time you are nudged to complete an online survey.</p>

<p>Source: Berggruen and Sarkozy (Who Is Half <a href="https://hungarytoday.hu/hungarian-roots-nicolas-sarkozy-france-23rd-president-2007-2012/">Hungarian</a>) in 2013 at the 21st Century Council Gathering in Zurich</p>
<p><a href="https://cep.lse.ac.uk/_new/people/person.asp?id=970">Richard Layard</a> of the London School of Economics Centre for Economic Performance first developed metrics around the “<a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/Research/research-impact-case-studies/2021/understanding-and-improving-subjective-wellbeing">science of happiness</a>” that were used to finance mental health services in the UK. By establishing that economic losses due to “mental health” amount to <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/spotlight/healthcare/2022/05/how-poor-mental-health-costs-the-economy-billions">billions of dollars</a>, the social impact sector has created an enormous cost-offset for pay-for-success social prescribing. The following excerpt is from a 2006 Guardian article, “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/jun/21/mentalhealth.socialcare">Spread A Little Happiness</a>,” about Layard’s pilot “happiness centres.”</p>
<p>“Imagine the situation. You have had a relationship breakdown. It has left you depressed, alone and turning to alcohol. Work is impossible. But, thankfully, your local NHS “happiness centre” is just around the corner. Part sanctuary, part psychology laboratory, happiness centres are a sort of Ikea for the mind, where the feelgood factor is flat-packed for you to take home. A branded chain of open-access outposts offering the latest talking therapies for some of the most common and distressing mental illnesses. No long waits. No need for a referral – simply turn up and get help.”</p>
<p>This is what ongoing mental health screenings are about; what ACEs scoring is about; what emotion-sensing digital surveillance is about; what social-emotional training in schools is about. The power structure is gathering baselines and sucking up data for prediction markets in future behavior management. That quote is sixteen years old. Today, your “Ikea of the Mind” drop-in center could easily be a tele-therapy chatbot or a cognitive behavioral therapy game in a VR headset.</p>
<p>Please understand, I am in no way dismissing or trying to minimize the reality of mental stress in society today. It is a serious concern. What I am trying to say is that these programs are dual use, and we’re moving into the phase where artificial intelligence really wants to learn what makes us tick as complex, emotional beings. There is a fiscal and pragmatic logic behind this pivot to tele-“wellness” management.” The plan is to use us to explain to AI how to be more like us. That’s human-centered design – that and cognitive warfare, the Sixth Domain. Hat tip to my friend <a href="https://siliconicarus.org/author/raul-diego/">Raul at Silicon Icarus</a> for bringing a <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03635898/document">2020 NATO report</a> on the subject to my attention.</p>

<p>In 2019, the Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems of the Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers">IEEE</a>), a professional association with over 400,000 members in 160 countries headquartered in New York City and Piscataway, NJ, prepared “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ethically-Aligned-Design-IEEE-Human-Well-Being-Autonomous-and-Intelligent-Systems.pdf">Ethically Aligned Design: A Vision for Prioritizing Human Well-being with Autonomous and Intelligent Systems</a>.” Their intent was to outline social policy imperatives in the face of pervasive computing with the goal of supporting human well-being. The effort was chaired by <a href="https://homepages.laas.fr/raja/">Raja Chatila</a>, a professor of robotics and ethics at <a href="https://www.isir.upmc.fr/">Pierre and Marie Curie University</a> in Paris.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, our goal should be eudaimonia, a practice elucidated by Aristotle that defines human well-being, both at the individual and collective level, as the highest virtue for a society. Translated roughly as “flourishing”, the benefits of eudaimonia begin with conscious contemplation, where ethical considerations help us define how we wish to live. Whether our ethical practices are Western (e.g., Aristotelian, Kantian), Eastern (e.g., Shinto, 墨家/School of Mo, Confucian), African (e.g., Ubuntu), or from another tradition, honoring holistic definitions of societal prosperity is essential versus pursuing one-dimensional goals of increased productivity or gross domestic product (GDP). Autonomous and intelligent systems should prioritize and have as their goal the explicit honoring of our inalienable fundamental rights and dignity as well as the increase of human flourishing and environmental sustainability.” <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ethically-Aligned-Design-IEEE-Human-Well-Being-Autonomous-and-Intelligent-Systems.pdf">Page 4</a></p>
<p>Looks like the eudaimonia protocol may involve scary ghostlike presences pulling the strings of your smart appliances to gaslight you into accepting the programmed new normal. I often link to this piece by Van Diamondfinger, “<a href="https://main.oxfordamerican.org/magazine/item/1243-domestic-front">The Domestic Front</a>.” The guy must know what’s coming; it dates to 2017. Still, it’s worth fifteen minutes of your time. Keep the image below in mind as you read it.</p>

<p>Page six of the document indicates that metrics assessing “flourishing” will be aligned to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and will require universal access to communication networks. Otherwise how can the autonomous intelligent systems aid us on our self-improvement pathways? Then on page eight the document discusses the importance of well-being metrics, the very same ones laid out by Stiglitz’s commission. The authors go on to say that social norms of different communities need to be documented and made computable, otherwise the intelligent agents won’t be able to serve their intended purpose.</p>
<p>“At the present time, the conceptual complexities surrounding what “values” are make it difficult to envision A/IS that have computational structures directly corresponding to social or cultural values such as “security,” “autonomy,” or “fairness”. It may be a more realistic goal to embed explicit norms into such systems. Since norms are observable in human behavior, they can therefore be represented as instructions to act in defined ways in defined contexts, for a specific community—from family to town to country and beyond. A community’s network of social and moral norms is likely to reflect the community’s values, and A/IS equipped with such a network would, therefore, also reflect the community’s values.” <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ethically-Aligned-Design-IEEE-Human-Well-Being-Autonomous-and-Intelligent-Systems.pdf">Page 171</a></p>
<p>In charter cities, the idea is that communities will be created from scratch under the presumption, likely inaccurate, that all residents have opted-in and personally endorse the structured social norms coded into the infrastructure at the time of incorporation. I’m picturing a cross between a busy-body homeowners association, intentional community, monastery, or college dorm. Ok, really I’m thinking about B.F. Skinner’s Walden Two and its real life counterpart, <a href="https://www.twinoaks.org/">Twin Oaks</a> in Louisa, VA. In the clip below former Twin Oaks community member turned Smith College behavioral psychologist <a href="https://www.abainternational.org/constituents/bios/davidpalmer.aspx">David Palmer</a> makes a case for cooperative living where the use of shared resources creates economic efficiencies that might even “save the world.”</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ98MoUyjnM">Source</a>: Reflecting on Walden Two With Dave Palmer</p>
<p>The one not so insignificant issue, however, is human behavior management. The ideal of the charter city would be to develop a machine for “sustainable” living, even “flourishing.” This would be accomplished through sophisticated development of behavioral economics to guide society towards optimization metrics with such subtlety that even residents might forget that the choices being made were not entirely their own.</p>
<p>I haven’t had a chance to read Alexandra Ruthorford’s 2009 book, “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Beyond-the-Box-Skinner-Technology-of-Life.pdf">Beyond the Box: B.F. Skinner’s Technology of Behavior From Laboratory to Life, 1950s to 1970s</a>,” but I ordered a copy and added it to my summer reading list. Linked is a PDF if you’re partial to a free, digital format. It would seem that Skinner’s legacy, expanded upon by the many social science researchers affiliated with <a href="https://www.ideas42.org/about-us/">Ideas42</a>, is being manifested in the linkage of DeFi (decentralized finance) to Internet of Things connected living situations for which displaced people receiving “aid” are on the front lines as Leo Saraceno has laid out in great detail through his work at <a href="https://siliconicarus.org/author/leo-saraceno/">Silicon Icarus</a>.</p>
<p>This is another excerpt from the OECD social impact measurement policy paper that discusses the need for system change / social change:</p>
<p>“Further, social entrepreneurs are under growing pressure not just to deliver on their mission, but also to create system change. For example, one of the pioneering and most eminent incubators of social entrepreneurs, Ashoka, views its purpose as transforming inequality by changing mind-sets globally. This implies heightened information needs in order to understand complex social problems and evidence social change. Undeniably, such large scale and ground-breaking aspirations require the ability to learn and build from failures. However, instances where charities or social enterprises are lauded for being transparent and open about failure remain seldom. The discomfort and stigma around failure need to be addressed if social impact measurement is to help uncover and address the drivers and impediments to social change.” <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Social-Impact-measurement-for-the-Social-and-Solidarity-Economy.pdf">Page 56</a></p>
<p>I propose that the framing used here is operating on two levels. The first is the one most readers would see, and that is about assessing effective strategies for mass social control and steering – systems change. The second, which I doubt would register for most readers is the use of so-called evidence generated through trial and error, and made legitimate through pay-for-success finance structures, to LEARN human social systems and transmit that learning into the hivemind as impact data. The images below show how ordinary people are tasked with collecting impact data in and around the homes of their peers and how Ocean Protocol then uses that data to advance the development of artificial intelligence. Aggregation of information about group dynamics and the use of it for social physics and prediction markets is based on work carried out by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_L._Moreno">Jacob Moreno</a>, father of <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2014/10/j-l-moreno-a-psychologists-30s-experiments-invented-social-networking.html">sociograms</a> and psycho-drama in the 1930s, and Alexander “<a href="https://littlesis.org/person/366499-Alex_Pentland_aka_Sandy_Pentland">Sandy” Pentland</a>, pioneer in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2010/0830/e-gang-mit-sandy-pentland-darpa-sociometers-mining-reality.html?sh=545b5e9b7c7f">interactive media</a> at MIT in the 1990s.</p>

<p>The evolution of artificial agents requires ongoing data transfer from our human experience into the emerging <a href="https://www.proquest.com/openview/2094cd55db808e343750e6eda4b3851d/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=1818062">World Sensorium</a> (Global Brain). The desire is that this data be structured to maximize utility and potential for pattern recognition. That means humans, in addition to other beings and objects, need to be assigned unique identifiers, which is why there are so many options bubbling up: ID2020, health passports, digital driver’s licenses, blockchain education transcripts and medical records, crypto play to earn games, and programmable money for refugees. Eventually all those side chains will interlock into comprehensible digitally-twinned individuals and societies.</p>
<p>According to the IEEE authors, their intent is for affective computing to be deployed in such a way as to neither amplify or dampen human emotional experience. It’s strange to contemplate that these engineers really want us to accept and internalize interacting with machines as if they were peers is a sane way to live. Though, if the goal is to nudge us towards a post-human existence, digital mediation of all social and environmental transactions towards some optimization scheme would be in keeping with the de Chardin / Huxley / Vernadsky / Reiser imagined World Brain evolutionary imperative.</p>
<p>Among the many concerns raised in the <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ethically-Aligned-Design-IEEE-Human-Well-Being-Autonomous-and-Intelligent-Systems.pdf">report</a> are: the potential for psychological manipulation of humans by intelligent systems (page 85); artificial intelligence impersonating humans (page 86); interference by non-human agents in human interpersonal relationships (page 96); the threat posed by coercive nudging (page 97); loss of individual autonomy (page 103); the use of intelligent toys for surveillance and profiling of children (page 120); weaponization of smart home technologies (page 145); labor displacement due to automation (page 152); the inability of intelligent systems to adapt to dynamic social norms (page 173);&nbsp; and how lack of understanding by the masses regarding how the technologies actually work will lead to poor implementation and bad outcomes (page 213).</p>

<p>IEEE has taken on the role of looking out for our interests by promoting digital identity as the key driver in the attainment of human rights, good governance, and self-determination in mixed reality. It is interesting that they keep bringing up democracy and political freedom, even though the authors must know the planned future is that of <a href="https://e-estonia.com/">Estonian e-citizenship</a>, a world where where one’s identity is defined less by the geographic location of your physical body than the accumulated SBTs (Soulbound Tokens) that define your avatar doppelganger.</p>

<p>Centering international human rights is key, because they need for one consistent legal system to extend across their borderless digital empire. The same set of smart contracts must function throughout the Metaverse no matter where you reside. On page 200, IEEE speaks of the Ruggie Principles, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Read the following with the understanding that the goal is for the government to become fully corporatized so as to eventually operate without human management as DAOs, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations.</p>
<p>“The Ruggie principles have been widely referenced and endorsed by corporations and have led to the adoption of several corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies in various companies. With broadened support, the Ruggie principles will strengthen the role of businesses (read DAOs) in protecting and promoting human rights and ensuring that the most crucial human values and legal standards of human rights are respected by A/IS technologists.” <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ethically-Aligned-Design-IEEE-Human-Well-Being-Autonomous-and-Intelligent-Systems.pdf">Page 200</a></p>

Picture citizens of an incorporated charter city that has its own legal standing to manage everything contained within its boundaries – citizens as wards of a machine, or collection of nested “machines.”</p>
<p>Below the slide of Villa Savoye are images of a pre-fab “tiny-home” model with embedded IoT, to maximize data extraction. <a href="https://austin.towers.net/austin-tiny-home-startup-kasita-rides-again-with-tiny-hotels-in-mind/">Kasita</a>, an Austin operation that rebranded from domiciles to resorts, eagerly promotes that its built-in technology can be customized to your mood, or perhaps the inverse depending on how “smart” it gets. Part of the pitch is that the “relatively” low unit cost makes the Kasitas good for affordable housing and disaster relief.

<p>In his <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/From_the_Ground_Up/GiYdUqx1m6wC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=mondragon+mitterand&amp;pg=PA95&amp;printsec=frontcover">book</a> on grassroots and worker democracy, Benello described the revolutionary qualities of Mondragon Corporation as creating a total system where one can learn, shop, and live within a cooperative environment. In such a culture people are supposed to be highly motivated, because moral incentives are integrated into every aspect of life: work, community, education, consumption, and family. Benello says workers have to be socialized into the culture; growing up Basque isn’t sufficient (<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/From_the_Ground_Up/GiYdUqx1m6wC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=mondragon+mitterand&amp;pg=PA95&amp;printsec=frontcover">Page 96</a>). Yet he praises the systems engineering approach to workplace management, stating that cooperatives reward labor, rather than capital, with profit and control. This, according to <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/author/B/C/au46055523.html">Benello</a>, empowers workers rather than infantilizing them (<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/From_the_Ground_Up/GiYdUqx1m6wC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=mondragon+mitterand&amp;pg=PA95&amp;printsec=frontcover">Page 96)</a>. I have many concerns as to the applicability of such a model in a world of ubiquitous computing, tokenized “participatory democracy,” platform cooperatives, and digital nudges. Rather than uplifting community agency in work, education, and living spaces, it feels far more likely that we’ll end up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi">Tamagotchi</a> pets trapped in cybernetic biospheres.</p>

<p>The well-being framework that the IEEE used was based on the OECD’s Better Life Initiative’s 2013 document, “<a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/9789264191655-en.pdf?expires=1656981699&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=7FED247A8BE1A8F6FB9CE39F8AAF71D4">Guidelines on Measuring Subjective Well-being</a>.” IEEE is developing its own draft standard for well-being metrics for autonomous intelligent systems through its working group <a href="https://sagroups.ieee.org/7010/wp-content/uploads/sites/275/2019/01/IEEE-P7010_WellbeingMetricsforA_IS_ShortPaper_December272018For_Submission_reviewedbyIEEELegal-1.pdf">IEEE P7010</a>. As a person who lives in a poor city with serious problems in the areas of housing and food insecurity, addiction, low-wage employment, mental health issues, and community violence, the idea that these technocrats are going to adopt some survey so that machines will interact with us in ways that actually improve the conditions of people’s lives is quite infuriating. It is hard to know that people are being harmed to lower baseline scores to make the odds better for bets on future improvement, but we cannot look away and pretend that’s not what’s happening. For more on my perspective you can read <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2019/03/03/philadelphias-5th-district-city-council-race-a-call-for-a-town-hall-on-social-impact-investing/">a piece that I wrote</a> about poverty in Philadelphia’s 5th Councilmanic District in 2019.</p>
 California and the Border Crisis 
<p>To bring all this back to the Berggruen Network and California’s Blueprint for “good governance” and close out this exploration, we must understand that displaced people are a central feature of the social impact economy. Much of the infrastructure to support this new economic model was developed in Silicon Valley and funded through tech-related “philanthropy,” of which the <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2019/01/04/silicon-valleys-social-impact-deal-maker/">Silicon Valley Community Foundation</a> is a major player. I find it interesting, given these investigations into Mondragon Corporation and the tradition of Spanish cooperatives, that the father of Laura Arillaga-Andreessen; Marc’s wife,&nbsp; pioneer of west coast impact investing, and <a href="https://www.sv2.org/person/laura-arrillaga-andreessen/">former SVCF truste</a>e, just happened to be the son of Basque immigrants who moved to Inglewood. John Arrillaga, one of Stanford’s top donors – to the tune of <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2022/02/09/deeply-grateful-for-his-remarkable-vision-stanford-remembers-philanthropist-john-arrillaga-60/">$300 million over his lifetime</a>, won a basketball scholarship and went on to <a href="https://archive.ph/g7zeg">build much of Silicon Valley</a> with his real estate partner Richard Peery. Arrillaga played for <a href="https://aboutbasquecountry.eus/en/2022/01/30/john-arrillaga-the-basque-silicon-valley-creator-who-played-in-the-bilbao-aguilas-in-memoriam/">Bilbao Aguilas</a> in 1960-61, so he could travel abroad and learn more about his <a href="https://stanfordmag.org/contents/basque-studies-debut">family’s culture</a>.</p>

<p>An influential presence in the tech-impact space is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/andreessen-horowitz-is-making-the-move-to-san-francisco-at-long-last/">Marc Andreessen</a> and his A16z blockchain portfolio with holdings in <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/04/02/celo/">Celo</a> and <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/07/27/investing-in-valora/">Valora</a> – all based in San Francisco. There’s the research taking place at Singularity University where management of data is inexorably moving us towards a Kurzweil post-human future, and of course Google and Linux Foundation and Unity and Salesforce and countless others. Sufficeth to say, many of the strings being pulled on the global stage around UBI and ubiquitous computing are being pulled from locations in California. Much of the groundwork for Web 3.0 has been laid by Bay Area faux-gressive techno-libertarians. California is a leader in the development of policy infrastructure for blockchain ID, micro-finance, digital payments, and human capital management. It’s in malleable mixed-reality, beyond the relative concreteness of the material world, that neuro-technicians of defense edu-tainment will do their best work concocting devastating cognitive warfare magic.</p>
<p>Seeing rising rates of homelessness in California, it is important to understand that the conditions are being created for social-impact “smart” <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/highland-park-tiny-home-village-homeless/2726687/">towns of tiny homes</a> where everyone can be put on pathways of self-improvement to train autonomous-intelligent systems and build character through remote gig work. It’s like the Jesuit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuit_Missions_of_Chiquitos">reducions</a> in Brazil and the Franciscan missions – captive neophytes converted through wrap around services to a holographic “faith.”</p>
<p>The state’s major health systems like <a href="https://www.csh.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CSH-Health-Center-Role-in-Housing-Innovations-Sept-2021-WEB.pdf">Kaiser Permanente’s “Thriving Communities”</a> are positioning themselves to get into the wellness markets in a big way. Authorized tiny house encampments are increasingly managed by faith-based welfare NGOs, fancied up with a “small-is-beautiful” aesthetic. Paint them with quirky murals and add some picnic tables, maybe a few raised garden beds, and the liberals feel good about it. Even though when you scratch below the surface, it’s obvious such a lifestyle is never going to be satisfying for anyone long term.</p>

<p>I spoke about this outside Project Home, a Catholic charity in Philadelphia that launched the city’s first pay for success finance deal for supportive housing. I was doing some informational picketing with intrepid, now deceased housing rights activist <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-jennifer-bennetchs-family">Jennifer Bennetch</a>. A <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2019/01/04/charter-public-health-and-catholic-charity-interests-help-launch-disruptive-pay-for-success-program/">blog post</a> I wrote on Catholic Charities of Santa Clara County, CA and impact investing provides additional context. It is important to make the connection between digital surveillance of displaced people abroad and internally-displaced residents here in the United States. Social impact finance creates profits from trauma and misery. Therefore the demand is to create as much of both as possible and slowly ameliorate those conditions, all the while collecting “evidence” on data dashboards.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Control of the Mexico-US border has been a polarizing issue for decades, and while less of an issue in California, the state does have&nbsp; the largest immigrant population in the nation. Industries have emerged from this manufactured disaster to process those kept in detainment, extracting practically free labor from captive workers. Some of those operators, like <a href="https://documentedny.com/2021/11/02/geo-group-owes-immigrant-detainees-nearly-17-3-million/">Geo Group</a>, are now moving into social work, since pay for success finance deals are being linked to anti-recidivism stats.</p>
<p>Geo Group’s western regional office is in Los Angeles. The state operates <a href="https://www.geogroup.com/LOCATIONS">a half-dozen facilities</a> in the state. Knowing many conservatives are inclined to free-market investments and have ties to faith-based organizations involved in social service delivery, I see a possible future where refugees from US-enabled drug wars, gang violence, and economic manipulation are brought into charter cities in Opportunity/Promise Zones or remote areas of the US and managed for impact data and sweat-shop cyber labor. Of course it’s not only immigrants who will be subjected to these new purpose-built social-impact “communities.” Soon the fate of many Central Americans will befall working and middle class people in the United States as their economic lifelines are cut, and society becomes increasingly unstable.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://www.geogroup.com/GEO-Care">Source</a>: Geo Care Services – Continuum of Care, Reentry, Electronic Monitoring</p>
<p>Remaking Opportunity Zones and Promise Neighborhoods as mini-charter cities would subsidize profit-taking in less than desirable real estate, “smart” construction developments, and third sector servicing of marginalized workers and children. The education, health, and credit union systems built into the Basque Mondragon model would go hand in hand with “pay for success” finance. Worker “satisfaction” is a metric that is being built into social impact deals, and that has long been a selling point for worker cooperatives.</p>
<p>That would be a possible Third-Way “solution” designed to appease activists across the political divide. The understanding would be that refugees and displaced people would “opt in” to the programs, living under coded laws of what are sure to be austere settlements of pervasive surveillance, perhaps with a cooperative veneer of collective participation through tokenomics. The Charter Cities Institute mentions their hope that Biden’s election would create a more receptive environment for their proposals:</p>
<p>“Despite political challenges, the upheavals of 2020 have presented a unique opportunity to advocate for change. There is a new president in the United States, who has expressed greater willingness to engage with the international community on refugee issues than his predecessor. Policymakers and humanitarians are rethinking their approaches to refugee encampments as a result of the preventable disease outbreaks that continue to result from living conditions in the camps. This is a time for bold thought and action in a world that, if current trends hold, will only see forced displacement increase. There is no replacement for political changes at the global and national levels, but one starting point to make these changes possible is through local initiatives.” <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/How-Charter-Cities-Can-Create-Better-Refugee-Responses.pdf">Page 29</a></p>
<p>Raul Diego’s “<a href="https://siliconicarus.org/2021/04/02/biden-picks-kamala-harris-to-carry-the-carrot-and-stick-in-central-america/">Biden Picks Kamala Harris to Carry the Carrot and Stick in Central America</a>,” offers important insights into Harris’s involvement in the creation of <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-launches-first-its-kind-criminal-justice-open">OpenJustice database</a> in California and what that means for her involvement in the border crisis – namely, more money funneled into the expansion of surveillance technologies like <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6439/text">Biometric Identification Transnational Migration Alert Program</a> (BITMAP), <a href="https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/183768.pdf">Central America Regional Security Initiative</a> (CARSI), and <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhsobimpia-004-homeland-advanced-recognition-technology-system-hart-increment-1">Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology System</a> (HART).</p>
<p>Politically, there is no appetite to slow migration or resolve the physical and economic violence that compels so many to make dangerous journeys north. We have entered the age of the data economy. People on the move, once they’ve been properly tagged, generate a lot of data. The goal is to get as many people as possible into the track-and-track supply chain for future management as human capital assets. I have a suspicion that the trauma generated by separation of immigrant families with children, has a lot to do with plans to ensure everyone’s biometric information is attached to a blockchain identity in the near future. They create the problem to guide you to the “solution” they wanted all along.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris was a junior US Senator during the years that the <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/12/22/silicon-valley-a-laboratory-of-smart-surveillance-and-privatization/comment-page-1/">Santa Clara County pay-for-success pilot programs</a> were put in place. Before that she had served as state District Attorney and District Attorney for San Francisco. During her time as San Francisco DA there was <a href="https://miningawareness.wordpress.com/2020/08/29/kamala-harris-covered-up-75-years-of-sex-abuse-of-little-boys-by-catholic-priests-including-priests-still-working-with-children/">public criticism that she suppressed information</a> held by her office relating to the sexual abuse of children by priests. The implication was that she was politically beholden to the Catholic Church. <a href="https://www.bishop-accountability.org/news2005_01_06/2005_01_19_Russell_SFArchbishop.htm">William Levada,</a> Archbishop of San Francisco at the time, was later appointed Cardinal by Pope Benedict the XVI whom he served as Prefect of the&nbsp;<a title="Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregation_for_the_Doctrine_of_the_Faith">Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith</a> between 2005 and 2012, the highest ranking American in Rome. Prior to coming to the Bay Area Levada had led the Portland, OR Archdiocese where he was also criticized for covering up abuse. Portland was the first Archdiocese to be <a href="https://www.archbalt.org/portland-archdiocese-75-million-settlement/">bankrupted</a> by settlements from abuse-related litigation.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/religion-lawsuits-us-news-ap-top-news-ca-state-wire-ecc0da5f6ac94b13be11e2a388967a85">Source</a>: Victims Question Harris’s Record on Clergy Abuse</p>
<p>It is all our responsibility as adults to face the real and serious consequences of the technologies that are being brought into the world and reflect on their potential for profound misuse based on historical precedent. We have to be able to comprehend the playbook and cut through their sweet talk of tokenized cooperation and innovative funding programs for the commons.</p>
<p>State-of-exception charter cities could easily become places where abuse and authoritarianism flourish. Consider the profound intergenerational trauma generated by the sexual abuse, forced child labor, and murder of indigenous youth through residential school prison camps modeled on <a href="https://carlisleindianschoolproject.com/">Carlisle</a>. In the twenty-first century we have that same drive towards domination and attempted erasure of social systems that counter the industrialized model, but now that ethos can be combined with powerful tools of prediction, profiling, and cognitive warfare harnessed to automated global finance markets.</p>
<p>It feels to me like what we are experiencing is ongoing AB market research to determine how best to sell “sustainable” confinement in such a way that it can thread the needle – appealing to the Left on the grounds of “green,” progressive care and to the Right’s inclinations towards faith-based crypto sovereignty.</p>
<p>There but for the grace of God go each of us. Who knows how far out on the horizon our date with displacement or a charter city may be. The one thing that seems certain is that massive disruption was baked into the plan long, long ago. That is why, in my opinion, with the time we have we need to throw as many wrenches as we can into the gears of Web 3.0 mixed reality, digital identity, “regenerative” finance, and human capital engineering. All that is sacred hangs in the balance.</p>

<p>While the deadline for the Beyond Inclusion Scholarship application is approaching (<a href="https://cyberxr.org/beyond-inclusion-scholarship/">Have you applied?

<p>“Representation matters. We’re committed to reaching a candidate pool that is as broad and diverse as possible, which is why we are proud to support the Beyond Inclusion Scholarship Program,” said Rob Sherman, deputy chief privacy officer at Meta, in a statement. “As companies and organizations build for the metaverse, it’s important that people from underrepresented communities have a seat at the table from the beginning — influencing product strategies, policies and perspective.”</p>



<p>Here’s what our CEO, Kavya Pearlman, said to Mr Takahashi. </p>



<p>“To create fair and equal work opportunities, we need to eliminate financial barriers to entry in immersive technologies and provide equitable measures like fully funded scholarships,” Pearlman said. “We need corporations to fulfil their social responsibility and collectively go beyond just inclusion by committing to increase the representation of underrepresented identity groups. This benefits not just the marginalized community but the entire technology ecosystem.”</p>

    <p>We’ve wrapped up Q2 2022, and we are excited to continue the growth of the Horizen ecosystem through new product launches, including <a href="https://testnet.tokenmint.global/">TokenMint on testnet</a> and our new <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Cobalt wallet!</a> We have also added five new integration pairs and exchange listings.</p>
 Q2 Highlights&nbsp; 
<p></p>
<p>Now is an exciting time for our ecosystem. Since the launch of <a href="https://horizen.io/zendoo">Zendoo</a>, our team has focused on launching products and adding new capabilities to our platform. This quarter we focused on the launch of our tokenization platform, TokenMint, and EVM compatibility, and our community growth has seen a huge increase because of it!</p>
 Products and Engineering Development 
 TokenMint on Testnet 
<p>This quarter, we launched our no-code necessary tokenization platform, TokenMint, to testnet. TokenMint is an easy-to-use platform for anyone to launch a token using custom tokenomics without having to know a single line of code. It streamlines and simplifies the tokenization process which makes creating a fungible token very easy and quick.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The TokenMint platform lives on TokenMint Chain, which is a sidechain built on Horizen. The testnet launch of the TokenMint platform comprised the launch of:</p>
 
 TokenMint Chain – an independent blockchain built on the Horizen sidechain platform, Zendoo.&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Cobalt Wallet</a> – a web browser extension wallet that stores and manages tokens created on TokenMint.&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://tokenmint.global/">Token Generator</a> – a web app that allows a streamlined and easy process for anyone to create and mint a fungible token with custom tokenomics.&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://explorer.tokenmint.global/">TokenMint Block explorer</a> – a block explorer that tracks and displays all transactions on the TokenMint Chain.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Over 550 tokens were created by our community, and the user feedback we received from our community helped us refine TokenMint features for its upcoming mainnet launch this month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also airdropped our own testnet tokens called Test Zenny (TZNY) and testnet CAKE (TCAKE) as a way to reward community participation in testing and other community activities. Over 8000 unique addresses received TZNY as of July 5th.&nbsp;</p>
 Cobalt Wallet 
<p>Along with <a href="https://testnet.tokenmint.global/">TokenMint</a>, we launched the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Cobalt wallet</a>. Cobalt is a web browser extension for Chrome and Brave browsers that mints, stores, and manages all tokens created on TokenMint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cobalt currently only supports TokenMint tokens as well as ZEN transfers between Horizen mainchain and TokenMint Chain. The team aims to extend Cobalt’s capability to support interoperability among different blockchain ecosystems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 EVM Sidechain Progress 
<p>The sidechain engineering team worked on the launch of our EVM sidechain. This upcoming sidechain will enable people to easily create their own Ethereum-based dapps on our ecosystem or bridge to existing dapps on other EVM-compatible platforms. We are excited to launch this sidechain in the near future.&nbsp;</p>
 Community Growth &amp; Updates 
<p></p>
<p>The community saw incredible growth this quarter, especially on Discord. We saw a 111.7% increase in total Discord members since Q1. The excitement and feedback received from the community about our latest products were incredible. Our community was also able to get a special new Discord Role (Test Pilots) for helping us test TokenMint and Cobalt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we welcomed a lot of new members to our community, the engagement rate increased tremendously, especially on Discord, with a soaring increase of 2,453% in monthly average new active communicators.&nbsp; Our other social media community also saw a large increase in engagement with an 86.6% increase on Linkedin, 29.5% increase on Twitter, and 18.6% on Facebook. Our most liked content focused on the release of TokenMint to testnet and the announcement of the activities we planned around the launch! The team will continue to plan additional activities around the mainnet launch of TokenMint, so be sure to look out for these in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also had a bump in activity on <a href="https://hde.horizen.io/">HDE tasks</a>, with our most popular tasks being creating content about TokenMint and testing the platform. The number of people signed up to test the TokenMint platform exceeded the task limit within the first few days of the task release! <br><br>We also welcomed a couple of new members to the <a href="https://www.horizen.io/ambassadors/">ambassador program</a>. We are excited that our long-time community members, Ghost and DeFi Money Printer, chose to join the program to help our community through social platforms and helpful content creation!</p>
<p>We also saw growth on the web, with a 6.5% increase in overall site traffic, a 5.9% increase in organic keyword rankings, and a 5.8% increase in referring domains. Social referral traffic was up 234% in Q2, with a 170% increase in blog traffic, a 120% increase in HEAP traffic, and a 24% increase in HDE traffic.</p>

 Events 
 Paris Blockchain Week 
<p></p>
<p>The Horizen team was at Paris Blockchain Week April 12-14! Our booth was packed during all three days of the event. We discussed our upcoming EVM-compatible sidechain and NFTs, and learned about a lot of exciting new projects in the space. Liat also spoke on several panels about NFTs and blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>
 Consensus 
<p></p>
<p>The Horizen team was in Austin, Texas, for Consensus 2022, where we had a fantastic time! We had a booth set up where we were able to give live demos of TokenMint; many attendees stopped by and created their own tokens in only 5 minutes, learning how the token generator works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Horizen Co-Founder and Team Lead Rob Viglione presented <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cGfULIwRg&amp;t=3s">“From Cypherpunk to Solving the Blockchain Trilemma Through zkSNARKS”</a> at Consensus to a packed audience while also conducting a fireside chat on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2JjEdrpM9g&amp;t=1s">“How Zero-Knowledge Proofs Change the Narrative Around Privacy.”</a></p>
<p>Horizen, along with Horizen Labs, hosted a side event with our partner, Halborn Security at Consensus, where guests enjoyed food, drink, and networking! We saw many longtime community members at the event, and it was a good chance for much of the team to network and catch up with each other during the busy event week.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 NFT NYC 
<p></p>
<p>This year, Zain Cheng Horizen’s VP of Engineering, presented on the future of NFTs during this major event in NYC. Zain’s panel discussion was one of our favorite talks during the event and covered his opinions on what the future of NFTs could look like.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Horizen Labs hosted a Happy Hour event during NFT.NYC and welcomed hundreds of guests and Horizen community members.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Introducing the first Nym Service&nbsp;Provider</p><p>Nym is an open, decentralised privacy infrastructure. The infrastructure is run by people all over the world and is composed of different node types that each perform slightly different roles. In short, when using the infrastructure for privacy, your communications traffic would first be encrypted by a Nym client on your device and then sent on&nbsp;to:</p><blockquote><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/gateways-to-privacy-51196005bf5">Gateway nodes</a> which are the first hop into the&nbsp;mixnet;</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/choose-your-character-an-overview-of-nym-network-actors-19e6a9808540">Mix nodes</a> that mix people’s traffic through three sets of nodes, making it untraceable;</blockquote><blockquote>And finally, Network Requesters are the hop out that takes the user from the exit gateway to an app — which they are now using in a privacy-enhanced mode!</blockquote><p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/choose-your-character-an-overview-of-nym-network-actors-19e6a9808540">Previous blog posts</a> have covered Gateways, Mix nodes and Validators. This post is a deep dive into <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/requester">Network Requesters</a>, which is the first type of Nym Service Provider, connecting the core privacy infrastructure to user-facing applications.</p><p>Before delving into Network Requesters, let’s have a broader look at the role of Service Providers in general — of which Network Requesters are just one&nbsp;type…</p><p>NOTE: Nym will very shortly be issuing grants for starting up and running Network Requesters. If you want to be among the first to provide mass access to network level privacy, sign up <a href="http://eepurl.com/h6uPSD">here</a> and stay&nbsp;tuned…</p> Service Providers <p>The design space for Service Providers (SPs) is very open: some will allow access to external services on the internet, shielding the user from the prying eyes of data scraping and machine-learning-enabled observers; other SPs will allow access to shielded services that can only be accessed via the&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Developing SPs doesn’t involve rethinking how you design your app from the ground up (in terms of code anyway)! You can think of SPs just as ‘applications that can communicate with a local Nym client’. This means that you can spend more time exploring the growing ‘private-by-design’ application design space, and less about integration!</p><p>It’s likely that people running SPs will also run their own gateway for their app, to ensure reliability and uptime. That said, a small SP could easily rely on the public gateways available to them if they wanted&nbsp;to!</p> On the internet no-one needs to know you’re using the&nbsp;mixnet… <p>Now you might be wondering how SPs might protect people’s privacy! SPs enable people to use even not-so-private applications in a privacy-preserving way. They may facilitate anonymised requests to public web services outside of Nym network to applications such as Keybase or Telegram, Mail servers, or even blockchains.</p><p>SPs do this in the same way as a standard proxy service: it takes your message request from the mixnet, and passes it to the specific endpoint elsewhere. The clearnet recipient — such as a web server — doesn’t (and shouldn’t) even need to have any awareness of Nym! To them the SP is just another application sending them a web request. The metadata exposed by the request will only be that of the SP. As a result, the origin of the request — the Nym user — will be protected, and any observer monitoring the clearnet traffic will be none the wiser than if they were interacting with the server from their metadata.</p><p>SPs that do not communicate outside of the Nym network can offer similar services to the standard range of application or server solutions available on the internet, but privacy-enhanced, and existing solely within the Nym network. Something like secure untraceable data backups are an immediate example: think anonymous Dropbox or file hosting services.</p> Introducing the Nym Network Requester <p>We already have one SP in our <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/service-providers/network-requester">github repository</a> and the <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/requester/">docs for you to try running it</a>: the Network Requester (NR). The NR is a binary that can be run alongside a Nym client on a VPS, which allows for private network requests to be made outside the mixnet from your local Nym&nbsp;client.</p><p>Why would you be using this? When you are using your desktop app, it communicates to the application backend servers, or makes outbound web requests. The Network Requester sits on ‘other side’ of the mixnet making these requests for you thereby hiding your metadata!</p><p>For example: you can use the Nym SOCKS5 client to connect your local Telegram desktop app to the Telegram servers to collect and send messages. This means that the Telegram servers see a request from the Network Requester instead of your local computer. The Network Requester acts in a similar way to a proxy, routing requests for you and passing back the responses it gets from Telegram’s message&nbsp;servers.</p><p>How does it work? It’s a piece of code which checks an inbound request from its Nym client, checks the domain that is being requested and whether this domain is on a whitelist, and if so, forwards the request and then passes the response back to the requesting client (i.e.&nbsp;you).</p><p>From the user’s perspective, this all happens under the hood. All you have to do is point your local SOCKS5 client to a NR that supports the domain you wish to access, and then point your local app into the SOCKS5&nbsp;client!</p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/requester">Explore how to run a Network Requester</a></p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/overview/">Explore the Nym privacy&nbsp;platform</a></p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Join Nym Discord</a> (Network Requester channel)</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/tech-deepdive-network-requesters-e5359a6cc31c">Tech deepdive: Network Requesters</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

It was a successful conference for the community, lots of fun, lots of heads turned, and lots of interest. Many community members attended, and for most of us it was the first time we all met in real life! It was an absolute pleasure and privilege meeting fellow community members and making friends along the way. The conference ignited a renewed sense of urgency for the continuation of the Verus mission. A public good for all of humanity, enabling novel ways for people to work together and create value.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz">Joseph Stiglitz</a>, former chief economist of the World Bank and Columbia University professor, paid visits to Mondragon in 2005 and 2018. He was looking at worker-owned cooperatives as a possible tool to resolve economic disparities created by capitalism. UN Sustainable Goal 8 is decent work and economic growth. In a 2020 New York Times article, “<a href="https://archive.ph/vAWSj">Co-ops in Spain’s Basque Region Soften Capitalism’s Rough Edges</a>,” Amal Chevrau of the OECD was quoted: “Mondragón is one of the landmarks of the social economy movement because of its scale.”</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mondragon-corporation.com/en/history/page/2/">Source</a>: Mondragon Timeline 2005, “Joseph Stiglitz (Fourth from the Left)</p>
<p>Peter Goodman, author of the piece, goes on to say the co-op model is suited to a new corporate outlook that asserts the importance of stakeholders, not just <a href="https://archive.ph/b7AtJ">shareholders</a>. The Business Roundtable affirmed this position in an August 2019 press release clarifying the <a href="https://archive.ph/FWZ7n">purpose of a corporation</a>. Cooperatives have been positioned as tools to meet targets for UN SDG 8 as seen in “<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/16094069211058614">The Mondragon Case: Companies Addressing Social Impact and Dialogic Methodologies</a>.” The following is taken from the OECD social impact measurement policy paper:</p>
<p>“Indeed, cooperatives have taken the lead in adopting appropriate indicators to capture their impacts in terms of social inclusion, well-being and community engagement. To be responsive the specificities and goals of Italian Work Integration, Social Cooperatives have developed a dedicated model with indicators on well-being and personal growth, which are operationalised through psychosocial perceptions of vulnerable people after their work experience in social cooperatives (e.g. trust in their abilities, happiness with their lives, enthusiasm and commitment to work). In Canada, the Urban Institute’s ABC of Co-op Impact identifies metrics to measure the community impact of cooperatives compared to other forms of businesses. Democratic governance and member empowerment in particular are identified as distinguishing features of cooperatives compared to for-profit companies. Similarly, the Centre of Excellence in Accounting and Reporting for Cooperatives has developed a set of key performance indicators along the domains voluntary and open membership, democratic member control, member economic participation, autonomy and independence, education, training and information, and concern for community.” <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Social-Impact-measurement-for-the-Social-and-Solidarity-Economy.pdf">Page 39</a></p>
<p>Here’s how the sausage gets made. To those who know nothing of platform cooperatives, tokenization, and impact finance it probably sounds benevolent and hopeful. I think, however, that if you review the topics and framing of these blog posts prepared by the Platform Cooperative Consortium carefully, you’ll see that their economy that “puts people first” has chosen that tactic, because the new economy demands everyone’s data.</p>
<p>Yes, they pay lip-service to the fact that you will own your own data and be able to participate in governance through awarded tokens, but the truth is that mixed reality is not a game created by the masses for their benefit. This is made very clear by the fact that the sole funder of the Platform Cooperativism Consortium is Google – a $1 million grant in 2018. The fact that this NGO’s headquarters is one block away from Union Square, a landmark for labor organizing and free speech in the United States, is a slap in the face to all who made sacrifices for workers’ rights.</p>

<p>The concept of <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w23780/w23780.pdf">Information Economics</a>, the impact of asymmetrical information on markets, was developed by Stiglitz. This fixation on resolving information inefficiencies precipitated the demand that everything be measured. One way to obtain measurements, and quantification of social relations for impact, within workplaces is to turn employers into platform cooperatives and then adopt a tokenized governance model to visualize the dynamics of internal operations, including adherence to stated corporate values.</p>
<p>It also drives the push for finclusion of the so-called un-banked. Eliminating anonymous informal transactions is an imperative for the data economy. It is a misguided quest for full spectrum dominance of all financial activity. Nothing is meant to exist beyond the reach of, the vision of, the machine. In “<a href="https://www.dgen.org/blog/decentralisation-at-work-cooperatives-on-blockchain">Decentralization at Work: Cooperatives on the Blockchain</a>,” Joshua Davila of <a href="https://www.dgen.org/about">dGen</a>, a Berlin-based consultancy working on “responsible” deployment of Web 3.0 technologies describes a DisCO (Distributed Cooperative Organization) Co-op model which is like a DAO with embedded aspects of eco-feminist economics. The effort is backed by <a href="https://www.tni.org/en/programmes">TNI</a>, the Transnational Institute, a program of the <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/36768-Institute_for_Policy_Studies">Institute for Policy Studies</a>, a liberal global NGO advancing the “green” economy, evidence-based drug policy, effective public services, people’s rights in trade, and opposition to structures of technological control (the irony).</p>

<p>The author of the 2019 DisCO Manifest, “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/DisCO-If-I-Only-Had-A-Heart.pdf">If I Had A Hear</a>t” is UK artist <a href="https://ruthcatlow.net/">Ruth Catlow</a> whose work asserts the potential of networked technology for emancipation. The project prefers the words distributed over decentralized and cooperative over autonomous. Their goal is to create community algorithmic trusts, DisCO CATs, to keep track of work related to the commons including unpaid care work through love, livelihood and pro-bono credits. The latter, especially when combined with fair trade certifications, will create metrics for UN Sustainable Goal 5, Gender Equity. The first use case was a Madrid-based online service, <a href="https://www.guerrillatranslation.org/2018/09/22/the-open-coop-governance-model-in-guerrilla-translation-an-overview/">Guerrilla Translation</a>, that uses a platform built on <a href="https://holo.host/">Holo</a>, a pilot for Open Value Cooperativism advanced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Bauwens">Michel Bauwens</a> and the P2P Foundation through its <a href="https://www.tni.org/files/publication-downloads/commons_transition_and_p2p_primer_v9.pdf">Common Transition</a> project.</p>

This reminds me of the new use case being applied to impact investing – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hOhOdCbBlU&amp;t=36s">Hypercerts</a> by San Francisco-based <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/protocol-labs">Protocol Labs</a>. The model of credit streams was later applied to a regional cultural project in western Spain relating to weaving and two maker-space “Fab-Labs,” one in&nbsp; Zimbabwe and the other Cooperation Jackson in Mississippi.&nbsp; Cooperation Jackson’s Fab-Lab uses software created by the MIT Center for Bits and Atoms.</p>
<p>On the surface this model seems reasonable. I know several extremely talented artists and writers whose ability to continue their vital work relies on navigating an increasingly perilous maze of gig work and one-off fundraisers. Stability and camaraderie of like-minded people is something we all seek. But to me this new brand of networked emancipation will demand all participants and the communities, online and offline, in which they are situated submit to the roll out of Web 3.0.</p>
<p>This will bring with it all kinds of smart contracts that will embed themselves in every aspect of our lives. It is only with great effort that activists are going to be able to hold onto the fiction that blockchain tools are serving them rather than confining them. The poster children for DisCO are eclectic, artsy makers, but we shouldn’t kid ourselves the model won’t be grabbed by the tentacles of corporate ESG portfolios or used to manage refugee camps or faith-based <a href="https://www.focolare.org/en/works-and-activities/cittadelle/">Focolare towns</a>.</p>

 Cybernetic Prosperity Gospel – Virtue and FreeDOM 
<p>The emerging economic system, embedded as it is within cybernetic enclosures, is taking on an anarcho-capitalist vibe where the far Left and far right, including the religious right, converge around a shared love of decentralization and the promise of techno-liberation. Somehow both sides think they can use a “tool” of state intelligence to accomplish their preferred economic and sacred ends. Color me dubious.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Left will enjoy a flat-horizontal social structure with weighted “woke” values embedded in its economic transacting for a while, but only until Aladdin comes on the scene. In the same way I think the religious right imagines a future of doing well by doing good and earning enough evidence-based charity tokens to pad their heavenly portfolio without stopping to think that the creator wouldn’t blockchain people and putting your faith in technology undercuts authentic spirituality.</p>
<p>I see the Acton Institute’s article <a href="https://www.acton.org/publications/transatlantic/2021/06/29/venerable-servant-god-jose-maria-arizmendiarrieta-patron">lauding</a> Arizmendiarrieta as the “patron saint of Spanish entrepreneurship,” as a clear example of the latter. Acton Institute is a Grand Rapids, Michigan based think tank that advocates Judeo-Christian values embedded in free-market economics. They are affiliated with the <a href="https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Atlas_Network">Atlas Network</a>, which is anti-regulation in outlook, and publish a peer-reviewed journal “<a href="https://www.marketsandmorality.com/index.php/mandm">Markets and Morality</a>.”</p>
<p>Grand Rapids, the <a href="https://www.experiencegr.com/articles/post/president-ford/">childhood home of Gerald Ford</a>, is the economic hub of western Michigan with <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/323562-Spectrum_Health">Spectrum Health System</a> its largest employer. <a href="https://www.amway.com/en_US/about-amway/history">Amway</a>, founded by the <a href="https://www.dbdvfoundation.org/news/how-and-why-amways-devos-family-gives-away-billions">influential DeVos family</a>, is located ten miles away in the suburb of Ada. The <a href="https://archive.ph/DKHjo">DeVos’s</a> are major donors, handing out millions upon millions in grants to nonprofits, many in Michigan, and to the Republican party. Betsy DeVos served as chair of the Republican Party of Michigan and was appointed Secretary of Education by Trump in 2016 where she advocated for charter school expansion and school choice. Among Acton Institute’s <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/52227-Acton_Institute_for_the_Study_of_Religion_and_Liberty">supporters</a> are DeVos, Eric Prince, the Kochs, and the <a href="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/4152914/2018_YearReview_BradleyFdn.pdf">Bradley Foundation</a> (Birch Society affiliate).

<p>The founder of Acton Institute is<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sirico"> Robert Sirico</a>, a man on an unusual spiritual journey. If there were ever an embodiment of shifted polarization it would be him. Raised in Brooklyn with his recently-deceased brother and Soprano’s actor <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/07/09/1110670719/sopranos-tony-sirico-dies-paulie-walnuts-obit">Tony Sirico</a>, Robert separated from the Catholic Church as a youth and moved to the west coast where he became a Pentecostal minister. He then changed course and established a church ministering to the gay community in Seattle and Los Angeles. Later, upon reading Hayek and the biography of John Neumann, he turned away from those beliefs and came back to the Catholic Church, attending Catholic University and becoming ordained as a Paulist priest.</p>
<p>A major influence on his theoretical understanding was Catholic philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Novak">Michael Nowak</a>. Nowak, a <a href="https://www.firstthings.com/article/1991/06/liberation-theology-whats-left">strong critic of Liberation Theology</a>, wrote “The Spirit of Democratic Capitalism, which theorized that democracy was only possible within free markets and a plural, liberalistic culture. During his time on the west coast Robert Sirico was active in peace and environmentalist movements. His goal at Acton is to bridge the Left’s position on the climate with the Right to become better stewards – though to my way of thinking this has everything to do with emergent markets in ESG finance and sensor networks.</p>
<p>The story goes that Sirico was inspired by Pope John Paul II’s encyclical,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centesimus_annus"> Centesimus annus</a>, which revisited the 1891 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rerum_novarum">Rerum novarum</a> in the waning days of the Cold War. It affirmed social and economic justice but in opposition to Marxism. He came to Grand Rapids to found Action Institute with <a href="https://www.acton.org/about/staff/kris-alan-mauren">Kris Mauren</a>, a Johns Hopkins graduate in international policy with a focus on nonprofit management and measurement. The men sought to promote virtue and freedom and honorable business practices grounded in private property rights. The organization has 50 employees, a $12 million annual budget, and maintains satellite offices in Rome and Buenos Aires. <a href="https://www.iese.edu/faculty-research/faculty/maximilian-b-torres/">Maximilian Torres</a>, professor of business ethics and corporate organizational measurement, connects Acton to Mondragon’s Spain and the Vatican’s inclusive capitalism. The Harvard Law alumnus took a PhD in Management at IESE in Navarre Span, an Opus Dei-affiliated institution, and taught there for a decade before coming back to Michigan where he now edits Acton’s “Journal of Markets and Morality.”</p>

 Blockchain Poverty Cure? 
<p>In the spirit of the church’s social teachings, Sirico <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBX5SKpjpWE">launched</a> the Institute’s PovertyCure initiative at the&nbsp; <a href="https://townhall.innis.utoronto.ca/event/the-newman-centre-toronto-poverty-cure-series-the-entrepreneurial-calling-screening-and-panel-discussion-with-andreas-widmer/">Newman Centre of the University of Toronto</a> in 2018. The <a href="https://www.povertycure.org/about-us">program</a>, which now has over 400 international partners in 150 countries, applies Christian-centered entrepreneurship to the problem of global poverty, fostering voluntary civil associations outside the state to promote human flourishing.</p>
<p>In 2014, Acton underwrote the creation of a documentary <a href="https://www.povertyinc.org/">Poverty, Inc.</a>, to prepare the ground for this work. The film, which won dozens of festival awards and was <a href="https://blog.acton.org/archives/83352-acton-institutes-poverty-inc-wins-templeton-freedom-award.html">recognized</a> by the John Templeton Foundation, is a good example of <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/09/30/dont-let-impact-investors-capture-the-non-profit-activist-media/">impact media.</a> The website even includes an “<a href="https://www.povertyinc.org/impact-survey">impact survey</a>” to capture metrics.</p>
<p>People on the Right who follow my work may be thinking, “So, what’s the problem? I don’t see anything not to like.” Well it gets murkier once you dig into the interests behind the creation of the film. Mark Weber was the point person. He’s the business innovation lead for IBM. From his <a href="https://www.markrweber.com/bio">online bio</a>: “Mark focuses on cultivating the research-to-impact workflow within a hybrid cloud ecosystem for driving AI applications with pathways to integration and scale.” “As a researcher, Mark has published works on blockchain technology for supply chain finance, graph deep learning for anti-money laundering, and AI fairness for anti-discrimination in lending.” Weber earned his MBA at the Sloan School where he worked as a graduate assistant on MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative (DCI). Weber overlapped for a year with DCI founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianforde/">Brian Forde</a>, who relocated to his home state of California in 2017 to run for a Congressional seat in Orange County (Forde lost).</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://www.markrweber.com/bio">Source</a>: Mark Weber – Driving Business Innovation from Fundamental Science</p>
<p>While at DCI Weber helped build <a href="https://dci.mit.edu/b-verify">b_verify</a>, a blockchain commodities tracking platform developed in <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/366647-b_verify">partnership</a> with Boston University (Jesuit), the University of Pennsylvania, the Mexican government, and the InterAmerican Development Bank. The platform was ostensibly to create efficiencies in warehousing and storage of commodities, but as we know, all of this technology is dual use.</p>
<p>At this point very few people are willing to say out loud that the plan is to tokenize poor people and children as commodities, track them, and place futures bets on them as you would a silo of GMO corn. If you read my <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/01/19/conditional-cash-transfers-and-cybernetic-futures/">detailed investigation</a> into Mexico’s pilot of conditional cash transfers to low-income women and children in the mid 1990s, you’ll understand my concern. There is a reason Mexico and InterAmerican Development Bank are on the partner list.</p>
<p>Michael Matheson Miller also helped create the film. Miller is an Acton Institute research fellow and wrote the book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Contagion-Intrusion-Surveillance-Capitalism-ebook/dp/B09GSWYDW7">Digital Contagion</a>” with a focus on Big Tech and surveillance capitalism. Of course we know how the dialectic works – the planned “solution” being some version of “rebel city” digital sovereignty (branded Left or Right as needed) so we will elect to commodify our souls and join IBM’s blockchain supply network that’s being built out by Mark Weber’s colleagues. Miller’s podcast topics at “The Moral Imagination,” are meant to appeal to Libertarians. They hit all the buttons – classical education, awake not woke, principled entrepreneurship, crypto; totalitarianism, beauty and love. They know how to tell you what you want to hear, but they aren’t going to tell you everything.</p>
<p>Mark knows that there’s a game afoot. Sirico may talk a good game about human flourishing, but I’ll state again that Jesus would not blockchain people and put them under ubiquitous digital surveillance for supply chain tracking. That is not freeDOM. That is not liberty. If you want to pull out of charity so you can push entrepreneurship, understand that a poor person succeeding in this age of automation will be practically impossible UNLESS they agree to be used for anti-poverty washing data analytics and synthetic biology for the open air prison. What Acton Institute is doing is asking people to live in the game while pretending that there is no game.</p>
<p>I invite you to read the description of blockchain warehouse logs with IoT surveillance monitoring. Then read <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/04/22/guest-post-our-acton-academy-experience-surveillance-incentives-behaviorism-freedom-levels-and-edtech/">this open letter</a> to Jeff and Laura Sandefer and parents who have children enrolled in Acton Academy franchise micro-schools. Acton Academy is <a href="https://www.acton.org/audio/heros-journey-jeff-sandefer">loosely connected</a> with Acton Institute through its Texas oilman founder Jeff Sander. The mom said she was very concerned about the amount of personal data being collected on her children in school through digital platforms. The Sandefer’s response was that they could choose to leave and that the kind of data they were collecting wasn’t Communist. I guess we’re supposed to be glad for it. I suppose they don’t count on people understanding digital twins and blockchain mind files. The school franchise and the Institute are both named after <a href="https://www.acton.org/about/mission#:~:text=The%20Acton%20Institute%20is%20a,Acton%20(1834%2D1902).">Lord Acton</a> who is often quoted as saying “Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.” Indeed.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://dci.mit.edu/b-verify">Source</a>: b_verify Warehouse Receipts An Open Source Blockchain Protocol For Verifiable Records</p>
 
 
<p>The text above:</p>
<p>“The selected use case informing this research is the negotiable warehouse receipt for agricultural commodities. Warehouse receipts (picture student meta-data on blockchain) are legally defined title documents attesting to a particular quantity, type, and quality of a commodity (securitized human capital) at a specific storage facility. These instruments can be used to secure inventory as collateral for loans, to facilitate trade, and to settle expiring futures contracts.</p>
<p>Development agencies and multilaterals have championed the benefits of warehouse receipts for price discovery (reputation scoring for securitization of humans as Berggruen’s tokenized assets) and access to credit for even the poorest of farmers. One USAID program in Tanzania produced a doubling of the prices farmers were able to command for their harvest immediately upon the installation of a storage and warehouse receipt program. Strengthening the agricultural sector also improves food security and competitiveness at a national level.</p>
<p>Three problems prevent warehouse receipts from realizing their full potential for farmers and society: forged documents, high transaction costs, and the potential for disparities (similar arguments used to advance blockchain learning lockers/transcripts) between the receipt attestation and the physical goods. Applications using the b_verify protocol can help mitigate these problems.</p>
<p>First, high profile frauds involving forged or duplicated warehouse receipts have cost banks hundreds of millions of dollars; this makes banks wary of lending against them and traders wary of buying them. The b_verify protocol addresses this problem by posting warehouse receipt issuances as cryptographic commitments to the data structure of the Bitcoin blockchain as a secure, public source of record.</p>
<p>Second, assuming the receipts are authentic, the transaction costs involved in verifying and transporting paper records are extremely high, especially in countries with poor infrastructure. The b_verify protocol addresses this problem using a novel method of coordinating updates to the records using cryptographic proofs constructed by a designated server, which need not be trusted (picture automated contracts/payments for remote gig labor).</p>
<p>Third, again assuming authentic receipts, banks and traders worry about the quality and honesty of warehouse custodianship; perhaps the goods are removed illegally for example. While this problem cannot be completely eliminated by technology, access control measures and Internet of Things (IoT) integrations can be combined with the b_verify protocol (surveillance of students/workers like Wildflower Montessori wearables and artificial vision cameras) to reduce these risks. For example, outflows of grain from a silo could require authentication via a query of the blockchain record, while digital devices measuring the outflow can independently commit updates to the record without human interference.</p>
<p>An added feature of the b_verify protocol is the opportunity for the programmatic enforcement of covenants and contracts (also known as “smart contracts”). For example, using an application servicing the b_verify protocol, the pledging of collateral with a warehouse receipt could automate the transfer of the collateral to the lender upon a hard loan default. Covenants such as maximum debt-to-asset ratios or minimum allowed commodity price fluctuations could also be constructed within the b_verify system.</p>
<p>The verifiable activities of a given business over time, such as inventory turnover and repayment history, can also provide valuable insight into the health of the business, which is the chief consideration in assessing creditworthiness (also applicable to human capital).</p>
<p>Lastly, the transparency provided by this publicly accessible and verifiable system of record may contribute to safer, more transparent asset-backed securities and derivatives markets as these develop in emerging economies.” <a href="https://dci.mit.edu/b-verify">Source</a></p>
 
 
<p>Excerpt from one mother’s experience with an Acton Academy Microschool – compare with excerpt above:</p>
<p>“The next big red flag was the 360 reviews&nbsp;that kids were asked to fill out at the end of every session on the Acton tracker. Acton says these reviews are meant to ‘normalize feedback’. Except, I do not know any professional who is allowed to offer feedback directed at an individual’s character. The 360 reviews ask students to anonymously rate everyone in their studio on a scale of 1 to 10 based on how ‘tough-minded’ and ‘warm-hearted’ they are. They are given a space to write a sentence of evidence for their rating, and then are given space to write ‘stars’ for things they like about the person, and ‘wishes’ for what they wish that person would change. After seeing this, I sent an email to the owners of our school with evidence I have accumulated from professors in my Master’s work which demonstrated feedback, especially personal feedback, does not have the desired positive outcomes, and induces shame responses. The owners of our school and founders of Acton told me normalizing feedback was valuable; and, if Acton was not a good fit, there are other schools for my kids.</p>
<p>The results of the 360 reviews were one of the metrics used to determine a student’s&nbsp;freedom level. Before Acton, the only time I had heard the term ‘freedom level’ was to describe a social credit system where those with higher credits get greater access-a program that has been piloted on a wide scale under the guise of ‘building trust’ with authoritarian governments. Inside each studio are 5 freedom levels. Freedom is earned or lost by meeting certain expectations, and in the middle and high school studios, higher freedom levels are not given to those with low peer 360 reviews. In upper elementary, a student on the highest freedom level can choose anywhere to sit during work time, and can even choose not to work. On the lowest level a student has to sit in an assigned seat, cannot snack, and must get a minimum amount of work done.</p>
<p>And, these 360 reviews are not written on paper or given any relational connection. They are written and published online, on&nbsp;Acton’s ‘tracker’. The tracker is a major anchor for many ‘personalized’ learning programs. It holds the student’s record, or ledger, of their work, their 360 reviews, their ‘SMART’ goals, their ‘badges’ for completing a certain amount of work, and their ‘buck’ balance (more on bucks below). This tracker allows you to look at the progress, bucks balance, 360 review scores, and badge earnings of everyone in the studio. It asks you how many minutes you worked on math or reading. It asks you to upload screenshots of proof, and answer questions about topics. One of the ways Acton keeps costs low is to utilize education technology for Math and English Language Arts, so that no expertise is needed by educators for what they call ‘core skills’ learning.</p>
<p>The tracker and the education technology learning platforms are forms of&nbsp;surveillance. These are ways data can be harvested and utilized. My open letter to Acton describes exactly how schools, institutions, and those set on 21st Century education reforms benefit from harvested data. I asked Acton how they are using the data from the tracker, how they are protecting the data harvested from my children on the tracker and the EdTech companies they promote. I was told that I could trust them or go to a new school, and that only I could protect my children.”</p>
<p>“Acton students are told they have a minimum number of lessons to do online for math and ELA. If they succeed, they will earn a badge and will get paid bucks. If they do not, they will lose a buck each week for not completing the minimum. This rewards those who learn well online. Some kids can earn bucks at a much faster rate, and others can be highly stressed. Now, if a student runs out of bucks they must go to an isolated room and work on core skills all day, for as many days as it takes to earn another hero buck by completing a badge. To avoid this, my kids have a badge they leave 90% completed so that if it were to happen they could get a badge and get out ASAP.</p>
<p>Bucks are also taken if peers see you not following the classroom rules. Peers are supposed to offer a verbal warning, and then if the behavior persists the peer can go on to the Acton tracker and ask the person for a buck. Guides take bucks for not being on time and prepared and not being respectful. There is not a moment in the day when bucks are not in jeopardy. Which, by definition, means this is not a self-directed environment.</p>
<p>I made several attempts to discuss why their learning and behaviors are incentivized, as this is in opposition to research that has been published for 30 years stating incentivization has a net negative effect. I was told to trust them and that these systems were being used wisely.” <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/04/22/guest-post-our-acton-academy-experience-surveillance-incentives-behaviorism-freedom-levels-and-edtech/">Source</a></p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>On June 17, 6pm UTC, shielded transactions submitted to the Zcash network increased dramatically. As a result, third party wallets have experienced lower performance. The network remained, and still remains, stable and operational, and transactions are being processed normally.<br><br>The ECC core team worked over the Fourth of July holiday to implement a new batch validation algorithm to further reduce verification time by another 80%. Their efforts saw release <code>zcashd</code> 5.1.0 go live.</p>



 Summary 



<p>This release is primarily targeted at improving the validation performance of Sapling and Orchard transactions as well as an incremental improvement to the scan performance of post-NU5 blocks. The release also made improvements to <code>getblocktemplate</code> performance and added Orchard information to <code>getrawtransaction</code> and <code>decoderawtransaction</code>. We will continue to address remaining scan performance issues in subsequent releases.</p>



 Notable changes 



 Faster block validation for Sapling and Orchard transactions 



<p>Block validation in <code>zcashd</code> is a mostly single-threaded process, due to how the chain update logic inherited from Bitcoin Core is written. However, certain more computationally intensive checks are performed more efficiently than checking everything individually:</p>



  ECDSA signatures on transparent inputs are checked via multithreading.  RedPallas signatures on Orchard actions are checked via batch validation.  



<p>As of this release, <code>zcashd</code> applies these techniques to more Sapling and Orchard components:</p>



  RedJubjub signatures on Sapling Spends are checked via batch validation.  Groth16 proofs for Sapling Spends and Outputs are checked via batch validation and multithreading.  Halo 2 proofs for Orchard Actions are checked via batch validation and multithreading.  



<p>This reduces worst-case block validation times for observed historic blocks by around 80% on a Ryzen 9 5950X CPU.</p>



<p>The number of threads used for checking Groth16 and Halo 2 proofs (as well as for creating them when spending funds) can be set via the <code>RAYON_NUM_THREADS</code> environment variable.</p>



 Option handling 



  A new <code>-preferredtxversion</code> argument allows the node to preferentially create transactions of a specified version, if a transaction does not contain components that necessitate creation with a specific version. For example, setting <code>-preferredtxversion=4</code> will cause the node to create V4 transactions whenever the transaction does not contain Orchard components. This can be helpful if recipients of transactions are likely to be using legacy wallets that have not yet been upgraded to support parsing V5 transactions.  



 RPC interface 



  The <code>getblocktemplate</code> RPC method now skips proof and signature checks on templates it creates, as these templates only include transactions that have previously been checked when being added to the mempool.  The <code>getrawtransaction</code> and <code>decoderawtransaction</code> RPC methods now include details about Orchard actions within transactions.  



 Wallet 



  Rescan performance of post-NU5 blocks has been slightly improved (overall rescan time for a single-account wallet decreases by around 6% on a Ryzen 9 5950X). Further improvements will be implemented in future releases to help mitigate the effect of blocks full of shielded outputs.  The <code>CWallet::UpdatedTransaction</code> signal is no longer called while holding the <code>cs_main</code> lock. This fixes an issue where RPCs could block for long periods of time on <code>zcashd</code> nodes with large wallets. Downstream code forks that have reconnected the <code>NotifyTransactionChanged</code> wallet signal should take note of this change, and not rely there on access to globals protected by <code>cs_main</code>.  Some <code>zcashd 5.0.0</code> nodes would shut down some time after start with the error <code>ThreadNotifyWallets: Failed to read block X while notifying wallets of block disconnects. zcashd</code> now attempts to rectify the situation, and otherwise will inform the user before shutting down that a reindex is required.  



 Deprecated 



<p>As of this release, the following previously deprecated features are disabled by default, but may be reenabled using <code>-allowdeprecated=&lt;feature&gt;</code>.</p>



  The <code>dumpwallet</code> RPC method is disabled. It may be reenabled with <code>allowdeprecated=dumpwallet. dumpwallet</code> should not be used; it is unsafe for backup purposes as it does not return any key information for keys used to derive shielded addresses. Use <code>z_exportwallet</code> instead.  



<p>As of this release, the following features are deprecated, but remain available by default. These features may be disabled by setting <code>-allowdeprecated=none</code>. After at least 3 minor-version releases, these features will be disabled by default and the following flags to <code>-allowdeprecated</code> will be required to permit their continued use:</p>



  <code>wallettxvjoinsplit</code> – controls availability of the deprecated <code>vjoinsplit</code> attribute returned by the <code>gettransaction</code> RPC method.  



<p>The <a href="https://z.cash/support/schedule/">Zcash Schedule page</a> has been updated to reflect the 5.1.0 release.</p>

<p>This is the second post referencing refugee labor, charter cities, faith communities, cooperatives and tokenization. You can read it in full <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fHzSgUXOVW97wRFCZbBV5Jlm0ce-yPGy_Tg5jpK9L7g/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> or access a PDF <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Mondragon-Series-Wrench-In-The-Gears-@Philly852.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>We’ll delve deeper in the next section when we discuss the model global cooperative Mondragon Corporation, but for now, make a note that while situated five hours across the peninsula on the Mediterranean side of Spain, Catalonia has synergy with developments in Basque Country.</p>
<p>For the past decade, the idea of applying collective ownership and governance principles to digital platforms has gained momentum, notably in the “rebel” ultra-smart city <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfkjDvn9Cs">Barcelona</a> where Francesca Bria, formerly of <a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/feature/innovation-methods/impact-investment/">NESTA</a>, vigorously promoted the digital sovereignty of citizens through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm82-sus1nE">cooperative ownership of data</a>. In this scenario the “renegade” Left is used as a counterweight to establishment neoliberalism, shoring up the technological imperative to dominate the natural world into synthetic submission. They promise that theirs will be a kinder, gentler AI that really, really cares about us and about solving inequality – in a Fabian Socialist / Libertarian paternalistic kind of way.</p>
<p>Illustrative of this mentality is a May 2022 article featuring the “rebel city” touting adoption by their Urban Innovation Lab of coastal <a href="https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/imi/en/noticia/barcelona-chooses-drone-technology-to-improve-its-management-of-public-spaces_1173724">drone surveillance</a> as a tool to “improve management of public space.” Sure, you can go to the beach, presuming you agree to follow an ever-changing list of rules. We’re supposed to feel reassured by the fact that the data is supposed to be anonymized. I don’t think people will forget, however, the use of drones to police social distancing over the past few years.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/07/21/drones-flying-over-catalonia-s-beaches-to-enforce-social-distancing-as-covid-rates-soar">Source</a>: Drones Flying Over Catalonia’s Beaches To Enforce Social Distancing As COVID Rates Soar, July 2021</p>
<p>The following is taken from “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Digital-City-Barcelona-Francesca-Bria.pdf">Building Digital Cities From The Ground Up Based Around Data Sovereignty and Participatory Democracy: The Case of Barcelona</a>,” prepared by Francesca Bria in 2019 when she was Chief Technology Officer of the city having come from London where <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/people/francesca-bria">digital identity and social innovation</a> were her areas of expertise:</p>
<p>“They can run smart, data-intensive, algorithmic public transportation, housing, health and education – all based on a logic of solidarity, social cooperation, and collective rights.”</p>
<p>“Barcelona is actively forging alternative municipal alliances of rebel cities, becoming a key site of struggles to fight climate change, build more liveable and just cities, and regain technological sovereignty.”</p>
<p>“Barcelona’s digital city efforts have centred on opening up governance through participatory processes and greater transparency. At the core of Barcelona’s model is a large scale participatory experiment powered by a digital participatory platform, Decidim (“We Decide”, in Catalan), which enables citizens to shape government policies by suggesting ideas, debating them, and voting on them. Decidim taps into the collective intelligence of citizens to create policies that better respond to their needs.”</p>
<p>“We focused on aligning the technology with the city’s core policy objectives selected through a large-scale participatory democracy process. In the case of Barcelona, affordable housing, healthcare for all, sustainable mobility, energy transition, increased public space and the fight against climate change are the top priorities.”</p>
<p>“Now the renewable energy operator is experimenting with distributed energy grid technology and with applications that allow citizens to own their energy consumption data.”</p>
<p>“The use of an open sensors city infrastructure called Sentilo and big data analytics makes it possible to define and predict better public mobility policies, and measure the urban impact of evidence-based policymaking.”</p>
<p>“Now, for instance, the municipality has a large contract with Vodafone by which every month the company is obliged to give back machine-readable data to the city hall, while also making sure they encrypt the data to preserve citizens’ privacy.”</p>
<p>“Alternative models of service provision are being fostered via the creation of special funds for platform cooperatives and digital social innovation, supported by an EU initiative that has channelled €60m in the last few years towards experimenting with next-generation digital platforms that work for the public interest.”</p>
<p>“Barcelona leads a network of rebel cities, “Fearless Cities”, that is adopting tools and experiments in open democracy and data protection. The first conference was hosted in the city last year, bringing together more than 180 cities from 40 countries and five continents.”</p>
<p>“Barcelona is the coordinator of the <a href="https://decodeproject.eu/partners.html">DECODE</a> project, the biggest EU effort to establish a framework for data sovereignty, aiming to develop open source, decentralised, privacy-enhancing and rights-preserving technologies for citizens to decide what kind of data they want to keep private, what data they want to share, with whom, and on what terms. This proposes a new social pact — a New Deal on data that we hope will soon become a reality in many cities across the world.”</p>
<p>In addition to the city of Barcelona, DECODE’s partners include: <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/arduino">Arduino</a> – advanced cyber-physical infrastructure based in New York; <a href="https://www.apax.com/partnerships/thoughtworks/">ThoughtWorks</a> – Chicago-headquartered Agile software consulting acquired by Ronald Cohen’s Apax Partners in 2017; <a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/brief-history-nesta/">NESTA</a> – UK Social Innovation Lab; <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/thingful">Thingful</a> – search engine for IoT connected devices in a geography based in London;&nbsp; <a href="https://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London Information Security and Research Group</a> – end-to-end cryptography for societal uses; the <a href="https://centredeconomiesorbonne.cnrs.fr/">Economic Center of the Sorbonne</a> (CNRS); <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dribia">Dribia</a> – geolocation data analytics in Barcelona; <a href="https://eurecat.org/en/">Eurecat!</a> – industrial technology R&amp;D center with bio-tech in Catalonia; <a href="https://www.uoc.edu/portal/ca/in3/index.html">Open University of Catalonia</a> – Human Computer Interaction and Digital Commoning; <a href="https://nexa.polito.it/about-en">Nexa Center for Internet and Society</a> in Turin, Italy; Amsterdam – the other pilot city; <a href="https://www.dyne.org/">Dyne.org</a> – open-source software foundry in the Netherlands; <a href="https://www.ru.nl/icis">Privacy and Identity Lab</a> at Radboud University in Nijmegen, NL; and <a href="https://waag.org/en/about-waag/">Waag FutureLab</a> – promoting a Planet B proposal for decentralized tech in Amsterdam.&nbsp;The <a href="https://decodeproject.eu/what-decode.html">framework</a> DECODE lays out is aligned with assertions of <a href="https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/data-dignity/">data dignity</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/plural-property/">plural property</a>&nbsp;being promoted by RadicalXChange, developers of <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/05/28/soulbound-tokens-trust-networks-and-californias-big-test/">Soulbound Tokens</a>.</p>
<p>Bria has since left Barcelona to head the Italian National Innovation Fund and <a href="https://www.mwcbarcelona.com/agenda/speaker/francesca-bria">consult</a> with UN Habitat on smart cities. They mean for us to become “sovereign” citizens of the planetary computer. They’re giving us two options: 1) allow tech giants to control our data or 2) agree to become data commodities inhabiting a world of total surveillance. Both models are grounded in digital empire and conquest of natural systems. There are other options that would not require us to submit ourselves to the AI gods, and we need to be advocating for them now. With all the talk of social credit scoring, we should remember that vulnerable populations, including children, are on the front lines of the social impact data commodities game.</p>
<p>With a deft sleight of hand, platform cooperative refugees could wind up contingent remote labor even as they’re publicly lauded as empowered token-holders with a stake in the brutal fiction that is the twenty-first century data economy. That’s what the “impact economy” looks like. Don’t get caught up in their manipulative interactive digital storytelling. Unfortunately, most of us are pretty easy to fool. We don’t want to face the horror that we may ALL end up living in a cross between Black Mirror’s “<a href="https://medium.com/@heranmamo/taking-a-social-media-nosedive-and-underrating-common-relationships-in-black-mirror-9be23b3a5575">Nosedive</a>” episode and Ira Levin’s “<a href="https://746books.com/2020/09/22/no-467-the-stepford-wives-by-ira-levin/">Stepford Wives</a>.”</p>

 Mondragon, Focolare, and Capitalism’s Catholic Makeover 
<p>Currently one of the largest companies in Spain, Mondragon Corporation started out in the 1950s as an effort of Catholic social teaching by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Arizmendiarrieta">Father Jose Maria Arizmendiarrieta</a> who combined technical education with a worker-centered model that remade the metalworking industry that had been the community’s economic engine since the middle ages. Laminates was one of their products – sheet metal, which is interesting given the ties to Lamina1 and lamins I wrote about in a <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/06/17/ritual-gaming-and-berggruens-transformation-of-the-human-synthetic-pretenders-part-4/">previous piece</a>.</p>
<p>The priest’s legacy is one of a vanguard entrepreneur who sought to go “beyond a mercantile and economic society dedicated to satisfying the private interests of its investors” to “spearhead a complex social movement based on principles of self-management, subordination of capital to labour and Christian communitarian ethics,” establishing a cooperative model that by the 1950s “included real estate, sports, educational, cultural and health services.” Sociologist C. George Benello includes a chapter on Mondragon in his 1993 book, “<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/From_the_Ground_Up/GiYdUqx1m6wC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=mondragon+mitterand&amp;pg=PA95&amp;printsec=frontcover">From the Ground Up: Essays on Grassroots and Workplace Democracy</a>,” that traces Mondragon’s influence to the creation of a cooperative cabinet post in Mitterand’s France, projects with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9Imekv-gU8">Welsh Trade Council,</a>&nbsp;England’s <a href="https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1981/oct/19/common-ownership-companies">Job Ownership Movement</a>, and the establishment of progressive Catholic worker organizations in Detroit, Milwaukee, and Boston.</p>
<p>The United Nations designated 2012 as the International Year of Cooperatives.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.un.org/en/events/coopsyear/">Source</a>: UN International Year of Cooperatives</p>
<p>The online Christian newsletter <a href="https://aleteia.org/about-us/">Aleteia</a> published “<a href="https://aleteia.org/2014/02/23/mondragon-and-the-other-fr-jose-maria/">Mondragon and the Other Fr. Jose Maria.</a>” The article opened contrasting Arizmendiarrieta with St. <a href="https://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=5603">Josemaría Escrivá</a> who founded Opus Dei, an influential and secretive fraternity of Catholic lay people and affiliated priests. Opus Dei began in 1928 and expanded to include the <a href="https://opusdei.org/en-us/article/the-priestly-society-of-the-holy-cross-what-it-is/">Priestly Society of the Holy Cross</a> in 1943, the same year that Mondragon Technical College was started. Arizmendiarrieta was seventeen years Escriva’s junior; though the careers of the two Spanish priests coincided for three decades.</p>
<p>Elias Crim, author of the piece, sought to unite the distinct outlooks of the two men, one conservative and the other socially progressive (though within the existing capitalist model), under the umbrella of the <a href="https://www.focolare.org/chi-siamo/">Focolare Movement. </a>Focolare translates to “hearth” or “fireside” in English and has the goal of universal Christian brotherhood. It was started by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiara_Lubich">Chiara Lubich</a>, a teacher from Trent, northern Italy, in 1943. The group was first acknowledged by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_John_XXIII">Pope Paul XIII</a>, “the Good Pope” as the “Work of Mary.” During his period of leadership Paul XIII modernized the church; dialogued with communist nations and Eastern Orthodox churches; increased the number of bishops to 85 and appointed representatives from Africa, Japan and the Philippines. He also called the Second Vatican Council in 1962. Additional approvals were given to Focolare by his successor Pope Paul VI. The movement spread to over 180 countries and now and has over two million practitioners and twenty-five “little towns.” Among them is <a href="https://www.focolare.org/en/focolare-worldwide/america-nord-e-centrale/stati-uniti/">Marianapolis Luminosa</a> in Hyde Park, NY where the <a href="https://www.newcitypress.com/history/">New City Press</a> is based, one of twenty Focolare-affiliated publishers. That press has a new book series out titled <a href="https://www.newcitypress.com/magenta-project">MAGENTA</a> meant to build bridges and address “polarization.”</p>
<p>Focolare embodies “Evangelii Gaudium,” a new era of evangelization by lay people. There is a <a href="https://www.sophiauniversity.org/en/centro-evangelii-gaudium/">center for Evangelii Gaudium</a> at the University Institute Sophia, which became the <a href="https://www.focolare.org/en/download/italiano-scheda-cronologica-della-vita-di-chiara-lubich/">successor</a> to the Abba school in 2007. Lubich created the <a href="https://www.focolare.org/en/works-and-activities/studio-e-formazione/scuola-abba/">Abba School</a> in 1990 with support from The Pontifical Council for the Laity to promote the charism “spiritual gift” of theological unity and “<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/An_Introduction_to_the_Abba_School/xmgHAAAACAAJ?hl=en">cultural potentiality</a>.” The organization maintains an ecumenical outlook with an emphasis on <a href="https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/87978/1/MT70%281%29A3.pdf">Marian devotion</a>.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.focolare.org/en/movimento-dei-focolari/scelte-e-impegno/volontari/">Volunteers of God</a>” organized at a <a href="https://www.focolare.org/en/movimento-dei-focolari/a-people/movimento-parrocchiale/">Parish</a> level take <a href="https://www.focolare.org/en/chi-siamo/">vows</a> of chastity, poverty, and obedience. Since 1963, its base of operations has been <a href="https://www.focolare.org/en/download/italiano-scheda-cronologica-della-vita-di-chiara-lubich/">Rocca di Papa</a> outside Rome. Lubich created three “Gen” programs for youth and then combined them as the “<a href="https://www.focolare.org/en/movimento-dei-focolari/a-people/new-humanity/">New Humanity</a>” in 1966 followed by a “<a href="https://www.focolare.org/famiglienuove/en/">New Families Movemen</a>t” the following year.</p>
<p>While undertaking “solidarity” work in Poland in the late 1970s, Focolare members met in secret with Archbishop Karol Wojtyla who was so impressed with Chiara’s writings that he invited her to meet with him shortly after he became pope. The following except is taken from the <a href="https://www.focolare.org/en/news/2011/05/05/giovanni-paolo-ii-e-i-focolari-in-polonia/">Focolare website</a>:</p>
<p>“Before his election to Pontificate, Karol Wojtyla only knew Chiara through her writings. As soon as he became Pope he wanted to meet her. I was visiting Rome in that period and I received a phone call from the Pope’s secretary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Dziwisz">Stanislaw Dziwisc</a> who I knew very well. He told me that the Holy Father wanted to invite Chiara and I to his mass the next day at 7.</p>
<p>Chiara, <a href="https://www.focolare.org/en/news/2018/11/26/thank-you-eli/">Eli Folonari</a> and I left very early in the morning.As you can imagine we were very excited.&nbsp;When we arrived we saw that the platforms for the Conclave were still in place and so we had to take a longer path to get to the Pope’s apartment. That mass in the Pope’s private chapel is still vivid in my soul. There was such a special atmosphere of recollection, a presence of God. Along with the Pope, Don Stanislaw and the three of us there were only 2 or 3 Polish sisters.</p>
<p>After Mass the Holy Father greeted Chiara. I still remember with what high regard and great love he addressed her.&nbsp;He asked if he could have a map showing the different places where the Movement was present:&nbsp;“So that I can know where to lean on!”&nbsp;he said.&nbsp;It was the beginning of a special friendship,&nbsp;of an ever stronger unity between two people called on by God to do great works, two people to whom God gave two gifts for the Church and for all of humanity”.</p>
<p>The fact that Focolare’s global footprint expanded significantly under the protective wing of Pope John Paul II is notable. During his first decade as pope, the Catholic Church played an influential role in Polish politics as defined by Lech Walesa’s “Solidarity” trade-union social movement. In retrospect, what was portrayed as a grassroots worker movement had the involvement of US interests through the <a href="https://msuweb.montclair.edu/~furrg/furraft82.pdf">AFL-CIO and the CIA</a> as well as clergy whose goals were to advance a nationalist conservatism. In the end, Poland’s economy was opened just in time to be eviscerated by neoliberalism and globalization.</p>
<p>The government repression workers sought to escape simply transformed into capitalist disciplining, <a href="https://monthlyreview.org/product/from_solidarity_to_sellout/">leaving many Poles in poverty</a> during the closing years of the twentieth century. More market shaping for a post-human economic framework where benefit corporations can pretend to care about people while milking them for poverty-compliance data to run the information economy. We now see “solidarity economy” messaging and a focus on platform cooperatives setting the stage for social impact finance, stakeholder capitalism, and cybernetic circular economies. In the May 2020 report below, funded by the (Klaus) Schwab Foundation in partnership with the World Economic Forum, “solidarity economy” was used interchangeably with “social economy” throughout.</p>

<p>I find it very odd that this teacher from a rural area, Chiara Lubich, was catapulted to such prominence after WWII, eventually gaining audiences with religious leaders from around the world including: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Ramsey">Michael Ramsey</a>, Archbishop of Canterbury; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenagoras_I_of_Constantinople">Athenagoras I</a> of Constantinople who helped write the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic%E2%80%93Orthodox_Joint_Declaration_of_1965">Catholic-Orthodox Joint Declaration of 1965</a>; Bishop Klaus Hemmerle, Bishop of Aachen, Germany;&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikky%C5%8D_Niwano">Nikkyo Niwano</a>, founder of the Buddhist lay movement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rissh%C5%8D_K%C5%8Dsei_Kai">Rissho Kosei-kai</a>; and the Supreme Patriarch of Thai Buddhism <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vajira%C3%B1%C4%81%E1%B9%87asa%E1%B9%83vara">Somdet Phra Nyanasamvara.</a> She gave presentations all over the world from the United Nations to the Malcolm X Mosque. At a conference for the 50th anniversary of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Europe">Council of Europe</a> in Strasbourg, France she presented on “A Market-based Society, Democracy, and Solidarity.” They may speak of love, unity, and harmony, but it’s actually about leveraging markets to attain a global heart-mind synthesis those in power believe will lead to a new phase of bio-digital evolution and the emergence of a World Brain.</p>
<p>There are critics. It is said that Focolare adherents are expected to exhibit self-denial and center themselves almost exclusively on the words and ideas of Chiara Lubich. There was <a href="https://www.ncronline.org/news/accountability/french-cases-lead-focolare-promise-investigation-handling-abuse-claims">child sexual abuse</a>. Certain Catholics <a href="http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/7057%26eng%3Dy.html">were also skeptical</a> of the influence of Focolare and other organizations of the Neocatechumenal Way that held sway over John Paul II, though they held Opus Dei above critique. A number of Jesuits have <a href="https://www.catalunyareligio.cat/node/230907/pdf">actively opposed</a> Lubich’s beatification.</p>

 Selling Sacred Economies 
<p>In 1977 <a href="https://www.templeton.org/news/a-force-of-nature-driven-by-god-and-love-remembering-chiara-lubich">Chiara was awarded</a> the Templeton Foundation Prize for Progress in Religion in London, an event attended by Prince Philip. The presentation was made at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guildhall,_London">Guildhall</a>, the ceremonial administrative building for the City of London and its Corporation, which feels significant. John Templeton made his fortune as a contrarian mutual fund investor turned philanthropist who had a keen interest in character education, planned reproduction, free markets, genius, religion, and theoretical physics. He became a <a href="https://www.templeton.org/about/sir-john">UK citizen in the 1980s</a> after moving to Nassau in the Bahamas and was knighted for his charity work by Queen Elizabeth II in 1987. At the close of her <a href="https://www.templetonprize.org/laureate-sub/address-by-chiara-lubich/">acceptance speech</a>, Lubich quoted the Converso Spanish mystic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_the_Cross">John of the Cross,</a> who worked with Teresa of Avila to “reform” the Carmelite order in the late sixteenth century: “<a href="https://carmeliteinstitute.net/the-power-of-love-in-saint-john-of-the-cross/">Where you do not find love, put love and you will find love</a>.” They do seem to know the power of love.</p>

<p>Focolare members gathered in Sao Paulo, Brazil in 1991 to launch the <a href="https://www.edc-online.org/en/30-years-of-edc.html">Economy of Communion</a>, (EOC) a premise that involves private enterprise solving social problems. Business owners, workers, and customers dedicate a portion of their profits to uplift people out of poverty. The effort promotes “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKhiBjTNojHrxo92jVNuAs1HBLajFrqoh">vaccines for all</a>,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9SSOE_yzxk">climate-related investing</a>, and an examination of individual behaviors around people and the planet in a spiritual context.</p>
<p>Last October Fordham University hosted a f<a href="https://eocnoam.org/2021/09/26/learn-about-the-economy-of-communion-in-4-online-sessions-hosted-by-fordham-university/">our-part series on EOC</a> with Columbia University professor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs">Jeffrey Sachs</a>. Sachs, an economist specializing in the transition from planned to market-based economies, is president of the <a href="https://www.unsdsn.org/search?searchTerm=sachs">UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network</a> and chair of the <a href="https://covid19commission.org/jeffrey-sachs">Lancet COVID-19 Commission</a>.

Over a thousand corporations have signed onto the Economy of Communion. While their website isn’t all that impressive, the involvement of Fordham and Sachs says something. There’s also a rather strange 2018 paper published in the International Journal of Engineering and Technology sponsored by the Seoul National University of Science and Technology that calls the Economy of Communion “a new ideal economy.” That’s the actual title of the paper and it feels very cybernetic / circular economy / systems engineering. It’s clear how that outlook meshes with the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-council-for-inclusive-capitalism-with-the-vatican-a-new-alliance-of-global-business-leaders-launches-today-301187931.html">Vatican endorsement of Inclusive Capitalism</a> in December 2020 and the mobilization of Catholic investment dollars behind social impact investing.</p>

The following is an excerpt from Crim’s article about Focolare and the origins of EoC:</p>
<p>“When Pope John Paul II’s encyclical <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_01051991_centesimus-annus_en.html">Centesimus Annus</a>&nbsp;appeared in 1991,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/business/fr91401.htm">some</a> American observers read it as a break with Church tradition, suggesting it somehow endorsed a particular set of economic arrangements—i.e., those of American-style free market capitalism, also known as neoliberalism. Focolare’s founder, Chiara Lubich, read the document rather differently—perhaps more presciently, in fact. &nbsp;She did not read the Pope as bestowing a blessing on “business as usual.” Instead, she saw him calling for a social economy that was capable of orienting capitalistic society toward the common good rather than individualistic consumerism.</p>
<p>The future pope’s &nbsp;interest in the meeting and in Focolare generally was due to the heightened awareness of this group to the interrelationship between spirituality and socioeconomic life. The Focolare movement’s special charism of unity, one which grew to include an “economy of the gift,” with its values of cooperation, sharing and justice, was extending outward from an initial focus on family life to an influence upon the larger community. This relational economy was indeed a form of capitalism but with a strong emphasis on the human person rather than on a deterministic confidence in an “invisible hand.” <a href="https://aleteia.org/2014/02/09/economics-as-if-people-mattered/">Source</a></p>
<p>Why is Crim so interested in this topic? Well, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elias-crim-08251319a/details/experience/">he’s</a> a Chicago-based writer who is currently founding editor of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ownershipmatters/">Ownership Matters</a>, a bi-weekly newsletter focused on impact investing, racial equity, and the solidarity economy. He previously managed a $2 million US Department of Education Grant for character education in Chicago schools; founded <a href="https://solidarityhall.org/#about">Solidarity Hall</a> a podcast and publisher featuring works on radical Christianity, the New Economy, and localism, and assisted Molly Burhans’s on her <a href="https://good-lands.org/">Good Lands</a> project to map Catholic holdings and make land “work for good,” featured in The New Yorker. Yes, we are supposed to believe a young college student just happened to be staying at a Rome hostel, cold-called Vatican officials, and got the chance to pitch her cartographic database skills. Ah, narrative shaping.</p>
<p>See how the story is used to package free-market exchange as the gift economy or sacred economics? As the age of cybernetic enclosures and programmable finance tightens its grip on refugees, the poor, and those thrown out of work by economic upheaval, propagandists are working overtime to convince us that disruption is merely the opening act for an age of digital abundance – no mention of the ubiquitous surveillance that’s being baked into the transition.</p>

<p>A current example is this duplicity is Yale alumnus, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Eisenstein">Charles Eisentein</a>, author and speaker on Eastern spiritual teachings, indigenous culture, ecology, and the new economy, who recently made common cause with <a href="https://celo.org/about">Celo</a>, a social impact “regenerative finance” company that’s doing the full court press to convince the world that “beautiful money” is the wave of the future.</p>
<p>During the global lockdowns Celo took the opportunity, in partnership with Impact Market, “<a href="https://www.impactmarket.com/">A Decentralized Poverty Alleviation Protocol</a>,” to seed a future customer base for Universal Basic Income. Impact Market is already active in the <a href="https://kotanipay.medium.com/kotani-pay-partners-with-rio-impact-market-to-enable-ubi-payments-to-refugees-in-africa-c9bb85beab36">refugee space</a> in Africa. Celo’s project involved a 30-year old traditional weaving cooperative (yes, cooperative) in the Philippines that became destabilized when the tourist economy was taken out. The program offered members, mostly women with children at home, a small monthly stipend to offset their losses. First, however, they had to obtain smartphones (mostly from their children) and learn the ropes of digital money and Valora wallets.</p>

<p>Celo’s founder and spokesperson is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepandar_Kamvar">Sep Kamva</a>r, the guy who invented Google’s page rank algorithm and, while working as the head of MIT’s Social Computing Group, started a Montessori-inspired pre-k franchise (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbB5na0g_6M">Wildflower</a>) where children had to wear slippers with sensors in them so adults could track their social behaviors and what toys they played with in school. Oh, and there were also artificial vision cameras mounted on the ceiling that fed data to dashboards on each child.</p>
<p>Eisenstein has not responded to repeated Tweets asking him to clarify his relationship with Kamvar and Celo and to explain how the company’s use of his “Sacred Economics” branding is compatible with the heartfelt blog posts he writes about protesting digital futures.</p>
<p>These characters are working all the angles to sell the masses on tokenized cooperatives as a wholesome remedy to the current brutal economic landscape. It’s not. For me it’s a gut-punch to see that so many supporters refuse to look at the facts and hold individuals and institutions whether Catholic, or New Age, or something else accountable for the deceptions they’re so deftly spinning.</p>

 In a Basque Village – Education for Liberation or Impact?

<p>Jose Maria Arizmendiarrieta, the Jesuit founder of Mondragon cooperative, was a seminarian during the Spanish Civil War and part of the <a href="http://www.canonizacionarizmendiarrieta.com/en/biografia/">Vitoria Priests’ Movement</a>, guided by the teaching of Spanish Renaissance theologian and jurist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_de_Vitoria">Francisco de Vitoria.</a>&nbsp;His training focused on Catholic social teaching grounded in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rerum_novarum">Rerum Novarum</a>, rights and duties of capital and labor. Dominican Thomist scholar Tommaso Maria Zigliara prepared the encyclical that was issued by Pope Leo XIII in 1891 to address suffering of workers caused by industrialization, a response to rising socialist sentiment that threatened to undermine the influence of church and uplift state power. The document reasserted the importance of private property while laying out responsibilities of employers to provide dignified work suited to each person’s capacity and for labor to refrain from violence and complete their tasks diligently. The Basque priest internalized the ideal of hard work for the collective good being a tool of economic and spiritual liberation. He was taught by his mentor Rufino Aldabalde that the exclusion of God from society through industrialization and secularization had led to the Second World War.</p>
<p>Another influence on Arizmendiarrieta was <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/history/past-prime-ministers/clement-attlee">Clement Atlee</a>, UK Prime Minister and leader of the Labour Party from 1935 to 1955. Atlee was Deputy Prime Minister under Churchill in 1942 and later presided over the partition of India. This was the era in which <a href="https://littlesis.org/person/389080-Michael_Dunlop_Young">Michael Dunlop Young</a>, father of social entrepreneurship in England, shaped the agenda of Labour, including the creation of the National Health Service. This influence led Arizmendiarrieta to endorse the public-private partnership model, which he used in the development of a TB treatment facility and early housing cooperative.</p>

<p>In their 2008 profile, “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Origins-of-Mondragon.pdf">The Origins of Mondragon: Catholic Co-Operativism and Social Movement in a Basque Valley (1941-59)</a>” sociologists Fernando Molina and Antonio Miguez state that Arizmendiarrieta had a desire to create a “new Christian order” where through proper education and training, Basque peasants could be morally transformed while building a “communitarian Christian practice of worker solidarity” that would “give them equal footing with their bosses and break the ruling-class structure.” When he arrived, the town was dealing with the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War, which divided the community. The town’s economy revolved around Union Cerrajera, a sheet metal company. Children of the elite had access to education and apprenticeship programs that enabled those in the network to control managerial jobs, while the rest had few opportunities for advancement.</p>
<p>The priest sought to mobilize the youth through sports and Catholic volunteer programs. He was very successful at shaping public opinion, having refined his skills in narrative crafting while working at a Basque Nationalist newspaper, Eguna, during his seminary years. Arizmendiarrieta targeted young men he felt could be molded to become “redeemers of their class,” and hosted weekly discussions on “private property, capital and labour, social justice, or novel Catholic social theories such as the ‘dual salary’, which sought to divide salaries into a portion for consumption and another for investment.” The priest centered the idea of emancipatory education and dignified work promoted by French Catholic philosophers Jean Leclerq, French Benedictine monk known for writing “T<a href="https://holywisdommonastery.org/the-love-of-learning-and-the-desire-for-god/">he Love of Learning and the Desire for God: A Study of Monastic Culture</a>“ and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Maritain">Jacques Maritain</a> a Thomist who help develop the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. Emphasis was placed on learning in the service of others, which supported the eventual expansion of the Mondragon cooperative model.</p>

<p>With support from local businesses, Arizmendiarrieta launched the Professional School of Mondragon with the goal of “socializing knowledge to democratize power.” Technical education and training has always been a central feature of the Mondragon program, which is important to remember as we consider the place of this model in human capital re-skilling tied to data-driven investments by social entrepreneurs today, not to mention the meta-data captured from online learning that is being leveraged to train our AI replacements.</p>
<p>While the priest had hoped to be able to change the corporate culture of Union Cerrajera from within by training up through subsidization of the education of a cohort of young managers, he was not successful. In 1956, a group broke off and petitioned to create a new Christian company, Ulgor. Their first product line was <a href="http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/dward/classes/powpart/benellomondragon.html">kerosene stoves</a>. The business thrived under <a href="https://www.bbva.com/en/brief-history-bbva-xix-economic-opening-stabilization-plan/">Spain’s Stabilization Plan</a> enacted by Franco in 1959 that backed-off the dictator’s previous efforts at <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Indecent-Proposal_-Exposing-the-1959-Stabilization-Plan-of-Spain.pdf">autarchy</a>, industrial self-sufficiency, and began to liberalize the country’s economy allowing for growth in exports. Over time Mondragon expanded production to include a range of home appliances.</p>
<p>The education component remained central with three interrelated programs that operated in affiliation with the University of the Basque Country for its first four decades. Mondragon University was incorporated as an independent university in 1997. Today it hosts 4,000 students studying engineering, business, entrepreneurship, communication, gastronomy, education, cooperativism, and social innovation. The school partners with ESADE, Spain’s influential Jesuit-affiliated MBA program second only to IESE, the Opus Dei-affiliate. Together ESADE and IESE hold substantial sway over business operations in Spain, maintaining extensive alumni networks that include over a quarter of the board members of the Ibex 35, the index of Spain’s principal stock exchange, with particular representation in the telecommunications sector. ESADE created a <a href="https://www.esade.edu/en/faculty-and-research/research/knowledge-units/center-social-impact">Center for Social Impact</a> in 2017. In 2020 ESADE joined with Comillas Universidad Pontificia and Universidad de Deusto, two other Jesuit institutions, to create <a href="https://www.esade.edu/en/news/comillas-deusto-and-esade-establish-jesuit-advanced-management-school-foundation/24884">a special post-graduate program of study</a> for international management with a focus on helping others through the development of social impact enterprises.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/dward/classes/powpart/benellomondragon.html">credit union</a> was added in 1959, Caja Laboral Popular. Its descendant, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboral_Kutxa">Laboral Kutxa</a>, has 400 offices and is the third largest credit union in Spain. The credit union was vital to business expansion, because each member business would put forty-percent of their after-tax profits into funds for research through the university or solidarity. The remainder, after a ten-percent distribution to charity, was deposited to cover worker pensions. All of the funds held could then be used to offer low-rate loans to support business expansion (<a href="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ap-st01.ext.exlibrisgroup.com/61RMIT_INST/storage/alma/9B/9C/05/D8/D6/36/67/EA/9C/2E/F2/03/EA/2D/4E/6B/Siebel.pdf?response-content-type=application%2Fpdf&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Date=20220703T123632Z&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Expires=119&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAJN6NPMNGJALPPWAQ%2F20220703%2Fap-southeast-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Signature=8206fb733378e743e6bfe0649f1b963ff3e787a991275206d9ea61e3468aeb61">page 122</a>) among members.</p>
<p>Given the amount of funding that is anticipated to run through human capital-related projects Mondragon Corporation could be in a position to channel a lot of money through worker re-skilling at their technical university. The financial infrastructure is already in place, integrated into the program from the beginning, and complements their history of faith-based philanthropy. I think a similar dynamic linking wellbeing metrics and human capital investments could be in play in the United States with plans for public banking.</p>

<p>Ignatius of Loyola (1491-1556), founder of the religious order of the Society of Jesus or Jesuits, was born in Azpeitia. He was the most famous Catholic priest from the Basque region. Pope Francis, of course, <a href="https://www.ncronline.org/news/vatican/understand-pope-francis-look-jesuits">is the first Jesuit pope,</a>&nbsp;one with some skeletons in his closet from <a href="https://archive.ph/hIPT7#selection-753.123-753.144">Argentina’s Dirty Wars</a>.&nbsp;Pope Francis has thus far issued three encyclicals: 1) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelii_gaudium">Evangelii Gaudium</a>, in 2007 that announced a new era of evangelism in which Chapter 4 speaks specifically about care for the weak and poor; 2) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laudato_si%27">Laudato Si</a> in 2015 critiquing consumerism and advancing environmental and climate concerns; and 3) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaudete_et_exsultate">Gaudete et exultate</a>, a universal call to holiness in 2018. The following paragraph is taken from a website promoting the canonization of Arizmendiarrieta, which is consistent with stakeholder capitalism:</p>
<p>“The basis of the Christian endeavour he founded was “a group of young people, who are very good Christians, and I would even go so far as to say they are good apostles”. He wished to fulfill the dictate made by Pope Pious XI in his encyclical “Quadragesimo Anno”. The result, following on from the Professional School, was the creation of ULGOR, the San José cooperative society (which would later become Eroski), the Caja Laboral savings bank and other cooperative enterprises. He considered that “the workers will not believe in the Church’s social doctrine if they cannot see it put into practice through work for society”. And he added “The cooperative formula requires human activity in order to share and implement higher human values, and work, capital and organisation are therefore not its ends in themselves, but means for better serving human interests“. <a href="http://www.canonizacionarizmendiarrieta.com/en/biografia/">Source</a></p>
<p>In the United States, quite a few of the institutions at the forefront of advancing social impact finance, digital governance, and data analytics are affiliated with the Jesuits: <a href="https://www.millersocent.org/">Santa Clara University</a>, <a href="https://www.gonzaga.edu/catalogs/current/undergraduate/school-of-business/course-detail?code=BENT+493">Gonzaga University</a>, <a href="https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/bcnews/nation-world-society/business-and-management/rating-social-performance-reveals-tough-graders.html">Boston College</a>, <a href="https://www.fordham.edu/gabelli-school-of-business/about/social-innovation-at-the-gabelli-school-of-business/">Fordham University</a>, <a href="https://www.luc.edu/baumhartcenter/">Loyola Universit</a>y, and <a href="https://beeckcenter.georgetown.edu/">Georgetown University</a>. In my opinion the <a href="https://library.brown.edu/create/fivecenturiesofchange/chapters/chapter-2/the-jesuits/">Jesuit’s history</a> of mass conversion of colonized people through control of labor for large-scale agricultural projects, standardized education, and enforced faith practices cannot be discounted moving forward. Look to the history of the original people and enslaved Africans that Jesuits used to subjugate the lands of Brazil and their use of <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Jesuit-Engagement-in-Brazil.pdf">aldeias</a>, small villages designed to instill new social norms.</p>
<p>“For the Indians the aldeias meant a new and inhabit living space. The customs as well as the structural layout of the village must have been very strange for the Indios (given their previous living environment). Besides the living conditions, the aldeias created a new identity for the people. The all-encompassing concept ‘Aldeia-Indian’ was created and applied to Indians from different tribes, with different cultures and languages. For the Jesuits the aldeias represented spaces for realizing a utopia which they already formulated in Europe. (Krumpel 1992) The missionary movement was strengthened in the counter-reform to fight Evangelization, so the Jesuits saw in the peoples, who were discovered during the Portuguese expansionist movement, an opportunity to shape Christianity and form a catholic community free from the problems which suffered the church at home in Europe. Because of this plan to create a purer and better Christianity abroad, the Jesuits in Brazil tried to keep a strategic alliance with the Portuguese Crown. Like the priest Antonio Viera said, they dreamed of creating a worldwide realm of Portuguese Catholicism.” <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Jesuit-Engagement-in-Brazil.pdf">Page 7</a></p>
<p>I imagine these are not so different from Focolare towns or charter cities for refugees. The networked built environment will be constructed with encoded social values and used to attempt to transition us from our original biological state to Nicholas Berggruen’s planned transition to holographic life.

<p>Why you might want to run a Nym&nbsp;gateway</p><p>The Nym mixnet is up and running, the reward system has been launched and now, to facilitate usage of the Nym privacy system, the mixnet needs gateways!</p><p>Gateways are entry points to the Nym mixnet. Without them, the mixnet is simply not accessible. And if there are too few of them, the system becomes vulnerable to DDoS attacks. <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/gateways">Jump straight to the docs to learn how to run&nbsp;one…</a>!</p><p>In this blogpost we will&nbsp;cover:</p>  What gateways do in the overall Nym architecture  How you can get creative when running a gateway and provide additional privacy&nbsp;features  Incentives and grants to spin up your&nbsp;gateway   What do gateways&nbsp;do? <p>Gateways are the interface between users and the mixnet. They check that an application or user has the credentials to use the mixnet; they send traffic through the mixnet; and they receive and store traffic at the other end in case a receiving user is&nbsp;offline.</p><p>Gateways can also offer extra privacy features as a way to attract users! (More on that&nbsp;below…)</p> Checking credentials <p>Gateways are responsible for checking that a user has credentials to use the mixnet. For the next few months, the mixnet will be free to use and integrate as we fine-tune and optimise the network performance. This means gateways will initially not be charging user fees to allow time for integration and optimisation. Meanwhile, gateways will be supported through a Service Grants scheme announced later this week— join our Gateways <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> chan or sign up <a href="http://eepurl.com/h6uPSD">here</a> to keep up to&nbsp;date!</p><p>Once usage fees are switched on, gateways will begin to receive a part of the fee after checking that the user (or the app they are using) purchased the required bandwidth credentials with their NYM tokens. Bandwidth credentials are a form of anonymous credentials using the decentralised Coconut signature scheme that prove payment of mixnet fees in a private manner. The gateway queries the blockchain to verify that the credentials have not already been ‘spent’ before forwarding traffic through to the&nbsp;mixnet.</p> Sending and receiving messages <p>A user can send messages through the Nym mixnet via the gateway. Currently there is no limit to usage, but once user fees are turned on, users will have purchased a data allowance represented by their bandwidth credential.</p><p>The Nym client on a user’s device encodes data into Sphinx packets with multiple layers of encryption and sends them over a secure channel (end-to-end encrypted) to the gateway that then forwards them on to the mixnet. At the other end, when a gateway receives packets from the mixnet, it removes the last layer of the Sphinx encryption, sending the message to its final destination. (This does not mean the gateway gets to see any plaintext though, as the content is still end-to-end encrypted by the original sender and is only decrypted by the receiving client!)</p><p>If a receiving user is offline when a message arrives, the gateway will store messages for later retrieval. When the user connects, all messages will be delivered. So it’s important that gateways be online consistently and not running on a mobile phone or a&nbsp;laptop.</p><p>The default gateway implementation included in the Nym platform code holds packets for later retrieval. For many applications (such as simple chat or file sharing), this means it is usable out of the box, as it provides a place that potentially offline clients can retrieve packets&nbsp;from.</p><p>In order to register a gateway, you will need to put up a registration deposit (a locked amount of NYM, which will be unlocked when you unregister the gateway) and publish in the blockchain a descriptor with keys and address, to be reachable for users. The registration deposit is required to discourage spurious registrations of gateways and prevent sybil&nbsp;attacks.</p> Running a personal&nbsp;gateway <p>Gateways serve an important function, making the mixnet publicly available, and are listed in the Nym explorer. If you are a more technically savvy user, you might want to run your own personal gateway, rather than relying on someone else’s. Running a personal gateway prevents you from having to trust a third-party gateway.</p><p>The downside, however, is that with just your own traffic flowing through your gateway, you don’t benefit from blending the bulk volume of your traffic with other gateway clients, potentially exposing your overall level of usage and your online/offline periods — anonymity loves company after&nbsp;all!</p><p>Running a gateway for yourself AND for others affords by far the best privacy protection for everyone. Not only will your traffic be aggregated with others, but you will also be able to earn fees from providing this service when usage fees are turned&nbsp;on.</p> Broader use-cases / how you can add&nbsp;features <p>Gateways do not only act as an entry-point to the mixnet. They are also a user-facing service! To attract more users (and thereby more user fees in the future) you might want to offer additional privacy features. These features could include all manner of additional benefit to users, for&nbsp;example:</p><p>Censorship circumvention — Making Nym available to people in parts of the world where Nym might be blocked. Multiple pluggable transport solutions have been proposed in the last years to circumvent censored access to Tor, which can be adapted to Nym. In the Nym infrastructure, gateways are the entities in a position to deploy censorship circumvention solutions and make Nym accessible to users in all regions. Gateways may also run different protocols to connect to the user machine, from Wireguard to various Shadowsocks variants.</p><p>Disguise — Such censorship circumvention could include disguising traffic as a WhatsApp call for&nbsp;example.</p><p>Anonymous mailbox services — gateways can provide email services at an additional cost.</p><p>Nyms — establish a temporary nym with the gateway. The user and the gateway establish a shared secret and a nym (i.e., a temporary pseudonym). The data exchanged between the user and the gateway is encrypted with the shared secret, and the nym is used by the gateway as a temporary mailbox address where it can receive downstream data that is cached by the gateway. The cypherpunks called this a “nym server” in the early days of mixnets and anonymous re-mailers.</p><p>In fact, the more diverse the gateways, the better for everyone! Get creative&nbsp;:)</p> Incentives and grants for&nbsp;gateways <p>The mixnet is currently free to use because over the first many months we will be optimising the system, supporting app integrations and focusing on developer onboarding. This means there will be no user fees as income for gateways for the first&nbsp;months.</p><p>Instead, we are offering Service Grants for people wishing to run gateways along with service providers. These grants are specifically aimed at gateways and service providers that are needed at this stage of development.</p><p>The details of these grants will be announced later this week. <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Join</a> the Discord gateway channel or sign up&nbsp;<a href="http://eepurl.com/h6uPSD">here</a>.</p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/gateways">Run a Nym&nbsp;gateway</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/gateways-to-privacy-51196005bf5">Gateways to privacy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By Brian Armstrong, CEO and Co-founder</p><p>As companies scale, they usually slow down and become less efficient. It takes more dollars, more people and more time to get anything done. Coordination headwinds increase, vetocracies emerge, risk tolerance fades, and teams become inwardly focused instead of staying focused on their customers.</p><p>While this trajectory is natural, it is not inevitable. Every great company, from Amazon to Meta to Tesla, found ways to retain their founding energy in conjunction with appropriate controls, even as they scaled to be much larger than Coinbase is today. Great companies maintain their insurgent mindset, for fear of becoming complacent and irrelevant over&nbsp;time.</p><p>That’s why we’re focusing on driving more efficiency at Coinbase. After 18 months of ~200% y/y employee growth, many of our internal tools and organizing principles have started to strain or break. So we’ve been digging in to identify the set of changes we need to make to help us succeed at this new&nbsp;scale.</p><p>The first step was significantly slowing our growth, and making the difficult decision to reduce the size of our current team, which we <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/a-message-from-coinbase-ceo-and-cofounder-brian-armstrong-578d76eedb12?source=collection_category---4------0-----------------------">announced last month</a>. Moving forward, we’ll keep looking for ways to make Coinbase more efficient, and to get back to the mindset and approach that made us successful. I believe that these steps will carry us&nbsp;forward.</p> Push decision making down to single-threaded DRIs <p>We use DRIs (directly responsible individuals) to help us execute faster. DRIs balance input from the team, and make clear decisions in a timely&nbsp;manner.</p><p>But now that we’re a larger company with many products instead of one, we need to adjust how we make decisions — pushing most decision making down in the org, removing bottlenecks and empowering our product&nbsp;leaders.</p><p>DRIs often have the temptation to push decision making up the chain when they aren’t sure or don’t want to take risks. Sometimes they’re afraid of being fired if the decision doesn’t go well. That’s why, where possible, we are increasingly focused on identifying “single-threaded” DRIs. Single-threaded is tech jargon that simply means solely focused on a single area. The single threaded DRI is the most senior person whose only job is to run a given product or initiative, this will typically be a product management or engineering leader. They can’t be the single-threaded DRI if they are the DRI of multiple&nbsp;areas.</p><p>This may mean that not every decision is perfect. But that’s OK if we can scale our impact and empower subject matter experts who are closer to the products and closer to our customers.</p> Give product leaders visibility into their&nbsp;P&amp;L <p>Each of our products have well funded competitors that are dedicated companies. We believe the right way to compete is to incentivize our product leaders to also run their product more like a standalone company. Companies must achieve profitable growth on some reasonable time horizon. Over time, we’ll be able to give product leaders direct visibility into their P&amp;L, so they can move their product toward positive margins and make better decisions around where to invest, while at the executive level we will continue to look at consolidated performance.</p> Leverage shared services to minimize duplication <p>While product leaders can operate independently, there are often common elements across products. We have shared services around how customers onboard, manage their accounts, store crypto, add payment methods, trade crypto, and more. Done wrong, shared services can slow down and frustrate product teams. But when they work well, they can create amazing synergies between products, and deeper product integration.</p><p>Product teams should not be required to use a half baked shared service. But once a shared service is mature, all products may be required to use it. We’ve found that it often helps to start a shared service with one anchor product in mind. When it becomes clear that we are duplicating effort or creating an inconsistent user experience across our products, services need to graduate into clearly decoupled services that any product can leverage.</p> Organize teams into small&nbsp;pods <p>Small teams are more efficient. That’s why it’s important to set a maximum size on teams, so they don’t grow too large and slow&nbsp;down.</p><p>We’re beginning to deploy a new concept that we call “pods” to create more structure around the appropriate size of a team. Within each product, we will be defining pods of &lt;10 people working on a specific feature or area. If a pod grows to be more than 10 people, it will be time to split it in two and assign each one a more specific goal or focus. Pods also need to have a focus, and a north star metric that ties into the overall company&nbsp;metrics.</p> Ship products not slide&nbsp;decks <p>Inside growing companies, there’s a danger that product and engineering teams start shipping great slides decks instead of great products. It can be tempting to “manage up” and feel like a meeting went great with a beautiful deck shown to superiors. But our customers never see the slide decks we create. They only see the&nbsp;product.</p><p>So we’re experimenting with banning slide decks in product and engineering reviews. Instead of a slide deck, you can&nbsp;show:</p>  A dashboard with your metrics — hopefully your team is looking at this at least weekly&nbsp;anyway  Figma mockups  But most importantly….show the product itself and use it&nbsp;live!  <p>It’s fine to include a one page agenda to capture action items, or to link to any pre-reads like technical design documents. But the best use of time in product and engineering reviews is to share your screen and walk through the actual product on mobile or web. It could be the production version, or a staging version. The important thing is to get hands-on with the product, see what the customer is seeing (or is about to see), and make it&nbsp;better.</p><p>As we do this, we should avoid spending too much time talking about what’s going well in meetings. We can share what’s going well in the pre-read, and take a moment to celebrate it, but the majority of the time in meetings should be focused on what is not going well, so we can improve the&nbsp;product.</p><p>It’s hard to overstate this point. Inside companies, there are plenty of things that feel like work, but ultimately don’t improve the customer experience — from market cycles and negative press, to policy efforts, internal politics/drama, titles, and compensation. We have teams that focus on these areas, so that the vast majority of the company (80%+) can remain focused on talking to customers and building better products.</p> APIs instead of&nbsp;meetings <p>Larger companies also get slowed down by endless meetings around prioritization and feature requests. We need to move to a model where all product and engineering teams (not just shared services) publish APIs so that other teams can benefit from what they’re building without ever needing to schedule a meeting. In other words, they need to productize their services and allow other teams to use them in a self-service way.</p><p>This requires us to adopt an internal API catalog where any engineer at Coinbase can browse to find an appropriate service. Without this, it’s difficult for any engineer to even know if an API exists, leading to duplicate work. All services need to be architected using “paved roads”, meaning consistent libraries and languages for authentication, logging, instrumentation, etc. Many of these APIs will be surfaced in Coinbase Cloud for external customers as well, making them even more&nbsp;robust.</p> Maintain an insurgent mindset <p>Ultimately, a lot of this comes down to retaining the founder mentality inside the company and acting like owners. Most companies start off by being anti-establishment, seeking to right some wrong in the world. But as they grow bigger and more successful, they start to become the new establishment. They get complacent, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTwXS2H_iJo">feeling that they’ve won</a>, and bureaucracy sets&nbsp;in.</p><p>At Coinbase, one of our values is repeatable innovation, meaning we always want to be pushing the frontier. We use a 70/20/10 resource allocation model where we invest 70% of our resources in our core business, and 20% in strategic efforts, we also ensure 10% of our resources are always going toward ambitious new bets. And we always try to make products that are the most trusted and easiest to use, so we can bring a billion people into crypto. This is the best way to accomplish our mission of increasing economic freedom in the&nbsp;world.</p> Conclusion <p>Coinbase’s success has always been rooted in an ability to operate efficiently with a startup mindset. Now, as we adjust to our new scale, we need to get back to the things that made us successful — to drive more efficiency and shake off the complacency that can creep into a bigger company. We need to empower our leaders to make decisions, and our teams to deliver great products to customers. It won’t be easy, and we’ll need to keep adjusting. But we got this far, and I’m confident that if we make smart decisions now, it will only be the beginning.</p> Further reading <p>Companies approach this problem of declining efficiency in different ways, to best fit their situation. We’ve aligned on implementing these changes and tools after doing significant research on how other companies have navigated this. Here are a few great books and resources that helped educate me on this&nbsp;topic:</p>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amp-Unlocking-Hypergrowth-Expectations-Intensity/dp/1119836115">Amp It Up</a>: Frank Slootman has a great <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/amp-up-frank-slootman/">blog post</a> on this that turned into a book. The core message is that when someone says I’ll get back to you next week, say how about tomorrow. When someone says it will take six months, ask how we would do it in six weeks or six days if we had&nbsp;to.  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers/dp/1591846404">Turn The Ship Around</a>: The core message of this book is instead of asking your manager what you should do, tell him or her what you intend to do, and they will edit your thinking if needed. You still need to inform, but it’s your responsibility to decide the best&nbsp;path.  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Founders-Mentality-Overcome-Predictable-Crises/dp/1633691160">Founders Mentality</a>: The core message is to maintain an insurgent mindset, with a bias for action, bold mission, customer advocacy, and more. Try the <a href="https://media.bain.com/founders-mentality/">quiz</a> for more&nbsp;details.  <a href="https://komoroske.com/slime-mold/">Coordination Headwinds</a>: Scaled organizations need to be loosely coupled and tightly aligned. In other words, align on a high level mission, values, and metrics, then empower leaders to make their own path with more localized decision&nbsp;making.   <p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/operating-efficiently-at-scale-e6e2378d3d4">Operating efficiently at scale</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com">The Coinbase Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Validator Spotlights showcase the great teams working to guarantee the security and decentralization of the Findora blockchain. Here are <a href="https://twitter.com/rockx_official">RockX</a>’s responses to some questions from the Findora community:</p><p>1. Tell us about&nbsp;RockX</p><p><a href="https://www.rockx.com/">RockX</a> is a leader in non-custodial staking for Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, Osmosis, and now Findora ecosystems. It was established in 2019, and so has been in the blockchain industry for 3 years now. We are a Web3 company that acts as a gateway to crypto finances. Through innovative and easy-to-use products, we give individuals and institutions access to blockchain data, crypto yield products, and the best-in-class key management solutions.</p><p>With over $900 million USD worth of tokens staked on our validators, RockX is an innovator in liquid staking, data services, and MPC key management, and we have partnered with firms like Lido, SSV Network, and Amber Group. Aside from running validator nodes, RockX also provides an access node API service. This allows blockchain businesses or developers to access on-chain&nbsp;data.</p><p>RockX will soon provide non-custodial staking for Findora. This means users hold their own keys, allowing them to stake FRA without surrendering ownership of their funds. Their FRA will be stored in their cold&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>2. What should we know about the RockX&nbsp;team?</p><p>Although RockX is based in Singapore, the RockX team is located around the world. This allows us to be responsive to inquiries from our community around the clock. We are committed to putting our community above all else, especially when it comes to things like governance and voting. You may reach us on <a href="https://t.co/GmwzB17Wt2">Discord</a> at any time. Also feel free to tweet at us, email us or drop a message through the chatbot on our&nbsp;site.</p><p>We’re also committed to security. With consistent, regular updates and 24/7 monitoring, our nodes have consistently performed smoothly and remained online at all&nbsp;times.</p><p>3. What makes RockX&nbsp;unique?</p><p>RockX prioritizes transparency and ownership. We strongly believe that everyone should know exactly what they are getting themselves into before staking with us. Thus, we’re extremely clear with how much commission we charge and lock-up periods. This is also why we provide additional resources on our <a href="https://blog.rockx.com/">blog</a> for anyone wanting more information. Whether it’s about staking, crypto in general, or the technology behind it, we publish thrice-weekly to answer common questions and provide regular updates on Web3 happenings.</p><p>We provide non-custodial staking, meaning you get to retain ownership of your coins while you stake. This gives you control over your assets and preserves the decentralized nature of&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>4. Why do you want to validate with&nbsp;Findora?</p><p>Ownership has always been important to RockX, which is why we offer non-custodial staking. We believe that with decentralization comes the right to data ownership, which goes hand-in-hand with&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Rather than exchanging personal data for online services, blockchain technology allows people to take ownership of their personal data. This is what truly sets Web3 apart from Web2. With advances such as zero-knowledge technology, this is becoming more of a reality. Findora’s focus on ZK and privacy aligns perfectly with our vision of what Web3 will look like in the future, and we’re excited to support that in any way that we&nbsp;can.</p><p>5. Where can the Findora Community learn more about&nbsp;RockX?</p><p>Website: <a href="http://www.rockx.com">www.rockx.com</a></p><p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/rockx_official</p><p>Discord: <a href="https://t.co/GmwzB17Wt2">https://t.co/GmwzB17Wt2</a></p><p>For direct access to our access node portal: access.rockx.com</p><p>For more information on staking or Web3 in general: blog.rockx.com</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation/findora-validator-spotlight-rockx-1d0033caadc8">💡Findora Validator Spotlight💡: RockX</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation">Findora Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Brave Wallet’s integration with <a href="https://solana.com/">Solana</a> offers more accessible avenues for DeFi and Web3, via fast transaction speeds, low fees, and a growing ecosystem of decentralized applications (DApps). Our mission with Brave Wallet is about much more than holding and transacting crypto; we aim to create the user-first gateway to an easy-to-use Web3, for anyone, on any device.</p>
<p>Brave’s version 1.41 carries this mission and our integration with Solana forward, introducing:</p>
 
 Solana DApp support for Brave Wallet on desktop&nbsp; 
 Solana <a href="https://wallet-docs.brave.com/">developer docs</a> for developers to add Brave Wallet to their DApps 
 

 Solana DApp Support for Brave Wallet on Desktop 
<p>Brave is continuing to deepen its integration with Solana, <a>first announced in late 2021</a>. With Brave’s 1.41 release, <a>Brave Wallet</a> desktop users can now connect directly to their favorite Solana-based Web3 DApps. This expands Brave Wallet’s Solana support that already includes the ability to send, receive, store, and purchase tokens.</p>
<p>With Solana’s low fees and fast transaction speeds, users can easily explore the network’s vibrant and growing ecosystem. They can buy NFTs on <a href="https://www.magiceden.io/">Magic Eden</a>, discover music on <a href="https://audius.co/">Audius</a>, earn tokens through exercise with <a href="https://stepn.com/">STEPN</a>, or even collaborate on projects with <a href="https://squads.so/">Squads</a> (just to name a few). Solana also boasts an impressive range of decentralized finance options. Fans of BAT should be on the lookout for a special BAT/Brave-themed NFT collection launching this month on Magic Eden.</p>
<p>“Brave Wallet already makes Web3 easy-to-use with multiple features and partnerships, and today we’re expanding this access via our Solana integration and DApp support for our desktop browsers, with mobile coming soon,” said Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave. “Brave users already benefit from Solana’s faster transactions and low fees, and can now directly connect with its growing ecosystem of DApps to explore NFTs, music, fitness, and many more options.”</p>


    


    

 
     
        
        
        
        
     
 

 Brave Wallet Developer Docs 
<p>We’re also announcing an easy way for developers to build Solana DApps with Brave’s 62 million users in mind. In these documents, you’ll find instructions on setting up your DApps to offer a seamless connection with Brave Wallet.</p>
<p>To get started, developers are encouraged to view the dedicated sections for <a href="https://wallet-docs.brave.com/ethereum">Ethereum</a> and <a href="https://wallet-docs.brave.com/solana">Solana</a>, as well as keep an eye out for updates on support for more blockchains on the horizon.</p>
<p>Release 1.41 is another step in the direction of opening up the decentralized Web to more people. We continue to drive forward our vision of a multi-chain Brave Wallet, offering our community more choice and control with security and privacy at its core.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more announcements around Brave Wallet, including more features on all devices. <a>Get started with Brave Wallet today</a>!</p>

<p>The next four posts started out as a single article for the Synthetic Pretenders series; but as I continued to dig and write, the content got a little out of hand. If I were more self-disciplined, I’d probably be able to organize my findings better and perhaps offer up more compact, digestible posts. There’s a lot of background information provided here, so even though I cast a wide net, rest assured it does ultimately connect back to syn-bio eugenics, Berggruen’s Network, and California social impact NGOs joined at hip with defense-tech, global finance, and faith-based institutions.</p>
<p>You can read it in full <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fHzSgUXOVW97wRFCZbBV5Jlm0ce-yPGy_Tg5jpK9L7g/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> or access a PDF <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Mondragon-Series-Wrench-In-The-Gears-@Philly852.pdf">here</a>.</p>
 Your Government As A Planetary Computer 
<p>When Nicholas Berggruen reestablished himself in Los Angeles in 2010 with an intention to train in philosophy, he sought out two mentors, both <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/06/magazine/nicolas-berggruen-philosophy.html">UCLA professors</a>. One was <a href="https://www.worth.com/the-new-world-of-nicolas-berggren/">Brian Esparza Walker</a>, a researcher in comparative political theory and civic responsibility who has been working on a new book on cybernetics and Confucianism. The other was Brian Copenhaver an expert in the belief in magic in early Modern Europe and the Hermetica. Copenhaver’s 2015 book, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Western-Culture-Antiquity-Enlightenment/dp/110707052X">Magic in Western Culture: From Antiquity to the Enlightenment</a>,” looks quite interesting, but comes with the hefty price tag of academic presses. If you’re interested in getting a sense of what he’s all about, there are a few online talks with Copenhaver <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CkHsu_xX10">here</a> and <a href="https://shwep.net/podcast/brian-copenhaver-on-the-hermetica/">here</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://shwep.net/podcast/brian-copenhaver-on-the-hermetica/">Source</a>: The Secret History of Western Esotericism Podcast, Episode 101 Brian Copenhaver on the Hermetica</p>
<p>In lieu of payment, the two professors asked Berggruen to become a donor to UCLA. He ended up underwriting research at the Luskin School of Public Affairs on a <a href="https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/gift-from-berggruen-institute-for-research-partnership">good governance index</a> and partnering with the humanities division on a lecture series aptly titled “<a href="https://humanities.ucla.edu/lecture/possible-worlds/">Possible Worlds</a>.” If you read between the lines of the tweets below, you can see how this governance index is infrastructure for outcomes-based contracts aligned to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
<p>Remaking political systems for electronic government is the imperative; not only to ease the collection of data to prove “progress” towards the seventeen goals, but also to build the global data economy which, in turn, fuels machine learning for artificial intelligence. <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal16">UN SDG 16</a> is “strong institutions.” The Governance Index is overseen by <a href="https://luskin.ucla.edu/person/helmut-k-anheier">Helmut Ankeier</a>, a German sociologist specializing in social innovation who splits his time between UCLA and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertie_School">Hertie School</a> in Berlin, one of Europe’s first graduate schools devoted to public policy. The Hertie School promotes e-government <a href="https://www.hertie-school.org/en/digitalgovernance/news/detail/content/centre-for-digital-governance-launch-event-how-can-digital-governance-strategies-drive-sustainability">digitalisation</a> as a means by which to steer behaviors towards “sustainability” through circular economic practice.</p>

<p>A network emerged from the proceedings of Berggruen’s <a href="https://www.berggruen.org/work/the-future-of-democracy/think-long-california/">Think Long California</a> committee, whose scope of work quickly expanded beyond the Eureka state to include international bridge building. In its first few years the Berggruen Institute <a href="https://www.berggruen.org/history/">established relationships</a> with leaders in the EU and sent delegations to work with Chinese officials and industry leaders. A year after “<a href="https://36z59wriv543qd814533ma8z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Blueprint_to_Renew_ca.pdf">The Blueprint to Renew California</a>” went public, Nicholas headed over to Berlin for a European town hall co-hosted with French economist <a href="https://www.berggruen.org/people/jean-pisani-ferry/">Jean Pisani-Ferry</a> and <a href="https://www.berggruen.org/people/jakob-kellenberger/">Jakob Kellenberger</a>, a Swiss diplomat working in the international humanitarian aid space. Both are members of the <a href="https://www.berggruen.org/people/group/the-berggruen-network/">Berggruen Network</a>.</p>
 Disruption, Displacement, and the Solidarity Economy 
<p>At that event, speeches were given by Minnesota native and former Prime Minister of Greece <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Papandreou">George Papandreou;</a> and former UK Prime Minister and <a href="https://research.gold.ac.uk/id/eprint/8051/1/POL_thesis_Somers_2013.pdf">big-data social entrepreneur</a>, Tony Blair. Then George Soros took the opportunity to chastise the greedy creditors that precipitated the Eurozone crisis, decry the refugee situation in Greece, and propose a new era in which <a href="http://www.solidaritynow.org/kentro-allileggiis-athinas/">“solidarity” community centers</a> would be established to manage the masses of people flowing into the debt-crushed country. In 2013 his foundation launched the <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/who-we-are/programs/open-society-initiative-for-europe">Open Society Initiative for Europe</a> to promote “democracy” and “human rights,” with a special focus on refugees. Three years later he pledged $500 million for social impact initiatives targeting displaced people.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to harness the private sector for public good,” Mr. Soros said. “We will invest in startups, established companies, social impact initiatives, and businesses started by migrants and refugees themselves. These investments are intended to be successful. But our primary focus is to create products and services that truly benefit migrants and host communities. I hope my commitment will inspire other investors to pursue the same mission.” <a href="https://www.solidaritynow.org/en/george-soros-why-i-invest-500-million-dollars-for-the-refugees/">Source</a></p>

<p>The issue of solidarity seems to be one of growing scholarly interest, which gives me the feeling that social integration of migrants may be being set up as a social impact investing opportunity – not unlike <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/business/columnists/carol-cain/2019/10/26/social-impact-bonds-help-nonprofits-help-others-heres-how/4090113002/">anti-racism</a> and <a href="https://nff.org/report/california-pay-success-final-reflections">racial equity metrics</a> in the US. If you want to read my concerns about equity dashboards, I wrote an open letter to Ibram Kendi about it in the summer of 2019, <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2019/08/31/digital-curriculum-an-answer-to-equity-an-open-letter-to-dr-ibram-x-kendi/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Academics are parsing the differences between offering needy people “charity” and “solidarity,” examining how that distinction plays into the dynamic of EU politics. Seeing that, my first thought is that this is a narrative being spun to position “<a href="https://cps.ceu.edu/sites/cps.ceu.edu/files/attachment/publication/2986/cps-working-paper-migsol-d3.1-2018.pdf">solidarity</a>” as the preferred method of immigrant support, where asylum seekers can be “empowered” to work off their re-skilling and social care costs with impact investments tracked against future economic output. That’s the set up for the <a href="https://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/562020/20201015a.shtml">Career Impact Bonds</a> former Goldman Sachs executive Phil Murphy has been pitching with Social Finance in New Jersey.</p>
<p>The OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) with funding provided from the EU launched the “<a href="https://www.oecd.org/cfe/leed/social-economy/OECD-global-action/">Global Action: Promoting Social and Solidarity Economy Ecosystems</a>” initiative in 2020 to begin to address income inequality exacerbated by Covid lockdowns. Or, to put it another way, the time had come to create the data architecture needed to channel global ESG capital flows through human misery.</p>
<p>The effort is being chaired by Secretary General <a href="https://www.oecd.org/about/oecd-secretary-general-mathias-cormann-biography.htm">Mathias Cormann</a>, a Belgian born and educated politician who was previously affiliated with the German and French-Speaking Christian Social Parties in Europe before he relocated to Western Australia and rose to become Finance Minister with the Liberal Party of Australia. Prior to that he’d been working in the health insurance industry. Cormann, a conservative with a free-market outlook, <a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-oecd-secretary-general-mathias-cormann-before-their-meeting/">met with</a> Secretary of State Antony Blinken last June to discuss the post-Covid recovery; climate change; international tax reform; and management of the risks associated with the digital transformation of the economies of market-based democracies.</p>
<p>The intent is to transform all the so-called solidarity economies, but substantial “education” will be needed. Those <a href="https://www.oecd.org/cfe/leed/Flyer_SSE_Ecosystems.pdf">targeted</a> for the first round hard sell are: Canada, Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, India, the United States and the EU. Canada, Mexico, and Korea comprise three of the ten <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-nations.html">Digital Nations</a>. Peer learning programs and conferences are meant to instill a desire in local leaders to develop the legal frameworks and impact metrics required to scale these planned “social economies.”</p>
<p>In 2021, the OECD developed a working paper, “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Social-Impact-measurement-for-the-Social-and-Solidarity-Economy.pdf">Social Impact Measurement for the Social and Solidarity Economy</a>,” with input from <a href="https://littlesis.org/person/344884-Catherine_Clark_(Cathy_Clark)">Catherine Clark</a> of the CASE Center for Social Entrepreneurship at Duke University; Lisa Hehenberger, management professor at <a href="https://www.esade.edu/faculty/lisa.hehenberger">ESADE</a>; and <a href="https://socialvalueuk.org/staff/j-nicholls/">Jeremy Nicholls</a> a leader in the establishment of social impact metric values in the UK.</p>
<p>The document emphasized the need to shift to outcomes-based reporting tied to procurement and enforcement regulations; addressing the lack of common measurement standards and issues of credibility; opportunities for government and foundations to finance rigorous data collection; and getting buy-in from employees. All of this data will be used to keep capital flowing even as its collection normalizes ubiquitous digital surveillance for surreal simulations run through Taylorist optimization protocols to stave off climate catastrophe and mass social unrest. That’s the story they’ll tell us anyway to justify our dehumanization and the imprisonment of nature through blockchain financialization.</p>

<p>Who knows, they may even fancy it up by positioning contingent laborers as “cooperative” members. Envision pop-up refugee communities, enclosures of dispossession, reframed as a collective businesses where residents are made “token” stakeholders, living under rule of smart contract law with enforced participation metrics for a governance scheme they never wanted to be a part of in the first place.</p>
 Charter Cities as Containment Zones for Remote Refugee Labor? 
<p>My suspicion is part of the plan to manage the transition to the Fourth Industrial Revolution era of automation will be to disrupt social structures across the globe through economic and military interventions; remove people to different locations where they have no support network; and then set up ad-hoc <a href="https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/intervention-report-charter-cities">charter cities</a> where they will be leveraged as human capital commodities and trained to build and defend mixed-reality Internet-of-Everything infrastructure.</p>
<p>Displaced people aren’t to be blamed; no one wants to be forced out of their home and culture. The average length of stay in a UNHCR camp is currently five years under terrible conditions with very limited rights and economic opportunities. Yet issues of asylum tend to center the challenges of meeting the needs of individuals and families balanced against economic and social impacts on host communities, who are often suffering under conditions of austerity themselves, rather than interrogating the systems that led to mass displacement in the first place.</p>
<p>I believe millions of people are being pressured to be on the move, because it serves the interests of power to normalize biometrically-managed social instability as the disruptive potential of Web 3.0 materializes. Last year the Charter Cities Institute prepared a white paper proposing their solution as an improvement over the current horror of refugee camps where families may languish for years. In the introduction, the author Sarah Doyel states that data from the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees indicates the number of displaced people has almost doubled over the past decade from 43 million to 80 million. Each of those people is a potential impact opportunity for global investment portfolios.</p>
<p>Markets in human capital “improvement” are created by trauma resulting from war and the breakdown of civil society. That’s the simple, brutal truth.</p>

<p>CCI pitches their planned communities as a better option to UN-managed camp life, because they would open up settlements to economic activity and thus pools of millions of desperate potential workers (<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/How-Charter-Cities-Can-Create-Better-Refugee-Responses.pdf">page 19</a>). This approach also creates investment opportunities for public private partnerships (P3), which are touted as a way to off-set costs for host countries desiring to stay in compliance with the 1951 Refugee Convention.</p>
<p>Though they speak of P3 investment in terms of local entrepreneurs, the reality is that residents of charter cities will most likely be working on the Web 3.0 build out. It’s not about supporting the creation of one-off mom-and-pop businesses. The excerpt from the CCI paper below brings in language of “the collective” and “cooperatives” with the additional element of female empowerment, since gender equity is UN Sustainable Development Goal 5. What this looks like is tokenized plural voting, NOT what most people understand as participatory democracy.</p>
<p>“Collective ownership and cooperative groups constitute the social and economic parallels to participatory governance in refugee charter cities. Land trusts, housing cooperatives, and what the International Labour Organization calls “Social and Solidarity Economy Enterprises and Organizations” (SSEEOs) create opportunities for refugee ownership and inter- and intra-community social and economic relationships. In partnership with the IKEA Foundation, UNHCR has already implemented livelihood cooperatives across the five Dollo Ado refugee camps in Ethiopia that seem to be popular among both refugees and host populations. Charter cities can also build on existing collective structures in local communities, which can be especially helpful for women refugees who face higher barriers to economic activity. For example, Dr. Holly Ritchie, founder of the refugee women’s empowerment social enterprise THRIVE for Change, pointed out that mutual aid networks have been particularly important for refugee women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, there is a strong need from both a normative and an empirical perspective to center refugee voices in the design of governance, business practices, programs, and institutions.” <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/How-Charter-Cities-Can-Create-Better-Refugee-Responses.pdf">Pages 22-23</a></p>
<p>The policy paper closes out with a call for accurate measurement and evaluation – for the impact markets.</p>
 Blockchain Collectivism and the Mormon Transhumanist Association Conference 
<p>Below is a clip from the blockchain-themed March 2022 <a href="https://www.mtaconf.org/">Mormon Transhumanist Conference</a> in which I ask <a href="https://chartercitiesinstitute.org/people/kurtis-lockhart-2/">Kurtis Lockhart</a>, head of research for the Charter Cities Institute (CCI), how he reconciles the use of digital identity and sensor networks to track behaviors within smart urban environments with his advocacy for high-tech communities managed through public-private partnerships. How will the concept he’s promoting avoid the creation of DAO “company” towns run on behavioral scrip? I mention that Foshan in China has been using blockchain to track the behaviors of individuals across the city, a topic I wrote about <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2020/01/06/prison-reform-to-incarcerate-the-world-smart-justice-global-finance/">here</a>. The model Mr. Lockhart envisioned for scaling charter city development was China’s complex network of Special Economic Zones.</p>

<p>The charter city idea was expanded upon later that day by Tom W. Bell, faculty of Chapman University’s Fowler School of Law advising on special jurisdictions, who logged in from <a href="https://prospera.hn/#:~:text=A%20Platform%20for,Sustainable%20Growth.&amp;text=Pr%C3%B3spera%20is%20partnered%20with%20Honduras,About%20the%20Pr%C3%B3spera%20Platform">Prospera</a>, the West’s first charter city billed as a “platform for sustainable development” on the Honduran island of Roatan. Bell’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyS9TKikW0M">talk</a> was on <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3605807">U-Lex standardized blockchain legal systems</a> – perfect for “sustainable,” automated cities of well-managed human capital.</p>

Various interest groups are working diligently to get all the parts up and running, but I sense it will take more manufactured disruption before things start to scale. I’d definitely keep my eyes on Ukraine being used as a case study for a decentralized, digital systems-engineered society.</p>
 Paul Romer’s Vision Opens the Door to “Sustainable” ESG Finance 
<p>NYU and former World Bank economist Paul Romer’s vision for geo-fenced, state-of-exception towns fell out of favor after an <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GHOST-TOWNS-CHALLENGES-FACING-THE-CHARTER-CITIES-PROJECT-IN-HONDURAS.pdf">unsuccessful campaign in Honduras</a>, but seems to be making a slow comeback. A former Russian energy lawyer doing consulting for the state of Vermont, <a href="https://www.mtu.edu/social-sciences/department/faculty/sidortsov/">Roman Sidortsov</a>, prepared a paper, “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sustainable-CharterCities-the-Development-Solution-to-Environmental-Problems.pdf">Sustainable Charter Cities: The Development Solution to Environmental Problems</a>,” as a Global Fellow at the University of Vermont Law School back in 2011.</p>
<p>Sidortsov began his paper describing how he and his wife were inspired to create a humanitarian NGO after listening to a National Public Radio program about women and children brutalized at the Chad-Sudan border. He then pitched charter cities as an effective “solution” to human misery that would also meet the needs of ESG impact finance portfolios. To Sidortsov’s way of thinking, charter city investments would generate profit, unlike traditional humanitarian assistance. According to his Michigan Tech bio, Sidortsov teaches courses in alternative energy and climate policy. It defies logic that he would embrace Romer’s proposal, which entails building enormous cities the size and density of Hong Kong from scratch in developing nations on uninhabited tracts of coastline. Strange indeed.</p>
<p>The Charter Cities Institute has been collaborating with the United Nations on “sustainable” global development per a <a href="https://chartercitiesinstitute.org/interviews/q-a-charter-cities-institute-united-nations-conference-on-trade-and-development-unctad/">2019 webinar</a> with Richard Bolwijn, head investment researcher with UNCTAD. The image below is taken from the <a href="https://www.iom.int/migration-sustainable-development-and-2030-agenda">website</a> of the UN-affiliated International Organization for Migration and links migration to the achievement of Agenda 2030.</p>
<p>It is important that we recognize displaced people as victims of the planned transition to an automated, surveillance data economy, one that will center remote work. No amount of border control can mitigate erosion of wages once blockchain skill lockers and haptic-robotic / telepresence labor become acceptable. Each of the squares below represents an opportunity for billionaires to use technological systems to process other humans, including children, as digital commodities. Every heading is an intentionally unattainable goal meant to keep the masses on treadmills (pathways) of prescribed self-improvement optimized for machine-learning data harvest. Immigrants are not the threat; BlackRock’s ESG portfolios are.</p>

<p>An example of immigrants being targeted for “pay for success” finance is the <a href="https://missioninvestors.org/resources/pay-success-action-massachusetts-pathways-economic-advancement">Massachusetts Pathways to Economic Advancement</a> piloted by JEVS (Jewish Vocational Service) in 2018 in partnership with <a href="https://www.maycombcapital.com/the-community-outcomes-fund/">Maycomb Capital’s</a> Community Outcomes Fund, <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/332796-Community_Outcomes_Fund">Prudential Financial</a>, and the <a href="https://kresge.org/news-views/kresge-invests-in-massachusetts-pathways-to-economic-advancement-project/">Kresge Foundation</a>. Digital identity is a way to profile and cream compliant immigrant labor. It is easy to see how such programs could be incorporated into charter cities where people may have to earn release into the general population through demonstrations of social impact compliance over time.</p>
<p>The idea is that purpose-built communities would be open to anyone who agrees to opt-in. They would be run by private managers and embrace Romer’s New Economic Theory of technological innovation guided by Meta-Rules. Of course the presumption that all people actually have a free choice in the matter is disingenuous. In a 2010 <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/article/charter-cities-qa-paul-romer">interview</a> with the Center for Global Development, Romer laid out a variety of scenarios, including the use of Charter Cities as immigrant containment zones:</p>
<p>“Brazil could be the guarantor and the host, but Haiti could be the source. Brazil has already made a major commitment to providing security for Haitians in Haiti. They are the main supplier of troops and police officers in the force that entered Haiti under a UN mandate in 2004. To have a credible exit option, Brazil might consider chartering a new city on empty land in its territory that could accept Haitians as residents of the new zone, while maintaining standard immigration procedures for the rest of Brazil.</p>
<p>This could give Brazilian forces in Haiti a way to leave even if there is little progress toward stable governance. Brazilian leaders might say to the Haitian elites “we’ll spend several years trying to help you return your government to the point where it can provide essential state services like public safety. But if by then it still can’t serve this function, and things go back to where they were before we came, back to a situation where crimes like kidnapping were common and the police couldn’t enter zones controlled by gangs, we will leave. But if we leave we will also give Haitians the option to move to a special zone in Brazil where we will provide the basics of good governance.”</p>
<p>The charter cities model involves up to three parties – the host nation that provides the land; the source nation that provides the people; and the guarantor nation that enforces the charter. From the passage above one can imagine where <a href="https://peacekeeping.un.org/en">United Nations’ Peacekeeping</a> fits in. Once installed in new settlements, displaced people would become impact commodities, suitable for training as gig-economy remote workers. That makes sense given the push by <a href="https://www.unicef.org/innovation/XR">UNICEF Innovation</a> to “educate” children of the global south through VR headsets and condition them for a future of tele-robotic labor. There are already many coding boot camps that target refugees and immigrants for training into low-skill, task rabbit work in the tech sector including: <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/refugees-get-free-training-tech-careers-pilot-program-launched-coding-dojo-partners/">Coding Dojo</a>, <a href="https://devmountain.com/blog/iraqi-refugee-finds-new-life-coding-bootcamp/">DevMountain</a>, <a href="https://refcode.org/pages/index.html">RefCode</a>, and <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/jordan/unhcr-partners-chams-and-na-amal-launch-two-new-coding-bootcamps-support-dignified">Na’Amal</a>.</p>
 Something Rotten In The State of Denmark 
<p>In a June 2021 Charter Cities Initiative <a href="https://chartercitiesinstitute.org/podcast/charter-cities-podcast-episode-30-how-displaced-people-can-build-economies-with-alexander-betts/">podcast,</a> the Jordan Compact and the economic upside of locating refugees in special economic zones is explored. While Denmark has taken an i<a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2021/06/denmarks-immigrants-forced-out-government-policies">ncreasingly hostile position</a> towards asylum seekers in recent years; we see developments like <a href="https://archive.ph/ghPYD">the tunnel project in Lolland</a> that rely on immigrant labor. With advances in <a href="https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/Words%20and%20Concepts%20Front%20Page/Shared/Biometric">biometric identity</a>, satellite surveillance, and geo-fencing, could charter cities become twenty-first century “pop-up” labor camps where people enter a country conditionally – borders within borders? Remote compounds like <a href="https://archive.ph/CbWpO">Lindholm Island</a> would no longer be needed.</p>

<p>The hard line taken with refugees in Denmark contrasts starkly with a <a href="https://www.icvanetwork.org/uploads/2021/07/JDC-Background-Note-September-2019.pdf">2018 Memorandum of Agreement</a> to establish a Joint Data Center on Forced Displacement in Copenhagen’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_City">UN City</a>. The United Nations and the World Bank have teamed up to gather “evidence” on “what works” in the management of global misery, styling the effort as a “<a href="https://www.jointdatacenter.org/who-we-are/#structure">global public good</a>.” The University of Copenhagen hosts the <a href="https://amis.ku.dk/about/">Centre for Advanced Migration Studies</a>, established in 2013, and the <a href="https://drc.ngo/about-us/who-we-are/drc-s-history/">Danish Refugee Council</a>, Denmark’s largest NGO established in 1956, holds the world’s largest migrant dataset. That data is being used to explore <a href="https://admigov.eu/home">Alternative Migration Governance Models</a> (ADMIGOV) aligned to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This is about managing humans for impact markets.</p>
<p>Martin Lemberg-Pedersen and Eman Haioty’s 2020 article “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Re-assembling-the-surveillable-refugee-body-in-the-era-of-data-craving.pdf">Re-assembling the Surveillable Refugee Body in the Era of Data-Craving</a>” does a solid job of laying out how the process of digitally-managing millions of dislocated people have supported the development of global data economies and the emergence of disruptive financial “solutions” like programmable money. The latter seeks to supplant informal economies and reframe “othered” people as dynamic “risk” scores, though the narrative spun in a 2018 article in <a href="https://archive.ph/prz3L">MIT Technology Review</a> is that intense blockchain data aggregation should be seen as empowering for those looking to make a new start. Every displaced person is a credit score waiting to be compiled and rated.</p>
<p>“The act of biometric enrollment can be seen as requiring refugees to perform certain acts and roles to obtain the associated entitlements. Performing docility is key to the assembling and re-assembling of webs of rights, duties and consumption opportunities. This can be perceived as a form of quasi-coerced alliance, defined as when one or more actors involved in a transaction are either forced to abide by the rules of a transaction or are otherwise placed in a position in which rejecting a transaction can incur a loss beyond the scope of the rejected proposition.” Page 4</p>
<p>“Refugee acts of quasi-citizenship are increasingly determined by intersecting and blurred markets involving actors like the UNHCR, the EU, the World Bank Group, IrisGuard, Accenture and the Cairo Amman Bank. These markets are characterized by a pervasive craving for data about displaced populations as risky others. The identities of the displaced and dataveilled are thus re-assembled according to their aid needs, but also according to donor dictates concerned with risk management, and technological and financial market opportunities.” Page 15</p>
<p>This quasi-citizenship is evocative of the plot of a science-fiction novel. Cory Doctorow’s novella “Unauthorized Bread” in “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbdgdH8ksaM">Radicalized”</a> comes to mind. Unfortunately, <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/pais/people/lemberg-pedersen/">Lemberg-Pederson</a> (Amnesty International) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emanhaioty/">Haioty</a> (IT University of Copenhagen) stop short of linking manufactured dispossession to the cultivation of social impact investment opportunities. The networks are vast, and hiding in plain sight as illustrated in a map I made a few years back of the Massachusetts Pathways to Economic Advancement Project. It links <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/77316-Jobs_for_the_Future">Jobs for the Future</a> re-skilling; financialized income sharing agreements through <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/350838-edly_Income_Sharing_Agreement_Marketplace">Edly</a>; <a href="https://littlesis.org/person/155465-Jonathan_Greenblatt">Jonathan Greenblatt</a>, Obama’s impact finance guy now head of ADL; and Bloomberg Philanthropies with its <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/363995-Hazira">Hazira</a> “what works” smart city government pilots in Israel where the start-up nation is pivoting to be a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LQ1xY2G2GQ">Tikkun Olam</a> <a href="https://socialimpactil.com/hows-the-impact-nation-transition-going-part-1/">impact nation</a>. Where impact data is the new gold, migrants will deliver as soon as blockchain ID has been fully implemented for supply train traceability.</p>

 The Learning Economy As A Digital Public Good 
<p>Deployment of educational technologies is being pushed to gather data for human capital finance deals and machine learning. One of the systems being prototyped is <a href="https://www.unicef.org/innovation/stories/imisi-3d-providing-locally-tailored-interactive-content-using-vr-transform-education">IMISI</a>, an interface where pre-literate children learn to code by <a href="https://www.unicef.org/innovation/stories/imisi-3d-providing-locally-tailored-interactive-content-using-vr-transform-education">hand gesture</a>. UNICEF believes children in Africa are never going to merit human teachers. Besides the continent’s substantial youth population is too important to leave as an unrealized dataset.</p>
<p>Much of the software being promoted by UNICEF is open-source and pitched as helping create “digital public goods.” UNICEF is a member of the <a href="https://www.unicef.org/innovation/hiring-digital-public-goods">Digital Public Goods Alliance</a>. This framing is important, because the new economic model is driven by data. Tokenized data will be used as the primary governance mechanism of smart contract mixed reality as society acquiesces to cybernetic control.</p>
<p>The “commons” should be understood as an encoded cyber-physical system, not some shared pasture, cultural tradition, or civic space. The narrative frame that is being crafted is that the Metaverse is “open,” that it is being created with “open source” software for “sovereign” digital citizens, so it must be good, right? In fact, in this Alice-in-Wonderland world, everything is inverted. When you see “open,” read “restricted.” When you see “commons,” read “enclosures.” When you see “decentralized,” read “centralized.” Once you understand the game is enmeshing everything natural in a synthetic sensing web, the intent is easier to assess.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/who-we-are/">Source</a>: Digital Public Goods Alliance</p>
<p>Investments in these so-called public goods will become quite important in the future. We already see the infrastructure being put in place to track “public benefit” contributions over space and time in David Dalrymple’s presentation for Protocol Labs on Hypercerts below.</p>
<p>Dalrymple worked on the creation of virtual organisms with Ed Boyden’s <a href="https://syntheticneurobiology.org/people/display/144/Alumni%20-%20Visiting%20Scientists%20and%20Affiliates">Synthetic Neurobiology Group</a> at MIT and secured private funding for his research from Peter Thiel and Larry Page. My sense is that what they are doing is attempting to organize information, including biophysical and biogeochemical data, to catalyze “life/automata” using artificial neural nets, gamified IoT environments, and “moralized” market logic. The Hypercerts presented here would be part of the latter. Perhaps they imagine bio-digital convergence as a form of <a href="https://voegelinview.com/evolution-2-0-by-perry-marshall/">symbiogenesis</a>? It’s difficult to imagine what might be going on in their minds beyond the goal of a seamless human-computer interface.&nbsp; Ed-tech is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MnbY8g_Iq4">testbed</a>.</p>

<p>They need ways to tag programs to track progress and claim “credit” for future well being. Hypercerts are one way to assess which of the various contributors have responsibility for a communal benefit and to what degree. Coming from a space as an activist parent who opposed the data-mining of children through educational technologies, I see that screenshot as representing many programs and interventions foisted on a child as digital society tracks their performance and future economic productivity. Sort of a cross between Los Angeles’s Daily Pass Digital ID, <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/164710-Clever">Clever’s QR codes</a>, and Soulbound Token meta-data tags.</p>
<p>Children are quantified as “public goods” and subject to optimization by technological systems. The application of “evidence-based” scientific management of children toward pre-determined outcomes on pathways will be justified through the language of “equity.” The data analysts, program managers, and investors may attempt to convince themselves that this is benevolent, but it isn’t. You can see in the image below the treacherous fiction being peddled by UNICEF, Disney, and the Finance Ministries of Denmark and Finland.</p>

<p>This training will not only be imposed on children. The new economy is a so-called “<a href="https://littlesis.org/org/409805-Learning_Economy_Foundation">learning economy</a>” on blockchain. Refugees are targeted for perpetual data-mining through the United Nations High Council on Refugees and allied promoters of competency-based education.</p>
<p>Paul LeBlanc at Southern New Hampshire University, home of one of the largest distance learning programs in the US, piloted <a href="https://www.snhu.edu/about-us/newsroom/stem/blockchain-securing-school-records">early blockchain transcripts</a> with MIT’s spin off Learning Machine and partnered with <a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/snhu-receives-dollar1m-grant-from-google-to-design-soft-skill-assessment-platform/20055568">Google</a> on development of systems to track and log soft skills among enrolled students. I discuss these initiatives in <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/08/13/edu-blocks-arrive-in-new-hampshire/">this post</a>.</p>
<p>SNHU’s <a href="https://gem.snhu.edu/about-gem/">GEM</a> (Global Education Movement) mastery-based degree program was initiated in 2017 in refugee camps in Lebanon and Africa. The UNHCR’s also manages a “Connected Learning In Crisis” program of badge-based education for refugees, which is affiliated with several Catholic and Jesuit institutions. All of this needs to be viewed as a mining operation where children and adults from dislocated communities are literally plugged in to generate data flows that accrue to their biometric ID, establishing their digital reputation with the understanding that one day they may be released back into the real world.</p>

 The New Economic Model Is Shared Surveillance Branded as a “Data Commons” 
<p>The intent of manufactured communities like charter cities is ostensibly to improve economic productivity and well-being while reducing poverty. In the clip below from 2013, George Soros talks about his <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/06/13/the-chicago-school-of-economics-and-george-soros-new-theories-for-an-impoverished-world/">Institute for New Economic Thinking</a>, which spent the past decade funding experts in the academy, paying them to conceptualize a new game of global economics to be built on cybernetic social impact finance and closing wealth gaps. The project lead is <a href="https://archive.ph/xL2Mf">Lord Adair Turner</a>, former head of the UK Financial Services Authority, who managed the aftermath of the 2008 global banking crisis in England.</p>

<p>Paul Romer won the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2018/romer/facts/">2018 Nobel Prize</a> in economics when he was teaching at the NYU Stern Business School. NYU is a major player in data-driven “what works” government through the <a href="https://thegovlab.com/about.html">GovLab</a> based out of the Tandon School of Engineering. It is this government policy infrastructure that will pave the way for the “new economic thinking” described above. The prize was for Romer’s work in <a href="https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/97956/#:~:text=Romer's%20theory%20of%20endogenous%20technological,goods%20and%20services%20more%20productive.">endogenous growth theory</a> that states growth is best achieved through investment in people that will generate innovative ideas and new technologies. Human capital management is a core element of this proposal. Romer noted that he sought input from James Heckman.</p>
<p>Although I don’t fully understand it yet, the concept of “non-rival goods” that Romer proposes feels important. This is a paper he wrote on “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131228135644/https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~promer/Endogenous.pdf">Endogenous Technological Change</a>” in 1990 for the Journal of Political Economy. Feel free to look it over and drop your thoughts in the comments. My sense is that this conceptual framework would be applicable to open source software (Linux in a major player in digital ID), the so-called “open” Metaverse (<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/?ncid=pa-srch-goog-721691&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw_ISWBhBkEiwAdqxb9nrZqOYHc6lSnkF-TENFu5xJafmySjuT_vREOYw5mse8c_1mpDecxBoCixsQAvD_BwE#cid=ov01_pa-srch-goog_en-us">NVIDIA</a> and <a href="https://cesium.com/platform/cesiumjs/">Cesium</a>), and digital public goods (<a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/governance/">Norway</a>) meant to open low and middle countries up to the global data economy – economic liberalization for the Web 3.0 era.</p>
<p>As I’ve mentioned often, the growth imperative of capitalism demands creation of a digital empire before the Ponzi scheme falls apart. That empire will be made up of ideas and information. Those who aspire to be the next imperial rulers need for us to submit and build it for them. Unlike the colonial era in which lands lay on the horizon for the taking by force and trickery, this new world, the mixed-reality smart contract world, must first be made manifest through the organization of innumerable bits and bytes.</p>
<p>The pillow talk being deployed to get us to walk over to the edge of the Metaverse pit trap is that we’ll be creators, peers, members of a collective working in unity to enhance the Metaverse commons. When the harsh reality is that their plan is to use our naivete and need for belonging to turn us into piles of Soulbound Tokenized meta-data for a poker game run by techno-fascist billionaires and AI supercomputers. You see the way the story is being spun in this excerpt from P2P Foundation founder and former Belgian telecom executive Michel Bauwens 2007 “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150701092856/http://p2pfoundation.net/P2P_Theory">Key Theses on P2P Politics</a>, which just happens to be eerily similar to <a href="https://www.radicalxchange.org/">RadicalXChange’s</a> plans for plural property, plural money, plural voting, and plural funding.</p>
<p>“Our current world system is marked by a profoundly counterproductive logic of social organization:</p>
<p>a) It is based on a false concept of abundance in the limited material world; it has created a system based on infinite growth, within the confines of finite resources.</p>
<p>b) It is based on a false concept of scarcity in the infinite immaterial world (that’s mixed-reality / the Metaverse); instead of allowing continuous experimental social innovation, it purposely erects legal and technical barriers to disallow free cooperation through copyright, patents, etc.</p>
<p>Therefore, the number one priority for a sustainable civilization is overturning these principles into their opposite.</p>
<p>a) We need to base our physical economy on a recognition of the finitude of natural resources (circular economy), and achieve a sustainable steady-state economy (cybernetic homeostasis).</p>
<p>b) We need to facilitate free and creative cooperation and lower the barriers to such exchange by reforming the copyright and other restrictive regimes (free markets in data).</p>
<p>Hierarchy, markets, and even democracy are means to allocate scarce resources through authority, pricing, and negotiation; they are not necessary in the realm of the creation and free exchange of immaterial value, which will be marked by bottom-up forms of peer governance.</p>
<p>Markets, as means to manage scarce physical resources, are but one of the means to achieve such allocation (tokenization as alternative), and need to be divorced from the idea of capitalism, which is a system of infinite growth.</p>
<p>The creation of immaterial value (data economy / information economy / knowledge economy), which again needs to become dominant in a post-material world which recognized the finiteness of the material world, will be characterized by the further emergence of non-reciprocal peer production.</p>
<p>Peer production is a more productive system for producing immaterial value than the for-profit mode (peer to peer makes social relations visible to AI through tokenized transactions), and in cases of the asymmetric competition between for-profit companies and for-benefit institutions and communities, the latter will tend to emerge.</p>
<p>Peer production produces more social happiness (well-being metrics for pay for success finance and to train cyber-physical systems how to be more “human”), because 1) it is based on the highest form of individual motivation, nl. intrinsic positive motivation; 2) it is based on the highest form of collective cooperation, nl. synergistic cooperation characterized by four wins (the participants x2, the community, the universal system).”</p>
<p>Two interesting and related side notes:</p>
 
 The techno-libertarian Holon future of free market peer-to-peer exchange is embodied in Daniel Suarez’s two books “Daemon” and “Freedom,” reviewed <a href="https://blog.p2pfoundation.net/daniel-suarez-daemon-and-freedom/2010/04/26">here</a> by the P2P Foundation in 2010.

<p>I haven’t had a chance to do more than skim it, but Nicholas Negroponte’s 1995 “<a href="http://governance40.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Nicholas-Negroponte-Being-Digital-Vintage-1996.pdf">Being Digital</a>” appears to be a very accessible entry point into the physics of the information economy. Thanks Sebs for bringing it to my attention in <a href="https://gnomes4truth.medium.com/goldman-sachs-brics-alternative-world-scenarios-b203957d3580">your recent post</a> about BRICs.</p>
<p>The planned future revolves around a knowledge economy, which is swiftly morphing into a data economy, which in turn rests on social impact finance, perpetual re-skilling to compete against AI, and health surveillance that legitimizes coerced bodily intake of the torrent of synthetic-biological “knowledge” churned out by thousands of biotech ventures. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/endogenousgrowththeory.asp">Romer’s theory of growth</a> promotes investment in education, healthcare, and telecommunications, which on the surface sounds good. What they don’t say is that measuring returns on these investments will require the invasive use of Internet of Bodies wearables and biometric identity linked to your education and health records.</p>
<p>While teaching at Stanford, Romer developed an online homework assignment platform, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplia">Aplia</a>, bought out by Cengage in 2007. So, he practices what he preaches. Ed-tech is an enormous area for investment as evidenced by BlackRock’s recent launch of a new entertainment/education-themed ETF (exchange traded fund) called <a href="https://www.etfstream.com/news/blackrock-launches-digital-entertainment-and-education-etf/">PLAY</a> that tracks stocks in the ed-tech, gaming, and digital device sectors. This new global economy of “ideas,” seems to be apps and games, while the future of “work” is navigating games under digital surveillance. I’m sure it sounded better to Romer back in the early 1980s when he was writing his <a href="http://dxie.people.ust.hk/OnlineMacro/romerjpe1986.pdf">dissertation</a>. I imagine his outlook is closely aligned with the tenets of the United Nations and <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/edutech/brief/blockchain-for-education-community">World Bank-affiliated</a> <a href="https://id2020.medium.com/id2020-welcomes-learning-economy-foundation-as-newest-alliance-partner-a7e92054e8bb">Learning Economy Foundation</a>.

<p>Charter cities, built from the ground up with smart infrastructure, will become glorified Skinner boxes. Sidortsov also thought it would be useful for UN Peacekeeping Forces to get involved setting up these new settlements, because if international energy firms can own large tracts of land in developing nations, why not the United Nations? It’s such an honorable project, who could possibly refuse?</p>
<p>“As I noted above, Romer is currently trying to persuade leaders of developing countries to invest into charter cities. However, his idea should be appealing to a much broader audience. Charter cities present a rare “triple dividend” solution of environmental, sociopolitical, and economic problems. This makes charter cities a primary goal for international aid funds of various flags and colors. For example, refugee camps provide a temporary yet critical solution of humanitarian crisis. However, they depend on international aid and do not provide a permanent solution, whereas charter cities do. On the climate change front, a charter city can be a perfect candidate for a carbon offset project and can be funded through the newly established Green Climate Fund. Finally, because a charter city creates a mechanism for sustainable economic growth, it should be a primary target for economic aid. Overall, investments in charter cities are a much more effective and productive way to distribute $120 billion that developed countries spend on international aid.</p>
<p>Charter cities present a unique opportunity as a test bed for the “new economy” ideas reflected in the works of several authors. Free of public pressure, the governing body can internalize environmental costs by shifting tax burden from payrolls to carbon and other pollutants. As the German energy tax experience shows, such a shift spurs “green” economic growth and innovation. Because a charter city or village will be planned completely or almost completely from scratch, “smart” urban design and permaculture principles will be utilized. Finally, sustainable charter cities can serve as hubs for new business organization forms such as for-benefit-corporations.” <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sustainable-CharterCities-the-Development-Solution-to-Environmental-Problems.pdf">Source</a></p>
<p>Sidortsov then goes on to say that while some worry cities run on public-private partnerships risk subsuming the public sector entirely, we shouldn’t be concerned, because there are models like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation">Mondragon</a> in the Basque region of Spain that generate strong economic growth.

<p>A challenge all web3 developers need to address when building applications is where the data is&nbsp;stored.</p><p>Historically, most web3 developers have chosen to use either blockchain storage or <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> and sometimes resort to traditional centralized database (eg MongoDB, Postgres) for some types of data. Verida provides a decentralized replacement for those traditional databases, and a better option for some of the things developers are currently using blockchain storage or IPFS&nbsp;for.</p> Choosing data&nbsp;storage <p>In the flowchart below we show some of the key decisions a developer must make when choosing&nbsp;storage.</p><p>Firstly, look at your data and decide if it is structured or unstructured. Examples of structured data include data that you would keep in a spreadsheet, a JSON or XML file or a Notion database. Unstructured data includes images, movies or other multimedia.</p><p>Secondly, is your data public or private? By public we mean it can be accessed without access control mechanisms. Note that encryption on its own is not an access control mechanism because access cannot be revoked if a key&nbsp;leaks.</p><p>Finally, do you need to update or delete data? Be careful here — some storage systems implement deletion as the removal of a reference to data that is stored elsewhere. In these cases the data is still there and anyone who recorded that reference can easily access it. Both deletion and updates should be implemented in such a way that all copies of the data are irrevocably modified.</p>Data choice flowchart Limitations of Current Web3 Data Storage Solutions <p>Blockchain storage is the first type of storage most web3 developers use. However, it doesn’t take long to realize this is best suited for very specific types of data such as links to external data like NFTs. The nature of a blockchain makes it expensive and inefficient to store more than small amounts of data and the immutable, public nature of the data means it is unsuitable for many applications.</p><p>Many developers discover these limitations and switch to using IPFS. IPFS is a globally accessible content addressable file storage network, where files are referenced by the hash of their content. This makes it very well suited to “flat file” type storage, and it has had great success as storage for NFT images. In broad terms IPFS is used in a similar way to how AWS S3 is used in Web2 development — to make files available to people and applications.</p><p>The next limitation Web3 developers find is around private data and managing access permissions to that data. Users want self-sovereignty over personal data so they can control their own information. How do you store things like a user’s interests or even things like health information in a way that doesn’t make it publicly available to anyone for data mining or identity&nbsp;theft?</p><p>Many developers resort to trying to encrypt data and store it either on-chain or in encrypted files on IPFS. There are a number of serious problems with&nbsp;this:</p>  Most developers are not cryptographers and often make mistakes in how they implement their encryption, putting user data at&nbsp;risk.  Both blockchains and IPFS are immutable storage systems, meaning that any mistake either in implementation or by a user accidently leaking an encryption key means their data is globally public forever with no way to fix&nbsp;it.  The lack of a proper query mechanism leads to badly performing apps. Either applications load large files into memory and developers find data inside them or there are many small files each of which must be requested each time it is&nbsp;needed.  Updates and deletes are implemented by copying all data to a new version of the file and resaving it. This is both expensive and&nbsp;slow.  No control over the physical storage location of data which is often important for legal or policy&nbsp;reasons.  <p>Verida exists to solve these problems. The <a href="https://developers.verida.io/docs/network/storage-node">Verida DbStore</a> is a decentralized, end-to-end (E2E) encrypted document database.</p><p>Because it is a database, developers get strong query capabilities. Data updates are trivial and fast which means correcting any errors in the data is simple. Databases are both encrypted (so storage node operators can never see the data) and protected by an authentication system (so they are inaccessible to non-authorized users).</p><p>Verida <a href="https://developers.verida.io/docs/network/storage-node">storage nodes</a> are open source and can be self-hosted. Users can choose what node to store their data on, meaning that the legal and policy issues around data sovereignty are easily addressed.

  One of the most pervasive techniques used by browsers &amp; advertisers to get ads in front of receptive eyes, is that of third-party cookies!

<p>Although it is intimately connected to our everyday lives, advertising technology (adtech) goes unnoticed by most of us. </p>

<p>One of the most pervasive techniques used by browsers and advertisers to get relevant ads in front of increasingly receptive eyes is that of the ‘third-party cookie’. </p>

 What is a third-party cookie?  

<p>These are tiny pieces of data that are stored in your browser on behalf of a website whenever you visit. Websites that you visit later can access these cookies and use them to tailor the ads they show or the deals they offer. </p>

<p>An example: suppose that you are planning a trip to Lisbon and doing online research about where to visit and what to eat. Some of these websites leave cookies on your browser that can be witnessed by other websites when you browse to them. The next time you visit Amazon you may find that - miraculously - there is a sale on guide books to Portugal. </p>

<p>As simple and benign as third-party cookies sound, this mechanism is powerful. As internet users, we are spreading information about our browsing history far and wide. While more tailored advertisements is in theory a benefit, the privacy implications are manifest.</p>

 How do we tackle the issues related with adtech? 

<p>An obvious approach to cookies and adtech is to make the trade-offs between privacy and relevance of advertisements clearer. One trivial way to do this is to alert a web user each time they visit a website that uses cookies. Those of us in jurisdictions subject to the GDPR encounter these warnings with aggravating frequency. Inevitably, we click through the warnings with no thought at all, meaning that the well-intentioned notifications are completely meaningless. </p>

<p>This status quo is transparency theatre. Even though these cookie warnings are meant to abide by the GDPR principle of consent, those of us in the majority of users who ignore the warnings do not have the time to give informed consent and we gain little assurance that our data is being used in appropriate ways. Even if GDPR risk is mitigated in a technical sense, practically there is no benefit.</p>

 Adtech needs a major facelift! 

<p>One such direction, until it was killed in January 2022, was Google’s FLoC; the Federated Learning of Cohorts. The idea behind FLoC was to map people into a group of like-minded users called a cohort. A website can then request the cohort identity of a given user to generate targeted ads, without getting more specific or identifying data from the browser. Topics, which is Google’s proposed replacement for FLoC, instead tracks user interests based on browser history and makes these interests available to advertisers in real time. </p>

<p>The Google proposals have received mixed reviews. They may not be as private in practice as suggested. Then again, it might actually be a more pragmatic approach than simply blocking third-party cookies, which at first glance is more privacy-friendly, but has the effect of strongly incentivising much more privacy destructive technologies such as device fingerprinting. </p>

 We see no solution on the table as getting adtech quite right.  

<p>The ingredients that are missing are meaningful transparency and minimality. A key aspect of adtech transparency should be to provide information about when a person’s browsing data is actually used. This avoids some of the problems of the never-ending cookie warnings, but also introduces ‘actionability’. </p>

<p>An example of actionable adtech transparency: you find that a particular company’s website is making heavy and seemingly unjustifiable use of your browser data. You then consider switching to an alternative business to get the same service. </p>

<p>This methodology, in which statistics about your adtech privacy are consumed after-the-fact, and then made actionable, eliminates the need for a constant stream of up-front warnings, without foregoing ultimate transparency or accountability. </p>

<p>As members of the PAD team, we cannot help but notice that this methodology is closely related to the trust-but-verify nature of decryptions under the PAD system. Once a user grants in-principle decryption approval to another party, that party does not need to request permission to decrypt. Instead, that party is subjected to unavoidable transparency about whether and when decryptions were made. </p>

<p>This counter-intuitive property allows many of the PAD use cases to fit together well. In the case of PAD Places, if you are in an emergency and a friend needs to identify your location, requiring that the friend seek permission may be unsuitable if you are unable to grant it.</p>

 Applying PAD-style transparency to adtech.. 

<p>Applying PAD-style transparency to adtech might be a modest part of solving the problems inherent to this domain. Technology that enables the average person to get a sense for which websites apply adtech proportionally - rather than provide a useless stream of blanket warnings - also could be used to empower the individual to be compensated for use of their browser data. Users who are highly motivated by this compensation could even optionally attach additional attributes about their identity or browsing history, and secure this information in encrypted form under PAD. If advertisers wish to use this data, they must transparently decrypt it and subject themselves to a micropayment to the user.</p>

<p>This self-sovereign ownership of browser data may be a moonshot for now, but regardless, the notion of meaningful transparency already incentivises our second goal of minimality. Privacy-centric consumers will track and recommend businesses that make the most out of the least data and provide more relevant ads without making unjustifiable intrusions. Reputation-sensitive companies will respond and learn to live with less. Incentive compatibility is a hallmark of great technology. </p>

<p>We see meaningful transparency and incentivised minimality as the principles currently missing from the adtech debate surrounding third-party cookies and alternative solutions like topics. Any technology that provides individuals with an easily interpretable layer to see how their data is actually used will play an outsize role in the adtech of Web3.0.</p>

<p>The Findora Newsletter gives you monthly updates in the push to build privacy infrastructure for Web3. Thanks for subscribing and being part of our community!</p> 🛠 Engineering Updates  🎉Triple Masking to Launch on&nbsp;Testnet <p>We are excited to announce a successful network upgrade to Findora: support for Triple Masking on Forge testnet is live and ready for extensive testing by the community! Triple Masking enables shielded asset creation, issuance, and ultra-fast transfers powered by Turbo-Plonks, <a href="https://wiki.findora.org/docs/modules/UTXO/anonymous/Concepts/">a type of ZK-SNARK</a>.</p><p>With this network upgrade, Findora’s network can support use cases not previously possible including confidential cross-chain transfers, private decentralized lending, private DAO fundraising, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Capitalizing on cryptographic breakthroughs and zero-knowledge proofs, the launch of Triple Masking completes Findora X, a series of integral toolkits including Restful APIs, SDKs, and infrastructure to make Ethereum-based assets and applications fully&nbsp;private.</p> …And A Triple Masking SDK is Soon to&nbsp;Follow <p>The Findora SDK contains a Triple Masking API, which enables developers to have access to the latest Findora privacy features, such as fully secured transfers with full privacy. SDK integration testing was completed locally.</p> Rialto Bridge to Support Fantom, Polygon, and…NFTs! <p>That’s right, according to the developers working on the Rialto Bridge, it is being configured to support NFTs. They will be supported on Findora OG (the UTXO ledger) where they can assume similar privacy properties to those Findora gives to ERC-20 tokens.<a href="https://wiki.findora.org/docs/developers/evm/Mint%20NFTs/p1_deploy_nft/"> Click here</a> for documentation on deploying NFTs on&nbsp;Findora.</p><p>The Rialto Bridge connects Findora to Ethereum and its satellite ecosystems, and the team has already launched a BNB Chain bridge on mainnet and an Ethereum bridge on testnet. Paths to the Fantom and Polygon are now in the pre-production phase.</p> EIP-1559 Transaction Support <p>As well as preparing the UTXO layer for the ERC-721 tokens, the Findora engineering team is working on supporting EIP-1559 transactions. EIP stands for “Ethereum Improvement Proposal,” and EIP-1559 is a hardfork of the Ethereum chain introduced by Vitalek Buterin to stabilize the volatility of gas&nbsp;fees.</p><p>🧑‍🌾 Ecosystem</p> EthCC Launch Party&nbsp;🥳 <p>We are celebrating the launch of Triple Masking with a launch party at EthCC! We plan to host a huge hackathon taking into account hacker feedback from EthNYC and Consensus in Austin. Be sure to follow our Twitter for&nbsp;updates.</p><p><a href="https://ethcc.io/">EthCC</a> is the largest European Ethereum gathering, happening this year in Paris from July 19–21. This year will feature speakers from all over the world and cryptoverse, and we’re looking forward to what we can build in just a few short&nbsp;days.</p> Developer Workshops <p>Findora is dedicated to giving developers the tools they need to build on Findora and holds regular developer workshops.

Here’s a look at the events, talks, and takeaways.</p> Consensus 2022 <p>Findora was a core sponsor of Consensus 2022, the largest crypto event of the year.

<p></p><p>The term MEV stands for Miner Extractable Value, lately referred to as maximum extractable value. It is a measure of the profit a miner (or validator, sequencer, etc.) can make through their ability to arbitrarily include, exclude, or re-order transactions within the blocks they produce on a smart-contract enabled blockchain network.</p> What is MEV (Miner Extractable Value)? <p>Simply put, MEV is a dynamic that allows miners to maximize their profit by determining the order of transactions on a blockchain network to their advantage. This includes arbitrarily reordering, including, or excluding transactions within a block at the expense of users.<br></p><p>The term Miner Extractable Value was first coined in 2019 by a team of researchers highlighting the issue by publishing a paper called <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05234.pdf">Flash Boys 2.0</a>. Interestingly, the problem of MEV was first identified even earlier by a Reddit user in 2014 who raised the issue of ‘<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/2d84yv/miners_frontrunning/">miner front-running</a>’ given that all transactions are public on the Ethereum network.<br></p><p>Subsequently, the concept of Miner Extractable Value and the problems surrounding it gained notoriety after the research team of a Web3 investment firm, Paradigm, dove into them. Head of Research at Paradigm, Dan Robinson, published the article <a href="https://www.paradigm.xyz/2020/08/ethereum-is-a-dark-forest/">Ethereum is a Dark Forest</a>, in 2020. In it, Robinson states that MEV issues such as front-running bots potentially incentivize miners to reorder and submit transactions in their mempools for their benefit.<br></p>Total MEV on the Ethereum network since 2020. (<a href="https://explore.flashbots.net/">Source</a>)<p>Today, MEV is one of Ethereum’s biggest issues, with more than <a href="https://explore.flashbots.net/">$663 million</a> worth of value extracted from users since 2020. This shows that MEV is not merely a minor issue, but a significant problem occurring at a massive scale and a matter of concern for Ethereum users.<br></p><p>Let’s look at the different types of extractions, examples, and effects of MEV, as well as the measures users can take to mitigate its effects.</p> Types of Miner Extractable Value <p>Today, users suffer the economic effects of MEV in more than one form. Terms like gas golfing and generalized front-runners often occupy crypto headlines. However, before we venture into discussing the various types of MEV, let’s first examine the theory behind MEV and how it impacts miners and validators.<br></p><p>As we have stated, MEV allows miners and validators to profit from re-ordering transactions, as they have access to confirming blocks. Despite this, a good portion of MEV is performed by autonomous network partakers called searchers.<br></p><p>Searchers are users (not necessarily miners) that handle intricate algorithms in the blockchain ecosystem. These algorithms are then used to detect available profitable MEV opportunities. Searchers make use of bots to automate the submission of profitable transactions to the network. Since searchers have a “secure” profit opportunity, they are able to pay high gas fees, incentivizing miners and validators to accept their proposed order of transactions.<br></p><p>Below are the different types of extractions that take place as forms of MEV.</p> Gas golfing <p>Gas golfing is the process of optimizing the existing functionalities of smart contracts in a way that minimizes the amount of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gas-ethereum.asp">gas</a> involved. This involves programming transactions in a way that takes advantage of contracts’ design to use the least possible gas. <br></p><p>Gas golfing gives a competitive advantage to searchers, as it allows them to set higher gas prices while keeping their total gas fees constant (since gas fees = gas price*gas used).<br></p><p>To understand the concept of gas golfing, one must understand the cost of storage in a <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-road-to-decentralization-part-1-setting-our-foundations-2e7e3874c09e/">decentralized</a> network. Unlike data centralized in servers, blockchain data is not stored in just one place but on tens of thousands of disks distributed across the globe. Furthermore, data has to be readily available to every node in the network if a future transaction comes along to access or change it. Because of this, the cost of data access is charged by the network in the form of gas fees. <br></p><p>Gas golfers use techniques such as: <br></p>  Saving data space within transaction code whenever they can.  Only storing data when it is really required.  Keeping a check on how many times a function is accessing or changing storage.<br>  <p>Other gas golfing techniques involve using addresses that start with a long string of zeroes, as they take less storage space. Another involves leaving small <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/">ERC-20</a> token balances in contracts to re-use them, since it costs more gas to initialize a storage slot than to update one (SSTORE vs SLOAD).<br></p><p>It’s worth noting that SSTORE (to store data in a storage slot) and SLOAD (to load data from the slot into memory) are some of the most expensive opcodes on <a href="https://cypherpunks-core.github.io/ethereumbook/13evm.html">EVM</a> in terms of gas fees.</p> Generalized front-running: What is front-running and why it’s so common <p>Unlike gas golfing, front-running doesn’t deal with optimizing smart contracts to detect profitable MEV opportunities. Instead, it involves keeping an eye on unconfirmed transactions, looking for profitable trades, and then front-running the original transactions by submitting them but with higher gas fees. <br></p><p>By effectively executing a winning trade first, front-runners secure a profit at the expense of the original honest trader. Front-running bots that use specific algorithms and parameters to identify transactions before they happen are called generalized front-runners.<br></p><p>Let’s illustrate this with an example.<br></p><p>Imagine a trader finds an arbitrage opportunity. As it turns out, there’s a price difference for a certain coin between Uniswap and Sushiswap. Let’s say wBTC/USDC is $20,904 in one and $20,916 in the other. To profit from this opportunity, the trader has to initiate a transaction to buy the asset for a lower price on Uniswap and then sell it at a higher price on Sushiswap. Once the trader initiates the transaction, it will have to wait in the mempool (the pool of unconfirmed transactions) to be picked by a miner and get executed.<br></p><p>However, what our trader doesn’t know is that this opens up a window for a front-runner bot to sweep in. The bot would detect the transaction while it’s waiting to be executed, copy it, add in higher gas fees, and have its transaction executed beforehand. This will effectively rob the trader of her arbitrage opportunity, profiting at her intellectual, monetary, and creative expense.</p> Back-running <p>Similar to front-running, back-running involves the monitoring of a mempool to execute a transaction immediately after a pending target transaction. To achieve this, MEV searchers employ back-running bots eavesdropping on big transactions that often results in an imbalance in an <a href="https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/what-is-an-automated-market-maker-amm-588954fc5ff7">AMM</a> pool and in heavy price slippage.<br></p><p>The back-running bot then executes an opposite trade on the same pool to maximize its owner’s profit. In other words, back-running works by leveraging the price difference caused by an original transaction.<br></p><p>Back-running bots also monitor mempools for new token pair listings and place transactions to immediately scoop the initial liquidity by buying a large quantity of one token from the pair. This subsequently increases the price of a token, creating FOMO among other traders and pushing the price even higher. The bot then sells the token at a higher price maximizing the searcher’s profit, wrecking small buyers on its way out.</p> Sandwich attack <p>Sandwich attacks deal combine both front-running and back-running strategies. They are particularly useful in decentralized exchanges (such as Uniswap) that utilize an AMM concept. As you saw in the back-running example, the price of an asset can substantially increase or decrease with a single big trade under this model. <br></p>Illustration of a sandwich attack for a given token. (<a href="https://www.publish0x.com/ilvfi/illuvium-silv2-don-t-get-sandwiched-xqmrdwj">Source</a>)<p>MEV extractors leverage AMMs for a profit by monitoring the mempool for large transactions and sandwiching them. To do so, they simultaneously front-run and back-run them.<br></p><p>For example, let’s say a victim wants to swap a large amount of ETH for an obscure altcoin on Uniswap. Once the MEV searcher sees this transaction in mempool, it can front-run the victim’s transaction by executing the same transaction prior to the victim's transaction. <br></p><p>As the searcher’s transaction hits, it will invariably result in price slippage, which will subsequently increase the price of the altcoin within the pool. This, in turn, will make the victim pay substantially more per coin than they originally expected. To complete the job, once the victim’s transaction is executed, the searcher can then swap its altcoins back to ETH at the original trader’s expense, back-running to make a profit.</p> Time bandit attacks <p>Another form of MEV attack is the so-called time bandit attack. As you will see, these are perhaps the most worrying types of attacks, as they could destabilize the consensus and trust in a network.<br></p><p>Time bandit attacks involve the re-mining of blocks in order to maximize profits. An opportunity for a time bandit attack might occur when block rewards are small enough compared to MEV. This incentivizes miners to destabilize the consensus to reap the maximum profits.<br></p><p>For example, let’s say the highest block of a blockchain network is numbered #B10 and its block reward is $100. Incidentally, a miner notices an MEV opportunity worth $1000 on block number #B7. This opportunity might incentivize the said miner to remine the #B7 block and all subsequent blocks to reap the MEV rewards while adhering to the longest-chain rule.<br></p><p>As you can imagine, this is unlikely to happen in big chains without a certain degree of collusion between several miners. However, block re-mining is still a problem in novel chains and could become more prominent as <a href="https://argoblockchain.com/articles/read-more-china-dominates-bitcoin-mining-heres-why-that-needs-to-change">mining power progressively centralizes.</a></p> Uncle attacks <p>Another peculiar kind of attack is uncle attacks. Uncle attacks can bypass and perform MEV even from bundled transactions, a common defense tactic that consists of sending transactions in batches. To understand how <a href="https://twitter.com/bertcmiller/status/1382673587715342339">uncle attacks</a> work, we need to first understand bundled transactions.<br></p><p><a href="https://docs.flashbots.net/">Flashbots</a> is a research organization that democratizes access to MEV (a controversial take that we’ll address below) by creating an off-chain MEV auction marketplace. This is called front-running as a service (FaaS). Once Flashbots’ auctions conclude, a batch of front-running transactions is bundled together to avoid getting front-run by other searchers (in other words, out-speeding front-runners). Bundled transactions must be included in the order submitted, and either the whole bundle is included, or nothing is. They are also not allowed to split.<br></p><p>However, there are cases in which a bundle of such transactions is mined on an uncle block. In Ethereum, occasionally two blocks can be mined at roughly the same time, with only one of them being allowed into the chain. The block that gets discarded is then called an "uncle" or “orphan”. Transactions that get written into uncle blocks then create a small window of opportunity for an attack.<br></p><p>When bundled transactions are mined into an uncle block, they’re open for everyone to see. In this case, an attacker can select transactions from the bundle to front-run or back-run them. This also shows that attacks extend beyond the mempool and into uncled blocks as well.</p> Effects of Miner Extractable Value – the good, the bad, and the ugly <p>Surprisingly, there are numerous arguments for MEV and its role in the blockchain ecosystem. <br></p><p>Let’s start out with the side that believes MEV is unsolvable and inevitable before we look into the negatives.</p> The good side of MEV <p>This side argues that the crypto community should be building the tools to democratize access to MEV instead of trying to solve it.<br></p><p>The proponents of MEV believe that MEV ensures the usefulness of DeFi projects such as lending protocols, enabling them to speedy and smooth liquidation processes. The proponents argue that MEV extractors are rational actors seeking and fixing economic inefficiencies of <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/the-worlds-first-private-decentralized-protocol-launch-panther-dao-votes-to-launch-private-defi-e721df1364/">DeFi protocols</a> making them robust.<br></p><p>A group of researchers belonging to the proponents camps have built an organization called Flashbots working on mitigating the negative externalities of current MEV extraction techniques. <a href="https://docs.flashbots.net/#:~:text=Flashbots%20is%20a%20research%20and,state%2Drich%20blockchains%20like%20Ethereum.">Flashbots</a> has built a product called MEV-Geth, which offers front-running as a service with a primary focus on enabling a permissionless, transparent, and fair ecosystem for MEV extraction.<br></p><p>The proponents argue that offering <a href="https://medium.com/offchainlabs/front-running-as-a-service-334c929c945a">front-running as a service</a> (FaaS) makes up for the miners’ lost revenue caused by Ethereum’s <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/quorum/what-is-eip-1559-how-will-it-change-ethereum/">EIP-1559</a> fee-burning update. Hence, it indirectly increases Ethereum’s security by incentivizing miners to compete for MEV with higher hash power.</p> The bad <p>On other hand, there are obvious reasons for MEV causing a worse experience for users. Particularly, it causes more expensive transactions and revenue loss.<br></p><p>For example, at the application layer, front-running and sandwich attacks are causing users millions of dollars worth of losses in terms of increased price slippage and lost arbitrage opportunities. In the 30 days before publishing this article, MEV searchers and miners have extracted over $28 million from Ethereum users.<br></p><p>The existence of front-running bots makes arbitrage trading an unwinnable game for amateur traders. This especially hurts the proposed functionality of DeFi protocols that rely on third-party arbitrage to function properly. The presence of MEV bots creates an unfavorable environment for real arbitrageurs to participate in such protocols, which in turn is detrimental to the protocol’s security.<br></p><p>Additionally, at a network level, generalized front-runners compete against each other by increasing gas fees. This often results in network congestion and high transaction fees. Network users (and the network itself, which turns inefficient and costly) suffer as a consequence.</p> The ugly <p>There are also arguments put forth claiming that MEV worsens the network itself at a protocol level. For example, for any given block, if MEV rewards are larger than block rewards, this might incentivize miners to remine blocks and destabilize the network’s <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065245820300668">consensus</a>.<br></p><p>Depending on who you ask, allowing miners to reorganize and reorder the transactions in blocks for profit might be seen as breaking the entire premise of blockchains being a secure, immutable, and permissionless technology. It also makes miners’ take an active role in influencing transactions and balances, as opposed to being neutral parties competing for a different set of benefits. In fact, we encourage you to think about what may happen when miners decide it’s worth their time to utilize their mining privileges to conduct MEV themselves.</p> Mitigating Miner Extractable Value <p>We have looked into the bad and ugly sides of MEV and considered the millions of dollars lost due to MEV extractions. It is now crucial to close this article by discussing how to mitigate or minimize the effects of MEV.<br></p><p>The crypto ecosystem as a whole is actively discussing and working on solutions to mitigate or at least minimize MEV’s effects. Numerous solutions have been proposed from both camps – those who believe MEV is inevitable and access to it should be democratized, and those who are trying to prevent it.<br></p><p>Let’s have a look at the solutions both camps propose.</p> MEV democratization, Flashbots, and more <p>In the “proponent” camp, several organizations such as Flashbots (see above) aim to democratize MEV extraction through a sealed-bid block space auction mechanism. This auction mechanism creates a parallel private relay to reduce mempool bidding wars, failed transactions bloating the blockchain, and overall gas costs for users.<br></p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.optimism.io/">Optimism</a> has led a movement that proposes <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-auction-auctioning-transaction-ordering-rights-as-a-solution-to-miner-extractable-value/6788">MEV Auction</a> (MEVA) to minimize the effects of MEV on network traffic. With MEVA, an auction is created in which the winner has the right to reorder submitted transactions and insert their own, as long as they do not delay any specific transaction by more than N blocks.</p> Against MEV <p>On the other side, those who believe that MEV is bad and should be minimized have built a couple of solutions as well.<br></p><p><a href="https://bridge.arbitrum.io/">Arbitrum</a>, a Layer-2 solution for Ethereum, has openly positioned itself against MEV and FaaS. To mitigate MEV, Arbitrum has proposed a solution to avoid reordering of transactions by having <a href="https://www.mev.wiki/solutions/mev-minimization/arbitrum-offchain-labs">no sequencer</a> on Layer-2 chains. <br></p><p>As per Arbitrum, a chain can be created in which no permissioned entities have sequencing rights. Ordering then is to be determined entirely by inbox contracts. A Layer-2 chain without sequencers might lose the ability to get lower latency than its Layer-1 chain but, without any party involved in the Layer-2 (including Arbitrum validators) having a say in transaction ordering, MEV cannot enter the picture.<br></p><p>Well-known oracle network Chainlink has also built a solution to avoid the reordering of transactions called <a href="https://blog.chain.link/chainlink-fair-sequencing-services-enabling-a-provably-fair-defi-ecosystem/">Fair Sequencing Service.</a> The idea behind FSS is to have an oracle network order the transactions sent to a particular contract, including both user transactions and oracle reports. Through FSS, oracle nodes ingest transactions and then reach consensus on their ordering, rather than allowing a single leader to dictate it.<br></p><p>Another approach is that of <a href="https://github.com/Taichi-Network/docs">Taichi Network</a> (now defunct) or <a href="https://bloxroute.com/">bloXroute</a>, which allows users to send private transactions directly to a mining pool, bypassing the public mempool. This eliminates the attack surface within the mempools (where, as we have established, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bitcoin-tumblers-privacy-coins-and-prifi-private-crypto/">transactions are public</a> and can be monitored by MEV bots).<br><br></p>A diagram showing how Taichi Network enables users to avoid getting front-runned. (<a href="https://www.mev.wiki/solutions/faas-or-meva/private-transactions">Source</a>) Conclusion: Miner Extraction Value is not going away soon. <p>It is a well-established fact that MEV problems, as they stand, are quite serious in nature, and need to be addressed or minimized at least. Even though there are conflicts about the good and bad sides of MEV, both sides are actively working on various solutions. The ones we covered are just the tip of the iceberg –<a href="https://www.mev.wiki/solutions/">the MEV wiki</a> and other sources offer a comprehensive list for those interested in knowing more about the MEV ecosystem.</p><p>At Panther, we're building privacy-centric solutions with an emphasis on users' privacy and autonomy. As such, MEV as a problem is deeply relevant to our research and interests. Panther is an integral part of the Private Finance ecosystem, enabling users to navigate the world of DeFi applications with full control of who sees their data.

<p>We’re proud to announce that Aztec Connect is live on mainnet, enabling private DeFi on Ethereum for the first time&nbsp;ever.</p><p>By fusing full privacy and L1 DeFi liquidity right on Ethereum mainnet, users no longer need to trade convenience for privacy via alternative privacy chains. With Aztec Connect, Ethereum is now capable of private DeFi all on its&nbsp;own.</p><p>To help reveal the power of Aztec Connect, we’ve completely revamped <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a>, our first-party DeFi aggregator. Users can try the comprehensive update today, which allows anyone to use DeFi apps like Lido, Curve, and Element with complete privacy and up to 100x cost&nbsp;savings.</p><blockquote><a href="http://zk.money">Try zk.money&nbsp;here</a></blockquote><p>Blockchain transactions are fully public. They leak privacy, exposing user behavior and creating security vulnerabilities. At Aztec we solved the challenge of implementing blockchain privacy by inventing <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/09/22/plonk.html">Plonk</a>, the industry-standard zk-SNARK that enables fast privacy for Aztec while securing billions of dollars of on-chain value for the broader zk community.</p><p>Aztec Connect is the next major leap toward our long-term vision: a fast, decentralized zero-knowledge network with native smart contract&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Aztec Connect enables anyone to add privacy to Ethereum applications with two easy-to-use developer tools:</p>  Bridge Contracts: 100–200 line interfaces connecting Ethereum smart contracts to Aztec’s&nbsp;rollup  SDK: a front-end toolkit enabling beautiful, seamless web interfaces to access Aztec Connect integrations  <p>In simples terms, Aztec Connect works like a VPN: by using Aztec’s rollup contract as a proxy, users interact with Ethereum services from within the Aztec&nbsp;network.</p><p>Encrypted instructions are passed to Aztec’s rollup contract on Layer 1, which executes those commands. Aztec batches transactions, reducing user fees and enabling up to 100x cost savings over mainnet Ethereum.</p> A Private zk-Rollup — Today <p>The launch of Aztec Connect represents exciting new paradigms for DeFi and&nbsp;beyond:</p>  Fully confidential Defi actions: staking, vault entry, lending and&nbsp;swaps  Significant cost reduction for&nbsp;users  Private treasury management, on-chain DAO governance, and NFT purchasing and&nbsp;trading  <p>And because Aztec Connect relies on Ethereum as its execution environment, protocols keep liquidity and contracts on mainnet while maintaining Ethereum ecosystem composability.</p><p>That means partners can access the benefits of a private rollup&nbsp;with:</p>  No liquidity fragmentation  No contract redeployment  No re-audits of code and contracts  <p>Scale and privacy without compromise.</p> zk.money <p>We originally built zk.money as a showcase for private payments. Since launch, 75,000 users have entrusted our cryptography with over $100 million in payment&nbsp;volume.</p><p>We’ve now expanded <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> functionality to support beautiful, intuitive access to DeFi interactions that are private by default, starting with acquiring Lido liquid staked Ether (stETH) with Curve and entering fixed rate vaults with Element&nbsp;Finance.</p><p>As of today, users can visit zk.money and interact with our Curve-Lido and Element bridges, enjoying mainnet liquidity, full privacy and up to 100x cost savings over Layer 1 Ethereum, with upcoming support for your favorite DeFi&nbsp;apps.</p><p><a href="http://zk.money">Zk.money</a> demonstrates the simple and elegant user experiences that are possible with the Aztec Connect SDK–a Typescript-based front-end development tool that allows anyone to integrate privacy and cost savings into Ethereum applications.</p><p>We’re just getting started and will be bringing more DeFi integrations to zk.money over the coming&nbsp;months.</p><p>We’re supporting developers creating fully private DeFi experiences using these tools, and we want to hear from you! The public repo for Aztec Connect can be found <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect-bridges">here</a>, with documentation found&nbsp;<a href="https://transcendent-marshmallow-2f922f.netlify.app/">here</a>.</p> State of Aztec’s Private&nbsp;Rollup <p>In order to achieve seamless privacy, we’ve made significant improvements to Aztec’s rollup in the last&nbsp;year:</p>  Performance: throughput increase of over 11x; rollup gas efficiency improvement of&nbsp;30%+  UX on L2: chained transactions allows for instant settlement on internal transfers  UX on L1: support for multi-asset DeFi deposits and withdrawals  <p>Further releases will include gas cost reduction via off-chain viewing keys, lower latency, improved UX and security via native Ethereum signatures, and multi-signature wallet&nbsp;support.</p> Towards a Community-Driven Rollup <p>This achievement wouldn’t be possible without the Aztec, Ethereum, and zk communities. More than ever, we are committed to supporting a community-first approach to Ethereum&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>That’s what prompted us to launch Aztec Grants, funding the independent development of DeFi protocol integrations with Aztec Connect. We’re excited to be working in collaboration with the grants programs at Aave, Compound, Element, Lido, and more to expand the privacy ecosystem.</p><p>If you’re a developer interested in building privacy-first applications, please <a href="https://airtable.com/shrvglCZ24jaH73oe">apply for a grant&nbsp;here</a>.</p><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect-bridges/tree/master/src/bridges">See here for a repository of Aztec Connect integrations.</a></blockquote><p>We also owe a debt of gratitude to the scientists, researchers, and engineers who are building on Plonk and keeping cryptography secure. With their support and collaboration, the dream of blockchain privacy will soon be a&nbsp;reality.</p> About Aztec&nbsp;Network <p>Aztec Network is the first private zk-rollup on Ethereum, enabling decentralized applications to access privacy and scale. Aztec’s rollup is secured by its industry-standard Plonk proving mechanism used by the leading zero-knowledge scaling projects.</p><p>Aztec’s first-party payments and DeFi aggregation product <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> has supported over 75,000 unique users, 250,000 transactions, and $100 million in transaction volume since its launch in&nbsp;2021.</p> Build with Aztec Connect&nbsp;SDK <p>Are you a developer who wants to bring privacy to your favorite DeFi protocol?

<p>Dear community,<br></p><p>We’re happy to announce that our Zafari incentivized Testnet is resuming its activities with the third wave of <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testing-for-zkp-advanced-staking-is-now-live-19b51bc6b42b?source=collection_home---4------1-----------------------">Advanced Staking testing</a>!<br></p><p>Please read all the details below carefully to learn more about what is being tested and how to participate.</p> How does Wave 3 of testing work?<br> <p>In this testing round, users will stake test $ZKP tokens (i.e., tokens with no value) to earn:</p>  Test $zZKP rewards, which are computed in a Multi-Asset Shielded Pool (MASP).  10,000 test Panther Reward Points (PRPs) per stake, which can be redeemed for test $zZKP once the protocol’s v1 launches.  <p>By holding onto their test $zZKP in the MASP, users can also continue to accrue additional test PRPs.</p><p>This new test environment will feature an Early Redemption functionality which allows users to withdraw their test $zZKP rewards early by forfeiting test PRP rewards. Withdrawing ahead of time means that users give up any possible additional test PRPs accrued through holding test $zZKP in the MASP.</p><p>$zZKP in the MASP will start accruing rewards in PRP as soon as the stake is created. They will continue to do so even in the period before upgrading to v1, which implements full shielded pool functionalities. This wave of testing also features updated contracts and reward management mechanics (implementing smart contracts), as expected.</p><p>Note that PRPs will only be created as the protocol’s v1 launches. Rewards issued to users will be computed taking into consideration their staking date.</p><p>Wave 3 of testing will proceed as follows:</p>  Staking will become available on July 7th, 14:00 UTC.  The staking period will end on July 9th, 14:00 UTC.  Unstaking of test $ZKP principal will become available on July 10th, 14:00 UTC.  test zZKP rewards will also become available for redemption on July 10th, 14:00 UTC.   Reporting a bug <p>Make sure you read the instructions below, as well as our section on Unaccepted submissions before participating.<br></p><p>To report and be eligible for rewards, do the following once you think you’ve stumbled into a bug:</p>  <a href="https://appuals.com/open-browser-console/">Open your browser console</a>.  Ensure that the Console tab is selected.  Type -/zkp-staking/ into the Filter box to filter out all the failed to load source map warnings.Make sure all logging levels are enabled, including Verbose:<br>    Scroll to the bottom to locate the more detailed errors.  Make sure the window is a decent size, so that it captures a good amount of detail from the errors.  Take one or more screenshots of the window to capture any log messages which might be relevant to the problem in question.  Make sure to include this information in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSftCbVmbosspDfFDLMwL5qfDyq4O7bRcijicZKPXLBhISUTGA/viewform">bug report form found here.</a><br>   Unaccepted submissions <p>Avoid grouping multiple bugs into a single report. Please generate multiple reports for any number of issues you find.</p><p>Note that the previous rounds of testing have helped identify several unresolved bugs. Submissions reporting them will therefore not be accepted. All submissions also now need to provide proof of the bugs they’re reporting via an image or video.</p><p>These include:</p>  White screen upon opening the zAssets page.  Pending transactions in MetaMask.  Faucet: transaction failed - None 200, status code ‘404’ (mobile version).  Transaction error: code 32603 + code 404.  Transaction error: Cannot find event in receipt. No StakeCreated event found for this transaction.  Available balance incorrect comma in total balance (balance card).  Double tapping Stake/Unstake buttons produces 2 transactions per one stake.  zAssets page not viewable if connected to networks other than the Polygon Mumbai Testnet.  zAsset link not showing on the navigation bar when &nbsp;connected to networks other than the Polygon Mumbai Testnet.  Incorrect rounding of staked amounts.  Footer line showing at incorrect locations.  White screens when using Safari (browser).  MATIC balance not auto-refreshing.  Progress bar on top of staking tab needs real data.  Auto translator enabled.  Unstaking tab and balance card data showing differences in total rewards.   Moving forward<br> <p>From the Panther team, we'd like to thank you again for your enthusiasm in previous testing rounds. Your feedback has been incredibly helpful in building towards v1 of our protocol and the launch of MASPs.<br></p><p>Advanced <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/crypto-staking-misconceptions-benefits-risks-and-taxation/">Staking</a> is a critical intermediate step between Panther's current state and the release of MASPs. Thanks to it, we can test the dynamics behind creating zAssets and computing rewards in a real-world setting.<br></p><p>We're looking forward to receiving your input!<br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

 Scallet — Scala’s Web Wallet &amp; Payment&nbsp;Gateway  Introduction <p>The most ancient among our community surely remember <a href="https://medium.com/scala/the-story-behind-stellitepay-12faddc8204">StellitePay</a>, the web wallet of the pre-Scala era… yes, that nostalgic time when Scala was still called “Stellite”.</p><p>At the time, StellitePay was a simple and fast payment system that has been integrated into some applications: tip bots, a gambling site, and some other experimental apps.</p><p>Unfortunately, user adoption of StellitePay was limited at the time due to some technical challenges and other priorities… until&nbsp;now!</p> The rebirth <p>Releasing a web wallet made it to the top of our backlog in 2022, and we took the time to rewrite the entire frontend/backend and make it better, thanks to the feedback we got from StellitePay.</p><p>After our <a href="https://shop.scalaproject.io/product/re-re-re-branded/">re-re-rebranding</a> (please, meme us!), we had to find a new name for StellitePay.</p><p>We decided to go with Scallet, which is the combination of “Scala” and “wallet”.</p> What is&nbsp;it? <p>You may be wondering why we need a new wallet? It is true that we already have a few wallets — they all have their respective uses… but they also have their drawbacks.</p><blockquote>Scallet intends to be a simple browser-based wallet with everything you need in your daily&nbsp;life.</blockquote> Everything I&nbsp;need? <p>Yes, indeed! But what does that mean&nbsp;exactly?</p><p>Well, if&nbsp;you…</p>  need a wallet which is always&nbsp;synced  need to access your wallet from any device connected to the&nbsp;internet  want to accept/use Scala’s currency (XLA) in your shop or application  want a simple and fast&nbsp;wallet  <p>Then… Scallet is the right&nbsp;choice!</p> How can I get&nbsp;mine? <p>It all starts here: <a href="https://scallet.io">https://scallet.io</a></p><p>Just register your email, username and password and you’re good to&nbsp;go!</p><p>Send some of your XLA to Scallet and have fun while sending it from your phone or even from your refrigerator web interface (did you know we are one of the only real CPU and mobile-friendly projects out there? Check out our <a href="https://github.com/scala-network/MobileMiner">mobile&nbsp;miner</a>!)</p> Shortlink <p>We have implemented a cool feature called “shortlink”, which allows you to define your own personal URL that you can share with your friends, family or users and makes it easy to receive&nbsp;XLA.</p>Shortlink example How much does it&nbsp;cost? <p>It’s totally free! There are no hidden&nbsp;fees.</p><p>You simply send and receive XLA like any other transaction on any other wallet, just like you are used&nbsp;to.</p> Can I make Scallet my main&nbsp;wallet? <p>We don’t recommend it. Even though we’re doing our very best to make Scallet as safe as possible, there isn’t a safer place than a cold wallet to which only you got access and no one else in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Our <a href="https://scalaproject.io/">CLI/GUI/Mobile wallets</a> are better options to store your coins safely if you intend to&nbsp;hodl.</p><p>Scallet is meant to be used as your “hot wallet” to send/receive transactions whenever you purchase something or when you need a simple and fast&nbsp;wallet.</p> Conclusion <p>In the future, there will be additions to the app, such as Discord webhooks, but first and foremost we want to make sure that the core features work as intended and that people can use the app&nbsp;easily.</p><p>So please give us your feedback on <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/djAFVvy">Discord</a> so we can improve the&nbsp;service!</p> Community 👋 <p>If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact&nbsp;us:</p>  Website: <a href="https://scalaproject.io/">https://scalaproject.io/</a>  Discord: <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/djAFVvy">https://discordapp.com/invite/djAFVvy</a>  Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/scalaofficial">https://t.me/scalaofficial</a>  Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scalahq">https://twitter.com/scalahq</a>  Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScalaNetwork/">https://www.reddit.com/r/ScalaNetwork/</a>  Scala Mining Stats: <a href="https://scalastats.com/">https://scalastats.com/</a>  Email: hello@scalaproject.io   <p><a href="https://medium.com/scala-network/scallet-scalas-web-wallet-payment-gateway-db6a7e29d808">Scallet — Scala’s Web Wallet &amp; Payment Gateway</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/scala-network">Scala</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/human-betterment-foundation-1928-1942">Ezra Seymour Gosney</a>, a lawyer born in Kentucky, became involved in the cattle and sheep industry in Arizona and later in citrus production when he relocated his family to Pasadena in the 1920s. He owned one of the largest lemon groves in the state and was involved in numerous finance civic activities, including the California Boy Scouts, when he approached Harry Laughlin of the Eugenics Records Office at Cold Spring Harbor on Long Island about establishing an office on the west coast to promote sterilization practices.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Before the Human Betterment Foundation (HBF) officially launched, Paul Popenhoe was hired to conduct extensive field work in California and summarize the impact of the 6,000+ sterilizations that had taken place in the state following the enabling legislation that passed in 1909. Popenhoe was a horticulturalist researching avocado and date production who later became interested in human breeding. He wrote “<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/19560/19560-h/19560-h.htm">Applied Eugenics</a>” in 1918, a textbook that promoted the idea of segregated societies where “waste” humanity would do manual labor to create value on unimproved forestland as a means by which to offset the cost of their upkeep.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://homesteadmuseum.blog/2020/02/27/the-slippery-slope-of-social-engineering-the-case-of-paul-b-popenoe-1915-1930/">Source</a>: Paul Popenhoe 1912 in India in Palm Date Research, “The Slippery Slope of Social Engineering: The Case of Paul Popenhoe 1915-1930”</p>
<p>This focus on sterilization coincided with intense anti-immigrant settlement during the 1920s and 30s. The Johnson Reed Act that was passed in 1924 implemented strict quotas, imposed a literacy test and tax, and excluded Asian immigrants other than Japanese and Filipinos, because the Philippines was an American colony at the time.</p>
<p>After Gosney’s death, the remaining assets of Human Betterment Foundation and his <a href="https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf2h4n98gb/admin/#did-1.7.1">papers</a>, were transferred to Caltech. The income from the <a href="http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/629/2/Personals.pdf">Gosney Research Fund</a> was to be used for “the promotion of the research of the biological basis of human qualities.” Of course today, Caltech offers <a href="https://catalog.caltech.edu/documents/19916/caltech_catalog-2122-section_2.pdf">graduate degrees</a> in molecular biophysics, bioengineering, biochemistry, neural engineering, medical engineering, social and decision neuroscience (including economic theory and game theory and behavioral economics). I imagine there are many avenues for pursuing the engineering of certain qualities, though they are increasingly likely to be post-human.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://collections.archives.caltech.edu/repositories/2/resources/91">Source</a>: Caltech Archives Human Betterment Foundation Collection</p>
<p>Below are selections taken from the Human Betterment Foundation’s materials on the social benefits of sterilization. Remember, this was during a period of economic upheaval that caused grave distress for many families.</p>
<blockquote><p>Chapter XII Sterilization for Eugenic Reasons</p>
<p>There remains, then, the principal field for sterilization; namely, the eugenic. Persons should be sterilized if it is to the interests of the commonwealth (or more broadly of the human race) that they bear no children, or no further children; and if it appears that sterilization is the most effective and satisfactory means of preventing such reproduction, more specifically, sterilization is justified 1) if mental disease and defect are a menace to the state 2) if they are perpetuated by heredity and 3 if sterilization seems to be the most effective means available for dealing with them, or with certain aspects of them.</p>
<p><a href="http://chwe.net/michael/gosney_popenoe_1929.pdf">Source</a>: Sterilization for Human Betterment, 1929, page 116</p>
<p>The Problem Before American Citizens</p>
<p>The situation which has led all these commonwealths to adopt sterilization laws grows out of such facts as the following. Births among families habitually living on public charity are often 50% or higher than births among self-supporting families. The families that contribute children to the state homes for the feebleminded in California are multiplying about twice as rapidly as the rest of the population. The burden of taxation due to the mentally diseased and mentally defective is, at the same time, steadily mounting.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/rbpe.0020380g/?sp=2&amp;st=image">Source</a>: Human Sterilization Today, Human Betterment Foundation, 1938, page 2</p>
<p>Eugenic Sterilization Is Not a Panacea</p>
<p>Sterilization is no panacea for these ills of mankind, but it is one of the many measures indispensable to any far-sighted and humanitarian program dealing with society’s tremendous burden of mental disease, deficiency, and dependency.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/rbpe.0020380g/?sp=3&amp;st=image">Source</a>: Human Sterilization Today, Human Betterment Foundation, 1938, page 6</p></blockquote>
<p>These quotes show that the foundation’s membership justified sterilization in part by saying families of feeble-minded people had too many children and were a drain on government assistance. These were among the wealthiest citizens of Pasadena, many of whom had made fortunes made in law, academia, and speculative real estate.</p>

<p><a href="https://calisphere.org/item/9ded8f51877b0ac10f122ad5bd345c5f/">Source</a>: Robert Millikan with Cosmic X-Ray Equipment 1935</p>
<p>While Robert Millikan was not a founder of HBF, he <a href="https://archive.ph/B7VFr">joined the board in 1937</a> and played a key role in securing Gosney’s papers and HBF’s funds for Caltech. Before coming to Pasadena in 1921, Millikan helped establish the physics department at the University of Chicago, where he pursued <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1923/millikan/facts/">Nobel Prize-winning research</a> into the charge of electrons. During WWI he served as vice-chair of the National Research Council and coordinated applied research for defense purposes. At Caltech he investigated cosmic radiation and served as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-Millikan">board chair</a> from 1921-46, turning the school into one of the foremost applied research institutions in the nation.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2020 <a href="https://archive.ph/B7VFr">concerns were once again raised</a> about Millikan’s legacy with calls to remove his name from campus facilities. The Black Scientists and Engineers of Caltech issued a statement at the time, noting that of the 1,299 graduate students at the university, only 11 (.8%) were Black. This was not because there weren’t qualified PhD candidates, but rather that the school had chosen not to direct endowment support to the <a href="https://sfp.caltech.edu/undergraduate-research/programs/wavefellows">WAVE Fellows</a> program for underrepresented communities.</p>

<p><a href="https://oac.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb2t1nb146&amp;brand=oac4&amp;doc.view=entire_text">Paul Helie Perigord</a> was another Caltech affiliate who served on the board of HBF. He taught European History there from 1919 to 1924. Born in France and a WWI veteran, he taught ethics at the University of Wisconsin and later French Literature at UCLA. Active in international diplomacy, he participated in League of Nations activities in the early 1920s, touring the country at the request of President Wilson. He was also president of the International Labor Office and served as a delegate to the United Nations after WWII. In retirement he relocated to Haiti where he established an English newspaper, the Port-Au-Prince Times.</p>

<p><a href="http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/2820/1/albert.pdf">Albert Ruddock</a> came from a lumber family, served in the diplomatic corps in Berlin, Brussels, and Peking. In the 1920s he moved to California and got into the petroleum and banking sectors. He was a lifelong benefactor of Caltech and served on many community boards, including two Los Angeles hospitals. Ruddock was a member of many California social clubs, including the Bohemian Club in San Francisco where he <a href="http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/2820/1/albert.pdf">died of a heart attack</a> in 1970. He, too, was a member of HBF.</p>
<p>The Ruddock family acquired what they initially viewed as “worthless” copper mines in southeastern Utah in foreclosing proceedings. In the early 1950s the Atomic Energy Commission determined that lands held <a href="http://www.canyoncountryzephyr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/OCT-NOV16-20-21.pdf">uranium deposits</a>. They incorporated as the Cal Uranium Company and began removing ore in 1954. Albert’s son Merritt Ruddock helped manage the family’s mining investments and purchased <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/?clipping_id=67047562&amp;fcfToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVlLXZpZXctaWQiOjU5OTI0MTAzOSwiaWF0IjoxNjU2NzY4ODQxLCJleHAiOjE2NTY4NTUyNDF9.Bjwnrds7-NEDYo9xocAhbR0eVp4_-OH0HWCFUAbP3B0">Charlford Castle</a> and extensive ranch holdings, now known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee_Ranch">Cherokee Ranch</a>, in Sedalia, CO in 1954. Following their divorce, Merritt’s ex-wife retained the house, modeled on a fifteenth-century Scottish castle. <a href="https://thekeepcolorado.com/the-story-of-tweet-kimball/">Mildred Montague Genevieve “Tweet” Kimball</a>, an anglophile equestrian, hosted many distinguished guests including European royalty at the home.

In the 1920s he began to winter in Pasadena and Millikan arranged a salary for him to lecture on government at Caltech half time.

<p><a href="https://about.usc.edu/presidents/rufus-b-von-kleinsmid/">Rufus Von KleinSmid</a> co-founded the Human Betterment Society with Gosney. He was an education and psychology professor who led Arizona State University before moving on to the University of Southern California. As the fifth president of USC, he developed international relationships in the 1930s, including with Japan, and undertook a massive building campaign in the years after WWII.</p>
<p>Von KleinSmid advocated for sterilization of “defective” people and deprived Japanese American students who had attended USC before being placed in internment camps during the war of their transcripts. His name was <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-11/usc-removes-name-of-former-president-rufus-von-kleinsmid-a-supporter-of-eugenics-from-prominent-building">removed</a> from the school’s Center for International and Policy Affairs in 2020 after over a decade of intense advocacy by staff and students. In 1913 as the director of research at the Indiana Reformatory KleinSmid prepared a speech, “<a href="https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/bitstream/handle/1805/1150/von%20KleinSmit_%20Eugenics%20and%20the%20State.pdf?sequence=1">Eugenics and the State</a>,” delivered before the Cincinnati Academy of Medicine.</p>

<p>The following quotes are taken from that speech:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The average worth of the individual to the society is constantly lowered because of both the lack of productiveness among the worthy, and the fecundity of the defective.”</p>
<p>“It is fair to say that too much of the effort which these organizations (social workers) have put forth has done little more than to save to the state the defective classes, making it less and less likely that the rigors of climate and the prevalence of disease and other devastating conditions among which these people live may tend toward the survival of the fittest. We who are strong have borne the burdens of the weak, and the weak have repaid us by furnishing still greater burdens for us to bear.”</p>
<p>“Whatever steps may be taken to prevent the augmenting of the part of society’s membership which can never be other than a hindrance and a drag, must be taken with the consciousness that what is best for society must be acceptable to the individual.”</p>
<p>“It may not be practical nor wise to adopt the Greek plan of welcoming every babe in the world in the presence of an agent of the state, nor yet to expose on the mountainside those babes who furnish immediate evidence of their unfitness for life. On the other hand, there is little question that the physician here in reporting to the proper authorities the physical condition of newborn babes and in so far as continued observation is possible, the mental condition, can render and incalculable service to society.”</p>
<p>“Psychology is, as yet, a comparatively new science, but when the most searching observation and test will have been augmented and explained by anthropometric records, statistics in the field of heredity, experiments in paidology and pedagogy, and investigations in the fields of neurology, pathology and biochemistry, we shall have every reason to believe that the commonwealth will make no mistake in organizing its affairs and legislating its will upon the basis of the most scientific research that it can employ. Nay, more, it is wholly the privilege as well as the duty of the state to deny itself no opportunity or obligation that will assure its people life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness in ever increasing abundance.” <a href="https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/bitstream/handle/1805/1150/von%20KleinSmit_%20Eugenics%20and%20the%20State.pdf?sequence=1">Rufus Bernhard Von KleinSmid</a> 1913</p></blockquote>
<p>The quotes above candidly reveal the disdain held by those who controlled the resources for those deemed less-than, degenerate, not pulling their own weight. Those condemning included newspapermen, real estate speculators, conservationists, medical doctors, a media broadcaster, agriculturalists, ministers, and a rabbi.</p>

<p>It is this mental construct that was adopted by the Nazis who murdered hundreds of thousands of children and adults under the <a href="https://www.hmd.org.uk/learn-about-the-holocaust-and-genocides/nazi-persecution/disabled-people/">T4Programme</a> starting as early as 1939. Germany passed a law in 1933 that legalized sterilization of hundreds of thousands of people labeled physically or mentally impaired. This law was based on American precedent – the <a href="https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/buck-v-bell-1927">Buck vs Bell</a> Supreme Court case of 1927 that legitimized forced government sterilization. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Sterilization_Act_of_1924">Virginia Eugenical Sterilization Act</a> of was based on model&nbsp; legislation developed at the Cold Springs Harbor Eugenics Records Office by Harry Laughlin, a close associate of Ezra Gosney and Paul Popenhoe.</p>
<p>The systems of industrialized mass murder first used by the Nazis on the disabled were then scaled for deployment in forced labor prisons like Auschwitz-Birkenau. For a detailed look into the inter-generational impact of one woman’s murder after being institutionalized for a mental breakdown, see Andreas Heckler’s 2017 long-form essay for Disability Studies Quarterly, “<a href="https://dsq-sds.org/article/view/5573/4651">Diagnoses That Matter: My Great Grandmother’s Murder as One Deemed ‘Unworthy of Living’ and Its Impact on Our Family</a>.” The screenshot below is taken from that article. Emilie Rau fell into a depression after her husband, who had a harsh temper, was injured and became unable to support their family of four children. The institution into which her husband placed her severely limited visitation and would not release her to return home, stating that her condition was incurable. Her unwillingness to work led to her being of over 10,000 people identified for euthanasia in the gas chambers of <a href="https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/american-soldiers-uncover-medical-mass-murder-hadamar">Hadamar,</a> “house of shutters,” in the first years of the war.</p>

<p>The following selection is from the 2020 East Tennessee University graduate thesis of Cameron Williams, “<a href="https://dsq-sds.org/article/view/5573/4651">A Study of the United States’ Influence on German Eugenics</a>:”</p>
<blockquote><p>American eugenicists enjoyed a strong position in the international community and were admired by their European counterparts for their success in influencing legislation and gaining extensive financial support for the American eugenics’ movement. The German racial hygiene movement, in fact, followed developments in the United States closely. During the First World War the Society for Racial hygiene began to distribute a public flyer extolling the “dedication with which Americans sponsor research in the field of racial hygiene and with which they translate theoretical knowledge into practical.” The previously mentioned flyer was in reference to a donation of several million dollars by a widow of a railway magnate in support of Cold Spring Harbor. Also mentioned was the foundation established in 1915 following a eugenics conference held in Battle Creek, Michigan, which provided over three-hundred thousand dollars for conferences and exhibitions in the field of eugenics. The flyer also claimed that even American farmers believed that racial hygiene was the most important question of the century. It praised the funding of state commissions that attempted to awaken the nation to a eugenic centered consciousness. It applauded the control of immigration through legislation as well as laws in twelve states that regarded the prevention of procreation of “inferior families”.56 The Society for Racial Hygiene concluded that Americans recognized the “critical importance” of race improvement and were eager to adopt measures to further this goal.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you try on the lens that the latter half of the twentieth century, and now the twenty-first, has largely been about using manufactured scarcity, military R&amp;D, radiological exposure, re-engineered food, and poisoned ecosystems to advance the Oliver Reiser-Julius Stulman-Ervin Laszlo-Fritz Kunz World Brain agenda, you can see how the pre-WWII ethos of eugenics in the United States and abroad, wrapped in social progressivism, effectively set the stage for much of what has followed.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Winslow_Taylor">Frederick Winslow Taylor</a> could only dream of a future where flesh-bound, fallible humans were replaced by programmed avatars functioning with supreme efficiency, never getting tired, never asserting their own ideas, never asking for a raise. The video below is a site visit I made last summer to the SEPTA bus depot, which was the site of Midvale Steel where Taylor refined his principles in scientific management while working on Naval contracts for the Spanish American War. I read from John Trudell’s 1980 incredibly moving and prescient speech “<a href="https://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/trudellwearepower.html">We Are Power</a>.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>The eugenicist Von KleinSmid, USC administrator and Human Betterment Foundation member, oversaw the creation of the first film studies program in the nation. Cecille B. DeMille funded the photography classes and teaching partnerships with many early actors and directors in 1929. Fast forward seventy-five years, and we get the Institute for Creative Technologies at the University of Southern California, a testing laboratory for the creation of synthetic people.</p>
<p>USC ICT was birthed from a <a href="https://archive.ph/AxNim">1996 collaboration</a> of the Hollywood special effects industry and defense interests hosted by the National Research Council and chaired by Mike Zyda. In 1986, Zyda, a computer science professor at the Naval Post Graduate School in Monterrey, founded a special research group, NPSNET, to develop gaming simulation technology for the military including virtual world building and America’s Army Game. Other participants included <a href="https://archive.ph/I6xMN">Gilman Louie</a> who would go on to found Niantic and <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/349407-Alexander_Singer">Alexander Singer</a>, Star Trek producer who created a short film to demonstrate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIO7gN1lvjU">augmented cognition</a>.</p>

<p>Reflecting on my “Digital Babies” piece, what more perverse “solution” could engineers’ minds come up with than extinguishing the materiality of living tissue and re-rendering it in efficient computational formats? Nanotechnology is central to such an effort, and it was launched at Caltech. Richard Feynman introduced the concept of nanotechnology to the world with he “<a href="https://web.pa.msu.edu/people/yang/RFeynman_plentySpace.pdf">Plenty of Room at the Bottom</a>,” lecture given in December 1959 in Pasadena to the American Physical Society.</p>
<p>Feynman taught at Caltech from 1950 to 1988, winning the Nobel Prize in 1965 for discoveries in quantum electrodynamics relating to how subatomic particles interact with light. In 2018 there was a <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/remembering-richard-feynman-81875">celebration of his life</a> on what would have been his 100th birthday coordinated by the following divisions of the university involved in carrying forward his research: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1733907&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">Caltech Institute for Quantum Information and Matter;</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://burkeinstitute.caltech.edu/AboutTheInstitute">Walter Burke Institute for Theoretical Physics</a> (Burke was a financial advisor to Sherman Fairchild a major shareholder in IBM who increased his fortune from inventions in avionic photography and semiconductors); <a href="http://kni.caltech.edu/about">Kavli Nanoscience Institute</a> (operating since 2003 and developed origami DNA in 2006); and the <a href="https://www.moore.org/grant-detail?grantId=GBMF412">Nanoscale Systems Initiative</a> established in 2004 with a $25 million gift from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. Gordon created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore’s Law</a>, was co-founder of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Fairchild Semiconductor</a> and Intel, and <a href="https://www.medalofphilanthropy.org/betty-gordon-moore-moores-law-giving/">Betty</a> was an employee of the Ford Foundation.</p>
<p>Perhaps in the age of Huxley’s high-tech eugenics, water-based beings will be deemed too bulky for “interplanetary” (“inter-dimensional”) travel. Some days it feels like natural humans (and all other watery beings) are Pasadena’s plump, juicy citrus of the 1960s facing off against <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/lifestyle/how-nasa-made-tang-cool">TANG</a>. Suck out the water, crystallize vitality, toss in a few chemical additives, and store on a shelf for future use. Seriously, let’s not do this. I don’t want to go to “Mars” that badly.</p>

<p>The gamified <a href="https://www8.cao.go.jp/cstp/english/society5_0/index.html">Society 5.0</a> and <a href="https://www.jst.go.jp/moonshot/sympo/sympo2019/material/day2_wg1_doi_20191218.pdf">cyborg avatar capitalism</a> pitched in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_og-LVZlRnE">Tokyo</a> in December of 2019 originated in multi-national networks of electrical engineers, digital artists, and animatronic roboticists funded from bottomless defense contracts, tried out in amusement park rides and feature films. The people who work in these arenas are tasked with delivering ruthless anti-life efficiencies. Make it a game; spackle Star Wars “hero’s journey” branding over the rough edges; and wrap it in an aura of novelty and exclusivity. Then people will beat a path to your door to boost their children into a Flat Stanley world run by military psychologists dialing up custom realities with internet of everything quantum supercomputers.</p>
<p>Given that many of the eugenics programs centered mental and physical deficiencies that impacted the abilities of adults to participate in economically productive work, it’s not much of a stretch to envision a future where AI synthetic therapists pull panopticon data on individuals deemed at-risk of falling out of compliance with the consensus reality, assign them mental health diagnoses, and issue treatment orders for ICT reprogramming or containment. We can only hope there are no Hadamars this time around.</p>
<p>Our nation’s eugenics history has not disappeared. Some of the most sinister tendencies had gone underground. Some of them have been rebranded in socially acceptable terms. The fact that we rarely teach youth contextualized history means velvet glove brutality can hide in plain sight in the land of movie stars and militarized digital “magic.”</p>
<p>It is my contention before society acquiesces to incorporating biology and thought forms into cyber-physical systems, we must have a better understanding of the ways in which scientific management principles have been used over the past century to dehumanize and degrade labor. Against a backdrop of eugenics, are we willing to disrespect the bodies birthed by our mothers and trade them for cyborg puppet avatars with holographic capabilities?</p>
<p>Is that really the world we are leaving for the children, so California’s modern day eugenicists can bring Julian Huxley’s plans to fruition?</p>

<p>This week we hosted a panel of parents from across the country and across the pond to discuss school choice, the recent Supreme Court decision about using public funding for private schools, the planned future of “anytime-anywhere” competency-based lifelong learning on blockchain, and a global gig economy.</p>
<p>My friend Cliff left a lovely comment that I wanted to share. He’s a thoughtful mentor who has a lot of practical insights into how we can live fulfilling lives. You can catch his channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/cg3ly/videos">here</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I can’t say enough about how much I enjoyed this conversation. To see such lovely women, mothers, activists, teachers and parents engaged in understanding and clarifying this content was a joy. I’m holding you all in a prayer of encouragement and support.  Blockchain and tokens are all based in your history, in the past. It’s a record of what was and it’s a permanent record. You ARE your history in that system, and so people won’t live into an open future, but instead in a tense present moment in service to your record, your past.  All your mistakes, your social sins, your transgressions from the pathways you were told to follow will haunt your future possibilities. It is behavioral training at a deep psychological level such that you remain concerned with reeling out a history that will assure your future. That may seem normal or even acceptable, but it’s a conditioned stance in service of a militarized gambling financial market.  You’re not free to hold your past as useful experiences in service of your growth when it’s a permanent record with an assigned value proscribed by artificial intelligence in the service of a global empire.</p>
<p>The dead artificial intelligence they intend to rule over the living, and that they’re selling as a good way to go, is representative of an idea in mind. That idea exists now in the landscape of mind as what it is, a dead thing with no life on its own, as something that only pretends to a semblance of being alive through the domination and control of the living. If life is the reflective surface of ideas in mind, or what ideas look like on the surface that we call the world, then while it’s important that we take a stand here in biology and say I don’t consent to these control mechanisms being rolled out in the world, we must also take a stand in our hearts and minds. You can say to life itself, of which you are a known, loved, and valued member, that you don’t consent.</p>
<p>This thing they’re making may listen in on every interaction you have one day, but life itself has and always will listen to you, to its own beloved life expressed as you, and so you’re one of the voices of life itself. Spiritually we can speak into the connective relationship we posses to life itself and say what’s truly in our hearts and minds, in much the same way you all have to each other in this video. I feel like that a pathway of communication holds out to us the power to move the world in ways that arguing with or about the beast and its reflection in AI never will.</p>
<p>It doesn’t care what you think about it, but life does. We do. Speak from the life you are to the living world as it is expressed in biology as birds, rivers, and people and discover how profoundly supported you really are. People are sometimes hard to reach, because they’re listening is clouded, but life itself is always listening and will help you to reach them. Call life itself to your side; wrap yourself in its truth, which you are, and cloaked in majesty your voice will find a way.” Cliff Gomes</p>

This is because the primitives used in Advanced Staking will be key to designing and building Panther’s Multi-Asset Shielded Pools.</p><p>Zafari, our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testing-for-zkp-advanced-staking-is-now-live-19b51bc6b42b/">incentivized testing program</a>, continues to provide invaluable feedback for our upcoming Advanced Staking program.</p><p>In addition to last month’s findings, testers managed to catch a few urgent and high-priority bugs, as well as other lower-priority items throughout. While feedback has now slowed down as the system has already been thoroughly explored, we haven’t. Our team is hard at work fixing the last batch of bugs, and we will soon be able to swiftly roll out Advanced Staking on Polygon.</p> DeFi integration <p>While Advanced Staking progresses, we have successfully finished the first proof-of-concept of a DeFi integration. Through it, users can utilize Panther to access DeFi privately, interacting with protocols in a way very similar to what they’re used to.</p><p>The importance of a DeFi-compatible privacy solution cannot be overstated! Enabling the Multi-Asset Shielded Pools to augment DeFi as a whole with privacy lays the foundation for bringing trust to DeFi via Panther’s flexible disclosure capabilities.</p><p>More news on this, pronto.</p> Community and business development  Released our one-pager <p>As builders of a pioneering blockchain privacy protocol, we are tasked with introducing people not only to the need for privacy, but to its solution as well. Since this happens almost on a daily basis, we decided to create the most digestible (but still thorough!) explanation of Panther to this day.</p><p>We’ve redesigned the <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.pdf">Panther One-Pager</a>. It contains all the central points to grasp why PriFi is deeply necessary and how Panther is the perfect solution for enabling it, within a single standard sheet of paper!</p> New Panther Blog &amp; Panther Academy <p>The <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/">Panther Blog</a> went through a complete UX redesign. We’ve organized content by categories, removed cluttering elements from its interface, and added a dark mode, in addition to many other noticeable improvements. The Panther Blog is now easier to navigate and friendlier than ever! Our re-vamp also touched on technical aspects that make our blog easier to find through search engines and news feeds. All our precious existing content is still available with the same URLs for you to share.</p><p>Part of the reason to put in the effort and redesign our blog came from our plans to launch a valuable initiative from Panther for the crypto community: The <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/tag/academy/">Panther Academy</a>. Our goal with the Academy is to improve accessibility to high-quality crypto education, even for subjects that could be considered basic by our audience of mainly hardcore privacy enthusiasts. Those interested in diving deeper into crypto, DeFi, and privacy can now come and learn about these subjects from us.</p><p>Our first Panther Academy article is already out and tackles <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bitcoin-tumblers-privacy-coins-and-prifi-private-crypto/">private crypto transactions</a>. Don’t forget to give it a read and share it with your privacy-curious friends!</p> Unofficial local language Twitter accounts <p>Panther Ambassadors have been doing a more than impressive job at spreading the Panther Gospel to non-English-speaking countries. We now have three unofficial Twitter accounts; in <a href="http://twitter.com/zkpantherES">Español</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/zkpantherTR">Türkçe</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/zkpantherFR">Français</a>! </p><p>Here’s to all of our amazing ambassadors.</p> 12k followers in CMC Gravity <p>In order to kickstart our <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/gravity/profile/PantherProtocol">CoinMarketCap Gravity</a> following, we hosted a <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther/status/1533888810991370240">giveaway</a> offering a $2500 $ZKP prize pool. Three weeks later, we can say with no doubt that it was a success.</p><p>Panther has attained the number one spot in engagement growth in CoinMarketCap’s blogging platform! That’s a pretty good reason to celebrate, don’t you think?</p><p>Panther’s CMC Gravity account now has over 12,000 followers, growing by almost a thousand daily. If you’re not among them, you know what to do: <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/gravity/profile/PantherProtocol">follow us now</a>!</p> zTalks #2 <p>The second episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mXHeo2FvUQ">Panther zTalks</a> touched on multiple intriguing subjects: </p>  The role of cryptography experts in Panther  Why we <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-joins-zprize-and-industry-leaders-to-further-the-zero-knowledge-industry-391a494a58d6/">foster the zero-knowledge field</a>  How significant is Advanced Staking in Panther’s roadmap  <p>… and so much more.</p><p>Our Senior Architect, Adam Spiers, was a new addition to our team members’ panel for this episode. Show it some love, and remember to subscribe to our Youtube account!</p> Events  Oliver and Mike in Consensus 2022 <p>Our Co-Founder and CEO Oliver Gale and Mike Chan, Head of Marketing, were present at <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus2022/">Consensus 2022</a>, the largest crypto and blockchain event worldwide. The conference hosting 500+ speakers from within and outside the cryptosphere took place in Austin, Texas, from June 9th to 12th.</p><p>Lots of partnerships talks, great panels about privacy, and walking around in Panther swag ensued.</p>Oliver and Mike in full Panther style. Anish and Saif at NFT NYC <p>On <a href="http://www.nft.nyc/">NFT NYC</a>’s 4th edition, Panther was well-represented by two heavy hitters of our tech team: Anish Mohammed, our Co-Founder, CTO, and Chief Scientist, and Saif Akhtar, our Head of Product. The conference featured 1500 speakers and over 14k attendees. </p><p>Why are we attending NFT conferences, you might be asking? Well, because privacy for NFTs is definitely necessary, creating a fertile land for Panther to explore.</p><p>To learn why, check out this great <a href="https://twitter.com/OriginalOlii/status/1540106469013610503">thread</a> by CEO Oliver Gale.</p> Features &amp; Media  Anish AMA with Bittrex &amp; interview on XT Cast <p>Bittrex was one of our first exchange partners to list $ZKP. They invited our CTO Anish for an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pz2LnHGn3Wk">AMA on Panther</a>, where he elaborated on Panther’s goals, development, and our approach to decentralization, among other very relevant aspects. Make sure to check it out!</p><p>Anish was also invited as a guest in the brand-new <a href="https://youtu.be/onqbP1Dh7EI">XT Cast</a>, specifically tackling how Panther is enabling privacy and trust through $ZKP.</p> Anish’s lecture at Cerberus Capital Management <p>Cerberus Capital Management, a leading global firm in alternative investing with around $60 billion in managed assets, invited our CTO on June 30th for a keystone lecture on “The Future of DeFi – Beyond the Crash”.</p> Oliver on Yahoo! Finance <p>As of late, crypto has become <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/the-ultimate-irony-thoughts-on-the-state-of-our-markets-1de4a5c8bec3/">increasingly correlated</a> with the stock market’s movements. These, in turn, are undeniably linked to interest rates set by the Federal Reserve. Yahoo! Finance’s article on <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/impact-did-fed-interest-rate-152256883.html">the impact of the interest rate hikes on crypto</a> counted on the expert opinion of none other than Oliver Gale, our Co-Founder and CEO. In his thought-provoking words:</p><blockquote>“Cryptoassets are experiencing the fastest growth of any technology industry in history – almost twice the pace at which the internet was adopted in the 1990s. Despite a bump in the road here, this trend is still intact and will resume in the next year or two. For now, we have to bide our time until inflation is brought down.”</blockquote><p>Worth a read!</p> Hirings <p>This month, we hired new Panthers for the following positions:</p>  Head of Compliance  Content Writer &amp; Social Media Manager  Head of Community  <p>Several roles remain open on our <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol">Angel.co page</a>:</p>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2172598-graphic-designer">Graphic Designer</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2204245-applied-mathematician">Applied Mathematician</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2221049-blockchain-architect">Blockchain Architect</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2204246-cryptographic-engineer">Cryptographic Engineer</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2142601-cryptography-internship">Cryptography Internship</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2221050-cryptography-researcher-zero-knowledge-proofs">Cryptography Researcher (Zero-Knowledge Proofs)</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2227585-full-stack-developer">Full-Stack Developer</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2227586-lead-front-end-developer">Lead Front-end Developer</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2109231-machine-learning-internship">Machine Learning Internship</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2227587-senior-solidity-developer">Senior Solidity Developer</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2198464-defi-research-analyst">DeFi Research Analyst</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2009427-product-marketing-intern">Product Marketing Intern</a>  <p>If you wish to work with us or know someone who might be a good fit, please apply right away!</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

<p>Findora made a <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation/navigating-nft-nyc-with-findora-727a1c06cbc3">good showing</a> at NFT NYC and ETHNewYork this year. We had the privilege to talk to many exciting and innovative projects, and we’re looking forward to partnering with them going&nbsp;forward.</p><p>The City That Never Sleeps always leaves you with a lot to look back on, but here are our main takeaways:</p> Forecast Calls for&nbsp;SBTs <p><a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html">Soulbound tokens</a>, or non-transferrable NFTs, look like they will be a big part of the NFT space going forward. They were certainly a hot topic among attendees at NFT&nbsp;NYC.</p><p>SBTs have many use cases because there are many financial applications in TradFi that aren’t transferable e.g. credit card numbers and bank accounts. SBTs mimick that&nbsp;utility.</p><p>SBTs may also play a huge role in identity verification. However, to safely do so, users will need to be able to selectively disclose only some information while keeping other data shielded. Users won’t want to reveal everything about themselves every time the token is used. Currently, there are no privacy solutions for SBTs, but the kind of selective disclosure they require is exactly what Findora can&nbsp;provide.</p> NFTs are Finding Their&nbsp;Utility <p>Apes, Lions, and Goblins are great…but we’re getting hyped&nbsp;out.</p><p>There were a lot of projects focusing on the less sexy applications of NFT technology like licensing. Other examples&nbsp;include:</p>  Ticket verification  Wallet verification  Linking real assets to NFTs e.g. real estate, supercars, trading cards,&nbsp;etc.  <p><a href="https://tokenproof.xyz/">Tokenproof</a>, <a href="https://0xmoon.io/">0xmoon.io</a>, and <a href="https://www.chainpass.xyz/">Chainpass</a> are good examples of projects working hard to make NFTs useful as passes at&nbsp;events.</p><p>There is a lot of creativity and imagination in the space as projects race to be the first to implement a new NFT use&nbsp;case.</p><p>NFTs are evolving from shiny collections to real-world applications; it’s a sign of the space maturing. We’re excited to see how NFTs will evolve and how they can change the day-to-day lives of people around the&nbsp;world.</p> ZK Privacy Is Getting More&nbsp;Popular <p>There were other zero-knowledge projects present, and while they may not be as far along as Findora is, their presence signals a general interest in ZK technology and privacy for NFTs. It’s increasingly recognized that privacy is a necessary feature of any financial or blockchain system, and there was a lot of interest in Findora&nbsp;events.</p><p>Despite short notice, our ZK-Bistro event was a huge success. We were able to meet many exciting teams looking to integrate ZK technology into their projects and who were interested in the Findora Foundation <a href="https://www.findora.foundation/">grant program</a>. We’re excited for the partnerships that will come out of&nbsp;it.</p><p>Warren Paul Anderson, CEO of Discreet Labs, gave a talk on the importance of privacy noting that privacy doesn’t not equal secrecy. Secrecy means never revealing information. Privacy implies you want to reveal information — but only to those who need to&nbsp;know.</p><p>He observed that major brands like Apple are launching campaigns to promote privacy and that Satoshi Nakamoto, whoever or whatever he is, most likely wanted bitcoin to be private but didn’t have the technological ability to accomplish it.</p><p>But with the introduction of zero-knowledge proofs, on-chain privacy on public ledgers is possible.</p>Warren Paul Anderson giving a talk on privacy at NYC&nbsp;NFT<p>A number of projects came up to him after his talk to understand how they could integrate Findora’s privacy tech for things like private payroll and protecting simple payments.</p> “Wen Regulatory Clarity?” <p>There was a lot of talk about future securities regulations and how to prepare for them. L1s, like Findora, will need to self-regulate and make it clear to users and regulators what their tokens are&nbsp;for.</p><p>They’ll also need to make sure user data and IDs are protected.</p><p>Smart contractors will likely be licensed the same way building contractors or insurance agents are licensed now. There will be some sort of licensing board that allows teams to go from project to project writing smart contracts.</p> Teams Need Better Documentation <p>Deploying NFTs isn’t necessarily complicated, but that doesn’t make it easy. There were a number of issues during the ETHNewYork Hackathon that showed basic documentation is still needed when talented teams couldn’t fix&nbsp;bugs.</p><p>Projects need to make sure their documentation is in order and easy to&nbsp;follow.</p><p>Findora has some of the best documentation in the Zk space (you can find our NFT documentation <a href="http://wiki.findora.org/docs/developers/evm/Mint%20NFTs/p1_deploy_nft/">here</a>) but it can always be better. Please feel free to join our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/aPuyZd8mBJ">Discord</a> and make suggestions on how we can improve in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>We got a lot of feedback on what hackers want at a hackathon and hacker house and we have some exciting plans in the works for the next crypto convention!</p> Looking Ahead <p>NFTs will be a big part of the future and the space in 5 years won’t look anything like it does today. But no one really can predict the future…that’s a big takeaway from 2022 in&nbsp;general.</p><p>One of our biggest takeaways is that energy is still high even if markets are low. Many projects are exploring NFT use cases and building solutions. They’re looking ahead, not looking&nbsp;back.</p><p>Projects are working to integrate NFTs into the legal system and onboard them with institutions. Coding is the easy part; projects are now solving for the human factor, starting the long, hard process of adoption.</p><p>Privacy will be a big part of that adoption process because it is an essential function that institutions and individuals require. We’re excited to keep building in the space with teams from all around the&nbsp;world.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation/findoras-takeaways-from-nftnyc-2022-2a8ff34b5d48">Findora’s Takeaways from NFTNYC 2022</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation">Findora Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Caltech-Archives-Eugenics.pdf">Human Betterment Foundation</a> was the West Coast affiliate of the Cold Springs Harbor <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/archives/institutional-collections/eugenics-record-office/">Eugenics Record Office</a> and operated in Pasadena, CA between 1929 and 1942. Pasadena is located about fifteen miles east of California Senate <a href="https://sd18.senate.ca.gov/district">District 18</a>, Robert Hertzberg’s district. The city was settled in the 1870s by Indiana residents, some of whom had respiratory illness and were looking for a milder climate. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe brought winter visitors, giant hotels, and development of citrus groves and real estate. When the Indiana contingent who had relocated to the area decided to incorporate the new town in order to exclude alcoholic beverages, they chose an eastern name rather than one of the Tongva, the original inhabitants. Pasadena is roughly translated as “valley” in <a href="https://www.cityofpasadena.net/about-pasadena/#:~:text=Name,in%20the%20official%20city%20seal.">Ojibwe</a>. Below is a historic view of the 1927 Mediterranean revival Pasadena City Hall set against the backdrop of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Gabriel_Mountains">San Gabriel Mountains</a>.</p>

<p>Pasadena is home to the California Institute of Technology, a private research endeavor devoted to the study of pure and applied science, often for military purposes. The school began as Throop University in 1891. Forty-five Caltech alumni or staff have received <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/about/legacy/awards-and-honors/nobel-laureates">Nobel Prizes</a> in the areas of physics, chemistry, medicine / physiology, economics, and peace (Linus Pauling).</p>
<p>During WWII, Vannevar Bush tasked Danish physicist <a href="https://calteches.library.caltech.edu/2734/1/kellogg.pdf">Charles Lauritsen</a> who had been working on high energy X-Rays at Caltech’s radiation lab funded by the <a href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/john-harvey-kellogg">eugenicist Kellogg</a> family to coordinate with Robert Oppenheimer, a former colleague, on mass production of explosive lenses and detonators for the atomic weapons program. This effort was part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Camel">Project Camel</a> and required the construction of eighty buildings in the desert at China Lake in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Wells_Pilot_Plant">Salt Wells Valley</a>.</p>
<p>That area comprises the Naval Air Weapons Station on the lands of the <a href="https://www.desertusa.com/desert-activity/desert-artists.html">Coso people.</a> It is the Navy’s largest land holding. The area, which has very <a href="https://www.desertusa.com/desert-activity/cosos-petroglyphs.html">restricted access</a>, holds the highest concentration of <a href="https://www.bradshawfoundation.com/coso/">petroglyphs</a> in North America as well as sacred volcanic hot springs <a href="https://www.ncai.org/resources/resolutions/ncai-support-for-return-of-coso-hot-springs-district-a-sacred-place-to-local-area-tribes">currently being mined by the military</a> for geothermal energy. The tribe has asked that the Coso Hot Springs District, a <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Naval_Air_Weapons_Station_China_Lake_Pro/CfQ3AQAAMAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=coso+hot+springs+district+national+historic+landmark&amp;pg=SA2-PA25&amp;printsec=frontcover">National Historic Landmark</a>, be returned to them and <a href="https://www.ncai.org/attachments/Resolution_JTnDYSxwnPhalfPnzcaOpnbqqGRtYxXvTLZwmEZynCHyYwaGoMj_SAC-12-007.pdf">put back under tribal care</a>. There is a lot of speculation regarding possible mind control experimentation at China Lake, for which I personally have no direct proof. It is interesting to note, however, that <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/hearings/95mkultra.pdf">Sidney Gottlieb</a> who ran MK Ultra earned his PhD at Caltech in <a href="https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/10023/">1943</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://prabook.com/web/arthur.fleming/3759164">Arthur Henry Fleming’s</a> substantial financial contributions enabled the regional vocational school to grow into an institution that has been on the vanguard of scientific, especially physics, research, for over a century. Born in Ontario, Fleming married into the Fowler family after settling in Detroit. His father-in-law held a large portfolio of mineral and timber assets that Fleming, a lawyer, helped manage. The couple relocated to Pasadena for his wife’s health and became heavily involved in civic affairs.</p>
<p>The Flemings’ transfer of the entirety of their estate to the school in 1920 was leveraged by <a href="http://nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/hale-george-ellery.pdf">Chicago-born astro-physicist</a> <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/celebrating-caltechs-founder-and-builder-large-telescopes-82669">George Ellery Hale</a>, project director for the Mount Wilson Observatory, to recruit MIT chemist Arthur Noyes and University of Chicago physicist Robert Millikan to Pasadena.</p>
<p>Among Fleming’s holdings that passed to the school was a <a href="https://campuspubs.library.caltech.edu/2435/1/1991_04_25_02.pdf">grove of ancient sequoias</a> that the Forest Service sought to acquire in the 1920s. That offer was turned down, in part on the recommendation of George S. Patton, Pasadena’s first City Attorney, San Gabriel Valley landholder, and father of the WWII general. For fifty years Caltech did little to manage this acreage located in the Sierra National Forest. In 1991 a <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/visiting-caltechs-sequoia-country-1801">centennial grove</a> naming ceremony was held to honor five of the school’s “pioneers:” Throop, Hale, Fleming, Noyes, and Millikan. The Railroad Fire devastated the area in the fall of 2017 and likely killed the Millikan tree.</p>

<p>I see industries of extraction and eugenics as being interrelated as both exemplify human attempts to dominate nature and undermine sacred energies through the hubris of imposed scientific management. Orson Scott Card’s <a href="https://enderverse.fandom.com/wiki/Enderverse">Ender Quintet</a> influenced my thinking in this regard – particularly the role of the Pequinino tree mothers and their relationship to Jane, the sentient AI described in “<a href="https://enderverse.fandom.com/wiki/Children_of_the_Mind">Children of the Mind</a>.” Card, the great-great grandson of <a href="https://www.mormonwiki.com/Orson_Scott_Card">Brigham Young</a>, seems to have <a href="http://gnostic-unrest.blogspot.com/2010/02/orson-scott-cards-philotic-twining.html">interesting insights</a> into what he called “<a href="https://enderverse.fandom.com/wiki/Philote">philotic</a>” twining that correspond to recent scientific investigations into the use of nanotechnology to discern forms of communication within fungal networks.</p>

<p>During the Depression, California, researchers were much more interested in the exploring the heavens than the microbial communities of forest soils. Rocketry was a big deal, and Caltech counted itself among an elite group of universities trying to develop the technology that would enable the United States to dominate the skies through avionics, aeronautics, and astronomy. The Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory and California Institute of Technology was established in <a href="https://galcit.caltech.edu/about/history">1928</a> with funds from Daniel Guggenheim’s foundation, sponsor of Lindbergh’s Spirit of St. Louis flight and benefactor of early aeronautics programs at NYU, Stanford, MIT, Harvard, Syracuse, University of Michigan, University of Georgia, and Northwestern.</p>
<p>In the 1920s, the Swiss-born Guggenheims held railroad stocks, controlled many global mining and smelting enterprises, and dabbled in a variety of international companies. <a href="https://www.learningtogive.org/resources/guggenheim-family">Meyer Guggenheim</a>‘s eight children comprised the second wealthiest family in the US. Three brothers became notable philanthropists: Daniel funded aviation; Solomon acquired modern art; and Simon funded the Colorado School of Mines.</p>

<p>Below is a portion of a larger map I created to explore bio-tech and education in Texas. The focal point is Texas native of Czech descent <a href="https://oralhistories.library.caltech.edu/149/1/Malina.pdf">Frank Malina.</a> Malina obtained a PhD from Caltech studying under Theodore von Karman, Hungarian physicist and descendent of <a href="https://www.nli.org.il/en/newspapers/cgs/1965/04/22/01/article/59/?e=-------en-20--1--img-txIN%7ctxTI--------------1">Rabbi Judah Loew</a> known for creating the <a href="https://www.commentary.org/articles/gershom-scholem/the-golem-of-prague-the-golem-of-rehovoth/">Golem of Prague</a>. After graduating, Frank taught aeronautics at Caltech while working on solid-state fuel research.</p>
<p>After a few harrowing experiments in the lab, Von Karman asked Malina and the graduate students working on the rockets to move off campus. Thus, if we are to believe the story, the Jet Propulsion Lab was born in Arroyo Secco. Seven men attempted, <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/timeline/">with limited success</a>, to launch their first rocket on Halloween 1936. In this mix was Ed Forman and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/miller/bfm07.htm">Jack Parsons</a>, an Ordo Templi Orientis <a href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/archivos_pdf/babalon-working-1946.pdf">occultist</a> who met an early demise.</p>

<p>During WWII, Malina conducted work in the area of guided missile systems. He tested the first WAC (Without Altitude Control) Corporal Rocket at White Sands in New Mexico less than two weeks after Truman’s announcement of Japan’s surrender on September 2, 1945. The following year Malina left his post at the university, ostensibly due to concerns over the direction the field of rocket research was taking. My current assessment of the situation is that after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki a dialectical framework was established where scientists for “peace” became a counterpoint to scientists like Ed Teller who asserted the need for full development of nuclear technology for war.</p>
<p>Ironically it would be the scientists, both East and West, who aligned with “peace,” whose globalist mindset would enable construction of an atmospheric space fence to manage life on the planet through <a href="https://futurecomresearch.eu/previous/2017/site_pres/K/IAN_Akyildiz.pdf">Internet of Bio-Nano Things</a> “track and trace” digital twin geo-fencing. It is these “peacemakers” advancing radiation for energy and medicine and non-military space “development” who substantially advanced Oliver Reiser and Julian Huxley’s goal of radio-eugenics, Human 2.0.</p>
<p>The final war to end all wars was meant to be a silent war against natural life deployed through strategic use of atmospheric frequency weapons and neural entrainment. Citizens of the Earth were supposed to unquestioningly embrace the new bio-digital social paradigm as being for the common good, to save the planet. In retrospect, those like Teller who uplifted bombings of remote islands with no regard to the implications of fall out, played a vital, yet secondary role in advancing the disarmament conversation that would transition humanity to a new harmonization phase.</p>
<p>For Frank, the heating up of Cold War antagonisms and shift in leadership of the rocket research to Operation Paperclip imports like <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/why-us-government-brought-nazi-scientists-america-after-world-war-ii-180961110/">Wernher von Braun </a>provided him with a good excuse to depart Pasadena and bring his research and networking skills to a global stage.</p>

<p>Malina relocated to Europe where Julian Huxley sought him out and appointed him Deputy Director of Science of <a href="https://www.un.org/youthenvoy/2013/08/unesco-united-nations-educational-scientific-and-cultural-organization/#:~:text=The%20United%20Nations%20Educational%2C%20Scientific,decisions%20of%20these%20two%20bodies.">UNESCO.</a>&nbsp; It was established with the United Nations in 1945 to advance a culture of peace and eradicate poverty through cross-cultural education and scientific outreach. Malina worked from 1946 to 1953 on environmental studies of the <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000153766?posInSet=6&amp;queryId=2d1044cb-a42e-42b7-b5c4-1312ee187eec">Hylean Amazon</a> and the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342218953_Climate_as_resource_and_challenge_international_cooperation_in_the_UNESCO_Arid_Zone_Programme">Arid Zone Programme</a> in North Africa / the Negev, today a center of <a href="https://www.israel21c.org/building-a-nano-future-in-the-negev/">nano-tech research</a> and nano-enabled water desalinization.</p>
<p><a href="https://leonardo.info/about-marjorie-malina">Majorie Duckworth</a>, a former Captain in the Women’s Auxilary Corps and daughter of a British textile manufacturer, was working in UNESCO’s personnel department. She and Frank married in 1949. Frank and his first wife, abstract painter Liljan Darcourt, had divorced in <a href="https://snaccooperative.org/view/70689227">1947</a>. Frank and Majorie Malina’s younger son <a href="http://archive.olats.org/africa/participants/malina_alain.shtml">Alan</a> would become a water engineer for the World Bank. Interesting, and somewhat odd, family conversation with brother Roger touching on local characteristics of water and homeopathy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv4f-X17yE8">here</a>.</p>
<p>After he left UNESCO, Frank’s Aerojet dividends supported the family as he experimented with <a href="http://archive.olats.org/pionniers/malina/arts/lumidyneSystem.php">lumidyne artwork,</a>&nbsp;illuminated kinetic mixed-media pieces. Among Malina’s most ambitious works was “<a href="https://www.patrickmccray.com/leaping-robot/2015/09/20/frank-malinas-cosmos">Cosmos</a>,” installed in the lobby of Robert Maxwell’s Pergamon Press.</p>
<p>Frank’s son Roger later married Maxwell’s daughter Christine, yes – Ghislaine’s sister.

<p>Huxley, Malina’s superior at UNESCO, was a biologist who embraced the idea of <a href="https://www.theosophical.org/publications/quest-magazine/4830-the-priest-and-the-biologist">evolutionary humanism</a>, the belief that the human species was destined for some more transcendent future. Huxley and Teilhard de Chardin, Jesuit paleontologist who advanced the concept of the Noosphere, <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/If_I_Am_To_Be_Remembered_Correspondence/xrLsCgAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=edmond-blanc+unesco&amp;pg=PT95&amp;printsec=frontcover">connected</a> in 1946 upon de Chardin’s return to Paris from China. They maintained a decade’s long correspondence, and Julian wrote a forward to de Chardin’s “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phenomenon_of_Man">The Phenomenon of Man</a>.” The book was posthumously-published in 1955. In 1959 Huxley <a href="https://carihovanec.com/litsci/people.php?person=23">assumed the presidency</a> of the <a href="https://eugenicsarchive.ca/discover/tree/5233e5175c2ec500000000e1">British Eugenics Society</a>. He had served as vice president between 1937 and 1944.</p>
<p>Paul Weindling’s 2012 paper for The Journal of Modern European History, “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4366572/">Julian Huxley and the Continuity of Eugenics in Twentieth-Century Britain</a>,” speaks to the ways in which Huxley’s evolving public relations strategies melded his scientific grounding in biological determinism with assertions of human rights for all.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4366572/">Source</a>: Julian Huxley and the Continuity of Eugenics in Twentieth-Century Britain</p>
<p>Huxley wrote in his 1946 “<a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000068197">UNESCO Its Purpose and Philosophy</a>” that the organization’s mission was to advance global scientific humanism. He imagined that by unleashing new scientific tools, the atomic age would bring about significant and rapid advances in human evolution.</p>
<p>The social sciences would be deployed to document existing cultures, including those deemed by UNESCO to be backwards and in the dark. They would utilize scientific education, psychology, art, and mass media to move people away from nationalist identities toward a one world government mindset under the banner of global peace. Spiritual practice, mystical experience, and even parapsychology would be studied and incorporated into the scientific regime so as not to become a distraction. Huxley clearly states that what he is proposing is eugenics; that in this planned future “mental defectives” and the “insane” would not have educational opportunities or equal treatment under the law. He asserts his desire to cultivate genetic variety for this imagined one world culture, positioning himself as anti-racist. The best specimens of each type would be cultivated with the “weaklings, fools, and moral deficients” weeded out so as to not impede the imperative of turbo-charged evolutionary progress. No tolerance for dissent in their new normal.</p>

<p><a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/UNESCO-Its-Purpose-and-Its-Philosophy-Julian-Huxley-1946.pdf">Source</a>: UNESCO – Its Purpose and Its Philosophy</p>
<p>UNESCO’s cultivation effort, as with livestock, required determination of good and bad traits followed by identification of these traits in the world’s population. Huxley’s treatise asserts the need to develop tools, psychometrics, to sort people for appropriate roles in society – cognitive ability, temperament, aptitudes, and weakness. To my twenty-first century eyes, this seems like the perfect use case for the meta-data tags Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaER344dhhU">describes</a> for the Ethiopia digital identity pilot where from toddlerhood people will be monitored to see whose interests are aligned with the government, and who is worthy of having a job.</p>
<p>Scientific education is a primary aim of UNESCO. In this misguided scenario, the premise of lifelong digital tutors&nbsp; meting out nudges to generate the compliance SBTs (Soulbound Tokens) needed to build out digital twins for ongoing cybernetic simulations makes perfect sense. In NATO’s mixed reality video game “womb to tomb” cybernetic pathways for work and self-improvement will substitute for authentic, unscripted life.</p>
<p>I created a long thread of tweet “notes” on Huxley’s sixty-page document. You can scroll through and get a sense of the domination mentality embedded in his Fabian socialist mindset now melding with techno-Libertarian paternalism in cyber-physical “smart” environments. Seventy-five years later, the petty bureaucrats are on the verge of evolving into artificial intelligence avatars analyzing real-time sensor data. My UNESCO Twitter thread can be read <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1542277277957881858.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>After leaving UNESCO, Frank Malina assisted his old mentor Theodor von Karman with setting up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Academy_of_Astronautics">International Academy of Astronautics</a> founded in Stockholm in 1960. The organization holds dozens of conferences annually, puts out many publications, and fosters international collaboration. Malina continued to run it after von Karman’s death and indeed <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/air-space-magazine/how-suicide-squad-became-one-worlds-first-rocket-companies-180962548/">Aerojet</a> Rocketdyne is still listed as one of the organization’s <a href="https://iaaspace.org/">major supporters</a>. For twenty years he split his time between “peaceful” space advocacy and avant-garde art production. During the Cold War the IAA worked with scientists around the world regardless of their nation of origin towards the non-militarized development of space. As with the<a href="https://pugwash.org/history/"> Pugwash Conferences</a>, forums were created for top scientists and policy makers to coordinate their strategies towards post-humanism even as manufactured polarities and fear ruled the lives of everyday people.</p>
<p>An enormous six-hundred+ page retrospective of UNESCO’s science program reveals the trajectory by which biophysics grabbed the reigns of the biosphere. Featured topics include: post-war international laboratories; the International Computing Center; the creation of CERN; the International Geophysical Year; the International Brain Research Organization; the International Cell Research Organization; the International Centre for Theoretical Physics; the Intergovernmental Bureau of Informatics; the World Solar Summit; the International Biosciences Network; The Science education and vocational training; Programme on Human Genome; Biotechnology Action Council; Conference on the Applications of Science and Technology to Development (CAST); Man and the Biosphere Programme; the International Hydrological Programme; Biosphere Reserve Integrated Monitoring; the International Geoscience Programme; UNESCO and outer space; valorizing traditional ecological knowledge; and integrated approaches for sustainability.</p>
<p>So, if you’re thinking that somehow the social changes wrought over the past five years from Greta to lockdowns and digital identity came out of nowhere; they didn’t. This is the nuts and bolts of the World Brain campaign, and it was carried out by tens of thousands of smart, thoughtful people over seven decades or more. Most of them were <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Internationalism_in_the_Age_of_Nationali/f2cUBAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22doctor+huxley%27s+wonderful+zoo%22&amp;pg=PA105&amp;printsec=frontcover">just doing their jobs</a> thinking they were making the world a better place. I wonder how many realize the fruits of their labor will the world run by a <a href="http://www.robothalloffame.org/inductees/03inductees/hal.html">HAL 9000</a> DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) if we don’t turn things around soon.</p>

<p>In retrospect, we see how assertions for “peaceful” space development provided a much-needed counterpoint to Cold War militarization. The Malina / von Karman / IAA narrative allowed the networked satellite-infrastructure that is coming into its own right now to be positioned as a helpful tool of global harmonization helping humanity address anticipated climate catastrophe and over-population. We are meant to view cybernetic DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) “peacekeeping” as an acceptable form of scientific governance. We’re not to entertain the thought that we are actually in&nbsp; frequency war, a radio-eugenics war on natural systems.</p>
<p>No, Huxley taught us that our fate is to experience an evolutionary upgrade that will managed by an elite class on behalf of the backwards, unwashed masses.</p>

<p></p><p>Web 5 is a decentralized platform that provides a new identity layer for the web to enable decentralized apps and protocols.</p><p>In the current web model, users do not own their data or identity. They are given accounts by companies and their data is held captive in app silos. To create a new class of decentralized apps and protocols that put individuals at the center, we must empower them with self-owned identity and restore control over their data.</p><p>This platform embraces the convenience of Web 2 but it also returns control back to the users, an ethos of Web 3. The harmony of these two views is what we're calling Web 5.</p><p></p> Components of Web 5<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>There are three main pillars of the decentralized web platform, all of which are based on open standards.</p><p></p> Decentralized Identifiers<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>The identifiers we know and use today are owned by the government, a company, an organization, or some other intermediary. For example, our email addresses and social media handles are identifiers associated with us but are owned and controlled by the service providers. These companies have the right to ban, disable, or delete these identifiers and we have little to no control over this.</p><p>So before we can realize truly decentralized applications, we need decentralized identifiers that users own and control. This removes the dependency on centralized entities to authenticate and represent us.</p><p>​​<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs) are a W3C proposed recommendation with a standardized structure that essentially links to you and your information.</p><p></p><p>They are a long string of text that consists of three parts:</p>  the URI scheme identifier, which is did  the identifier for a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-methods">DID method</a>  the DID method-specific identifier  <p>Storing DIDs on <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">ION</a> (a Layer 2 DID network that runs on top of Bitcoin) is a preferred design decision for the implementation of Web 5. ION is a decentralized replacement for DNS for identity identifiers, so there are no authorities, coordinators, tokens, or other centralized bottleneck.</p><p>DIDs are the only component of Web5 that touch a blockchain, which is generally limited to anchoring the keys/endpoints linked to the ID.</p><p>That being said, anchoring DIDs on Bitcoin (or any blockchain) is not a requirement. In fact, what's great about having the standardized formatting for DIDs is that they can be anchored anywhere or not anchored at all and this still works, although with varying levels of decentralization.</p><p>Here are examples of DIDs on the Bitcoin blockchain, the Ethereum blockchain, and the web. Notice they all use the same format: scheme, DID method, and DID method-specific identifier.</p>   <code>did: btcr: xyv2 - xzpq - q9wa - p7t;<br>did: ens: some.eth;<br>did: web: example.com;<br></code>   <p>Because personal data is not stored on the blockchain, the DID essentially acts as a URI that associates the subject of the DID (the person, company, or object being identified) with a DID document that lives off-chain.</p><p>DID Documents are JSON files stored in decentralized storage systems such as IPFS, and describe how to interact with the DID subject. The DID Document contains things like the DID subject's public keys, authentication and verification methods, and service endpoints that reference the locations of the subject’s data.</p>   <code>{<br>  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",<br>  "id": "did:ion:EiClkZMDxPKqC9c-umQfTkR8",<br>  "verificationMethod": [<br>    {<br>      "id": "did:ion:EiClkZMDxPKqC9c-umQfTkR8",<br>      "type": "Secp256k1VerificationKey2018",<br>      "controller": "did:ion:EiClkZMDxPKqC9c-umQfTkR8"<br>    }<br>  ],<br>  "authentication": ["did:ion:EiClkZMDxPKqC9c-umQfTkR8"]<br>}<br></code>    Verifiable Credentials<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> are a fully ratified W3C standard that work hand in hand with Decentralized Identifiers to enable trustless interactions - meaning two parties do not need to trust one another to engage, but claims made about a DID subject can be verified.</p><p>For example, Alice needs to prove she has a bank account at Acme Bank. Acme Bank issues a cryptographically signed Verifiable Credential which would be stored in Alice's identity wallet.</p><p></p><p>The credential contains the issuer as Acme and the subject as Alice, as well as the claims, which are Alice's account number and full name.</p><p>Upon request for proof of banking, Alice presents the Verifiable Credential that's cryptographically signed by both Alice as well as her bank.</p><p>This is an easy, machine-readable way to share credentials across the web. The Verifier does not know or trust Alice, but they do consider Acme trustworthy, and they have essentially vouched for Alice therefore distributing trust.</p> Decentralized Web Nodes<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Today, centralized entities act as our data stores. Applications hold all of our content and preferences on their servers.</p><p><a href="https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/">Decentralized Web Nodes</a> (DWNs) change this by allowing us to decouple our data from the applications that we use, and instead host our data ourselves in our own personal data stores.</p><p><a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/">BlueSky</a> is a good example; it's a decentralized version of Twitter that's in the works. With BlueSky, your tweets and your connections aren't stored with the application. They are stored with you. So you can present your content on any decentralized social media app you want, not just BlueSky.</p><p>Your DWNs can hold both public and encrypted data. For example, in the case of a decentralized version of Twitter, you'd want data like your tweets and your connections to be public but things like your DMs to be private.</p><p>Your decentralized web nodes do not live on the blockchain. You can host your web nodes anywhere (your phone, computer, etc) and can replicate them across your devices and clouds and all data will be synced.</p><p></p><p>While self-hosting your DWNs provides a means for decentralizing your data, we recognize some users will be more comfortable with others hosting their web nodes for convenience sake. We envision there will be vendors offering to host your web nodes for you. The good part about that is you can encrypt any private data so unlike today where cloud hosts can scan everything that you host there, you can still maintain some privacy even if you have your web nodes hosted by intermediaries.</p><p>Your DWNs are associated with your Decentralized Identifiers and are listed in a DID document.</p><p>Notice the <code>serviceEndpoint</code> section of the DID doc specifies service endpoints and provides URIs to the decentralized web nodes.</p>   <code>{<br>  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",<br>  "id": "did:web:example.com:u:alice",<br>  "service": [<br>    {<br>      "id": "#dwn",<br>      "type": "DecentralizedWebNode",<br>      "serviceEndpoint": {<br>        "nodes": ["https://dwn.example.com", "00:11:22:33:FF:EE"]<br>      }<br>    }<br>  ],<br>  "verificationMethod": [<br>    {<br>      "id": "did:web:example.com:u:alice",<br>      "type": "Secp256k1VerificationKey2018",<br>      "controller": "did:web:example.com:u:alice"<br>    }<br>  ],<br>  "authentication": ["did:web:example.com:u:alice"]<br>}<br></code>   <p>Given an application has the address to your DWN, they can send you a request for data.</p><p>This represents a request from an application to obtain all objects within a DWN that follow the <code>SocialMediaPosting</code> schema:</p>   <code>    POST https://dwn.example.com/<br>    BODY {<br>      "requestId": "c5784162-84af-4aab-aff5-f1f8438dfc3d",<br>      "target": "did:example:123",<br>      "messages": [<br>        {<br>          "descriptor": {<br>            "method": "CollectionsQuery",<br>            "schema": "https://schema.org/SocialMediaPosting"<br>          }<br>        },<br>        {...}<br>      ]<br>    }<br></code>   <p>The data within DWNs are JSON objects that follow a universal standard, thus making it possible for any application to discover and process the data given its semantic type.</p><p>If this data is public, those objects will be automatically returned to the application, and if the data is private, the node owner would need to grant the application access to that data.</p> Identity Wallets<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Obviously all of this is pretty complicated, especially for non-technical users. So we need a simplistic, easy to use interface that will allow people to access and manage their identity.</p><p>A well designed identity wallet would provide ways to manage the data stored in decentralized web nodes, the decentralized IDs and the context in which they should be used, verifiable credentials, and authorizations.</p><p></p> Decentralized Web Apps<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Web 5 enables developers to build decentralized web applications (DWAs) on top of it and it’s all open source! You're free to use it as your foundation and focus your attention on what you really care about, your app. Web5 brings to DWAs what cloud and application servers bring to enterprise apps. It does the hard part. It brings decentralization. By building your apps on top of Web 5, you get decentralization and identity and data management as part of the platform.</p><p>This is definitely a fundamental change in how we exchange data, but it's not a total overhaul of the web we already know. This works like Progressive Web Apps, but you'd add the decentralized web node SDK and then applications are free to really go serverless because the data isn't stored with them.</p><p></p><p>The sky's the limit to what you can build on top of this platform, but here are some cool basic examples.</p> Music Applications<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>No one likes recreating their music playlists over and over again for different apps. With Web 5, you wouldn't have to do that.</p><p>In this example, Groove has access to write to Alice's decentralized web node and adds a new entry.</p><p>Tidal has access to read from Alice's DWN, so can read the new entry that was added by Groove, and now Alice has her playlist readily available on both apps.</p><p></p><p>With the continuous utilization of the data across apps, not only do Groove and Tidal get access to Alice's data, but they use it to improve her user experience, thus creating a stronger experience than Alice could have ever gotten had she not used this tech.</p> Travel Applications<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Your travel preferences, tickets, and reservations are scattered across so many different hotels, airlines, rental car agencies and travel apps, making it really difficult to coordinate. Heaven forbid there's any hiccup in the system such as a delayed flight. You end up trying to get in touch with the car rental place to let them know you'll be late for your reservation, and if it's really late, you'd want to call the hotel to ask them not to give away your room. All while you're hustling and bustling at the airport.</p><p>Web 5 can help unify these various app experiences.</p><p>If Alice gives the hotel, the airline, and the rental car agency access to the <code>Reservation</code> and <code>Trip</code> objects in her DWN, they can react and adjust accordingly to any changes made.</p><p></p><p>These are just a few applications that can be realized by building on top of Web 5. There's so many more possibilities once the web is truly decentralized the way it was always intended to be.</p> How to Get Involved<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>While we’re super excited about this technology, there's still lots of problems to be solved.

<p>Privacy in crypto is an ongoing major theme, shaping innovations and driving discussions in the ecosystem. <br></p><p>The idea that all cryptocurrencies are private is fairly attractive and a narrative that has been sold to newcomers countlessly. After all, who would not want full control over their information and guaranteed coin security?<br></p><p>As enticing as the concept of default privacy in crypto sounds, it has (with exceptions) always been nothing but a common misconception, particularly on public blockchain networks, which represent the majority in the crypto space. Therefore, it is imperative to find a solution to interact on the blockchain without giving away sensitive, personal information. It’s also worth noting that a sustainable privacy solution can only be achieved by taking back control over our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/philosophy-legality-and-economics-of-privacy-how-privacy-spans-through-most-areas-of-our-lives-1b0d48945291/">privacy</a> while remaining within the boundaries of legislation and compliance.<br></p><p>In this article, we will explore the concept of on-chain privacy, why most cryptocurrencies are not private, and how this takes a toll on coin security. We will look into privacy coins and the validity of their claims towards creating private blockchains. Finally, we’ll explore the viability of achieving privacy in a <a href="https://www.leewayhertz.com/cross-chain-defi-technology/">cross-chain</a> interoperable DeFi ecosystem while achieving regulatory compliance.<br></p> Why blockchain anonymity is (for the most part) a myth <p>When Bitcoin emerged a decade ago, it promised an idea of pseudonymity and privacy. Naturally, people were excited about the ability to transact without giving up their personal information, unlike in traditional financial services. <br></p><p>At the time, few people noticed an inherent contradiction: On one side, the supposed pseudo-anonymity stood, and on the other, never-seen-before transparency was the major selling point of Bitcoin.<br></p>Bitcoin traceability diagram (<a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/protect-your-privacy">Source</a>)<p>Every transaction and activity related to interacting with the Bitcoin blockchain is recorded on an immutable ledger. No one can change the records afterward, nor could anyone conspire to alter the ledger. Yet, the Bitcoin blockchain has more than an unalterable bookkeeping function— it is <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/btc/blocks">completely public</a>. Whereas banks can only reveal a statement to its account owner and maybe law enforcement, on the Bitcoin network, everyone can access all the information stored on the blockchain. <br></p><p>Taking this into consideration, “are Bitcoin transactions traceable?” is an incomplete question at best.<br></p> How do cryptocurrency transactions get traced?<br> <p>Given a Bitcoin address, you can check every transaction that ever involved it. You can also easily see how much Bitcoin it holds. Although the faces behind the addresses are hidden, every transaction is public. And, while Bitcoin is often lauded as a completely private and anonymous way to transact, there are ways that users' identities can be revealed. For example, if someone's identity is linked to their Bitcoin address, any transactions they make can be <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/protect-your-privacy">traced</a> back to them.<br></p><p>While chain analysis is something anti-crime organizations perform to take down criminals, there are also cases of users’ identities being tracked in the most mundane settings. A typical case occurs because virtual asset service providers (<a href="https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/what-are-virtual-asset-service-providers-vasp/">VASPs</a>) like crypto exchanges are required to comply with know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. Any transaction in or out of a crypto exchange wallet leaves a clear trail connecting all self-custody wallets to their user’s identity. This opens a door for law enforcement to subpoena the exchange for their KYC records and the user's transactions can be made transparent.<br></p><p>While Bitcoin promised anonymity, it could only deliver pseudonymity. Individuals who wanted to keep their transactions fully private searched for and developed methods to stay private, leading to the rise of <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bitcoin-tumblers-privacy-coins-and-prifi-private-crypto/">Bitcoin mixers and coin tumblers</a>. In essence, the transparent nature of Bitcoin made it impossible for anyone to use the network privately.<br></p> Why are blockchain networks open and transparent? Why this is good for coin security? <p>Most cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks are open and transparent, for reasons that may surprise you. The founding idea behind Bitcoin, the mother of all cryptocurrencies and blockchains, is decentralization. And the concept of decentralization has been thrown around in crypto-centric circles enough for many to not know what it means anymore.<br></p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/02/17/bitcoins-value-depends-on-its-decentralization/">Decentralization</a>, in simple terms, means dissolving central authority and giving the right of governance to the stakeholders involved in the system, giving full control back to the ordinary user. <br></p><p>The idea of decentralization is quite familiar to how democracies work where instead of a single ruler making all the decisions, a government is mainly composed of an executive, legislative, and judiciary power keeping a check on each other. Similarly, decentralization takes the power from a single centralized authority and distributes it among all network participants keeping a check on each other. <br></p><p>Bitcoin is decentralized, as no company or group can lay claim to being decision-makers on the network. Unlike banks and governments, no one can freeze a person's access to the blockchain. However, this lack of a central authority poses a need for accountability of transactions since there are no governing bodies to verify them.<br></p><p>The Bitcoin network maintains its miners honest by issuing rewards to those that agree on an immutable network state. However, by design, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin-mining.asp">miners</a> alone shouldn't be trusted to verify transactions, as they’re likely to act in a way that maximizes their profit. Therefore, the network was made transparent and public so that anyone with access to the Internet could run a <a href="https://www.bitpanda.com/academy/en/lessons/what-is-a-bitcoin-node/">Bitcoin node</a> and personally confirm if the miners' verification claims were true. <br></p><p>In this way, it wouldn’t be wrong to say that the radical transparency of public blockchains is both a feature and a bug. But doesn’t change the fact that It is secured with the same level of security employed by banks, the military, and virtual private networks (VPNs) to encrypt their systems: the 256-bit SHA hash algorithms. However, SHA hash functions provide each transaction a distinct fingerprint that cannot be reversed, unlike encryption, which can be decoded. Meaning that it grants your coin security.<br><br></p>Bitcoin – a shared public ledger. (<a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/how-it-works">Source</a>) Need for privacy coins <p>Privacy coins were born as a next step in the evolution of cryptocurrency. <br></p><p>Bitcoin’s creator(s) never had access to the technology necessary to make transactions that were fully private possible. And, in their defense, “are Bitcoin transactions traceable” could’ve been taken as a silly question before the development of chain analysis tools and in an early stage of the network. <br></p><p>As soon as these standards were reached, new initiatives to restore true control over information to the average user and counterbalance the excess of transparency in the crypto space emerged. The earliest private blockchains such as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2021/08/03/satoshi-nakamoto-collaborator-says-his-bitcoin-fork-zcash-should-go-proof-of-stake-and-wind-down-its-carbon-footprint/?sh=610aa2d47449">Zcash</a> were forked from the Bitcoin network. They adhered to the fundamental aspects of blockchain technology and the solutions that cryptocurrencies offered, but every similarity ended there. <br></p><p>Private blockchain networks didn’t take the path of open-ledger technology with all transactions open to the public along with receivers' and senders' addresses, amount of coins transferred, history of all transactions associated with addresses, etc. They, on the other hand, enabled users to conceal all these details.<br></p><p>Privacy-focused blockchains utilize privacy settings and advanced technologies like <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ring-signatures-vs-zksnarks-comparing-privacy-technologies/">ring signatures</a>, zero-knowledge proofs, and stealth addresses. Some of them have been largely successful at maintaining their users’ privacy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">Zero-knowledge proofs</a>, one of the most exciting technologies used in them, ensure that you can see that a transaction was successful but know nothing else about it –which, as you will learn, can have many applications.</p> Examples and comparison of privacy coins <p>The most popular privacy coins include Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC), and Secret (SCRT). Other popular options are Beam, Grin, Verge, and Horizon (ZEN). These cryptocurrencies use different technologies and cryptographic protocols to keep their users anonymous.<br></p><p>Out of all privacy coins, Monero and Zcash are the most well-known and have the highest market cap. Let’s have a look at these top two privacy coins and how they differ in terms of technology to enable privacy. <br></p>Comparison between Monero, Zcash, and Dash. (<a href="https://medium.com/@tabul8tor/privacy-coins-monero-dash-and-zcash-compared-686fdae6c0ba">Source</a>) Monero <p>Monero (XMR) has made a name for itself in the crypto space as a leader in the private cryptocurrency space. The network uses ring signatures and stealth addresses to hide the identities of both parties in a transaction, as well as Ring Confidential Transactions (<a href="https://unblock.net/ringct-vs-zk-snark/">RingCT</a>) to hide the amount involved in any transaction.<br></p><p>Unlike some of its competitors, Monero is a private-by-default blockchain. Although some groups have proclaimed to have cracked Monero's technology, most of those claims are largely disputed by the blockchain community.<br></p> Zcash <p>Forked from Bitcoin, Zcash famously <a href="https://nakamoto.com/zcash-the-https-of-blockchains/">claims</a> to be “HTTPS if Bitcoin stands for HTTP”. Using advanced cryptography, Zcash allows its users to shield their transactions. Its zero-knowledge proof setup also facilitates shielded transactions, allowing users to send and receive coins without revealing their addresses to third parties.<br></p><p>Zcash’s ZK proofs also hide transaction amounts, adding an extra layer of privacy. Its technology is widely used in the crypto space today, adopted by many as a transparent way to access privacy. Like Monero, the network has been successful at keeping its users’ privacy.</p> Private but flawed: The drawbacks of private blockchains and privacy coins <p>Most privacy coins are true to their promise of anonymity, but it comes at a huge opportunity cost. In the past couple of years, the rise of decentralized financial services (DeFi) and Web3 has clouded the crypto space at large. Built on the ethos of cypherpunks and leveraging blockchain technology, the DeFi ecosystem offers almost all of the financial services seen in traditional finance, but without trusted third parties or middlemen.<br></p><p>But there's a caveat: the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/institutional-defi-the-next-big-thing-a5b07193232b/">DeFi ecosystem</a> at large is built on top of public blockchain networks. The same blockchain networks that antagonize private transactions or privacy in general. Privacy coins, on the other hand, offer top-notch privacy but lag behind in terms of DeFi innovations. <br></p><p>Furthermore, building a DeFi ecosystem on privacy coin networks would be like reinventing the wheel. Building a new DeFi ecosystem in silos rather than fixing privacy on existing DeFi carries along a range of complexities such as attracting new capital, training developers, fixing the same old <a href="https://analyticsindiamag.com/understanding-ethereums-scalability-problems-and-the-solution-on-the-horizon/">scalability issues</a>, etc.<br></p><p>The combination of complexities involved in building a new DeFi ecosystem, along with the composability issues in the existing DeFi ecosystem severely limits the prospects of private blockchains. This limits users’ privacy to mere simple wallet-A-to-wallet-B transactions, while missing out on financial services such as lending, borrowing, yield farming, stablecoins, decentralized exchanges, and <a href="https://defillama.com/top-protocols">many more</a>. <br></p> Regulatory compliance<br> <p>Another major drawback of privacy coins is regulatory compliance. Even though privacy coins allow users to hide their sensitive information from public view, it then becomes tricky for them to prove they’re compliant, or to do so without disclosing all their information..<br></p><p>Solution offering privacy without achieving regulatory compliance will always end up in a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/regulators-dial-up-the-heat-dash-zec-and-monero-reach-boiling-point">tussle with regulators</a>. This creates the need for a privacy solution that achieves regulatory compliance through voluntary, selective disclosures.<br></p> Panther Protocol: driving interchain privacy with compliance<br> <p>The Panther Protocol prides itself as an end-to-end solution to privacy in Web3 and DeFi. The protocol also seeks to aid financial institutions as they aim for regulatory-compliant participation in decentralized finance. Panther combines the power of blockchain privacy with transparency, restoring trust in the system without sacrificing privacy.<br></p><p>Panther adopts <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zksnarks-through-the-lens-of-a-cypherpunk-f9f72a0f5bcd/">zk-SNARKs</a> cryptography, allowing users to perform shielded transactions across DeFi platforms with zero-knowledge proofs. Through a powerful multi-asset vault, the average cryptocurrency user can deposit their coins into Panther's vaults and mint a corresponding amount in zAssets (zero-knowledge, fully collateralized versions of the deposit). These zAssets support interoperability, allowing the user to move them across different blockchains and transact privately on public networks.<br></p> Panther protocol vs privacy coins <p>Panther's moat is in providing privacy in DeFi while allowing users to achieve compliance without sharing underlying data. Panther allows users to generate zero-knowledge reports to voluntarily disclose parts or their full transaction history with select counterparties.<br></p><p>Furthermore, Panther <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/privacy-finance-why-panther-is-different-and-necessary-e423b2993df9/">stands out</a> from the crowd because it provides privacy across several blockchain networks. When users deposits assets into Panther, they break the on-chain link but continue to perform on-chain activities privately using Panther's <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/minting-and-burning-zassets-a-semi-technical-deep-dive-18dea602a859/">zAssets</a>.<br></p><p>Panther’s vision is to provide privacy features and power of choice to the entire DeFi ecosystem, in which users have complete control of their data and an ability to reveal as much or as little as they want, to whomever they want, at all times.</p> So, are Bitcoin transactions traceable? Yes, very much. <p>Privacy on public blockchain networks is a myth, with the most popular cryptocurrencies only able to offer pseudonymity due to their transparency. Privacy coins have sprung up to fill the void, but their solutions do not make room for compliance or offer advanced financial services.<br></p><p>For a true solution to this dilemma, the crypto ecosystem needs to combine privacy, access to DeFi, selective transparency, and <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/interoperable-privacy-building-privacy-bridges-to-all-of-defi-2eaa89c9c7ac/">interoperability</a>. Every attempt that fails to meet any of these requirements will either result in a siloed ecosystem, lack of public interest, or in further violations to users’ privacy. Private chains, even if they support smart contracts, are therefore not a solution to the need for privacy across the blockchain scene.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

  Staking your DOT just got a whole lot easier with Polkadot’s new staking dashboard, a user-friendly interface for staking natively on Polkadot.

<p>Staking your DOT just got a whole lot easier with Polkadot’s new staking dashboard. This new interface offers an intuitive, user-friendly alternative to the Polkadot-JS Apps developer tool for DOT holders who want to stake natively on Polkadot.</p><p>The Polkadot ecosystem is getting a long overdue upgrade to its staking experience for less-technical DOT holders. The new <a href="https://staking.polkadot.network/dashboard">staking dashboard</a>, demonstrated today for the first time at <a href="https://decoded.polkadot.network/">Polkadot Decoded</a>, provides a simplified and streamlined interface to give users a more intuitive staking experience. Coupled with the expected launch of <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-nomination-pools">nomination pools</a> (currently live on Kusama only), the new dashboard eliminates the need for newer and less-technical DOT holders to stake via third-party staking service providers.</p><p>The dashboard is now available for the community to try out in beta, with several features to continue improving the staking experience planned for future updates.</p><p>Polkadot uses a variant of proof of stake called Nominated Proof-of-Stake, or NPoS, which enables DOT holders to help secure the network by selecting validators and staking their tokens to receive rewards. In addition to improving the user experience, the new staking dashboard is also designed to encourage more participation with native staking directly on the Relay Chain rather than using third-party applications and custodial services, helping ensure the network remains secure and decentralized.</p> Polkadot Staking Dashboard Beta <p>It’s now possible to manage all Polkadot staking functions through the staking dashboard. The interface works by connecting to your existing Polkadot wallet, with support for the Polkadot-JS Extension and Talisman for now, and support for Subwallet coming soon. Additionally, read-only accounts are supported, allowing you to connect any account on a read-only basis to track your staking activity. The dashboard currently has support for Polkadot, Kusama, and Westend networks.</p><p>The staking dashboard currently offers the following features and functionality:</p>  Research, favorite, and nominate your choice of validators  See your payouts history thanks to an opt-in Subscan API integration  Support for nomination pools (currently live on Kusama only)  Handy definitions for staking terminology  Support for read-only accounts on mobile devices  Extrinsic-related data fetched directly from RPC node for better decentralization  Network-wide staking metrics   App walkthrough  Overview <p>The Overview tab provides information about the state of the network, including the cumulative supply of DOT being staked globally and the number of nominators on the network earning rewards. There’s also information on your staking statistics, such as the amount you have staked vs your free unstaked balance and an overview of your recent staking payouts. The announcements section features recent news on the network’s staking parameters that may affect your staking positions.</p> Staking <p>You can view all the relevant information about your staking activities at a glance under the Staking section. The ‘Stake’ tab provides an overview of your current staking setup and lets you start or stop nominating, adjust the DOT amount bonded, choose and adjust your selected validators, and select your payout destination. The ‘Payouts’ tab shows insights on your recent history of staking payouts.</p> Validators <p>The ‘Validators’ tab allows you to see an overview of network validators and relevant statistics that could affect your nomination choices. You can sort validators by commission rate and exclude inactive validators, oversubscribed and blocked validators, validators charging 100% commission, and validators without an on-chain identity. Once you’ve identified your favorite validators, you can pin them to save them in the ‘Favorites’ tab for easier reference and selection.</p> Get started with the Staking Dashboard <p>Go to the <a href="https://staking.polkadot.network/dashboard">Staking Dashboard</a> to get started. Then, select ‘Connect’ to link an account from the compatible wallet extensions including Talisman and Polkadot-JS. Select ‘Read Only Accounts’ to import any account address directly into the dashboard.</p><p>Make sure your controller account and reward destination are set, then you’re ready to set up or modify your staking preferences. If you’re not familiar with any terms along the way, click the (i) to access the Staking Assistant.</p> Coming soon to the Staking Dashboard <p>The staking dashboard is a work in progress. There are two milestones active on Github [<a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard/milestone/5">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-staking-dashboard/milestone/4">here</a>] at the time of writing aimed at getting the codebase production-ready and feature complete — so users can expect changes and improvements across the board.</p><p>In addition to improving the existing code, a range of other validator discovery improvements including a search bar, a validator metrics card, fairer nomination generation, and integration of the validator selection algorithm are on the agenda before the initial release. High-priority items like proxy account support and SubWallet extension support are also on the near-term roadmap.</p><p>With this first-class staking portal, the community now has an easy, modern, and advanced interface to stake directly on the Polkadot Relay Chain. This should encourage more network participation as users are given an easier way to stake directly (versus through trusted third-party services), and ultimately a more secure network.</p><p>User experience will continue to improve beyond the beta, and the dashboard should help to inspire other components that will contribute to a larger library of reusable, generic UX components for the ecosystem and complement the other application-side initiatives that include style guides, validator discovery, metrics, and future Polkadot APIs.</p><p>Have any feedback on the beta or suggestions for future functionality? Check out the <a href="https://staking.polkadot.network/dashboard#/feedback">feedback page</a> and leave your thoughts!</p><p>Interested in building on Polkadot or Kusama?<a href="https://info.polkadot.network/contact"> Get in touch</a>!</p>

<p>Validator Spotlights showcase the great teams working to guarantee the security and decentralization of the Findora blockchain. Here are <a href="https://twitter.com/delightlabs_io">DELIGHT</a>’s responses to some questions from the Findora community:</p> 1. Tell us about&nbsp;DELIGHT <p>DELIGHT is a technology-driven team that has operated in the world of decentralized cryptocurrency since the beginning. Though we started just by running our own validator nodes, we now run validator nodes as a service for delegators. Our dApps and services are well-known to be stable and secure, showing our team’s high level of expertise.</p> 2. What should we know about the DELIGHT&nbsp;team? <p>We have contributed to many networks’ growth in diverse ways. Regarding node operation, DELIGHT is currently running validators on over 10 networks, including several cosmos blockchains, SKALE and Threshold Network. When it comes to the Dapp development, the team provided Dapps such as an AMM DEX. They have supported asset trading so that many users can exchange their tokens very easily since its&nbsp;launch.</p> 3. Why Should People Rely on&nbsp;DELIGHT? <p>We have proven reliable even in times of network volatility. DELIGHT was one of the validators holding the highest voting power in the Terra Network (now a.k.a Terra Classic), and proved our reliability when the network was congested due to the UST de-peg. We endeavor to enhance our availability and security by implementing custom monitoring tools that catch emergencies and prepare for&nbsp;them.</p> 4. Why was Findora an appealing network for&nbsp;DELIGHT? <p>Findora’s graceful integration of UTXO and EVM blockchain technology persuaded us to be network validators. Our team expects more and more people to want privacy on the blockchain in the near future, and we expect many other teams to build their dApps on the network soon. As the crypto market grows, so does the need for privacy, making Findora an essential piece of future web3 infrastructure.</p> 5. Where can the Findora Community learn more about&nbsp;DELIGHT? <p>Website:<a href="https://delightlabs.io/"> https://delightlabs.io/</a></p><p>Twitter:<a href="https://twitter.com/delightlabs_io"> https://twitter.com/delightlabs_io</a></p><p>Github:<a href="https://github.com/DELIGHT-LABS"> https://github.com/DELIGHT-LABS</a></p><p>Email: contact@delightlabs.io</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation/findora-validator-spotlight-delight-1ae645f96abe">💡Findora Validator Spotlight💡: DELIGHT</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation">Findora Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In this post, I’ll be talking about several individuals associated with the <a href="https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/human-betterment-foundation-1928-1942">Human Betterment Foundation’s</a> eugenics / institutionalized sterilization program who were based in the Bay Area where the Berggruen’s Transformations of the Human office is located. From these figures I’ll draw connections to current policy implementations in California that appear benevolent, but are really about social efficiency and scientific management of children.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/rbpe.0020380g/?sp=6">Source</a>: Human Sterilization Today, 1938</p>
<p>Three <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2015/05/history-of-sterilization-in-california-pamphlet-from-the-human-betterment-foundation.html">board members</a> were associated with Berkeley:</p>
<p><a href="https://history.library.ucsf.edu/evans.html">Herbert Evans</a>, chair of the university’s school of anatomy with a research focus in endocrinology and reproduction</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Jackson_Holmes">Samuel Holmes</a>, a UC Berkeley zoologist with strong anti-immigrant sentiments</p>
<p><a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/coffee-rudolph-isaac">Rabbi Rudolf Coffee</a> who led Berkeley’s Temple Sinai from 1921-34 and then led the San Francisco Conference of Christians and Jews</p>
<p>There were also representatives of Stanford, a school that is at the forefront of developing social policy; financial innovation, including social entrepreneurship; and biomedical research. Transformation of the human is definitely in their wheelhouse. David Starr Jordan, a founding member of the board of the Human Betterment Foundation and mentor to its director Paul Popenhoe, was the first president of Stanford University. After a <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2020/10/07/jordan-agassiz/">review</a> in the summer of 2020, university officials decided to remove Jordan’s name from numerous buildings and a street on campus and make plans to better educate the community about his legacy through historical exhibits and programming. Jordan, a naturalist and ichthyologist, held racist views about dysgenic degeneration, unfit populations, and that the “efficacy of education was limited by genetic potential.” You can read more about him in this <a href="https://campusnames.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2020/04/Jordan-Hall-request.pdf">request to rename Jordan Hall,</a> prepared in 2019 by the Stanford Eugenics Project.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/digital/collection/BYUPhotos/id/238/">Source</a>: David Starr Jordan with Brigham Young University President George Brimhall at the Provo, UT train station in 1912. Jordan was there to deliver a lecture.</p>
<p>Lewis Terman was another prominent member of the Human Betterment Foundation. He was a renowned psychologist at Stanford who developed the <a href="https://stanfordmag.org/contents/the-vexing-legacy-of-lewis-terman">Stanford Binet IQ test</a> and carried out extensive studies of genius seeking to determine the genetic basis of intelligence. In 1928, Terman <a href="https://stanfordmag.org/contents/the-vexing-legacy-of-lewis-terman">wrote</a> ” It is more important for man to acquire control over his biological evolution than to capture the energy of the atom.” With today’s <a href="https://www.azonano.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=2465">nanoelectromechanical systems</a>, some imagine they are close to harnessing evolution towards renewable energy harvest within living tissues.</p>
<p>Terman’s son Fred was a protege of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush">Vannevar Bush</a> who returned to Stanford after working at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Research_Laboratory_(Harvard)">radio research lab</a> at Harvard during WWII. Fred became dean of the engineering school at Stanford and helped launch the Stanford Research Park in the early 1950s. This became the anchor for today’s Silicon Valley juggernaut. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Terman">Fred Terman</a> was also involved in setting up the Korea Advanced Science Institute in 1970 under Pak Chung Hee (fast forward to Samsung’s Metaverse). He <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/news/2004/november3/Terman-1103.html">mentored</a> William Hewlett and David Packard and got them set up in business. An interesting, but probably related side note, is that HP’s first big break was selling processors to Disney for the animation of the film Fantasia – picture playlists of gamified edu-tainment with trademarked animated characters. In 2015, HP split off its enterprise unit from its personal computing division, creating HPE. HPE’s focus includes <a href="https://www.hpe.com/us/en/compute/hpc/cray/oak-ridge-national-laboratory.html">high performance supercomputers</a>, <a href="https://www.hpe.com/us/en/solutions/internet-of-things.html?jumpid=ps_jpc654xgmv_aid-520061462&amp;ef_id=CjwKCAjw5NqVBhAjEiwAeCa97d18-NPzVWRViWmNRzIOiJpSd7616Lv5tPk92CD62dGYXlz4MquSuRoCQmYQAvD_BwE:G:s&amp;s_kwcid=AL!13472!3!545753513965!e!!g!!hpe%20iot!14648842481!125062696737&amp;">IoT edge computing</a>, <a href="https://www.hpe.com/us/en/solutions/healthcare.html">digital medicine infrastructure</a>, <a href="https://www.hpe.com/us/en/software/ezmeral-data-fabric.html">data storage and analytics</a>, and <a href="https://www.hpe.com/uk/en/solutions/infrastructure-security.html">cyber-security</a>.</p>

<p>The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation has played a leading role in remaking the non-profit sector to be data-driven and evidence-based for the coming era of social-impact finance. It’s also almost single-handedly funded the development of OER. These are Open Education Resources tagged with meta-data that will be used to program humans as lifelong learners chasing skills badges in haptic suits. The stuff Knewton was working on. I’ve written about them <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/11/25/toxic-philanthropy-part-2-hewlett-packard-re-engineers-the-social-sector/">here</a> and <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2019/07/07/hewlett-packard-and-the-pitfalls-of-deeper-learning-in-an-internet-of-things-world/">here</a>.</p>

<p>In 2018, funds from the <a href="https://www.packard.org/what-we-fund/children-families-and-communities/starting-smart-and-strong/san-jose/">David and Lucille Packard Foundation</a> were awarded to <a href="https://www.fmsd.org/apps/news/article/806906">Franklin McKinley and Alum Rock schools</a> in San Jose to participate in the <a href="https://fmcisite.wordpress.com/monitoring-and-evaluation/">Datazone</a> pilot affiliated with the <a href="https://ccrec.ucsc.edu/partnerships/silicon-valley-regional-data-trust">Silicon Valley Regional Data Trust</a>. Datazone’s initial funding came from the <a href="https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1338411">National Science Foundation</a> in 2013 and was expanded with support from <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/newsroom/supporting-the-silicon-valley-regional-data-trust/">Chan Zuckerberg</a>. The intent was to aggregate a broad range of data including early childhood education, foster care, and juvenile justice data in addition to academic data. It is notable that Priscilla Chan was the keynote speaker at the 2017 <a href="https://www.sccoe.org/news/NR/Pages/011817-Investing-in-children-families-communities.aspx">launch</a> for SVRDT.</p>
<p>David Haussler, the bio-molecular engineer who assembled the first draft of the human genome in 2000, was a panelist that day. So where does genomics fit into the data interoperability agenda? That would be those synthetic-biology upgrades and value profiling of human resources. Let’s just not call it eugenics. Precision education and nutrition sound much better don’t you think?</p>
<p>They are after the children – to convert the next generation to Metaverse life. The plan is to govern them as data commodities that will generate social impact profits and, strange as it may seem to say at this point, possibly as a source of alternative energy through entangled digital twins and quantum thermodynamics? Picture pre-k classrooms remade as bio-generators. So much un-harnessed piezo-electric energy going to waste. If only we had more “smart” playgrounds.</p>
<p>A lab for experimenting with a “concierge” model of integrated health and personalized learning grounded in family re-education was Priscilla Chan’s Primary School franchise, established in 2015 with a $5 million pass-through grant from the Silicon Valley Community Foundation. There are now two schools, one in East Palo Alto and one in East Bay. So, pull out your “Fitter Families” lens&nbsp; as you scroll through these images and consider what they portend for Fourth Industrial Revolution bio-digital convergence.</p>

<p><a href="https://littlesis.org/org/315852-Franklin_McKinley_School_District">Source</a>: Littlesis.org deleted three hundred+ maps I made over five years on their open-source platform. Unfortunately, an interactive version of this map was not archived before the purge. Littlesis,org has also made it impossible to search their database for many entries I created. However, you can still find a lot of the records via Google&nbsp; if you include Littlesis in your query along with the term. Once you locate one of the records they are still interactive, so you can explore and uncover additional information.</p>

<p>Looking back over the fine print of the grant, coordinated by of the University of California Santa Cruz, I noticed that the IJIS (Integrated Justice Information Systems) has been tapped to provide input on the development of secure information sharing for the project. IJIS is based in Ashburn, VA on George Washington’s Science and Technology campus. Its mission statement is to unite “private and public sectors to improve critical information sharing for those who provide public safety and administer justice in our communities.”</p>
<p>The social-impact finance model is built on the premise of pre-crime, where “crime” is re-framed as being an economic burden on society. How much did the system put into raising you? What is the return on that investment relative to your anticipated economic productivity? In 2020, IJIS prepared an extensive white paper outlining the use of technology in transitioning to an open-air prison model for low-level offenses. I believe such a structure will eventually be applied to children and “lifelong learners” for risk assessment and reputation scoring embedded in pay-for-success finance deals. Prison and rehabilitation are significant cost-offsets used in the equations meant to finance this disruptive debt product boondoggle.</p>
<p>SVRDT’s data interoperability provides the predictive analytics needed to scale impact investing in pre-k, juvenile justice, and foster care. Picture the “anytime-anywhere” “learning ecosystem” model as a <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/04/24/navigating-whiteness-could-anywhere-anytime-learning-endanger-black-and-brown-students/">QR-coded carceral state</a> intended to groom children, through digital identity management, for a post-human existence. E-carceration has been embedded into education infrastructure over the past decade: school security screenings with <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2017/06/09/scholarchip-ids-convenience-but-at-what-cost/">student ID</a> scans led to QR codes linked to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcujVWv4R_Y">school bus ridership</a>. The system takes advantage of parental concerns around safety to impose more and more surveillance on and off campus. Sadly, the characterization of schools as prisons is not so far off the mark for many children today.</p>

Beyond concerns relating to the involvement of IJIS, NIC <a href="https://nic-us.org/nic-participants/">maintains partnerships</a> with both the National Council on Crime and Delinquency and the National Fusion Center Association. Stanford Center for Population Health Sciences (David Starr Jordan and Lewis Terman) is also in the mix. While the NIC’s website and logo are clunky, the inclusion of the icosahedron feels significant. It’s a Platonic solid that represents <a href="http://www.mathematicsmagazine.com/Articles/SacredGeometryPlatonicSolids.php#.Yp14RxPMLtU">water</a>. A figure of an icosahedron is featured in the Nobel Prize-winning Dan Schectman’s video on quasi-crystals. It’s a prominent theme in The Institute for the Future’s 2016 “Learning is Earning” video about blockchain identity, unbundled education, debt logs, and human value calculated based on “edu-blocks” attained. Could the repeated use of this shape be an indirect reference to biomedical sensing technologies, photonic computing, and fourth phase / structured water, and the possibility of holographic DNA?</p>

<p><a href="https://littlesis.org/person/332743-Marcy_Lauck">Marcy Lau</a>ck of the Santa Clara County Office of Education was data administrator for Datazone and served on the board of the National Laboratory of Education Transformation (NLET). NLET was a subcontractor to Resilient Network Systems, Inc. on a <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2015/nist.ir.8054.pdf">NIST-sponsored digital identity project</a>, Zero-Knowledge Identity and Privacy Protection Service for Education and Children, in 2012. Again, we see where the impetus for the California Trust Framework comes from. Robert Hertzberg didn’t just come up with this idea on his own. There is a deep backstory around the development of digital identity in the state. Look at all the parties involved. This is not just about a convenient way for students to share their high school transcript during college applications. It’s a plan to engineer the lives of all the people of the Earth by luring them onto cybernetic pathways where their autonomy will be stolen.</p>

Just as K12 and higher education were standardized for global gig labor, the same structure needed to be applied to pre-k. All levels of training for future digital citizens would be integrated into cradle to career, lifelong learning pipelines. Santa Clara County, CA, the epicenter of pay-for-success human capital pilots, was among the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190111171041/http:/www.qualitymattersscc.com/about/qris/">first counties in the state to participate</a>.

Educare launched in Chicago with the backing of former first lady of Illinois <a href="https://littlesis.org/person/107511-Diana_Rauner">Diana Rauner</a> and expanded to Santa Clara with backing from deep-pocketed ECE and tech interests. Rauner, executive director of Ounce of Prevention Fund, was closely allied with <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/333647-Early_Childhood_Pay_for_Success_Social_Impact_Finance_Report_2012">Jim Heckman</a> and a trustee at Stanford Business School where she earned her MBA.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The pre-k “quality” effort in California has been led by the <a href="https://first5association.org/about/about-us/">First 5 Association</a>, coordinating fifty-eight county participants since 1998 when it was established with proceeds from the Proposition 10 tobacco tax. That’s an interesting detail, since the tobacco mosaic virus has been identified as a key material for use in <a href="https://avs.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1116/1.4816584">biomolecular engineering</a> to create nano-bio technology systems by US Department of Energy, NSF, and US Army researchers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markcrandall/">Mark Crandall</a> of Early Quality Systems helped devise iPinwheel, the pre-k data architecture in 2012. The criminal justice aspect enters the picture once again, since before starting his business, Crandall had been an Agile consultant with BAE, a UK Aerospace defense contractor, developing FBI case management software. The integrated software system has since been renamed Hubbe and aggregates the following data: attendance, health, assessment tools with evidence documentation, meal management, payments, and parent engagement. Among the 100+ Student Information System fields is a reference to <a href="https://assets.website-files.com/6086c8a2024331c54a9a3e31/609557c267d1eae5d131a60c_Hubbe_SIS.pdf">PayPal</a> payment integration, the only company referenced. Under the document management section there are fields for family case notes, family documents, parent case notes, parent documents, and child case notes and child documents. When you sign up for universal pre-k, your entire family becomes part of a dossier that will very likely be used to profit human capital finance impact investors.</p>

Pritzker</a> went up and down the coast pitching a 7-13% rate of return on improved human capital through “character training.”</p>
<p>Perry did a brief stint at Save the Children, a global NGO working in data-driven maternal and childcare, in 2018. In 2019, she was appointed senior advisor to Governor Newsom on Health and Human Services. Remember, California is a partner with Stewards of Change, and one of three pilot states in addition to Connecticut and Virginia to build interoperable systems of Health and Human Service Data linked with the Fusion Centers and the National Council on Crime and Delinquency.</p>
<p>In May of 2022 she became executive director of Screens and Kids on Long Island, an international group working tapped to make the case for evidence-based child digital media. There’s a full court press on to groom preschoolers to grow up to be good, compliant digital citizens of the Metaverse. “Helping children lead healthy lives in a digital world.” Not quite an icosahedron in that logo, but it has a crystalline quality to it. Screens and Kids, Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory (DNA and Eugenics Record Office), and Stewards of Change area within a 13-mile drive of one another on Long Island.</p>

<p>Over the past five years, we’ve seen a nationwide surge in media coverage and third sector advocacy around early childhood education, building brains neuroscience, and device-based parenting “solutions” labelled “evidence-based.” Low-income children, particularly Black and Brown children and immigrant and refugee children, are being groomed as human capital assets against whose futures profitable gambles will be made. In 2018, the <a href="https://earlysuccess.org/2019-california-home-visiting/">CalWORKs Home Visiting Initiative</a> was launched in California targeting expectant parents or families with children under age two in the home. The program saw a significant expansion in 2020 with financial support from Governor Newsom, which aligns with his expansion of pre-k services to include funding in the 2021 budget for <a href="https://edsource.org/2021/how-californias-new-universal-transitional-kindergarten-program-will-be-rolled-out/657818">transitional kindergarten</a> for all four year olds in the state. <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/education-policy/edcentral/home-visits-universal-pre-k-and-trauma-informed-care-california-dreams-big-for-families/">Trauma screenings</a> have also been prioritized, because <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2019/02/05/ace-adverse-childhood-experience-scores-part-of-the-pay-for-success-plan/">ACEs</a> (Adverse Childhood Experiences) scores generate pay-for-success cost-offsets that can be leveraged to finance the digital interventions being sold to us as quick fixes for broken children to minimize their future burden on society.</p>
<p>Among those lobbying for program expansion was the Alliance for Early Success with a deep stable of “investors” in human capital including Ballmer Group, the Buffett Early Childhood Fund, the Gates Foundation, Heising Simons Foundation, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Pritzker Family Foundation, Davide and Lucille Packard Foundation, and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. William Keith Kellogg was the brother and business partner of John Harvey Kellogg, 7th Day Adventist entrepreneur in wellness and cereal. John was also a benefactor of the Eugenics Records Office at Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory on Long Island and a founder of the <a href="http://eugenicsarchive.ca/discover/tree/553e95f955b4ad0326000001">Race Betterment Foundation</a>.</p>

<p>Management of children’s behaviors, soft skills and character training, is a keen interest of researchers. Why? Because social impact investment equations have been designed to use that data by <a href="https://wymancenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Belfield-et-al-2015.pdf">Clive Belfield</a> and <a href="https://heckmanequation.org/">James Heckman</a>. Social-Emotional Learning data lakes will also help “humanize” AI. A presentation about PBS Kids apps and social-emotional learning data harvest was hosted by the Human Capital and Economic Opportunity at the University of Chicago in 2018. The eleven minutes of content in the clip was drawn from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRUGsOAsc2w&amp;t=0s">two-hour presentation</a>. The target audience for interventions are low-income families, children in Head Start and their mothers. It’s a warmed-over story where the well-off set expectations for uplift of the poor to increase their value to society.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The following issues are touched upon:</p>
 
 How to get children who cannot yet read to be motivated create accounts on the pre-k apps. 
 Use of facial recognition and behavioral biometrics to determine who is using the app. 
 Programmed digital nudges by NPCs in game that encourage pro-social behaviors like sharing. 
 Incentivizing children by using gamification, leaderboards, and digital sticker books. 
 Interest in getting access to data about the parents and the child’s environment in the home. 
 Interest in advancing techniques for parental behavior change. 
 Where to advertise to parents to get them to download the apps. 
 Correlating in-game behaviors with OCEAN 5 personality traits. 
 Importance of child engagement above all else, and the amount of competition among games. 
 Using many different pots of data with “high-value tidbits” to find patterns and make predictions. 
 
<p>Shockingly, James Heckman, a professor of economics and Nobel prize winner, floats the idea during the presentation that parents be incentivized to get their children to regularly log in to PBS kids’ educational apps by using gamification and pornography for the adults.</p>
<p>What kind of social norms are being advanced in this oak-paneled room full of elite researchers? Who are they to be making decisions about appropriate outcomes for vulnerable children in this automated dystopia? Acknowledging that management of children on digital leaderboards as human capital assets is a direct extension of the eugenics practices of the twentieth century will perhaps get service providers and families to adopt a frame that prioritizes caution in the face policies that on the surface appear benevolent, but upon deeper investigation are found to serve other interests than those of families.</p>
<p>Thus far pre-k and home visits are optional, but for how long?</p>
<p>Home-visit programs may set up pregnant women and mothers of preschoolers for intrusive social prescriptions and collection of personally identifiable information on families. We see in the image below taken from the report “Big Ideas: Little Learners: Early Childhood Trends Report 2019” that a 13% return on investment is anticipated for investments managing children as impact commodities. The children must first be blockchained to create the interoperability needed to fulfill the requirements of the impact finance deals. This is another possible use case for Robert Hertzberg’s proposed California Trust Framework.</p>

<p>California is the most populous state in the nation with a quarter of child residents under the age of five living in poverty. As we reflect on the techno-solutions being offered to engineer the lives of those in great need, we need to realize humanity hasn’t evolved much beyond the days of Evans, Holmes, Coffee, Terman, and Jordan. In the name of “human betterment” will we profile the next generation into a mixed reality panopticon and pretend we were doing them a good turn? Managing people in an age of automation will be about managing behaviors and mental states under conditions of unimaginable social stress. It should come as no surprise that creative debt finance innovators have come up with a system that will allow them to profit from this dehumanizing transition.</p>

         From Poker to Protocols                <p>BySam Eifling</p><p>PublishedJune 28, 2022</p>            <p>A lifelong competitor, Bryan Pellegrino is turning what might be crypto’s biggest challenge into his own game: connecting all blockchains securely, cheaply and efficiently.
</p>       



 
 
   
<p>In 2014 Bryan Pellegrino was one of the world’s best poker players, winning more money than ever—and having the most boring year of his life. The change felt sudden. After tens of thousands of hours of grinding online, and a big finish at the 2012 World Series of Poker, only fools or those new to the game would now play him online. What had once been his life’s great pursuit, working to outwit and outplay other poker stars, was reduced to a chore. Pellegrino sat in his apartment in Vancouver, British Columbia, staring at his laptop, playing rote perfection, pouncing on the rookies’ mistakes. “It was mind-numbing,” he says. “I felt like a monkey clicking buttons.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pellegrino had begun playing online poker at 15, well below legal gambling age, using an account his dad set up for him. Over a dozen years, poker helped Pellegrino travel the world for tournaments and for fun. He accumulated more than $500,000 in World Series of Poker purses alone. He spent 10 hours a day, for years, clicking through a half-dozen hands at a time. He’d won a fortune in return. But by 2014, his reputation had caught up with him, and there was no joy, challenge or purpose in playing the newbies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It felt incredible, he says, to be so good at something so hard. But poker had become a cul-de-sac. He knew, after he’d played this hand, there was going to be another, and another. There was no bigger point, no end goal. Once there was no one worth playing, the game wasn’t enough for Pellegrino. “I was just trying to be the best,” he says now. “Once I got there, I realized, hey—there’s no leverage. There’s no anything. I hadn’t realized until then, you need to focus on the utility payoff of what you’re doing.” So he closed his laptop and went looking for a payoff he could measure in more than money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Today Pellegrino is the co-founder and CEO of LayerZero Labs, a company that set out to solve one of the most fundamental, yet most difficult problems in the world of blockchains and cryptocurrencies. Pellegrino and his LayerZero co-founders Ryan Zarick and Caleb Banister—best friends since they worked together in computer network research labs at the University of New Hampshire—built a protocol that enables blockchains to communicate with each other frictionlessly, so people and programs can move assets or information across chains cheaply, swiftly and securely. They’ve named their new venture LayerZero because it offers a foundation with which any application on any blockchain (layer 1 or layer 2) can integrate. The ability for users to send information between blockchains is central to the promise of Web3, which some think will be the future of the internet. In this vision, the internet is organized on decentralized global ledgers called blockchains, allowing people to connect without central servers to store permanent digital records.</p>



<p>The problem Pellegrino, Zarick and Banister are solving with LayerZero is that, today, moving data between two chains is expensive, tedious and insecure. Blockchains have been in operation since the late 2000s, each uniquely coded to excel at a different task. But no single blockchain has emerged as the standard. Even as the larger chains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana grow, dozens of others keep popping up. For <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFnF1dgbF00">data to move between blockchains</a> today, a message has to wind through a blockchain bridge, a series of centralized servers. Navigating a bridge can require clicking dozens of times through multiple programs for anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour. And it requires that a user have a coin or token on the destination blockchain to pay for the transaction fee, called gas, which can add up quickly. Another issue LayerZero is solving for is security. Pellegrino found the state of bridge security technology “horrifying” when he looked into it in 2020. To move, for example, $1,000 worth of cryptocurrency from blockchain A to blockchain B, a person has to send a message from A through a middle chain, which validates the transaction, and then that middle chain tells B that A has moved the funds. But those middle chains make enticing targets for hackers to attack. Cryptocurrency hacks cost more than $14 billion in 2021. The weakness of existing bridge solutions make the entire crypto ecosystem vulnerable, and could hobble its wider adoption.</p>



<p>Inspired by the thrill of a great challenge, Pellegrino, Zarick and Banister began writing the code in early 2021 that would become LayerZero. Not a bridge, but rather a new kind of messaging layer, they believed the tool they were working to create would make all of Web3—apps, money, security, games—better. For average users, their protocol would run as seamlessly in the background as standardized tracks beneath a railcar. Pellegrino had finally found something with meaning, with a global payoff, in his words, a “Holy Grail” problem to solve. It was something worth his time in a way poker could never be.</p>



<p>Along the way, they caught the attention of others in the space. Sequoia Capital partner Shaun Maguire, who earned a physics PhD from CalTech, and had been tracking blockchain technology’s progression since the late ’90s, was following them. And after <a href="https://twitter.com/PrimordialAA/status/1451632573310857216">a notable tweet</a>&nbsp;from Pellegrino in October of 2021, he and Sequoia partner Michelle Bailhe prompted the firm in 2022 to co-lead a $135 million Series A+ fundraising round. “LayerZero’s technology is the glue of crypto,” Maguire says. “It is the thing that stitches the rest of crypto together. The collective value is much, much greater than the sum of its parts. Bryan wants all of crypto to win, wants to make every pocket of crypto more valuable.”</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Danbury, New Hampshire, had fewer than 1,000 residents when Pellegrino was born, and to him, it felt like a significant portion were his cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandparents. By age 4, he’d already sized up his hometown, says his mother, Audrey, and declared that one day he wanted to live in a place where people were more different from one another. By age 6, he was such an evident math prodigy that his parents bought him a guitar, thinking that if he was going to be an outlier, he’d at least have music to share with others. Their worry was misplaced. Pellegrino was also unusually empathetic. Audrey recalls a youth soccer game when a larger kid crashed into Pellegrino hard enough to send him sprawling. “Don’t worry,” she told her son, “The bigger they are, the harder they fall.” He stopped playing to correct her, saying, “Mom, that is not nice.”</p>



<p>Pellegrino’s dad, Steven, was a UPS driver who got up early and came home late, so Friday and Saturday nights at the Pellegrinos’ were special, and all about games. The four siblings, Deanna, Manie, Bryan and Angela, bonded over long hours playing Risk, Monopoly, Stratego and bid whist. Pellegrino was a game savant, always willing to play, and winning almost all the time, at almost all costs, even if he had to stay up all night to do it. His family didn’t know it then, but these ordinary game nights would come to shape Pellegrino’s life and livelihood.</p>



<p>In high school he was a good kid—he took after his parents, abstaining from smoking or drinking—though he was not above reproach. When he was 15, Pellegrino spent a week at Georgetown University as part of the Presidential Classroom program, wherein bright high schoolers toured the nation’s capital and met political leaders. The idea was to inspire kids to go into public service. Instead, Pellegrino got into poker. A fellow participant invited him to play and Pellegrino bought in with $20 his mom had given him as spending money. His childhood obsession with games honed his sense of risk and strategy, which paid off almost immediately. Before the night was over, he’d turned $20 into $60, which he spent on a Georgetown sweatshirt that he’s pretty sure he still has. When he got home, he handed his dad another $50 to get his first online account started.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Throughout high school, Pellegrino ran track, wrestled—and played online poker. Senior year, he barely studied and still graduated third in his class. He chose the University of New Hampshire out of frugality as much as anything. But the decision worked out. It was through working at a networking lab that he got close to Zarick and Banister, who would become his lifelong friends and LayerZero co-founders. And the college broadened his horizons. When he was 19, he applied to a study abroad trip to Budapest, Hungary, at the insistence of his brother-in-law, who had done the same trip years before and loved it. Pellegrino submitted his application at the deadline, got accepted, and truly left home for the first time. “I cried like a baby when I dropped him off,” Audrey says. “He cried like a baby. We never thought that he would never return home.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>During his first week in Budapest, Pellegrino lived in a hostel with fellow students while they were expected to find their own apartments for the semester. Pellegrino was in an elevator one day when the doors opened for Melanie, a French architecture student. She saw him and thought, “Oh, no. This is trouble,” she remembers with a laugh. With a mini French-to-English dictionary in her pocket, Melanie got into a cab with Pellegrino, and they spent the day together. “Our first conversation, she had to look up every word, one at a time, with this little book,” Pellegrino remembers. “I don’t know what it was, but it was definitely there for sure.” Melanie asked him to split an apartment with her, strictly as roommates. That arrangement, she says, lasted about a week. They were married two years later.</p>



<p>In Budapest, Pellegrino earned enough money playing online poker to justify dropping out of school. He gave himself six months to make it as a pro or resume computer science studies. When Pellegrino told his family he wasn’t going back to school, his mother remembers telling him that she’d support him no matter what, so long as he kept his nose clean, paid his taxes, and stayed safe. “He could do anything he wanted,” Audrey says. “If he goes busto—that’s his word—he knows he can come home. There’s always home. He has a very tight-knit family.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>From this moment, until 2011, when America outlawed playing online poker for money, Pellegrino played poker 70 hours a week, most of the time at a computer. He was obsessed with the game, optimizing his performance and learning to make decisions about risk and reward in .3 seconds, over and over and over. He and Melanie traveled the world, hitting 80 countries, often while lugging a full-size computer tower across borders. Melanie remembers customs agents stopping them at airports, insisting that the computer proved Pellegrino must be traveling for work. But he explained he was a dedicated online poker player—and that’s just for fun, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>When America outlawed playing poker online for money, the Pellegrinos were living in Austin, Texas. Because online poker is where players could make the most money and have the most frequent opportunities to play, Pellegrino was ostensibly out of work. He agreed to join the fantasy sports betting site BuzzDraft and had become CEO by the time the company was acquired by another fantasy sports betting company shortly thereafter. Then, he went to Las Vegas to play in the World Series of Poker in 2012, where he finished second in one of the events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By 2013, Pellegrino had some money in the bank and was curious about the Bitcoin buzz between his brother and his brother-in-law. Cryptocurrency caught Pellegrino’s attention for a number of reasons, one of which was that it was a new kind of way to place a bet. He understood the cryptography and distributed systems that undergirded the blockchain, and he felt like he was good at crunching the odds of a payoff. And like poker, some cryptocurrencies paid out, and some went bust. The three men bought computers to mine Bitcoin, but then the cryptocurrency’s value plummeted in 2014. Its exchange collapsed, a Bitcoin Foundation board member was arrested for money laundering, and hackers repeatedly stole hundreds of millions of dollars. It had been a bad bet at the time. Pellegrino, now living in Canada, where online poker was legal, went back to playing. This is when he found himself listless, absent challenging competition, when he should have been having the year of his life professionally. “The game had changed,” Pellegrino remembers. Unlike so many other pros, he wasn’t driven by the money. He wanted a competitive challenge. And one with a meaningful payoff.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>For about three months circa 2015, Pellegrino actually contemplated retirement. He and Melanie took their infant son around the world to look for their ideal home, hitting 12 countries in 12 months. He was restless but not anxious. Then one day, as he watched YouTube, the algorithm served up a video of a DeepMind artificial intelligence called Agent57 playing Atari. Agent57 had, in fact, “learned” to play all 57 Atari games starting from zero, just pixels on the screen. As the AI failed and failed, it learned, and quickly taught itself to surpass any human. “This was one of the first steps toward artificial general intelligence, something that could take information with no context and learn to be incredible at it,” Pellegrino says. “That was super exciting. That got me thinking about reinforcement learning generally—machine learning, AI. Just excited about the field.” Pellegrino, awed, thought back on how the fantasy sports players he’d seen at BuzzDraft racked up millions in wins without the aid of machine learning. “I said, ‘That’s crazy. There has to be a better way.’ So I looked at all the sports and said, ‘OK, I hate baseball, but it has the best data set. Let’s go with that.’”</p>



<p>After their year of travel, the Pellegrinos settled back in Vancouver—it had a school the family loved—and Pellegrino found himself drawn to work on the baseball-AI idea. It was another puzzle to solve, a game to design. Pellegrino hypothesized that he could build an AI to crunch the data points to predict a pitcher’s pitch-by-pitch performance against a batter. It had been years since he’d routinely written code, but one thing led to another and, as can happen to a guy like Pellegrino, he wound up creating a machine learning tool he sold to several Major League Baseball clubs in early 2016. He still relishes the day when the phone rang and on the other end, ready to talk business, was Billy Beane, the Oakland A’s executive immortalized in “Moneyball” for his dedication to statistical analysis. Pellegrino had addressed a big problem for a few pro sports teams. But he wanted to work at something, and be the best at something, that would matter more.</p>



<p>He was becoming increasingly curious about cryptocurrency as a place to do that work. In late 2016, Pellegrino bought into Bitcoin with “a renewed conviction.” What started as an investment turned into Pellegrino building on the Ethereum blockchain, reading white papers and connecting with the community. He immediately saw how hard it was for people to start new cryptocurrencies. “It was a miserable process,” he says, one inaccessible for anyone without coding sophistication. At this time, a friend introduced him to Daniel Chen, then an engineer at Andreessen Horowitz. In 2017, the two friends decided to pursue something big—writing code that could democratize cryptocurrency launches. They launched OpenToken in 2018 as a platform that offered regular people the chance to launch their own cryptocurrencies. But both Pellegrino and Chen moved on to other projects as the work they did with OpenToken led to product pivots and an acquisition. Pellegrino turned back to experimenting with AI and gaming.</p>



<p>In the summer of 2020, he had a breakthrough, further solidifying his credibility as a master of games and machine learning. Pellegrino, his longtime best friends and co-founders Zarick and Banister, along with Facebook AI’s Noam Brown, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10442">published a research paper</a> that described their poker-playing AI, named Supremus. The AI clobbered the world’s previous best poker AI, and some of the world’s top pros. A key insight: players do not always optimize their odds, but are likely to play in such a way that gives them the fewest regrets about the outcome. Their paper has since been cited in game theory research published by DeepMind, the Alphabet AI lab. “All my life, I’ve just liked to work on hard problems,” Pellegrino says. “More than anything else, that’s what attracts me.”</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>In the fall of 2020, the Binance Smart Chain launched. As a rare non-Bitcoin, non-Ethereum blockchain product, it fascinated Pellegrino. The cryptocurrency exchange built a new blockchain designed to make it relatively easy, cheap, and fast for users to conduct transactions among more than 300 cryptocurrency tokens. Pellegrino decided he wanted to test this new tool. He lassoed Zarick and Banister and began, as so many technologists have over the years, by trying to create a game. The goal was to leverage the quick throughput and cheap transaction cost of Binance Smart Chain to play this game they’d invented—generating a bunch of gladiators to fight to the death—and in so doing create an NFT of the winning gladiator. The NFT would be stored on the Ethereum chain, a popular chain for NFTs but relatively inefficient and expensive for the work of gameplay. They soon realized that they had to move the NFT more or less manually, using a bridge they built themselves. The other bridges they could’ve used were too susceptible to hacking. They’d hit upon an aha moment: If existing bridges were a liability for moving an NFT, the risk in moving actual money was enormous.</p>



<p>They realized they needed more than a bridge. They needed a foundational code layer the bridge could be built upon to make it secure. But, more than a decade into the blockchain revolution, such a thing didn’t exist. And other multi-chain bridges were only moving “wrapped” cryptocurrencies, not NFTs or other kinds of data. Pellegrino says the most fundamental need was to get a generic message—the simplest, barest information packets—to operate across blockchains. What solution could facilitate that kind of interoperability among every sort of chain moving any kind of data? Pellegrino had found his big project, a challenge that could pay off in a way that no poker hand ever could.&nbsp;</p>



LAYERZERO



<p></p>



<p>The LayerZero team spent months hardening their messaging protocol, and in late May 2021 <a href="https://layerzero.network/pdf/LayerZero_Whitepaper_Release.pdf">released a white paper</a>, “LayerZero: Trustless Omnichain Interoperability Protocol.” The paper laid out how their free, open-source protocol would be the first to enable direct transactions across all blockchains while remaining decentralized, transparent and permanent. They never shopped their project as a company; Pellegrino smiles when he says LayerZero never created a sales deck. But stealthily, Pellegrino, Zarick and Banister were leveling up. When the renowned co-founder of SushiSwap, who goes by 0xMaki, left that decentralized exchange, he could’ve taken a job anywhere, Pellegrino says. But Pellegrino dropped him a Twitter DM and soon coaxed him aboard to integrate new clients and find new business for LayerZero.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October 2021, feeling exuberant at the 0xMaki hire, Pellegrino tweeted a fateful claim: “We’re legitimately assembling the greatest team in crypto and nobody even knows about it yet.” Sequoia partner Michelle Bailhe saw it and sent a DM. “I didn’t know him,” Bailhe says, “but his contributions to crypto Twitter were optimistic and interesting. Plus, he had a Pudgy Penguin as his profile picture. When Shaun and I met him, Bryan’s intellectual horsepower and clarity of thought on one of the hardest problems in crypto was immediately compelling to us.” As it happened, Maguire had been an angel investor in OpenToken, and Chen, Pellegrino’s former co-founder at OpenToken, would soon become a visiting fellow at Sequoia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bailhe and Maguire recognized that LayerZero was, in one sense, tackling a massive, future-internet-shaping problem. It was, in another sense, inventing plumbing. The internet today is built on similarly boring breakthroughs. Before the creation of Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (known as TCP/IP), the varied intranets that linked universities and government offices in different countries had no way to transmit data to each other. Further back, people standardized electrical currents, fire hoses and hydrants and myriad other things in which interchangeability determines the usefulness of two things together. They saw that Pellegrino wanted to build this kind of basic infrastructure, something worth his time and expertise because it had such a huge potential payoff for so many. And when he came to Sequoia to negotiate the terms of business, Maguire says Pellegrino showed that same spirit of wanting everyone to come out ahead.</p>



<p>“Heads-up poker is basically the same skill as negotiating,” Maguire says. “It’s reading people, knowing when they’re bluffing, all that. So despite the fact that Bryan has that skill, when he negotiated with us, he didn’t play poker, which was very interesting. He was just 100 percent upfront and direct. He said all of his constraints and basically implied, ‘Look, if I wanted to go negotiate and be a jerk and all that, I could do it. But I want to build a partnership with you guys.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In March of this year, Pellegrino, Zarick and Banister launched their own proof-of-concept in Stargate, an application built on LayerZero that helps to move funds between blockchains smoothly. In its first 10 days, people moved more than $250 million worth of crypto assets using Stargate, which helped to get other applications to adopt LayerZero. Pellegrino and others in the crypto community saw it as an unmitigated success. His inbox is full, he says, of potential partners. But outreaches aren’t the same as customers or collaborators.</p>



<p>What lies ahead is anyone’s guess. Hundreds of developers are now working on applications that incorporate the free, open-source code of LayerZero, promising to flatten the silos that individual blockchains have built. Take a platform like OpenSea, the largest marketplace for NFTs. It had built three parallel versions of itself, effectively, one each for users of Ether, Solana, or Polygon. But none of the versions could transfer cryptocurrencies, information or digital art between them easily or affordably because they were all on different blockchains. By adopting LayerZero, OpenSea could allow a user holding any of those coins to spend freely on anything on the platform.</p>



<p>Pellegrino’s time these days is spent on business development, strategy and honing the product. And he now has three kids ranging in age from 8 years to 11 months, so he also spends time getting them up for breakfast, fed and out the door, playing little word games along the way. “In those short moments with my kids… when we’re in the car, we’re not just sitting, we’re doing something. (My oldest) loves this game where we throw out a letter, and on the entire commute, we’ll just throw words back and forth on that letter.” Of course, Pellegrino has also been playing cards with his oldest son since the boy was four. He says he’s a family man like his dad, working to spark in his kids the same excitement for games that his dad instilled in him. “I try to celebrate even a small moment,” he says of the car rides. “Then I go off and I do my thing.”</p>



<p>At work, he has no direct reports and no limit to the number of ways his platform could plug into the next version of the internet. “We’ve built something awesome,” he says. “But there’s a lot of awesome technologies out there that don’t get used. For us now, it’s purely expansion and adoption. It’s getting all of the largest projects in the world to build on top of us. To get every developer who’s thinking cross-chain, to think of us.</p>



<p>“The prior stage was launch, which was great. But as soon as you launch? People forget about the past. And now you’re in a totally new game.”</p>

<p>The birth of Bitcoin led to a Cambrian explosion of blockchains with different design decisions and use cases. While these distributed ledgers serve different purposes, they existed (and still exist to a certain degree) as silos with limited meaningful interaction.</p><p>Similar to the Internet which facilitates different types of computers in different parts of the world to communicate with one another, a similar technology that acts as the connective tissue between blockchains is necessary for true value accrual. The Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol aims to serve this&nbsp;purpose.</p><p>IBC is a universal interoperability protocol that allows two different blockchains to communicate with one another. IBC guarantees reliable, ordered, and authenticated communication.</p><p>Perhaps one of the most important properties of IBC is trust-minimization. In blockchains, the property of trust-minimization is inherently linked to security. No distributed system is entirely ‘trustless’. Therefore, the question of security boils down to who or what is trusted, and how can that trust be violated i.e., what does it take for the trusted entity to be corrupted?</p><p>In this sense, and unlike most bridging solutions, IBC uses no trusted third parties. This means that if you trust two particular chains to use the functions they provide (and by default their consensus mechanisms), then there is no additional trust assumption required while using IBC to interact between said&nbsp;chains.</p><p>IBC is also more than just a bridge that facilitates token transfers. It is a general-purpose message passing protocol. This means that any form of data can be communicated over&nbsp;IBC.</p> How does IBC&nbsp;work? <p>In order to understand how IBC works, it is important to separate the two different layers of IBC — 1) the transport layer and 2) the application layer.</p>High-level depiction of IBC packet flow between two blockchains Transport Layer <p>Messages communicated over IBC are transported within <a href="https://computersciencewiki.org/index.php/Data_packet">data packets</a>. And the transport layer is responsible for transporting, authenticating, and ordering these data&nbsp;packets.</p><p>The transport layer does not specify anything about what the data in the packets should be or how they should be interpreted by a receiving chain. From the transport layer’s point of view, information within data packets are just random&nbsp;bytes.</p><p>The key components of the transport layer are light clients, relayers, connections, and channels.</p><p>A light client is a lightweight representation of a blockchain. Unlike a <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos/blob/master/VALIDATORS_FAQ.md#what-is-a-full-node">full node</a>, light clients do not store the entire history of all the messages contained in a blockchain. Neither do they execute transactions. Rather, light clients are designed to connect to a full node, and verify block headers (a summary of the data contained within a block). This allows light clients to be efficient in terms of storage and computation.</p><p>Two independent blockchains A and B interacting over IBC have <a href="https://medium.com/tendermint/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-tendermint-light-client-f80d03856f98">light clients</a> of the counterparty chain. This means that A has a light client on its blockchain which acts as a lightweight representation of B’s blockchain. When A wants to communicate a certain message ‘X’ with B, it sends the header of the block in which that message exists, along with a commitment proof of that message to B. The commitment proof is used to verify the presence or absence of a particular message on A. Using the block header and proof, B cryptographically verifies that A did indeed perform X. It is this use of light clients in IBC that allow blockchains to exchange messages with one another without the need for a trusted third&nbsp;party.</p><p>But A and B do not directly send these messages/data packets between each other. Instead, when A wishes to send a message to B, it commits or stores a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hash.asp">hash</a> of a data packet containing the message in its <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/16447/state-machine">state machine</a>. Relayers, which are off-chain processes, constantly observe for such messages. When they see that A has committed a message intended for B in its state machine, they simply pick up this message and pass it onto B. Note that relayers are permissionless and therefore can be run by&nbsp;anyone.</p><p>Connections are responsible for connecting light clients on two different chains. And channels are conduits for transferring packets between modules on these different chains. Therefore, while connections are chain-specific, channels are module-specific. Each channel end has a unique channel ID (and a port ID) that is used to accurately route packets between two&nbsp;modules.</p> Application Layer <p>The application layer is what end-users interact with. It consists of various applications that use the transport layer to build on top. The transport layer does not specify how data packets need to be interpreted. This role is performed by the application layer.</p><p>IBC supports a variety of applications such as fungible/non-fungible token transfers, cross-chain oracle feeds, <a href="https://interchain-io.medium.com/welcome-to-the-ibc-gang-lets-talk-f469883e0ffe">Interchain Accounts</a>, Interchain Queries, <a href="https://interchain-io.medium.com/ibc-relaying-as-a-service-the-in-protocol-incentivization-story-9922c7b953f0">Fee middleware</a> (to incentivise relayers), etc.</p><p>For example, the IBC-level application for token transfers — termed <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/blob/master/spec/app/ics-020-fungible-token-transfer/README.md">Interchain Standard 20</a> (ICS 20) — specifies how data packets should be structured and how they are to be interpreted by receiving chains. In the case of fungible token transfers, data packets contain information regarding the sender, receiver, amount, and denomination (IBC denom). The denom field traces the path that a particular token has gone through to reach a certain chain. Logic regarding how the packets are to be acted upon are also specified by ICS&nbsp;20.</p><p>A simple analogy that can be helpful in understanding IBC is that of the mail delivery system. When you send a letter to someone, you send it through a postal service that collects the envelope containing the letter from you and deposits it into the recipient’s mailbox. The recipient then opens said envelope and reads your letter. The transport layer of IBC can be thought of as the postal service. The postal service does not tell you what the contents of the letter should be, or how the recipient should interpret your&nbsp;message.</p><p>Neither do they know what the contents of the envelope are. It only performs the action of collecting the envelope from point A and sending it to point B. The envelope itself can be thought of as IBC packets that are sent from one chain to another. And on this envelope, you would specify the address of the recipient. This is similar to how IBC packets contain information regarding who sent the packet (specified by the channel ID) and to whom it is intended for (specified by the counterparty channel ID). In the end, it is the receiver (application) that is responsible for opening the envelope (data packet) and interpreting the contents of the&nbsp;letter.</p> What can IBC be used&nbsp;for? <p>Apart from fungible token transfers, two other IBC-level applications include Interchain Accounts, and <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/interchain-security-is-coming-to-the-cosmos-hub-f144c45fb035">Interchain Security</a>.</p><p>Interchain Accounts facilitate chain to chain interaction while remaining on a single interface. This effectively means that any action such as transfers, staking, or voting on governance proposals which can be performed on B (called the ‘host chain’), can be performed from A (called the ‘controller chain’). Interchain Accounts significantly increases composability within the Interchain by improving user-experience.</p><p>Interchain Security is the Cosmos Ecosystem’s version of shared security. It enables a blockchain to lease security from another chain in a completely opt-in manner. This is especially useful for new chains that can choose to tap into the security offered by an already established network such as the Cosmos Hub. Interchain Security removes the need for chains to bootstrap their own validator set.</p><p>The scope of applications that can be performed using IBC as a core primitive is consistently growing. Cross-chain NFT transfers and Interchain Queries (where one chain can read state from another chain) are currently being developed and will soon be production ready.</p> What problem does IBC&nbsp;solve? <p>In a sentence, IBC solves the problem of blockchains existing as silos with limited interaction. Interoperability between blockchains is necessary for maximal value&nbsp;accrual.</p><p>Each blockchain caters to one or more specialized use cases. If these use cases cannot be leveraged across multiple blockchains, it severely handicaps their utility. The breakthrough that the internet provided is that information can easily flow across different parts of the world with ease. Similarly, the utility of different blockchains need to be freely accessible across multiple platforms.</p><p>For example, users might want to use stablecoins from one blockchain, to generate yield through a liquidity pool (LP) on a decentralized exchange (DEX) that exists on another blockchain. Or they might want to leverage the privacy preserving properties that a different blockchain provides. Interoperability between chains are required to realize these use cases and&nbsp;more.</p><p>IBC not only solves the problem of interoperability, but it does so in a trust-minimized, secure, extensible, and general purpose&nbsp;manner.</p> How can I as an application developer use&nbsp;IBC? <p>The modular nature of the Cosmos SDK prevents developers from having to concern themselves with some of the layers of abstractions such as light clients, connections, proof verification, etc. For developers, the most relevant requirements and functions to familiarize with are <a href="https://ibc.cosmos.network/main/ibc/overview.html#channels">channels</a> and <a href="https://ibc.cosmos.network/main/ibc/overview.html#ports">ports</a>.

Before joining Discreet Labs, Warren led crypto products at <a href="https://ripple.com/">Ripple</a> for over 4 years, working on open protocols such as XRP Ledger, Interledger, &amp; PayString, the RippleX developer platform, and RippleNet’s On-Demand Liquidity enterprise product.</p><p>Prior to Ripple, in 2014, Warren co-founded Hedgy, one of the first DeFi platforms for institutional OTC bitcoin transactions using programmable, escrowed smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p><p>Warren got started in the crypto industry as a hobbyist Bitcoin miner in 2011, back when one could still mine a block with a CPU. Warren earned two bachelor’s degrees from Northwestern and did graduate studies at Harvard. Warren is a regular presence in the blockchain community and press, a frequent public speaker, and has also guest lectured at institutions such as Stanford, Northwestern, UC Berkeley, Wharton, University College London, and the University of Zurich on topics related to blockchain, cryptocurrency, fintech, and technology more&nbsp;broadly.</p> Dr. Weikeng Chen Becomes Chief Scientist at Discreet&nbsp;Labs Weikeng Chen, Chief Scientist at Discreet&nbsp;Labs<p>Dr. Weikeng (pronounced “waken”) Chen has also joined Discreet Labs as Chief Scientist where he will be leading cryptography research and development. Weikeng recently completed his Ph.D. at U.C. Berkeley’s world-renowned Security &amp; Applied Cryptography Group, where he focused his research on systems and applications of ZKPs and multi-party computation (MPC) with an emphasis on efficient implementations. Beyond his academic research, Weikeng has also been a core contributor to several ZKP open-source projects implemented in Rust including: <a href="https://github.com/arkworks-rs/">arkworks</a>, an ecosystem for developing and programming with zkSNARKs; <a href="https://rustrepo.com/repo/scipr-lab-marlin">Marlin</a>, a Rust library that implements a preprocessing zkSNARK for R1CS with universal and updatable SRS; <a href="https://github.com/AleoHQ/snarkVM">snarkVM</a>, a virtual machine for ZKPs; and <a href="https://dzk.org/">DZK</a>, a decentralized system for practical end-to-end zero-knowledge proofs. Weikeng was also instrumental in implementing ZEXE (Zero-knowledge EXEcution), a ledger-based system for enabling decentralized private computation. He was advised by Professor Raluca Ada Popa, a 2022 ACM Grace Hopper Murray Award&nbsp;winner.</p><p>Dr. Weikeng Chen has already made many voluntary contributions to the Findora open source project, especially <a href="https://github.com/FindoraNetwork/zei">Zei</a>, a cryptographic library of advanced ZKPs. Weikeng is among a small group of cryptographers that have dedicated their academic careers to the technologies that Discreet Labs is building to scale web3&nbsp;privacy.</p> Discreet Labs’&nbsp;Progress <p>In one year’s time, Discreet Labs has shipped multiple exciting protocols, platforms, and products for Findora, including an advanced multi-chain architecture, which combines privacy and scalability on Findora OG (UTXO chain) with programmability and interoperability on Findora X (scalable Web3 privacy solution with full EVM compatibility). Discreet Labs also recently launched Prism, a trustless atomic swap protocol that bridges Findora OG and Findora X. To interoperate Findora’s multi-chain architecture with the growing ecosystem, Discreet Labs launched Rialto, which is a non-custodial bridge between all EVM compatible chains and&nbsp;Findora.</p><p>With the launch of toolkits like <a href="https://wiki.findora.org/docs/components/Prism/Overview">Prism</a> and <a href="https://rialtobridge.io/">Rialto</a>, as well as a cryptographic library of advanced ZKPs, Discreet Labs is now focused on extending Findora privacy to EVM-based dApps with smart contract functionalities. Most recently, on April 22nd, Discreet Labs, in partnership with <a href="https://twitter.com/ColumbusDAO_">Columbus DAO</a>, launched <a href="https://twitter.com/Yellow_Subm">Yellow Submarine</a>, the first Web3 dApp to enable privacy on Ethereum-compatible projects.

 Announcing the Verida Credentials Incubator &amp; the inspiring first projects coming to&nbsp;market Announcing the Verida Credentials Incubator<p>Self-sovereignty is a key objective of Web3. “Not your keys, not your crypto” is a common mantra. Verifiable credentials are a way to bring self-sovereignty to your identity and build digital attestations in order to access products and services, both on and off the blockchain.</p><p>Enabling privacy preserving credentials on public blockchain is critical to enable regulatory compliance and unlock trillions of dollars of capital from traditional finance to flow into Decentralized Finance&nbsp;(DeFi).</p><p>Verida offers the world’s first mobile wallet that incorporates a blockchain wallet, verifiable credential support and a decentralized database storage network that is capable of storing verifiable credentials in a regulatory compliant manner.</p><p>As such, we have seen an explosion of interest in recent months to utilise our wallet and storage network to build credential related products and services.</p><p>The Verida Credential Incubator is bringing together a collection of these organizations and emerging technologies to enable the rapid development of end-to-end credential products and proof of concepts.</p><p>These projects are supporting use cases such&nbsp;as:</p>  Blockchain enabled KYC for Decentralized Exchanges, DAO’s and DeFi lending and insurance protocols to become regulatory compliant  Blockchain enabled credit scores for DeFi protocols to enable under collateralized loans  Healthcare worker credentials for nation state healthcare systems to increase trust and efficiency  <p>Verida, along with the technology partners in the incubator program, provide a composable credential technology stack that allows projects to innovate at speed, demonstrate real world use cases and increase interoperability with complementary projects.</p><p>Many of the technical partners are actively participating and helping shape the standards that support verifiable credentials, including the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID-Core</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>.</p><p>Verida is committed to the Verida Vault and the Verida private data storage network continually being upgraded to support these emerging standards as they are ratified and accepted by their respective communities. This will provide a reliable, end-to-end, interoperable technology platform for projects requiring credentials.</p> Current Challenges With Credentials <p>We have been approached by many organizations to help them build out products using verifiable credentials and the Verida technology stack. Through our discussions with these partners, it’s become clear that credential technology is rapidly evolving and projects need help in several&nbsp;ways:</p>  End-to-end infrastructure for testing credential products and new technologies  Accelerating collaboration and adoption between complementary projects  Support to create PoC’s that demonstrate new technology enhancements  <p>Additionally, the technical standards and implementations of verifiable credentials are rapidly evolving. Here are some of the problems being tackled by participants in the incubator, often through involvement with standards working&nbsp;groups.</p>  Private credential storage: Credential holders need the ability to store their credentials in a private database, owned and controlled by the&nbsp;holder.  Business model: Verifiable credentials construct an ecosystem where a user owns data about themselves. This creates challenges around who should pay for the work involved with issuing a credential. The holder or the verifier? How should that payment be privacy preserving? Can the payment be made with fiat and / or&nbsp;crypto?  Interoperability: There’s an emerging Verifiable Credential standard, however there are many varied implementations and lack of definitions in some key areas required for mass adoption. How do we create an architecture that supports both on-chain and off-chain use cases? How can wallets easily support many different credential implementations? Is an NFT a credential?  Revocation: One area lacking clarity is the revocation of credentials. Can or should that occur on the blockchain? Should that remain private with a standardized set of REST API calls? When should revocation occur? When should revocation be&nbsp;checked?  Trust anchors: A credential is signed using the private key of an issuer, which is linked to a public key. This public key is simply letters and numbers. How can an individual be confident their public key is actually controlled by the government, a bank or a healthcare organisation?  On-chain bridging: How can an off-chain Verifiable Credential be used on the blockchain? What are the privacy implications? How can zero-knowledge technology help? What is the role of Oracles? How does an on-chain credential work with revocation and trust anchors? How do we create an architecture that’s multi-chain?  Data connectivity: How can a user’s personal data be consensually obtained and shared (by its rightful owner) in a way that meets the principles of self-sovereignty?  Adoption: Gaining widespread adoption of credentials in the off chain world (Web2) and the on chain world (Web3) requires both technical and business consensus, with an understanding that flexibility of approaches is required for different use&nbsp;cases.   The Verida Credential Incubator: A composable tech stack for&nbsp;Web3 <p>It’s been clear from conversations over the past three months that many projects are coming up against the challenges listed above. Builders and developers need support in different ways.</p>  Projects addressing a technical challenge (ie: revocation) require a full end-to-end credential technology stack where their contribution to a broader solution can be integrated, easy to demo, and rapidly iterated on for end to end proof of concepts.  Projects have customers wanting to issue credentials or build new tokenized business models with credentials, but lack the end user products, expertise and tools to quickly deliver a solution.  Web2 companies see the huge opportunity emerging with Web3 credentials and want to rapidly build PoC’s and partner with others to launch new products and services.  <p>The Verida Credential Incubator provides a composable credential technology stack. This enables projects to easily collaborate with each other on proof of concepts via a highly flexible technology stack that offers technology consensus.</p>A composable credential technology stack.<p>When combined with some of Verida’s solutions to the challenges above (ie: private data storage, self-custody credential wallet) and open source reference implementations, it provides an ideal environment for projects driving credential innovation across&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>This incubator will assist all participants to better collaborate, innovate and launch new products that drive forward adoption of both credential solutions and broader adoption of Web3 solutions.</p><p><a href="https://www.verida.io/credentials">Learn more about Verida Credentials</a></p> Discover what’s being&nbsp;built <p>Discover the projects Verida is collaborating with to accelerate the development of credential based solutions for&nbsp;Web3.</p>  cheqd — payment — cheqd is a decentralised network for data ownership and value creation.

  Arc Americas: Build for the Next Decade  <p>Applications are now open for the first Americas cohort of Arc, our seed-stage catalyst for outlier founders.</p>  <p>By Jess Lee</p><p>Published June 27, 2022</p>  



 
<p>Earlier this year we <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/sequoia-arc-outliers-wanted/">unveiled</a> Arc, Sequoia’s seed-stage catalyst that helps outlier founders build category-defining companies that will endure. Our first Arc Europe cohort kicked off in May, and today we are thrilled to launch the <a href="https://arc.sequoiacap.com/">application</a> for Arc Americas—for companies headquartered in North America and Latin America.</p>



<p>In addition to receiving initial funding of $1M, each Arc founder participates in a seven-week program introducing them to Company Design, the Sequoia way to start, build and scale enduring companies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Company Design draws on Sequoia’s five decades of experience to teach core concepts in product strategy, go-to-market, culture and more. The curriculum is taught by Sequoia partners along with visiting instructors and builders from our network, including founders and operators of our portfolio companies. To connect the dots between theory and practice, Arc blends foundational lectures, case studies, hands-on practice and a group field trip; the inaugural <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/outlier-founders-of-arc-europe/">Europe cohort</a> visited Stockholm to learn with the Klarna team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Arc also connects participants with a powerful network for mentorship and support, through regular 1:1s with our partners and fellow founders, office hours, peer boards and Sequoia community dinners. In addition, participants get access to our Ampersand app, where Sequoia founders can share advice and explore a library of Company Design resources.</p>



<p>Six weeks into hosting Arc Europe, it’s been incredible to watch how these founders are already bending the arc of their companies, and we are excited for the first Americas cohort to embark on the same transformative journey.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“I love how each week takes a deep dive into a specific topic. Arc has provided me the knowledge, tools and network to bring Xelda to the global stage. I feel there’s no limit to what Xelda can achieve with the support of this group.”</p>India Healy O’Connor, Xelda</blockquote>



<p>Each week of the Arc curriculum is focused on a different question—such as “Who are you building for?” “How do you find traction?” and “How do you win talent?” As we work together to find the answers to those questions, the company’s story takes shape.</p>


 Founders explore Company Design cards at Sequoia’s London office. 


<p>Participants learn to articulate their unique founder story, as well as the stories of their customer, their product, their culture and their business. Each module builds on the next, starting with what makes an outlier and ending with understanding and sharing the scale of your company’s ambition—with critical lessons about how to get there learned along the way.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“I thought I understood customer obsession and all it entailed. Being shown what true customer obsession looks like immediately changed how we see our customers and how we interact with them at every level.”</p>Ciaran O’Keefe, Akeero</blockquote>



<p>In the final week, founders synthesize the company story they’ll use in recruiting critical early hires, and present those stories to a group of Sequoia partners, visiting instructors and potential customers, getting feedback to help them grow.</p>



<blockquote><p>“Learning about the early days of legendary companies directly from the operators and founders who built them has massively raised both my personal ambition and my ambition for what we can achieve with Telescope.”</p>Camin McClusky, Telescope</blockquote>



<p>The first Arc Americas will take place September 12 through October 28, with Weeks 1 and 7 on-site at Sequoia’s offices in Menlo Park, a field trip during week 4 and the rest of the program held remotely. Applications are open through July 22. <a href="https://arc.sequoiacap.com/">Learn more and apply here.</a></p>

  Before the PriFi boom, Bitcoin tumblers and privacy coins were the only way to transact privately on-chain. Are they still valid, safe options?

<p>Before the PriFi (private finance) scene emerged, people looked into Bitcoin tumblers and privacy coins as the only means to exert their on-chain privacy.<br></p><p>Privacy is not only a fundamental right but a foundation upon which many other human rights are built. When we speak of privacy, we speak about privacy of body, correspondence, data, finance, identity, location, and territory. <br></p><p>However, when it comes to financial privacy, there isn’t much we can do to exert our rights, considering the limitations of our traditional financial institutions. When Bitcoin emerged as an alternative to the current global monetary system, there was hope — a hope to uphold our right to financial privacy with a completely new system that doesn’t rely on third-party or trust-based models.<br></p><p>With the rapid rise of blockchain forensics, analysis tools, and the inherent open nature of public blockchain networks, all transactions are open for everyone to see. This makes it impossible to transact privately on an open ledger.<br></p><p>Because of this, many users constantly wonder how to send crypto privately and if this is doable at all. In this article, we’ll explore the popular methods through which one can send crypto privately. These methods can be broadly categorized into three distinct categories, as mentioned before:<br></p>  Crypto mixers (or Bitcoin tumblers)  Privacy coins  Privacy solutions <br>  <p>We will also address common questions on how to use the blockchain privately and how privacy coins and cryptocurrency mixers work. <br></p><p>Let’s get started.</p> How do Bitcoin tumblers work? <p>Crypto mixers, also known as Bitcoin tumblers (even tho they can support a wide variety of crypto assets, including ERC-20 tokens), allow users to transact with their cryptocurrencies privately. They work by pooling together funds from different sources and then allowing users to withdraw from the pool to a destination address of their choice. Since the funds are lumped together and then distributed at random times, examining the trails behind exact coins and their new destinations becomes particularly hard, helping users gain privacy.<br></p><p>The dynamics of crypto mixers can be explained through an analogy: If you take ten $100 notes from ten people and put them all together in a bag, it is unlikely that each person will have the same note they put in if you ask them to retrieve their notes. If you then play around with factors such as the order of retrieval, where notes are delivered, in what order and at what times, it becomes even more difficult to track the transaction trail of an exact note.<br></p><p>Bitcoin tumblers follow a similar model. If more people contribute, it gets progressively harder to trace which note originally belonged to whom. Crypto or Bitcoin mixers create private pools and muddle them before sending coins out to pre-set recipient wallets.</p>Diagram showcasing how crypto mixers work (<a href="https://www.coincenter.org/education/advanced-topics/what-are-mixers-and-privacy-coins/">Source</a>).<p></p><p>There are two main types of cryptocurrency mixers. They are sufficiently different, although they stay true to the founding idea of how Bitcoin mixers work. <br></p>  Centralized mixers (tumblers) will receive your Bitcoin or tokens and send it to a designated address for a fee.<br>  Decentralized mixers are built on the blockchain and use a protocol to receive and send identical amounts of Bitcoins or tokens. They usually use a peer-to-peer or coordinated approach and involve many people, usually in the hundreds.   Benefits of crypto mixers (Bitcoin tumblers) <p>Regular cryptocurrency transactions are traceable and can be sufficiently proven by exchanges. If the coins you bought were involved in illegal activities (such as black market transactions), a crypto exchange could freeze your funds even if you weren’t complicit in that behavior. The traceability of blockchain transactions and KYC verification exercise make it possible for crypto exchanges to figure out and reveal the identity of persons involved in a certain blockchain transaction.<br></p><p>With mixers, the idea of untraceable cryptocurrency transactions is possible.<br></p><p>Cryptocurrency mixers help you stay private as you transact on the blockchain, keeping your dealings away from the public eye, preserving your identity, and obscuring sensitive information on the transactions you have made.</p> Flaws of Bitcoin tumblers <p>If you remove the benefit of keeping transactions and identities private from the picture, little is left regarding the benefits of using cryptocurrency mixers. Firstly, one major flaw of crypto mixers is supporting only one asset type at a time and only in a determinate amount (e.g. only in batches of 1 BTC at a time per mixer), thus severely limiting their privacy prospect.<br></p><p>Most crypto mixing services also operate in legal obscurity and might get you in trouble if your jurisdiction introduces a law against them and applies it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_post_facto_law">retrospectively</a>. On top of that, the unchartered territory of crypto mixers is riddled with scams, seizures, outright fraud, and shutdowns.<br></p><p>Fraudulent services aside, some cryptocurrency mixers provide somewhat flawed privacy. With the help of blockchain forensics and analytics firms, law enforcement agencies can <a href="https://protos.com/bitcoin-mixing-coinjoin-wasabi-chainalysis-samourai-privacy-wallet/">bypass</a> some of the mixing models these services use. This is particularly true when it comes to KYC’d accounts in centralized exchanges, for example.<br></p><p>Major crypto exchanges like Binance have begun blocking crypto transactions originating from mixers or freezing the accounts of users receiving or sending funds connected to mixing services. These companies cite money laundering and compliance with existing <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/as-fatf-regulations-galvanize-crypto-mixing-applications-are-targeted/">regulations</a> as the reasons behind the clampdown, and they are not far from the truth.<br></p><p>Another problem with mixers is – how to make them profitable or even self-sustaining? It is the reason several current schemes are broken. Furthermore, these mixers often request users to withdraw the exact number of coins they put in, and only accept one type of asset. This makes mixers inconvenient and limits the scope of the privacy they're able to provide.<br></p><p>In essence, crypto and Bitcoin tumblers aren’t ideal for financial privacy because their flaws pose some unique challenges, particularly on the compliance side. Even though mixers aren’t inherently bad, they might be better positioned to succeed if they tackled regulatory concerns first and foremost.</p> All about privacy coins <p>A second popular way through which one can send crypto privately is through privacy coins. Unlike open ledger networks such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, privacy coins can offer greater obscurity.<br></p><p>By creating Layer-1 blockchains that are inherently more private than their pseudonymous counterparts, privacy coins go beyond what is possible with crypto mixers. This has attracted attention from privacy enthusiasts, financial regulators, and exchanges alike.<br></p> How do private cryptocurrencies work? <p>Privacy coins keep the flow of money on their networks from the public eye, usually by restricting vital information involved in a transaction (e.g.,wallet addresses, transaction amounts, senders’ and receivers’ wallet addresses, etc.) from public view. If you send a private coin to another address, other users cannot access the details of the transaction, as is the practice with Bitcoin and other open blockchain networks.<br></p><p>Popular examples of privacy coins are Zcash and Monero, which employ different methods to achieve privacy. <br></p><p>Monero uses three different mechanisms to hide transaction data. First, users send or receive coins with stealth addresses, which resemble one-time passwords that cannot be used twice. Then, Monero uses ring signatures to mix up actual transactions with old and fake transactions and ringCT, a privacy technology, to hide the transaction amount.<br></p>Diagram showing how Monero’s untraceable payments work (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/introduction-monero-xmr/">Source</a>).<p></p><p>Zcash employs a different mechanism, incorporating an optional switch between transacting publicly and privately. The network receives a message validating each private transaction via zero-knowledge proofs, and this message withholds any additional information on the transaction. <br></p><p>Other examples of privacy coins include Beam, Grin, and PIVX.<br></p> How can you use privacy coins? <p>On a fundamental level, privacy coins operate in a similar fashion as those within open ledger blockchains. Like their counterparts, they hold qualities such as immutability, verifiability, distribution, and decentralization. As such, you can send or receive privacy coins with a cold or hot wallet, and some are available for trading on centralized exchanges. However, many exchanges like Coinbase UK and <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bittrex-to-delist-privacy-coins-monero-dash-and-zcash-2021-01-01">Bittrex Global</a> have recently delisted privacy coins.<br></p><p>To use Monero ($XMR), for instance, you would need a Monero GUI wallet. After setting up the wallet, you can buy $XMR on a centralized exchange or through a peer-to-peer network and transfer your coins to a Monero wallet. <br></p><p>Other private currencies like Zcash are also available on centralized exchanges, offering optional privacy functions like PrivateSend for Dash and shielded transactions for Zcash (ZEC).</p> Pros and cons of privacy coins <p>Like every innovation in the crypto space, privacy coins have their good side and also come with certain flaws. <br></p><p>For starters, you can keep your financial information away from the public with privacy coins, regaining control over how much information you want to disclose online.<br></p><p>A privacy coin keeps the details of transactions hidden, protecting the identities of both parties against third-party privacy violations. The record of such transactions exists, but the sending and receiving addresses, and the amounts involved, are unavailable to the public.<br></p><p>On the flip side, privacy coins occupy a precarious position on the books of centralized exchanges. Remember that we mentioned how you could access privacy coins through centralized exchanges? Under the Financial Action Task Force Travel Rule, exchanges are required to share information on transactions with law enforcement agencies on request. The absence of clarity on this subject has made certain exchanges <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/state-of-the-privacy-coin-fatf-pushes-delisting-and-exclusion/">delist</a> privacy coins.<br></p><p>Also, the question of legality hangs in the air. In some jurisdictions, privacy coins are as good as illegal, with their trading fully banned in South Korea. The United States is towing a different path, focusing on developing technology to crack privacy on the blockchain. They even offered a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2020/09/14/irs-will-pay-up-to-625000-if-you-can-crack-monero-other-privacy-coins/?sh=3db27e1b85cc">$625,000</a> bounty to anyone who could crack the Monero network.<br><br></p><p>Besides issues around legality, privacy coins seriously lag behind in terms of DeFi innovation. Open ledger networks such as Ethereum, with its Layer-2 solutions, are massively ahead in terms of offering a range of decentralized financial services such as lending, borrowing, stablecoins, etc. This limits the use of privacy coins to simple transactions, making them less attractive in comparison.<br></p><p>The lack of privacy in the existing DeFi ecosystem then raises an important question: what can we do to incorporate privacy into what already exists? This is where Panther comes into the picture to solve a previously unsolvable problem.<br></p> What is Panther Protocol? <p>In the world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), the public nature of most L1 blockchains, while offering transparency, has the side effect of robbing traders of their advantages. Alphas and strategies become non-existent or less effective when surveillance and observation of a DeFi user's strategy and transaction records are possible. <br></p><p>With Panther, DeFi users can keep their transactions private while ensuring compliance with regulations as they trade on the blockchain. Panther integrates with the existing DeFi ecosystems on multiple chains rather than trying to reinvent the parts of them (e.g., protocols, underlying structures, etc.) that are currently most popular and in use. Through this, Panther aims to create a cross-chain interoperable privacy-preserving DeFi ecosystem for all players to thrive.</p> The technology behind Panther <p>Panther restores privacy through zAssets, versions of regular digital assets that enhance privacy with zero-knowledge proofs. <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/26/snarks.html">zk-SNARK</a> cryptography (short for zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge) allows users to provide proof of transactions without giving up sensitive information, ensuring compliance without violating privacy rights.<br></p>Panther’s unique architecture, from <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/panther-protocol-v-1-0-1.pdf">our whitepaper.</a><p></p><p>Panther's zAssets operate across several blockchains and allow users to protect their privacy as they interact with DeFi applications. Presently, Panther is building on several networks, including Elrond, Ethereum, NEAR, Polygon, Flare, and more. Panther’s native token $ZKP governs the Panther ecosystem and is used to reward users for enabling the protocol’s privacy.</p> Using Panther Protocol <p>DeFi traders can mint zAssets by depositing their corresponding digital assets into Multi-Asset Shielded Pools (MASPs). They can then use their zAssets across different blockchains through a system of private bridges. Rewards are available for users that deposit and interact with the shielded pools.<br></p><p>For instance, when you deposit USDC into the pool, you can mint the corresponding privacy-enabled zAsset, zUSDC, which breaks the on-chain link and allows you to transact privately. After transacting, you can redeem your deposited USDC to a new stealth address, and the zUSDC is removed from circulation.<br></p><p>Panther also supports a feature called Panther Reveals, which allows you to disclose parts or the totality of your DeFi history if required by KYC verification, regulators, and financial institutions.</p> Final thoughts <p>The discussion around the subject of privacy on the blockchain may never cease. Users continue to clamor for increased privacy while regulators grow wary of the solutions currently in the market. Cryptocurrency mixers and privacy coins have enhanced users' privacy on the blockchain, but this has come at the cost of coming under scrutiny due to their lack of compliance concerns.<br></p><p>Panther solves this dilemma with a comprehensive solution, ensuring users can send and receive cryptocurrencies privately and compliantly. Panther offers an end-to-end DeFi solution that enhances trust on the blockchain and gives users control over the information they share. <br></p><p>The future of privacy will thrive in an ecosystem where there’s no additional cost or barrier for a law-abiding citizen to exercise their right to privacy. We’re at an important juncture of building a decentralized financial world – a global monetary system built on the ethos of transparent, private, and censorship-resistant. <br></p><p>It’s time to realize that our right to financial privacy cannot be ignored while building an open financial system.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

 Introducing Privy’s new&nbsp;look <p>I wish this title were a computer science joke. It’s not. We’re just very excited to introduce our new look. Thank you to the great team at <a href="https://unfold.co/">Unfold</a> for working with us on this redesign.</p>We’ve taken to calling it&nbsp;blobby What’s in a&nbsp;brand? <p>The French say “<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/l%27habit_ne_fait_pas_le_moine">the clothes do not make the monk</a>” and we recognize this: Privy is only as good as its APIs are useful. We are here to build simple, powerful developer tools to help you manage user data safely and put users back in control of their data on the web. That is our core&nbsp;mission.</p><p>And yet, we also recognize the power of brands to create movements and foster community. Here are a few we look up&nbsp;to:</p><p><a href="http://uniswap.org">Uniswap</a></p><p>We’d know that hot pink anywhere. Yes, they may be building an AMM, but from the horse 🦄 to the socks 🧦, you can tell they care about their art.

Along with their comically understated site, these are hackers first and foremost. They ship code, with a&nbsp;purpose.</p><p><a href="http://dune.xyz">Dune</a></p><p>The website, the palette. This is about information architecture and surfacing data, plain and simple&nbsp;📈.</p> Enter Blobby <p>We built Privy to help developers delight their users without putting them at risk. It’d be a shame for us not to find delight in our own&nbsp;work.</p><p>As a developer, dealing with user data must become simple again. You should be able to build wonderful products without stripping your users of control, or putting your product and org at risk. Privacy is table-stakes. More than that, our data future will unlock new, interesting experiences on the Web. It must be secure, engaging and&nbsp;playful.</p>What do you leave behind as you surf the&nbsp;web?<p>We’ve done our best to convey a sense of this across our work. We hope you’ll like&nbsp;it.</p> Privacy as a&nbsp;prism Before /&nbsp;After<p>The new carries with it some of the old.

 On-Site Token Launch Station 



  
<p>We had a booth on the exhibitor hall where we hosted an on-site token launch station! The pre-booked 2-day launch schedule was fully booked before the event, and we had many “walk-ins” that lined up by our booth to create their own token on <a href="https://tokenmint.global/">TokenMint</a>.</p>
<p>Our swag was a huge hit too!</p>

<p>Horizen, along with Horizen Labs, hosted a side event with our partner, Halborn Security at Consensus, where guests enjoyed food, drink, and networking! We saw many longtime community members at the event, and it was a good chance for much of the team to network and catch up with each other during the busy event week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One year ago, <a>we launched Brave Search</a> to give everyone online a real choice over Big Tech: a privacy-protecting, unbiased alternative to Google and Bing, and a truly independent alternative to providers—such as DuckDuckGo or Startpage—that rely on Big Tech to run.</p>
<p>Today, Brave Search is exiting its beta phase. It’s the default search engine for most new Brave browser users, and any user can search privately using Brave Search in their favorite browser by going to search.brave.com. It’s had rapid user growth, released a slew of innovative features, and challenged the Big Tech monopolies head on. All while staying true to core principles:</p>
 
 Independence: We serve results from our own built-from-scratch index of the Web 
 Privacy: We don’t track you, your searches, or your clicks 
 User-first: We put you first, not the advertising or data industries 
 Transparency: We don’t censor, bias, filter, or downrank results (unless legally required to) 
 Seamlessness: Brave can offer a best-in-class integration between the browser and search—from personalization to instant results as you type—without compromising privacy 
 
<p>To celebrate this one-year anniversary, we’d like to take a moment to highlight growth, give a sneak peek of Goggles, and review other innovative features of Brave Search.</p>

 Unparalleled growth 
<p>Brave Search has grown faster than any search provider since Bing. Some numbers:</p>
 
 2.5 billion queries in the past 365 days 
 A high of 14.1 million queries per day 
 5 billion queries annualized (projection based on current monthly totals) 
 
<p>For comparison, it took Google <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Search.html?id=FAJ9DAAAQBAJ">more than a year</a> to reach 2.5 billion queries, and DuckDuckGo <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/traffic">more than 4 years</a>.</p>
<p>While we’ll never stop improving, in many regions Brave Search already has a level of quality that competes with other established search engines such as Google and Bing. Thanks to this quality, growth, new features, and continued rise in global independence scores, we’re pleased to announce that we’re removing the “beta” label from Brave Search.</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>“Since launching one year ago, Brave Search has prioritized independence and innovation in order to give users the privacy they deserve. The Web is changing, and our incredible growth shows that there is demand for a new player that puts users first,” said Josep M. Pujol, Chief of Search at Brave. “Today we’re releasing Goggles to alter the way search has traditionally been done and to put users in charge at last. The world is too diverse for a single ranking, so Goggles opens search ranking and filtering transparently for everyone to use, share, and improve.”</p>

 Search without limits: Goggles beta release 
<p>We’re excited to announce the long-awaited beta release of an innovative new Brave Search feature: Goggles. Goggles will enable anyone, or any community of people, to create sets of rules and filters to constrain the searchable space and / or alter the ordering of search results. Anyone could then choose to apply a Goggle—or extend it—to their view of Brave Search results. Essentially, Goggles will act as a re-ranking option on top of the Brave Search index.</p>
<p>This means that, instead of a single ranking, Brave Search can offer an almost limitless number of ranking options, enabling search use-cases that could be too specific for a general purpose search engine. While Brave Search doesn’t have editorial biases, all search engines have some level of intrinsic bias. Goggles allows for users to counter any intrinsic biases in the algorithm.</p>
<p>Brave Search is committed to openness in search. It does not manipulate its algorithm to bias, filter, or down-rank results (unless it’s compelled by law to do so). Contrast this with the world’s two largest search providers—Google and Bing—who <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-google-interferes-with-its-search-algorithms-and-changes-your-results-11573823753?mod=hp_lead_pos10">openly manipulate their rankings based on political leanings or other factors</a>.</p>
<p>Goggles takes this commitment to openness a step further by allowing users to choose, alter, or extend the ranking of Brave Search results. In the sample query “search engine” below, you’ll see the power of Goggles in action. You can see that a simple query that would normally favor more common news outlets instead here shows results from individual bloggers.</p>



    



    


    


    
    




    



    


    


    
    

<p>Goggles can work much the same way for any topic, any media, any website. With Goggles, users can search without Big Tech’s bias—they can search without limits.</p>
 
 
<p>To get started with the Goggles beta, simply conduct a search at search.brave.com and click the Goggles tab on the results page.</p>
 
 
<p>Anybody can make Goggles, use ones created by others, and see the source code for already existing Goggles—and extend it—by <a href="https://github.com/brave/goggles-quickstart">visiting the Github repository</a>.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Read the full <a>Goggles white paper</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>The Goggles available at launch (listed below) are demos, created by Brave for educational purposes only, and to showcase the Goggles’ syntax and their simplicity. They’re meant as examples so users can understand the impact and potential for new Goggles, and developers can extend or fork them. Brave will not actively maintain or extend those Goggles, and will delete these specific Goggles once the community has begun building their own.</p>
 
 
<p>Tech blogs—Rerank results to boost content found on technical blogs.</p>
 
 
<p>Hacker News—Prioritizes domains popular with the Hacker News community, minus those that would rank among the top 1000 most-viewed websites.</p>
 
 
<p>No Pinterest—Rerank results to remove pages / threads hosted on Pinterest.</p>
 
 
<p>Rust programming—Rerank results to boost content related to the Rust programming language.</p>
 
 
<p>Copycats removal—Rerank results to remove “copycat” content (e.g. StackOverflow threads or GitHub translations).</p>
 
 
<p>1k short—Rerank results to remove pages found on the top 1,000 most-viewed websites.</p>
 
 The lists of tech blogs are drawn from multiple sources, including blogsurf.io and refined.blog, and not vetted by Brave. The list of top sites in the “1k short” Goggle are drawn from tranco-list.eu. Newly up-ranked sites are not vetted by Brave. 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Community engagement with Goggles has already started. The team at <a href="https://allsides.com/">Allsides</a> has built Goggles based on their knowledge of political biases in the media. Note that Brave is not affiliated with any of the Goggles’ independent creators.</p>
 
 Left-leaning sources—Rerank results to boost content from left-leaning sources. 
 Right-leaning sources—Rerank results to boost content from right-leaning sources. 
 
 
 

 Discussions 
<p>Brave Search isn’t just about offering a newer, more private alternative to the same old search. We’re also adding brand new features to improve search results.</p>
<p>In addition to Goggles, <a>in April, 2022 we announced</a> Discussions. With Discussions, search results on Brave Search are augmented with actual conversations related to the query, pulled from popular forum sites including Reddit. This allows users to easily see what various communities are saying about a topic, rather than just reading content curated by websites.</p>
<p>Discussions bring multiple points of view to search, and a readymade method—upvotes and likes—to measure an answer’s quality. They also allow Brave Search to combat the so-called “SEO spam” that’s <a href="https://dkb.io/post/google-search-is-dying">become so prominent on Google</a>. Brave Search is already better than other search engines at handling SEO content—with Discussions, we’re enhancing results even more to bring real human conversations (and answers) right to the search results page.</p>

 How we’ve grown 
<p>Of course privacy, independence, and innovation are nice. But search lives and dies on accuracy. From the beginning, we set out to build a search engine that delivers the quality, nuance, and depth that people expect from Google or Bing. And we set ourselves that mission all while committing to stay true to our principles.</p>
<p>So Brave Search then became an enormous engineering challenge: How to build the index—and the ranking algorithm—without collecting user data? We came up with a handful of ways:</p>
 
 <a>The Web Discovery Project</a>: A privacy-preserving way for users to anonymously contribute browsing data, and thus improve the coverage and quality of Brave Search. 
 <a href="https://search.brave.com/help/google-fallback">Fallback mixing</a>: An anonymous way for Brave to check Google in cases where our index isn’t complete or refined enough (especially for “long-tail” queries), and “mix” the results for you. 
 <a href="https://search.brave.com/help/anonymous-local-results">Anonymous local results</a>: A way for Brave Search to serve localized search results (e.g. for the query “restaurants near me”) without knowing your physical location or broadcasting your IP address. 
 <a href="https://search.brave.com/help/feedback">Listening to your feedback</a>: We have a strong community of Brave Search users who provide feedback, requests, and suggestions on everything from results, features, infoboxes and widgets, and more. And we act on as much of this feedback as we can. 
 

 Independence scores 
<p>Together, the above show it is possible to thread the needle: to both improve the index for all users, and preserve their privacy and anonymity online. In addition to the rapid growth Brave has seen, we’re also checking another metric to measure the success of this mission: the independence score.</p>
<p>In isolation, this score—shown for both individuals and users globally—is a measure of the percentage of our results served directly from the Brave Search index. But it also does something much more important: It ensures free access to information, without Big Tech’s manipulation. Search engines that depend too much, or exclusively, on Big Tech are subject to their censorship, biases, and editorial decisions. The Web needs multiple search providers—without choice there’s no freedom.</p>
<p>Brave is building an alternative to what already exists, not window dressing the same old thing.</p>
 
 The global independence score for all Brave Search users is 92% 
 This is up from 87% when Brave Search first launched one year ago 
 



    



    


    


    
    


 Let me de-Google that for you (LMDGTFY) 
<p>When Brave first acquired the Tailcat team and began to lay the foundation for Brave Search, we knew what we were up against: The monolith of Google. It was audacious enough to take on a global brand that dominates 85% of search volume and over 60% of desktop browser usage worldwide. Doing so in a way that preserved user privacy and relied on an independently built index of the Web was a huge challenge. But it was consistent with Brave’s mission of putting users first and fixing the Web.</p>
<p>Coupled with our privacy browser, Brave now provides the first truly viable, private browser+search alternative to the Big Tech platforms. We’re making it seamless for users to browse and search with guaranteed privacy, all while fighting the censorship and overreach of Big Tech companies. And, rather than just offer a privacy-first copy of Google, we’re continuing to innovate with features such as Discussions and Goggles.</p>
<p>Ever hear the phrase “Let me Google that for you?” How about letting Brave de-Google that for you instead?</p>

</h3>

  CBDCs are far from how they were initially conceptualized, as revealed by Oliver Gale, founder of the first digital dollar project.

<div class='item-content item-summary'>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>The current concept of CBDCs is diametrically different from the values cryptocurrencies initially embodied. <br></p><p>State-controlled, opaque, fully-surveilled exchange networks within which only government-issued currencies are used certainly differ from Bitcoin, a decentralized public network of democratically- mined money. <br></p><p>But what if we told you CBDCs were not always meant to be this way?<br></p><p>This is the story of how our co-founder and CEO, Oliver Gale, got involved in the invention of CBDCs, stepped away for ideological reasons, and joined the fight for privacy in DeFi and Web3.<br></p> A digital dollar project in the sunny Caribbean<br> <p>Oliver, an early investor in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies (think Mastercoin days!), founded the first crypto exchange in the Caribbean, <a href="https://bitt.com/">Bitt.com</a>. He and his co-Founder quickly noticed the disruptive role cryptocurrencies could play in remittances, particularly within Oliver's native Barbados.<br></p><p>The founders realized that, with US dollars trading at a premium in Barbados, using BTC for remittances would be a lower-cost solution. Through this they hoped to create demand and adoption for BTC, increasing people’s access to decentralized finance.<br></p><p>The only problem was Bitcoin's volatility.<br></p><p>At the time, Tether had just launched using the BTC blockchain as its network. This inspired Oliver and the other founders to use the Colored Coins protocol to launch one of the first-ever stablecoins, the <a href="https://www.bitt.com/blog/why-has-bitt-created-barbados-digital-dollars-on-the-blockchain">Barbados Digital Dollar</a>. The stablecoin would make it easier to hold funds in the exchange and send remittances without users being afraid of losing money due to volatility along the process.</p> Which of course, got them blacklisted by banks<br> <p>A crypto exchange was not for the faint-hearted at the time. Traditional financial institutions might be <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/institutional-defi-the-next-big-thing-a5b07193232b/">relatively open</a> to the idea of cryptocurrencies (even if they don't use them themselves) nowadays, but Bitt.com quickly got "de-risked" (a fancy word for “blacklisted”) by its local banks, operating under the direction of their correspondent banking overlords.<br></p>Oliver Gale on the Bitt days. ‌ ‌<p>Bitt.com, however, had proven that the blockchain was a superior alternative for many of the financial problems nations face. And the Barbados Digital Dollar project, taking advantage of distributed ledgers' auditability, accountability, distributed, and open-source nature, had certainly drawn some international attention.<br></p> Innovation always happens during crises (or how the digital dollar project was re-born)<br> <p>After hurricane Maria devastated the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Caribbean_Currency_Union">Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU)</a>, governor of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), Timothy Antoine, called for innovation to help the region “develop a digital ecosystem from which [the] region can reap <a href="https://www.tbstat.com/wp/uploads/2020/08/KPMG-CBDC-Report.FINAL_.v.1.02.pdf">huge digital dividends</a>”<br></p><p>The natural disaster that brought great pain to the islands was a harsh wake-up call. The local authorities were forced to realize that reconstruction was going to be hard. Without financial and technological innovation that attracted capital and resources, the island's future would be far from insured.<br></p><p>This, along with the splash that Bitt had made, created a path for their financial services suite to receive the first-ever contract to deploy a CBDC into a production environment. And so the government got on board with the Eastern Caribbean Digital Dollar, $DXCD.<br></p> But governments seldom like true permissionless tools<br> <p>The project for the Eastern Caribbean Digital Dollar sounded like an ideal CBDC and was far from the projects we know today. <br></p><p>As originally projected, the DXCD would be legal tender, a bearer cash equivalent, with no risk of bank runs, no mechanisms for seizure or freezing someone's balance, or for unwarranted censorship. While initially open to the project, the Central Bank soon realized the implications of this and slightly shifted towards opting for a ledger they could control and audit. In their eyes, the project was to be launched on a permissioned blockchain, where they could freeze and seize assets and print money directly.<br></p><p>This ideological shift, the antithesis the original CBDC project, is what ultimately caused Oliver to leave the digital dollar project in 2018. <br></p> Do CBDCs have a future?<br> <p>When questioned about his current stance on CBDCs and government efforts to incorporate blockchain technologies, Oliver points out that nearly all forms of money since the dawn of civilization have been private. Private money, he says, "is necessary for honoring our fundamental freedoms and equal human rights."<br></p><p>Oliver also adds:<br></p><p>"We need private digital cash because it preserves fungibility. <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/are-bitcoin-transactions-traceable-coin-security-privacy/">Bitcoin's traceability</a> destroys fungibility."<br></p><p>I honestly believe that, when it's all said and done, all CBDCs will be privacy-enabled. They must protect their citizens and the nation itself from espionage, and if they don't embrace Privacy-Enhancing Technologies they won't have a future.<br></p><p>In the same way they now fight privacy finance, some argued in favor of <a href="https://reason.com/video/2020/10/21/cryptowars-gilmore-zimmermann-cryptography/">banning encryption in 1992</a>, predicting it would be used everywhere on the Internet and would facilitate criminal activities. Today it's instead used overwhelmingly as protection for honest users against bad actors in any website that involves payments or sign-ins. We wouldn't have Web 2.0 without encryption, and Web3 will eventually be equally reliant on privacy.<br></p><p>There is a greater benefit to society by being able to preserve your privacy on the Internet than there is a cost and risk of nefarious activity. It's a matter of tracking 0.001% of society against 99.999% of people having safety, security, freedom of speech, and the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/philosophy-legality-and-economics-of-privacy-how-privacy-spans-through-most-areas-of-our-lives-1b0d48945291/">right to privacy</a> as a matter of protection, human rights, and dignity.<br></p><p>You can police nefarious activities by targeting the access points where the protocols are used, not the protocols themselves. The Internet is a great example, as it is used for the good, the bad, and the ugly. It's not safe to have our underlying infrastructure be designed to disclose everything by default."<br></p> Why Panther<br> <p>For his next venture, Oliver wanted to build something that represented a step in the right direction for fundamental rights and freedoms. In Panther, which he conceptualized along with CTO and co-Founder Dr. Anish Mohammed, he saw a system that allowed people to have a choice. Regulatory compliance was a priority and fully possible, but Panther wouldn’t mandate it on people.<br></p><p>In Oliver's eyes, Panther is building the tools to enable a safer economy, allowing the properties of sound money to be delivered on Web3. <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/privacy-finance-why-panther-is-different-and-necessary-e423b2993df9/">Protocols like Panther</a> can translate privacy into confidentiality and then into safety. They allow users to disclose only the data they want, and only to who they want to. <br></p><p>To this day, Oliver is not entirely against CBDCs, provided they run on infrastructure that doesn't endanger their users. A fully digital economy is not to be feared, he says, if we create the right systems for this to happen. <br></p><p>Indeed, Oliver’s views seem to have been echoed across the industry. Noticing the reputation the initiative held, the <a href="http://cbdctt.com">CBDC think tank</a> (an independent group of academics that cooperates with government officials) <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3891121">published a paper</a> in relation to employ zero-knowledge proofs to support full privacy, even citing Zcash.<br></p> Creating a path<br> <p>When smart contracts were first conceptualized, they were seen as a computing renaissance in the crypto realm: thanks to them, some thought, we would be able to interact on-chain in ways entirely dictated by open-source code. This would all happen in the open, using hard assets, building from cryptocurrencies, the latest evolution in finance.<br></p><p>Today, we know that this comes with the danger of users being monitored, surveilled, and endangered. Should we not figure out a solution to total transparency, the alternative is closer to zero privacy. And this means censorship and tight controls.<br></p><p>The battle for individual financial empowerment is being fought in the field of encryption. And Panther is working hard to help take financial empowerment one step further.<br></p><p>Help us spread the word about privacy in DeFi by sharing this article!</p> Disclaimer <p>Olive Gale was interviewed for this article.

         Partnering with Deno: Application Development for the Modern Web            <p>Ryan, Bert and the Deno team are breathing new life into the server-side JavaScript ecosystem.</p>  <p>ByLauren Reeder and Mike Vernal</p><p>Published</p>       



            



 
 
   
<p>Today, we are incredibly excited to announce that we are partnering with Ryan Dahl, Bert Belder and the team at <a href="https://deno.com/">Deno</a>.</p>



<p>Over the last couple of years, application development has moved to the cloud. If you want an auto-scaling database, a warehouse or a message bus, you have MongoDB, Snowflake or Confluent available at the click of a button. Yet for core application logic, developers still need to worry about pods, instances, versions, ports, regions and everything between. Whether it’s deciding to run your application in US-east1 or US-east2, or choosing the right instance type out of the dozens of options—it all feels archaic and far too complex.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t need to be that way. We deeply believe in a serverless future—one where developers can write their core logic in a simple, accessible way, and the cloud will be responsible for auto-scaling and globally distributing that code to all of the machines needed to serve their users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also believe that in that future, Deno will be the easiest, fastest way to build applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ryan has been making full-stack application development dramatically more accessible for well over a decade. He is the creator of Node.js, which brought the power of JavaScript—and later TypeScript—outside of the browser and into the cloud. But as Ryan detailed in his 2018 presentation “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3BM9TB-8yA">10 Things I Regret about Node.js</a>,” it was built in and for a different era. That’s why he and co-founder Bert created Deno: to bring the world a modern JavaScript and TypeScript runtime.</p>



<p>Deno has become <a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno">tremendously popular</a> in the last four years; with more than 83k stars, it’s already nearly caught up to Node. The recent launch of <a href="https://deno.com/deploy">Deno Deploy</a> made it trivial to build serverless apps in a globally distributed way—and since then, Deno has seen strong adoption by both individual developers and as the new default environment for products such as <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/announcing-serverless-compute-with-edge-functions/">Netlify’s serverless Edge Functions</a> and <a href="https://deno.com/blog/supabase-functions-on-deno-deploy#:~:text=With%20Deno%2C%20Supabase%20Functions%20get,websites%2C%20services%2C%20and%20apps.">Supabase’s Functions</a>. For those customers and countless others, Deno is a much-needed breath of fresh air. No more puzzling over or tweaking instances or pods—just write your app with JS/TS with Deno and then deploy and auto-scale around the world.</p>



<p>But Ryan, Bert and their team are just getting started on their mission to make it dramatically easier to write global-scale web applications, and we are thrilled to partner with them on that journey by leading this Series A. If you’re interested in Deno, you can check it out <a href="https://deno.com/deploy">here</a>. And if you’d like to join the team, please reach out—they’re <a href="https://deno.com/jobs">hiring</a> now!</p>

<p>By Kian Paimani, Parity Technologies</p> Notable Contributions: Nomination Pools. <p>After deploying to Westend, we got numerous valuable bug reports and immediately it gave us some work to do. Most notably:</p>  The pool can now also `<a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/11426">chill</a>` itself. This is important for the pool dismantling scenario  Pool roles can now be <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/11411">optional</a>. This is HUGE! A pool now can be created, and the pool operator can publicly express that they no longer wish to control a certain aspect of the pool, and leave it only to the governance. See the PR details for more info.  <p>To facilitate those who are interested in building on top of nomination pools: 1</p>  There’s a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/paritytech/projects/21/views/1">dedicated github project</a> for nomination pools now.  There’s a <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nompools-support:matrix.parity.io">dedicated element room</a> for support and discussion.  <p>Thinking about contributing? Look for issues in the Substrate repo with the <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AZ1-mentor">mentor tag</a>, or the <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/projects/10">NPoS and Elections project</a>. All successful contributions will get an on-chain tip initiated by the staking team.</p><p>Also, if you are interested in contributing long-term, there’s a “<a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/parity/jobs/5064110003">Staking / PoS Engineer</a>” position available at Parity Technologies, targeting exactly those who will contribute to the staking system.</p> Nomination Pools: Detailed Release Schedule. <p>Kusama, as scheduled, has been upgraded to include Nomination pools in the v0.9.22 release. At the time of this writing, 50 pools are already active on kusama and earning rewards. There have also been <a href="https://www.dotreasury.com/ksm/tips">some tips</a> opened for some of them. </p><p>We were initially proposing to deploy the pools on Polkadot in v0.9.23, but some of the aforementioned PRs were not merged in time, this is now scheduled to happen in the v0.9.24 or v0.9.25 release.</p> More UI Changes <p>Parity has been working on a <a href="https://staking.polkadot.network/dashboard">new UI for staking</a>, and it is finally ready for users to try out! Be aware that it is in beta phase for now.<br></p><p>Moreover, &nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/pull/7179#discussion_r874580712">Thanks to </a><a href="mailto:nikolaos@parity.io">Nikos Kontakis</a> ’s PR, the staking page of the Polkadot.js Apps will be totally revamped soon. </p><p><br>In the new UI, the overview page covers only some metrics and numbers, and the list of validators has been moved to a different page. These metrics aim to answer FAQ that most users deal with, such as:</p>  How much stake does a validator need to be in the active set?  How much stake does a nominator need to actively earn rewards? <br>  <p>Since these numbers basically cover the metrics that we had in our “By the Numbers” section here, we decided to remove that section henceforth. <br><br></p>

<p>XRSI Founder and CEO, Kavya Pearlman, who is a key member of the Global Coalition for Digital Safety at the World Economic Forum (WEF) and part of its new Metaverse Initiative, is joining its Global Technology Governance Retreat in San Francisco between 21 and 23 June 2022.</p>



<p>“Behind every avatar — Kavya says — there is likely a human being. Therefore, when we extend reality into other dimensions and move fast towards the next iteration of the internet, we need to honor human nature and protect our consciousness and prevent harm from happening.”</p>



<p>The exponential nature of technological evolution often overwhelms existing institutions and organizations, leaving societies exposed to poorly understood risks and deprived of unprecedented opportunities.</p>



<p>In the wake of escalating geopolitical conflicts, a climate crisis spiraling out of control, and a global economy rattled by the aftershocks of a historic pandemic, adopting shared principles and safeguards for the use of exponential technologies and advancing their implementation is more important – yet also more difficult – than ever before.</p>



<p>At this critical juncture, the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution will convene its global network of business leaders, start-up entrepreneurs, innovators, policy-makers, experts, and civil society representatives for a three-day community retreat to review strategic priorities, foster trusted partnerships, and advance flagship initiatives.</p>

<p>(Watch the full workshop&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/NEc2dijbllM">here</a>)</p> TL;DR <p>❗Validating with Findora means you are bringing scalable privacy to Ethereum (and its satellite networks) and accelerating mass adoption of DeFi.<br>❗Validator rewards and penalties are carefully balanced to incentivize the long-term sustainability and security of Findora.<br>❗Epoch cycles happen every four blocks or so, meaning rewards can start to pay out in as little as a minute.<br>❗Validators can track their performance using <a href="https://findorascan.io/">Findorascan.io</a>.<br>❗Delegators can delegate funds from within the Findora Native&nbsp;Wallet.</p> Our Commitment to Partner with Developers <p>Findora is dedicated to bringing privacy to Web3 and working with talented teams across Web3 to make that vision a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Part of that process is providing developers with the tools and documentation they’ll need to build on Findora. To that end, we put on weekly “Findora Fridays” designed to help developers understand how Findora works and how to get&nbsp;started.</p> Why Validate on&nbsp;Findora? <p>A big way for developers or retail users to partner with Findora is to become a validator to secure the&nbsp;network.</p><p>As with any other Proof of Stake network (PoS), validators are rewarded for securing the network. Findora offers both a block reward and the block proposer reward to validators and those that delegate funds with&nbsp;them.</p><p>Beyond the financial incentive, validating with Findora means you are contributing to the future of privacy in DeFi and Web3. Privacy is necessary to accelerate mass adoption because it is required by many institutions before they enter the&nbsp;space.</p><p>Though privacy sometimes has a negative connotation, it really serves as a financial primitive. Some use cases for privacy include private payroll, private markets that won’t reveal proprietary trading strategies, DAO signing of community wallets, and DAO voting without discrimination or intimidation. Validators on Findora will be part of&nbsp;that.</p><p>Watch the workshop <a href="https://youtu.be/NEc2dijbllM">here</a> or read a few highlights below.</p> Validator Best Practices <p>It’s recommended that validators use a cloud service like AWS or GCP services to run a node since this way, you don’t need to worry as much about downtime.</p><p>AWS and GCP have backup systems that can keep your nodes live. Self-hosting a validator node means that you may suffer from slashing penalties for power outages or hardware failures. When self-hosting a node, you will need to tend your node yourself or face slashing penalties for downtime.</p><p>Validators should keep in mind that their voting power is limited to 20% no matter how much they have staked on a node. Findora doesn’t want to incentivize the creation of whales, just “baby whales” with multiple nodes. The more nodes run on a network, the healthier and more secure it ends up&nbsp;being.</p> Slashing Stake <p>“Slashing stake” is when a network burns some of the tokens a validator and their delegators have staked as a penalty. It’s a critical mechanism all PoS networks have to incentivize good behavior and network&nbsp;health.</p><p>With Findora, there are four reasons why a validator and their delegators might have their stake&nbsp;slashed:</p>  They are unreliable with long periods of downtimes — this might result from a power outage or just a validator turning their node off. When this happens, a very small amount, around&nbsp;.1% of their stake, is burned for every block missed. There is a new block on Findora every ~15&nbsp;seconds.  Serious Attacks — If a validator tries to attack the network with an attack like a double signing attack, they will lose 5% of their total staked amount. A double signing attack is when a validator tries to vote twice on the same block and corrupt the consensus mechanism.  Light Attacks — Findora will slash 1% of the total amount staked for attacks that aren’t as&nbsp;serious.  Unknown and Undefined Attacks — Though rarer, these can be serious threats to the network. As a result, 30% of the total amount staked will be&nbsp;slashed.  <p>Findora runs on the Tendermint consensus engine, and the slashing helps protect the network from malicious actors. There are also rewards to incentivize network health. Slashing rates are balanced with reward rates in order to provide a carrot and stick incentive structure to protect networks.</p> Findora Reward&nbsp;Rates <p>As stated before, there are two types of rewards paid to validators — a block reward and a block proposer reward. Delegators who stake with a validator share in the block reward and any slashing penalties.</p><p>The more delegated to a validator, the more rewards they can earn. The APY reward for staking on Findora with a validator is on a sliding&nbsp;scale:</p><p>The reward rate increases as the amount staked FRA that is in circulation decreases to encourage more staking. Rewards decrease as more and more FRA get staked. The Rate Modifier Constant is set at 0.0536 (as of 5/1/2022) and is responsible for determining the reward rate for each value of % circulating supply staked. The community is able to vote on the modifier constant as&nbsp;needed.</p><p>To learn more about the rewards paid to validators and delegators, check out the <a href="https://wiki.findora.org/docs/components/Staking/rewards">updated Findora&nbsp;Wiki</a>.</p> Findora Epoch&nbsp;Cycles <p>Rewards to validators are paid after every epoch cycle which is only every 4 blocks. Since there is a new block every 15 seconds, once you start validating with Findora, you can start getting rewards within a&nbsp;minute.</p><p>Validators can check their rank, earnings, or the health of their node by visiting <a href="https://findorascan.io/">findorascan.io</a>. Currently, the top 74 validators are listed on Findorascan.io but that number should be increased eventually to&nbsp;100.</p> What to Consider as a Delegator <p>Delegators stake FRA by entrusting it to a validator. Having funds delegated to validators helps them earn more rewards and delegators in turn share in those rewards, but it also means you are penalized when they&nbsp;are.</p><p>As a result, it’s worth researching a validator before staking with them. You can research all kinds of things about a validator using findorascan.io. Here are perhaps the top three things to consider when doing your research:</p>  Validator Uptime  Number of blocks&nbsp;proposed  What reward rate is being given out by the network? At the time of this recording, the reward rate is around 50%&nbsp;APY.  <p>You’ll also find their commission rate which is what they charge for using their node. Though some offer a 0% commission rate, which is generous, it’s always good to tip your local validator. They need to be rewarded for their work, and some validators even try to offer 0% commission because it’s a way to boost voting power for a malicious attack.</p> When Can I Get Back the Amount that I&nbsp;stake? <p>To unstake or unbond FRA requires 21 days. Requiring an unstaking period of a few weeks is not uncommon because the period has to be long enough to prevent long-range attacks in which actions taken don’t affect the network for another 10–15&nbsp;days.</p><p>Having an unstaking period in which delegators and validators could still have their funds slashed prevents both long-range attacks and other types of malicious activity.</p> How to Start the Validation Process <p>Before becoming a validator, it’s good to <a href="https://wiki.findora.org/docs/introduction/intro">learn the basics about Findora</a> from the wiki and get some FRA to stake. Just below that tab in the menu you will find the <a href="https://wiki.findora.org/docs/Introduction/changelog">change log</a> which you can check for&nbsp;updates.</p><p>After that, go ahead and check out the validator start guide on the <a href="https://wiki.findora.org/docs/validators/validators-get-started">Findora Wiki</a>. It will walk you through step by step how to do a manual setup or an automatic setup. Although the automatic setup works perfectly well and is easier, doing the manual setup will give you a better understanding of what is happening under the&nbsp;hood.</p><p>If you’re running multiple nodes, manual setup will make it easier to manage them. You’ll know where your keys are, how your folders are set up, and give you more control of your directories.</p><p>We put on regular workshops for developers to prepare them to develop on Findora.

  Today’s Brave browser release (v1.40) is expanding on the mission of making Brave Wallet a safe, easy-to-use onramp to Web3. It gives users easy access to new chains and decentralized apps (DApps), right in the browser, no extensions required.

<p>Brave also includes DApp support on desktop (Solana) and Android (Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains)</p>
<p>Today’s <a>Brave browser release (v1.40)</a> is expanding on the mission of making <a>Brave Wallet</a> a safe, easy-to-use onramp to Web3. It gives users easy access to new chains and decentralized apps (DApps), right in the browser, no extensions required.</p>

 Brave Wallet now integrates with the Filecoin blockchain 
<p><a href="https://decrypt.co/resources/filecoin">Filecoin is a decentralized storage provider</a> that allows users to store their most important files and documents on a decentralized network, rather than a centralized service. With Brave’s 1.40 release, we’ve integrated the <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a> blockchain directly into Brave Wallet. With this integration, Filecoin’s token (FIL) is fully supported as an asset in Brave Wallet. Brave users can frictionlessly send and receive FIL directly in the Wallet without worry due to Filecoin’s extremely low transaction fees.<br>
The Filecoin integration also complements <a>Brave’s native integration</a> with the <a href="https://ipfs.io/">InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) network</a>, and sets the stage for future utility of Filecoin in the decentralized Web. Brave users can access content directly from the IPFS network by resolving ipfs:// URLs via a gateway or installing a full IPFS node in one click. The integration gives users options for a more resilient Web, increases the availability of content they care about, and more.</p>



    



    


    


    
    


 Brave Wallet now has more preloaded EVM chains 
<p>With the 1.40 release, the following blockchains compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) will now be pre-loaded in Brave Wallet, offering users more choice across popular networks:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.avax.network/">Avalanche C-Chain</a> 
 <a href="https://www.bnbchain.org/en/smartChain">Binance Smart Chain</a> 
 <a href="https://celo.org/">Celo</a> 
 <a href="https://fantom.foundation/">Fantom</a> 
 <a href="https://polygon.technology/">Polygon</a> 
 <a href="https://www.optimism.io/">Optimism</a> 
 
<p>Assets on each of these preloaded networks are supported with <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/4416863200141-How-do-I-manage-crypto-assets-in-Brave-Wallet-">Brave Swaps</a>, and <a href="https://www.0x.org/">powered by 0x. Brave</a> also supports fiat-to-crypto purchases for most of these networks via <a href="https://www.0x.org/">partners </a><a href="https://ramp.network/">Ramp</a> and <a href="https://www.sendwyre.com/">Wyre</a>. We plan to extend support to even more networks in the months ahead.<br>
In addition to the networks above, <a>Brave also recently announced plans to support Aurora as a default chain</a>, an EVM that offers Ethereum compatibility with the speed, low fees, and scalability of <a href="https://near.org/">NEAR</a>.</p>



    



    


    


    
    


 New DApp support 
<p>Finally, Brave is bringing more support for <a>decentralized apps (DApps)</a> to Brave Wallet users.</p>
<p>Brave launched the first part of its Solana integration with the <a>1.39 Wallet release</a>. On the desktop side, we’re carrying that integration forward with a developer release of DApp support for Solana. Users can now test Solana DApp support in Brave Wallet in the <a>Brave Nightly</a> (v1.42) version of our desktop browser. We encourage the community to test and provide feedback.</p>
<p>More Solana support on all platforms—including DApps and swapping—will be available in the <a>release channel of Brave</a> in the coming months.</p>
<p>In addition to buying, sending, and swapping crypto assets, <a>Brave Wallet Android users</a> can now access and explore Web3 DApps and services in Ethereum and EVM-compatible ecosystems. This will soon be available for iOS users as well (DApp support is already available for Brave Wallet desktop users).</p>

 Brave Wallet: More chains, more features, better security 
<p>Brave Wallet brings added security to Web3. Being native to the browser, Brave Wallet removes the risk of installing 3rd-party extensions that can be easily spoofed, and brings an easy, safe onramp to the decentralized web.</p>
<p>However, Brave Wallet is about more than security. From the beginning, we wanted it to compete with any other wallet on integrations, speed, fees, user experience, and more. With our 1.40 release, Brave is introducing an even richer set of features for all Brave Wallet users, and any Brave browser user who’s curious about Web3.</p>

 Update to staking supply and active set — and the impact on mix node&nbsp;APY <p>This week there have been some important updates to the reward sharing parameters in the mixnet contracts. Namely, the stake supply and the active set, which in turn affects the mix node saturation point. You can see evidence of these changes already in <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">the explorer</a>: the active set number, stake saturation point and the estimated rewards are all affected. These changes have been made in order to ensure a better quality of mixnet and better&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This blogpost will give an overview of what exactly has changed and why it matters — especially if you are a mix node operator or someone who has delegated to a mix&nbsp;node.</p><p>Before we go into further details, these changes may require some action on your&nbsp;part:</p>  If you are a mix node operator, your % saturation will look different, as will your estimated rewards. There is now competition to be in the active set, so make sure your node is fully operational!  If you are a delegator, note that the stake saturation has changed, so you should check if the mix nodes you have delegated to are above saturation and consider redeeming your rewards and delegating to a different set of nodes! (This is now even easier through the <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/">new wallet</a> interface).   What has&nbsp;changed? <p>Stake supply adjusted to&nbsp;100M</p><p>The reported stake supply has been adjusted from an assumed total supply of 750M to 100M, to better reflect the real world stake&nbsp;supply.</p><p>This does NOT mean the supply of NYM tokens has changed (total NYM supply is 1bn), it just means that the max supply that is currently liquid or in the vesting contract available for staking is only approximately 100M.</p><p>So the reward sharing algorithm has been adjusted accordingly and now assumes there are 100M NYM tokens available for staking at this point in time, rather than the full stake supply of 750M (1bn minus the 250M mixmining pool). This change is important and affects stake saturation point and improves the APY, described below.</p><p>NOTE: there is a small bug, meaning the stake supply changes have not fully gone through yet. Core dev are fixing it as we speak so you should see evidence of higher rewards as a result of this change by next&nbsp;week.</p><p>Active set (k) adjusted to&nbsp;240</p><p>The active set has been changed from 720 to 240 to ensure competition and better performance. When the active set was set to 720, all nodes were selected as the actual number of nodes was less. This meant the mixnet was not performing well as it included low quality nodes. With the adjustment, the overall quality of the network should start to&nbsp;improve.</p><p>There is now no standby set because it is not needed at this early stage of the network. This means a mix node is simply either active or inactive at a given epoch, with a higher probability of being in the active set if the node has good performance and high stake saturation.</p><p>Stake saturation point is now&nbsp;416k</p><p>A mix node’s stake is the total of how much an operator bonds and how much token holders delegate. Combined, it represents the confidence in that mix node, and affects its probability of being selected to the active set to mix traffic and be rewarded.</p><p>The stake saturation point is a softcap, meaning any additional stake that a node receives above that point will no longer be of benefit — it will in fact begin to reduce the overall rewards for all stakers on that node by spreading out the share. The softcap is to ensure stake doesn’t centralize and that people delegate stake to a sufficient number of well performing nodes.</p><p>The stake saturation is found by dividing the total stake supply by the number of nodes in the active set (100M/240). The rewards algorithm is designed such that nodes with 100% stake saturation will get the full share of mixmining rewards pool. The previous stake saturation was 1M, calculated on the basis of a 750M stake supply. This number is far from the actual reality at this early stage of the network, meaning the saturation point was far too high making it impossible for the majority of nodes in the network to get close to saturation. The adjustments from 750M to 100M means the saturation point is now 416k and more nodes will get full share of the rewards making them look more attractive to prospective delegators.</p><p>This also means that some nodes are now way oversaturated! So delegators, it is time to redeem your rewards and redelegate to a different set of nodes! And node operators, encourage your delegators to redelegate!</p><p>You will be losing out on rewards if you continue to stake on oversaturated nodes. To help distributing stake more evenly across nodes, the next release of the wallet will simply have delegation and compounding disabled for over-saturated nodes.</p><p>Go to the explorer, click on “Stake Saturation” to view nodes by saturation and you will see the over saturated ones with a red warning&nbsp;color.</p> Why were these changes&nbsp;made?   Improve the quality of the&nbsp;network  <p>The quality of the mixnet is currently not good enough for broad adoption and usage. There are simply too many nodes and gateways dropping packets. What is more, this is affecting the reputation of other mix nodes. There has been some dissatisfaction with the way that a mix node’s uptime is displayed because good performing nodes are at times seeing their uptime&nbsp;drop.</p><p>Here is what is happening: a node’s uptime is measured by measurement packets. These report back on whether the packet was successfully routed through the full path, meaning through a gateway, three mix nodes and another gateway. The implication is that a well performing mix node can have their “uptime” affected by being in a pathway with an underperforming gateway or mix&nbsp;node.</p><p>Measurements have to happen like this. However, mix nodes with good performance should start to be less implicated by badly performing nodes now that the active set is smaller, because there will be more competition.</p><p>The probability of being in the active set will decline for bad nodes. And this means higher performing mix nodes will be less likely to be in the same path as low performing nodes.</p>  Encourage competition  <p>When the active set was 720, all nodes currently bonded in the mixnet were selected for the active set in every epoch because there were less than 720 nodes. This means there was no competition and no quality control. By reducing the active set number to 240, there will be actual competition to be included in each epoch, encouraging node operators to run functioning nodes, and ensuring that node reputation and delegations actually&nbsp;matter!</p>  Make delegations count  <p>Before reducing the active set to a more competitive number, delegated staking had no actual effect on whether a node was selected or not because all nodes were selected! With a smaller set, only about half of the current number of nodes are selected for each epoch, which means the delegated stake will begin to make a real difference for a mix node’s probability of being in the active set — in turn affecting the rewards it will receive and the share that delegators receive.</p><p>This should make the whole network a lot more dynamic and ensure people will begin to see some real differences in rewards for good versus bad nodes and overall better&nbsp;APY.</p>  Improve APY  <p>Last but not least, all the above means better rewards for well performing nodes. The simulations that we ran before making these changes in fact <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-mixnet-apy-initial-simulations-for-first-quarter-139ac49d5348">reported an APY of up to 40%</a> (annualized) for mix nodes with 100% uptime and stake saturation for the first months of the network, after which the rewards will begin to tail off to a more stable&nbsp;level.</p><p>Any questions - the Nym <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> and <a href="https://keybase.io/team/nymtech.friends">Keybase</a> channels are&nbsp;open!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/update-to-staking-supply-and-active-set-and-the-impact-on-mix-node-apy-df0db507845b">Update to staking supply and active set — and the impact on mix node APY</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 OXT Visualizer Update A picture is worth a thousand&nbsp;words Intro <p>A financial flow (transaction graph) analysis aims to track a single entity’s spending over multiple transactions. By naively mapping the flow relationship of bitcoins, analysts can miss obvious signs of coins changing&nbsp;hands.</p><p>Additional information known as wallet or software “fingerprinting” can be used to help determine when bitcoins are spent by a different software. Spending by wallets with a new fingerprint is a heuristic for coins changing ownership. The latest OXT transaction graph update visually encodes changes in wallet fingerprints on the graph to improve analysis accuracy.</p> Entity Tracking Recap — Change Detection <p>To track an entity, “change detection” heuristics are used to determine which transaction outputs are payments and which outputs are “change” returned to the original spender. The analyst evaluates the full transaction details including the input and output amounts, script types, output positions, and more. If one or more change heuristics can be applied, the analyst continues tracking the spender to the next transaction. We previously presented several change detection heuristics in these <a href="https://medium.com/oxt-research/understanding-bitcoin-privacy-with-oxt-part-1-4-8177a40a5923">posts</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEnL5k0R08w&amp;list=PLIBmWVGQhizLrPjpFMN5bQdbOZRxCQXUg">Youtube playlist</a>.</p><p>Applying these simple heuristics in combination can be extremely accurate. Academic researchers are looking to thoroughly establish the accuracy of change detection heuristics using machine learning algorithms as presented <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05749">here</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13882">here</a>.</p><p>The results of these papers indicates that including wallet fingerprinting such as different script types, version numbers, and lock times encountered during a transaction graph analysis can be used to improve tracking.</p> OXT’s New Fingerprint Mode <p>OXT’s transaction graph is a directed acyclic graph. Nodes on the graph represent transactions. Edges (lines) map the relationships between nodes. To provide maximum detail and minimize cognitive load on the analyst, OXT’s new Fingerprint Mode encodes the various transaction and TXO data in different ways.</p><p>Transaction details are encoded by varying node shapes and shading. TXO details are encoded by varying edge linetype and&nbsp;color.</p>Multiple peel chains showing different script&nbsp;types<p>The end result makes change detection easier for analysts and visually displays different fingerprints to transaction graph observers without the observer needing to know what these differences are.</p><p>With this new data visualizer, bitcoin users can keep pace with the advances in academic research and evaluate the impacts of using wallets that do not support <a href="https://medium.com/oxt-research/understanding-bitcoin-privacy-with-oxt-part-3-4-9a1b2b572a8">anti-fingerprinting defaults</a>.</p> Menus and&nbsp;Buttons <p>A summary of the buttons on the transaction graph tool bars is presented below.</p>Toolbar buttons<p>Quick access menus for transactions, TXOs, and comments are presented below.

<p>McKinsey &amp; Co.’s new research shows the metaverse could grow up to $5 trillion in value by 2030. That illustrates the impact the&nbsp;metaverse&nbsp;is expected to have across key sectors and businesses over the years.</p>



<p>McKinsey said the report, dubbed&nbsp;Value creation in the metaverse, shows the metaverse may be too big to ignore. Many of us think of this as science fiction, as the&nbsp;metaverse&nbsp;is the universe of virtual worlds that are all interconnected, like in novels such as&nbsp;Snow Crash&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ready Player One.&nbsp;But it has become a vision for the next generation of computing, as a spatial version of the internet. (Neal Stephenson, author of Snow Crash, which was published in 1992, just started an open metaverse effort dubbed Lamina1).</p>



<p>McKinsey’s preliminary forecast shows the metaverse has the potential to grow up to $5 trillion in value by 2030. It shows eCommerce as the largest economic force ($2.6 trillion), ahead of sectors such as virtual learning ($270 billion), advertising ($206 billion), and gaming ($125 billion).</p>



<p>As companies of all different shapes and sizes look to enter the metaverse, this report provides a clear view of what the metaverse is and is not, what first movers are doing, what’s fueling the investment, and the potential for consumer and business-to-business (B2B) companies.</p>



<p>Our Founder and CEO, Kavya Pearlman, gave a key contribution to the report.</p>

 Our latest partnership with LI.FI introduces BlockWallet users to their advanced bridge and DEX aggregator through Transferto — LI.FI’s simple UI that provides an easy way to bridge and swap across multiple&nbsp;chains. <p>As the blockchain ecosystem shifts toward multi-chain applications, <a href="https://li.fi/">LI.FI</a> provides an easy way to interact with your favorite chains and DApps. And with <a href="https://li.fi/">LI.FI</a>’s plug-and-play feature, users can swap any asset from any chain on all DApps that apply their solution.</p><p>As of today, <a href="https://blockwallet.io/">BlockWallet</a> is officially integrated with <a href="https://transferto.xyz/swap">Transferto</a>, the intuitive interface powered by&nbsp;<a href="https://li.fi/">LI.FI</a>.</p> LI.FI is redefining the status&nbsp;quo <p>The existing bridge-swapping solutions are simply not good enough. With their limited chain support, coupled with low liquidity, the result is a poor experience for users. Not to mention, frequent downtimes from existing protocols.</p><p><a href="https://li.fi/">LI.FI</a> solves these problems by implementing multiple chains through a feature called smart routing, which algorithmically decides the best route for swapping, reducing gas fees. They also connect bridges with DEXs and dex aggregators to support swap-bridge functionality, where Blockwallet users can swap from any asset on any chain into any other asset on a different chain (Any-2-Any swaps).</p><p>If all that seems too complicated, don’t worry. Because all you need to know is&nbsp;this:</p><p>As self-proclaimed UX maxis, LI.FI makes bridging and cross-chain swapping incredibly simple, with less fees and greater reliability.</p> About BlockWallet <p>BlockWallet is a privacy-first self-custodial browser extension wallet where you can store, send or receive crypto and interact with your favorite blockchain apps privately.</p><p>As crypto sees mainstream adoption, blockchain’s lack of privacy poses real security risks. BlockWallet is here to ensure that on-chain privacy does not lag behind. The wallet provides a set of advanced privacy tools wrapped in a familiar and user-friendly wallet experience, eliminating friction and making privacy accessible for everyone.</p><p>BlockWallet protects you and ensures privacy by default. When you make transactions or interact with blockchain apps, BlockWallet routes all node requests through Privacy Proxies, which mask the IP address and other metadata, that can be used to identify and track you on a blockchain. You can also use the Privacy Pools feature, powered by <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/zk-snarks">zk-SNARKs</a> technology, to deposit and mix funds in a smart contract. This allows transferring funds without links to your history and identity on the blockchain, effectively rendering them untraceable. BlockWallet offers integrated Flash-Bot Protection, shielding you from sandwich attacks when you trade on DEXes. Meanwhile, the Phishing Protection feature combats phishing scams by generating unique artwork on all sensitive pages.</p><p>BlockWallet is not a compromise. It’s privacy-first, but it still packs all features you would expect from a wallet. With full Web 3.0 support, the wallet allows you to connect to any&nbsp;DApp.</p><p>Become a part of the BlockWallet community today:</p><p><a href="https://blockwallet.io/">Homepage</a> | <a href="https://blockwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/GetBlockWallet">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/blockwallet">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://discord.gg/69gvNKatdb">Discord</a> | <a href="https://discord.com/invite/EKVZ2xWXEH">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="http://hello@blockwallet.io/">E-mail</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/blockwallet/blockwallet-partners-with-li-fi-84e29ca1dac4">BlockWallet Partners With LI.FI</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/blockwallet">BlockWallet</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>As we described in our initial blog on <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/zcash-proof-of-stake-research/">Proof-of-Stake Research</a>, we are releasing updates to the Zcash community as we go.</p>



<p>In this post we describe major technical research areas we intend to focus on moving forward. We will go over a number of topics, including these focus areas, approach, and next steps. We’ll adjust throughout the process as we discover new needs.</p>



<p>As the cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to evolve, it’s important to understand how ZEC might be best suited to find its niche in the overall marketplace. The core of this research is to improve the overall use experience, and broader use case, for Zcash and ZEC.</p>



 



 



 



 Approach 



<p>With <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/eccs-north-star-building-a-world-class-ux-for-zec/">ECC’s North Star</a> and research goals in mind, we are adopting this broad approach to developing a successful proposal:</p>



 



 Go-to-market process 



<p>This status update is focused on an initial technical research phase as part of a comprehensive go-to-market process. The broader process has these components:</p>



  Requirements definition to establish specific goals for a PoS transition proposal  Market research to identify the target market, user needs, and market landscape  Technical research to identify the range of feasible technical designs  Engineering R&amp;D to develop a concrete design and deployment roadmap  Zcash proposal (with a specific decision) to present to the Zcash community   Go-to-market execution, for an accepted proposal, to ship usable and valuable products to users  



<p>In practice, the first three components are interleaved: As we explore technical designs and learn more from market research, we will refine our requirements, which may require further technical and market research. We will iterate these three efforts until we develop high confidence that we have the best requirements.</p>



 



 Technical research process 



<p>The technical research process has three main components:</p>



 Protocol survey 



<p>First, we’ll focus on researching existing proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols to understand trade-offs and risks. From there, we’ll select our preferred candidate, using our vision for ZEC and Zcash to guide our choice of trade-offs. We’ll share this comparative analysis and our preferred candidate protocol early in our research process to get review and feedback from the broader community.<br><br>Our preferences: We have a strong bias toward protocols that have significant pre-existing deployments that have matured and hardened in the market, as well as strong theoretical underpinnings. Protocols that have both of these traits present the least possible risk for this emerging technology.</p>



 Zcash specialization 



<p>Second, with a preferred protocol candidate in hand, we’ll carefully investigate which design facets may need customization or alteration to support ZEC. We’ll especially consider usability, safety, privacy, and monetary policy constraints that serve as ZEC’s strengths.<br><br>Our preferences: We maintain a security and technical strategy that minimizes changes or innovations, and we strongly prefer to use proven designs as much as possible. The ideal candidate would require no changes. As stated in our research goals, our aim is to target a minimum viable protocol, with the assumption of future improvements, rather than aim to include all valuable potential Zcash specializations up-front.</p>



 Transition plan 



<p>Finally, after developing a proposal for this minimally customized candidate PoS protocol, we’ll develop a more comprehensive proposal, including a transition plan, for safely migrating Zcash from its current proof-of-work (PoW) network to the new target PoS protocol. The transition plan is likely to require significant effort, and there are a range of feasible approaches. We intend to present several possibilities earlier in the research process to get community input on their trade-offs.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Our preferences: We prefer to select an ideal target protocol independent of developing a transition plan to that protocol. If we find the transition plan introduces new constraints or requirements on the target protocol, we will refine the target protocol requirements later in the process.</p>



 



 



 



 Research areas 



<p>Given our goals and approach, we’ve currently identified a number of major areas of technical research for the protocol survey and Zcash specialization phases. These research areas do not yet focus on the transition plan. We will turn our attention to the transition plan as other areas, and broader market research and requirements, become clearer.</p>



 



 Shielded wallet UX and security 



<p>A high priority for our technical research is to consider shielded wallet usability and security, especially for mobile devices. We do not expect the consensus protocol to directly impact shielded storage and transfer functionality or usability. Beyond that, participants in a PoS protocol also may contribute ZEC to staking bonds, validate blocks, propose blocks, and select blocks.</p>



<p>The interaction between the shielded pool and staking is an essential interface of the design. Staked capital must be in bonds visible to the protocol to select block producers and potentially slash for misbehavior. A plausible simple design for this interface would be to support single-use bond positions with a public amount and no associated addresses. These can only be funding from, or withdrawn to, the shielded pool.</p>



<p>In this simpler design, block producers are likely to operate using the target PoS protocol mechanics with minimal Zcash customization.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Our preferences:</p>



<p></p>



  We prefer to enable any number of shielded mobile wallet users to delegate ZEC to staking bonds with a first-class user experience.  



  We prefer the plausible, simple integration between stake delegation and the shielded pool described above for the initial PoS protocol.  



 



 Cross-chain interoperability 



<p>A key pillar of our vision for ZEC’s value in Web3 is to enable interoperability between the Zcash blockchain and any number of other blockchains.</p>



<p>Our preferences:</p>



  We prefer protocol interoperability features with the best balance of current and future potential reach against complexity. For example, interoperability with Bitcoin may have the largest current reach in terms of market capitalization, yet interoperability with the Cosmos ecosystem may have more reach with lower complexity.  To that end, we have a preference for a protocol with finality, as described below in the Dynamic availability vs finality section.  We prefer to target existing, standard cross-chain mechanisms without requiring privacy innovations. We prefer to design the interface between the shielded pool and cross-chain mechanisms similarly to our preference for the interface between the shielded pool and stake delegation.  



 



 Proof-of-stake security 



<p>While we strongly favor protocols that are proven via real-world production hardening, we additionally require a strong theoretical foundation.</p>



 Incentives and resource cost security 



<p>A core concept in security arguments for cryptocurrency protocols is incentive alignment: If it’s in the best interest of independent block producers to follow reinforcing consensus rules, the protocol should be robust against deviations (aka attacks). This is an important departure from earlier work in Byzantine consensus protocols, which typically only distinguished between “honest” or altruistic nodes versus malicious nodes.</p>



<p>If security relies on incentives, then feasibility of an attack depends on the payoff given the cost. So, for example, a proof-of-work attacker with a tiny fraction of mining capacity is unlikely to execute a long rollback within some window. However, as an attacker’s resources scale up, their ability to successfully execute attacks improves (despite the larger cost of the attack).</p>



<p>So, arguments for security in cryptocurrency consensus analyses often rely on the cost to maliciously control a key resource: hashpower for proof-of-work and staked tokens for proof-of-stake. Sites like <a href="https://www.crypto51.app/">crypto51.app</a> provide cost estimates for 51 percent attacks against PoW chains, which exemplifies this mode of reasoning about security.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pwt-EdnjhDLc_Mi2ydHus0_Cm14rs1Aq/view">Ethereum 2.0 Economic Review by Hoban &amp; Borgers</a>, the authors compare the estimated 51 percent attack cost against ETH1 (PoW) to the cost of controlling sufficient validators for a safety attack against ETH2 (PoS) as a heuristic to determine whether the newer protocol is as safe as the previous protocol.</p>



<p>Our preference: We believe the “attack cost comparison” used in the Hoban &amp; Borgers paper is one useful guideline in analyzing the safety of a transition from PoW to PoS, as long as we exercise caution in not relying too heavily on this single heuristic.</p>



<p>A key safety mechanism in PoS protocols is an “unbonding period” during which a staker cannot access their staked funds without some delay. This delay underpins security guarantees, for example, by ensuring a bond may be slashed some time after a slashable behavior occurs.</p>



<p>Our preference: We don’t anticipate deviating from an existing candidate protocol’s design for unbonding period length, while ensuring it is tuned to a conservative value for our security requirements.</p>



 Wrinkles in incentive space 



<p>While the notion of relying on participants to follow incentives seems reasonable, we are acutely aware of three big risks in the “cost of resource” attack reasoning from the last section:</p>



  Attack costs may be overestimated  Pay-offs may be underestimated  Or more generally, real incentives for participants may not be correctly modeled  



<p>Attack costs can be overestimated in the simple “cost of consensus resource” security model due to financial mechanisms, as well as combined attack modalities. For example, <a href="https://jbonneau.com/doc/B16a-BITCOIN-why_buy_when_you_can_rent.pdf">Why buy when you can rent?</a> explores how an attacker can use “bribery” to gain temporary control of PoW mining capacity to execute an attack, without incurring the larger and longer term capital cost of acquiring the mining equipment. A similar case could occur in PoS if, for example, an attacker acquires staking capital through a financial mechanism that lowers their direct cost.</p>



<p>Pay-offs may be underestimated, especially because the attack-cost models tend to ignore payoffs altogether. If an attack costs the equivalent of $X billion USD, that may seem reassuring, but what if an attack can net $10X billion in proceeds?</p>



<p>Finally, those two problems are more specific cases of the real incentives of participants being incorrectly modeled. On this more general point, evolving real-world incentives may threaten the security of consensus protocols even when there is no “attacker” with malicious intent. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00919">Competitive equilibria between staking and on-chain lending</a> the researchers analyze how the amount staked in a PoS protocol interacts with a model defi lending platform. In that analysis, staking security may become perilously low through self-interested behavior of participants, none of whom intends to “attack” the network. The meltdown of the Terra staking token Luna, as described by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-05-11/terra-flops">Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine</a>, would seem to be a real-life event related to this research that is likely to become a canonical example of how financialization mechanisms when attached to a proof-of-stake token can lead to security disasters.</p>



<p>So, many kinds of financialization or financial mechanics can impact security, including defi, bridging, multi-asset support, and off-chain custodial financial services impact security.</p>



<p>All of this complexity not only complicates analysis of a protocol, but it also opens the design space to incorporating financialization mechanisms. Existing networks are exploring this area of design space with staking derivatives, such as staking-backed derivative tokens (often simply called “staking derivatives” or “liquid staking”), <a href="https://medium.com/osmosis-community-updates/osmosis-superfluid-staking-faq-a7b49797cb72">superfluid staking</a>, and more. <a href="https://research.paradigm.xyz/staking">On Staking Pools and Staking Derivatives</a> mentions a common argument that liquid staking may lower security and it then presents an argument that for some given assumptions it can actually increase security.</p>



<p>Finally, all of this discussion of incentives has skirted around a core economic design component impacting PoS security, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-tHNTedhBNCRI6p7mGm0Gyfy_RIIGqXRgBXNJecLnrI/edit#heading=h.v6vihtk2cvzs">Issuance Policy</a>, which we discuss separately below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our preference: Our preferences around issuance are described in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-tHNTedhBNCRI6p7mGm0Gyfy_RIIGqXRgBXNJecLnrI/edit#heading=h.v6vihtk2cvzs">Issuance policy</a> section. Our belief around financialization is that it generally produces value, is inevitable, and that ZEC can be safely incorporated into it, so long as we understand and mitigate risks as they develop. Our preference for incorporating financialization into the consensus protocol is to be extremely conservative and only consider such mechanisms, such as liquid staking, when there is a strong argument for their benefit versus their risk and complexity. We prefer to propose a simpler “V1” protocol and may consider such mechanisms in later iterations of future PoS protocol improvements.</p>



 Dynamic availability vs finality 



<p>The research literature highlights a fundamental trade-off in consensus protocols between “dynamic availability” vs “finality”. This extends earlier research from distributed computing around a similar trade-off popularized as the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12636">CAP theorem</a>.</p>



<p>Dynamically available protocols can continue making progress during network partitions, at the cost of reverting transactions when the partitions later reconnect. Finalizing protocols ensure that once a transaction is final it cannot be reverted, at the cost of halting the network during a partition.</p>



<p>Both transaction reversion (aka “rollbacks”) and network halts cause economic damage to participants. A protocol which allows transaction reversion can lead to “half-executed” economic exchanges, which leave one party harmed. Protocols that can halt will prevent the users from accessing their capital, introducing opportunity costs.</p>



<p>An example of a half-executed exchange in a dynamically available protocol (such as Zcash PoW), is when Alice sends Bob 0.001 ZEC, and Bob makes and gives Alice a latte, then Alice consumes it. If there is subsequently a network rollback that reverts the transfer, Bob will not receive the 0.2 ZEC, thus causing Bob to not be compensated for their work. By contrast, in a finalizing protocol, if Bob receives the payment he has a guarantee it cannot be reverted, and can safely sell the latte. Meanwhile, if a finalizing protocol halts, Alice cannot pay Bob at all. Neither party loses out in direct terms, but they cannot complete an exchange which has opportunity costs. (For example, should Alice wait in the cafe? For how long?)</p>



<p>However, it’s important to note that network halts in finalizing protocols can be particularly damaging for financialized mechanics that should respond in real-time to market conditions, such as collateralized systems that may liquidate positions when real-time prices cross some threshold.</p>



<p>Our preference: We have a strong preference for finalizing protocols. A network halt affects all users consistently whereas a rollback only reverts a portion of transactions (those on one of multiple partitions) and harms one participant in every economic exchange for all reverted transactions. Currently, the Zcash network has minimal programmability enabling use cases such as financial systems that respond to real-time price oracles, so we suspect that class of harm from network halts is lower than other crypto networks. Finally, we believe, separate consensus protocols which provide finality can interoperate more safely with less complexity.</p>



 Block producer decentralization and resilience 



<p>Because permissionlessness is a key property of Zcash, we need to consider how resilient the consensus infrastructure is.</p>



<p>The infrastructure that selects from proposed blocks is critical to censorship resistance and capture resistance, although shielded transactions and the possibility of a community-organized chain split are even more fundamental protections. If entrance to the set of block selectors can be limited outside of freely open, nondiscretionary competition, that presents a capture risk.</p>



<p>Among proof-of-stake protocols with nondiscretionary rules for becoming a block selector, there are several constraints to entry:</p>



  Participation has capital and operational costs beyond staking bond capital itself, such as network connectivity, operations &amp; maintenance, executive functions, etc… We refer to this as “out-of-band costs”.  Participation has competitive in-band staking bond capital requirements, or “in-band costs”.  Different protocols may have resource constraints on the number of participants. For example, Ethereum Consensus Layer aims to support thousands of block selector nodes, while Tendermint has a practical limit of hundreds of block selectors.  If entry is in-band, the existing block selectors must accept in-band transactions that allow new entrants to register. There is a risk that existing block selectors could censor these registrations to prevent their competitors from freely entering the system.  



<p>Our preferences: For each of the above constraints, our preferences are:</p>



  We prefer to prioritize permissionless entry and competition into block producer infrastructure.  We prefer in-band staking bonds to be delegatable with low cost and ease of use by a very large number of users. We believe the ability for users to freely redelegate their stake to different block selectors enables free competition between the selectors.  We prefer the practical “floor” amount of ZEC for delegating stake to be as low as feasible, ideally less than $1 USD.  We prefer not to prioritize having a large number of block selectors based on the belief that delegatable stake supports free competition sufficiently. We also believe finalizing protocols tend to have lower limits on the number of block selectors supported, and our preference for finality supersedes the desire for a large number of block selectors.  We strongly prefer protocols that protect the permissionless entry of new validators in free competition to preserve overall consensus permissionlessness, resist capture, and lower validation fees.  We believe with this combination of properties, delegator returns should approach block producer returns through open competition.  



 Other security risks 



<p>There are a multitude of other security risks related to PoS which we anticipate will be shared between Zcash and other PoS networks, including long-range attacks, a variety of network attacks (eclipse attacks, Denial-of-Service, initial node introduction risks), and more.</p>



<p>Our preference: Based on the belief that these risks will not be unique to Zcash, we optimistically anticipate existing PoS protocol designs have been hardened against them. Where we discover weaknesses we intend to collaborate with the broader PoS protocol design ecosystem to address those.</p>



 



 Issuance policy 



<p>For cryptocurrencies, beginning with Bitcoin’s breakthrough design, monetary policy sits firmly in the intersection of macro- and micro-economic dynamics, protocol security, governance, usage, and adoption. This area of protocol design is truly multidisciplinary and novel.</p>



<p>We aim to publish a more detailed exploration of issuance policies and PoS security in an upcoming blog post.</p>



 Issuance rate security 



<p>Existing proof-of-stake protocols have a variety of issuance policies. We’re just beginning to familiarize ourselves with research related to how issuance relates to Proof-of-Stake Security.</p>



<p>Our Preference: We aim to provide supporting arguments from research around the protocol security for the specific issuance policy we propose.</p>



 Issuance policy discretion 



<p>There are several design options around issuance policy involving discretion and the schedule itself.</p>



<p>Issuance could be more or less discretionary. A prime example of a schedule with minimal discretion is Bitcoin’s issuance schedule, which is fixed. The only way to alter it would be a core protocol change that would require an economically dominant majority of users to adopt a hardforking consensus rule change. An example of a protocol with discretion over monetary parameters would be MakerDAO or many other DAOs which can alter rates, fees, or other economic parameters through on-chain governance. A middle-ground example might be Ethereum, where the current issuance schedule is fixed in the protocol, yet there is precedent to alter this through consensus rule upgrades.</p>



<p>Our Preference: We prefer an issuance policy with as minimal discretion as possible. Because Zcash already has a culture and precedent for backwards incompatible protocol upgrades, this is likely to include social norms about the “Overton window” of acceptable issuance changes, placing a high burden on proposals to motivate changes to issuance. An example from Zcash history of the threshold to enact a significant change was the establishment of the Development Fund which involved a multiyear referendum-like process.</p>



 Issuance rate schedule 



<p>There are four major possibilities for issuance schedules:</p>



  Keep the current Bitcoin-like schedule completely unchanged.  Adopt a schedule that’s strictly equal or lower than the current schedule, thus keeping the 21M ZEC cap.  Adopt a “reasonable” well-known schedule that doesn’t maintain the Bitcoin-like limit.  Something else further afield.  



<p>Our preference: We have a preference for the second option, a rate that’s lower than the current Bitcoin-like schedule. If this is feasible from a security perspective, we believe it would be acceptable to the vast majority of current and potential future Zcash users, while lowering the costs paid by holders for the security of the network. This option would maintain the 21M ZEC cap. We may find in our research phase that this option cannot support sufficient security, in which case we’ll surface the issue for Zcash users as soon as we formulate the concern.</p>



 



 On-chain governance 



<p>Proof-of-stake protocols track the amounts of tokens in bonds, and use that information for making consensus decisions (such as which nodes are able to become block producers). Thus, it’s very natural to also enable on-chain governance mechanisms, where the amount of coins are used for other decisions outside of direct block production consensus.</p>



<p>Our preference: We prefer not to propose binding governance on Zcash protocol development using coin-weighted polling. However we do have a strong preference to enable non-binding coin-weighted polling where anyone can submit petitions or polls and ZEC holders can weigh in using on-chain coin-weighting data. We believe this gives the best balance between capture resistance and governance signaling, and follows the Zcash tradition of incrementally improving governance in safe and sensible stages.</p>



 



 Reducing protocol complexity 



<p>Zcash has successfully evolved throughout its lifetime with Bitcoin-compatible functionality through Transparent Addresses, and three separate shielded protocols (Sprout, Sapling, and Orchard). The benefit of this has been to enable wider technical adoption and backwards compatibility. There are several drawbacks to this “technical debt”:</p>



  Each kind of transfer technology interacts with a single common ZEC supply, so supply integrity failures in any of these tech stacks present a risk to the entire system. While the “<a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/turnstile-enforcement-against-counterfeiting/">Shielded pool turnstile</a>” mechanism protects the overall ZEC supply, such a failure would still harm users and shake confidence in the overall protocol.  The protocol must be complex to support multiple different technologies, making it more difficult for new implementations.  The same complexity inhibits protocol designers from safely extending or improving the protocol, and Zcash needs continuous innovation to remain relevant into the future.  Older shielded pools are rarely used, so even users who need that functionality in the future may find that wallet support has either been removed or has unintentionally accrued bugs for that rarely used use case.  



<p>It may be feasible and a good path forward to couple the need to reduce protocol complexity with a transition process to PoS. It may, however, introduce extra complexity and risk, so this is an area that needs more research and discussion across the community.</p>



<p>Our preferences: We prefer to design the new PoS protocol with support for only newer technologies, and to include a standard migration system to address the issue of technology evolution moving forward. We prefer for the Zcash protocol to introduce fees for users of older technology to incentivize migration and additionally to restrict migration to the new protocol to the newer technology stacks.</p>



 



 



 



 Next steps 



<p>As our technical and market research progresses, we will regularly post articles on specific topics, our current understanding of that area, any preferences we hold, and next steps for that topic. The next topic we will dive into for this technical research blog series is issuance in PoS protocols and how that relates to Zcash.</p>

<p>1. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10698.pdf">Resource Pools and the CAP Theorem</a> the notion of general “consensus resources” is used to model dynamically available and finalizing protocols (including both PoW and PoS) in a common framework.</p>



<p>2. A separate team, <a href="https://qed-it.com/">qed-it</a>, is currently developing multi-asset support for Zcash dubbed Zcash Shielded Assets. Their latest update is available <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/grant-update-zcash-shielded-assets-monthly-updates/41153/11">here</a>.</p>



<p>3. While Zcash currently does not have programmability features, there is significant enthusiasm for developing for programmable use cases, for example the Zcash Foundation calls includes it as a goal in <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/the-zcash-foundations-strategy/41549">a recent post defining their Zcash strategy</a>.</p>



<p>4. An exception here may be changes to the Bitcoin issuance schedule that could be adopted as soft forks, such as lowering the issuance rate early. Existing nodes would accept this, since it’s already acceptable for miners to claim less than the maximum available reward in their coinbase. In any case, we still consider this minimally discretionary.</p>

Jordan began his journey with BlockWallet as a community member. Through his active participation and consistently providing valuable suggestions and contributions to the BlockWallet community, we saw a natural fit for Jordan to transition into a Community Manager&nbsp;role.</p><p>Read more to learn about Jordan, his position at BlockWallet, and his thoughts on&nbsp;crypto.</p> What’s your job position? <p>I’m a Community Manager at BlockWallet and I’m in charge of the following:</p>  Educating the community around BlockWallet  Keeping the community engaged  Relaying information between the team and community  <p>I’ll also be helping out with writing short informational pieces and doing the occasional bug fix wherever necessary.</p> Which projects have you worked on&nbsp;before? <p>I’ve been a part of a few crypto-focused communities, such as Axie Infinity and a few other p2e projects, since finishing my computer science University course last year.

After a few months of research I bought my first batch of Ethereum and shortly after, I started getting involved with the BlockWallet community.</p> What made you interested in BlockWallet? <p>I’ve been searching for high potential low cap projects for a little while when I stumbled across BlockWallet in April of 2021.

I started getting involved with the community and made suggestions and contributions wherever I could — and as soon as I heard there was a community manager role available I jumped at the&nbsp;chance!</p> Why do you think privacy matters on blockchains? <p>Without privacy your data is often at the mercy of the highest bidder, who may not have your best interests at heart. This idea is well known in the traditional financial world, which is why your bank balance isn’t open to the public. When it comes to public ledgers, however, your financial information is easily accessible if you don’t take extra steps to protect&nbsp;it.</p><p>If you wouldn’t expose your bank account activity in Web2, why would you do the equivalent in&nbsp;Web3?</p> Do you have any predictions on where crypto will be 5 years from&nbsp;now? <p>5 years from now I think the crypto space will be largely the same, just with a larger market cap and more of a focus on user privacy. I also think that the average Ethereum user won’t have to use MetaMask anymore&nbsp;😎</p> Parting thoughts <p>I’m really glad to be a part of this amazing community at such an early stage and can’t wait to see what the future holds for BlockWallet 💪🔲</p> About BlockWallet <p>BlockWallet is the most private, non-custodial browser extension wallet, where users can store funds and interact with their favorite blockchain applications privately.</p><p>As crypto sees mainstream adoption, blockchain’s lack of privacy poses real security risks for newcomers and enthusiasts alike.

<p>Like its predecessor, Wasabi Wallet 2.0 &nbsp;is an open-source, non-custodial, privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet for desktop, that implements trustless WabiSabi coinjoin over the Tor anonymity network.<br></p><p>This newest iteration promises more privacy at less cost for the user. The zkSNACKs coordinator in Wasabi Wallet 2.0 offers an initial coordinator fee of 0.3% which only fresh UTXOs will pay. Remixes (even after one transaction), Wasabi Wallet 1.0 coinjoin outputs and UTXOs of 0.01 BTC or less pay no coordinator fees in Wasabi Wallet 2.0 coinjoins. </p><p>We know you've all been impatiently waiting so we've compiled a concise list of some of the newest features in Wasabi Wallet 2.0. Read more about it below.</p><p></p> Wasabi Wallet 2.0 Welcome Screen  <p>After the Wallet has been downloaded and installed users are greeted by a completely revamped User Interface and color scheme that welcomes them to the wasabi experience and outlines the project’s core values.</p><p></p> Loading Your Wallet  <p>The login screen has been completely redesigned/revamped since the TestNet release. The border of the wallet has been changed and the previous sliding sidebar on the left has been replaced with a sleek transparent design.</p><p>Wasabi 1.0 users who have upgraded to Wasabi Wallet 2.0 will be able to access their wallets using their previous login information, new users will be presented with the following prompts:</p> Create a New Wallet <p>After the user has selected the ‘create a new wallet' option &nbsp;from the ‘Add Wallet’ prompt, they will then be able to:</p>  Name the wallet and create a password  Write down the numbered recovery words in the correct numbered order  Confirm recovery words by entering particular words in the sequence they were given.  Choose a coinjoin strategy  <p>Connecting to hardware wallet<br>The user can connect a hardware wallet to Wasabi<br><br>Import a wallet<br>Import an existing wallet to Wasabi <br><br>Recover a wallet<br>Recover an existing wallet using the Recovery Words</p> Loading the wallet <p>Initiates the Auto-start coinjoin countdown - a feature which usually starts within the first 15 minutes of loading your wallet. However, the user can start coinjoin immediately after the wallet has loaded by clicking on the ‘play’ button.</p> Coinjoin Strategy <p>There are 3 default coinjoin profiles meaning that they have specific default settings regarding the coinjoins. The user can choose which one it prefers or create their own customized one. The defaults are: </p>  Minimize costs  Maximize speed  Maximize privacy   <p>The customize feature allows you to adjust the settings for the coinjoin</p>  Enable/disable Automatically start coinjoin  Anonymity score target (2-300)  Coinjoin time preference (hours, days, weeks, months).  <p>The wallet home page displays the user’s balance, the privacy progress, the current exchange rate (BTC/USD) and the transaction history list. Users loading newly created wallets will have an empty wallet with a Privacy Progress of 100%.</p><p>Privacy progress indicates the percentage of progress in making your entire wallet private/making the coins in your wallet private. Users will have a privacy progress of 100% when there are no coins in their wallets. </p><p>Discreet Mode (formerly known as Privacy Mode) hides all the sensitive information on your screen by changing the numbers to hash symbols.<br><br>Other options on the Wallet Home Screen include:</p><p>Wallet Info (wallet fingerprint, derivation path &amp; key information)</p><p>Wallet Settings (coinjoin related settings &amp; Verify Recovery Words)</p><p>Wallet Statistics &nbsp;(UTXO count, balance, address &amp; key gap information)</p> Sending Bitcoin with Wasabi Wallet 2.0   To send bitcoin, users need to click on the Send button in the upper right corner of the wallet’s home page.  Enter the address you want to send bitcoin to or use your webcam to scan the QR code (available for Windows only).  Enter the amount of bitcoin or dollar value you would like to send. The wallet automatically calculates and converts this amount to the amount of bitcoin that will be sent.  <p>Before Sending transactions, the wallet provides a Transaction Preview that gives a summary of your transaction. This &nbsp;includes:</p><p>-The amount of BTC you are sending<br>-The address you are sending the BTC to<br>-Who could know about this transaction (only if non-private coins are used)<br>-The estimated transaction confirmation time<br>-The transaction fee<br></p> Privacy Suggestions <p>To avoid change, users will have a single transaction with no transaction change returning to their wallets. Thus creating a smaller digital footprint on the blockchain and making your transactions a bit more private. Users can avoid change by sending more or sending less bitcoin than originally intended. </p> Get suggestions to avoid privacy leaks by having no change in the transaction <p>The wallet tries to maintain coins with differing denominations and tries to find the best coin combinations that will produce the least difference for the target amount.</p> Receiving Bitcoin with Wasabi Wallet 2.0  <p> <br>To receive bitcoin, users need to click on the Receive button in the upper right corner of the wallet’s home page. Label the address by entering the name of the entity or person you are receiving bitcoin from and then click the continue button to generate the receive address.</p><p>All previously generated bitcoin addresses which haven't been used yet, are displayed at &nbsp;Unused Receive Addresses.</p> Advanced Features  <p>The Wallet Coins displays all the wallets' utxo's. The user can see all related information of the UTXO: confirmed, coinjoining, amount, anonymity score and the labels.</p><p>In the Wallet Coins, it is possible to select specific UTXOs.</p> Wallet Settings <p>The wallet settings consist of two tabs:</p> General <p>This allows you to manage your wallet’s privacy and appearance.</p>  Light/dark mode  Run wasabi when the computer starts  Run Wasabi &nbsp;in the background when the window is closed  Automatically copy address  Automatically paste address  Network anonymization  Terminate Tor when Wasabi shuts down  Fee display unit (display fee in BTC or sats)    Bitcoin   Network: Main, TestNet &amp; RegTest  (EXPERIMENTAL) Run Bitcoin Knots on startup: this downloads the entire blockchain and allows you to run a full node  Local Bitcoin Core/Knots version: display current version  Bitcoin P2P Endpoint: connect to full node  Dust Threshold: coins under the dust threshold won’t appear, 0.00005000 BTC by default  <p>For a more detailed visual walkthrough of Wasabi Wallet 2.0’s new features check out this video by <a href="https://twitter.com/btcdragonlord">btcdragonlord</a>. </p><p>Download Wasabi Wallet 2.0 <a href="https://www.wasabiwallet.io/">here</a> .</p>

 Introducing Sign-in with Web3 — Building a Non-Custodial World <p>In a much needed multi-chain extension to Sign-in with Ethereum, users will now be able to control their digital identity with their Ethereum/ENS, Solana, and Starknet accounts instead of relying on traditional/custodial profiles.</p><p>Importance of building a non-custodial future</p><p>In crypto, there is a saying that goes “Not your keys, not your crypto ‘’ exemplifying the importance of non-custodiality, — the need to shift the dynamic of ownership from entities to the end-user. The principle also extends beyond just the crypto you hold to your very identity itself. While traditional Web2 entities have done a tremendous job in making the user experience incredibly intuitive but that has also come at a cost — the cost of&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>There is excessive monetization of the users’ activity and their residing information on the web. Security compromises even among the biggest names in cybersecurity are increasingly common. As the average user is becoming more and more aware of these tradeoffs, the voice to safeguard their identity is growing louder by the day. We at Web3Auth firmly believe that non-custodiality is the future and we want to lead the way in making it&nbsp;happen.</p><p>Sign-in With Web3 — You Own Your&nbsp;Identity</p><p>Web3 has to a large extent cracked the code for the user privacy problem. The power of public and private keys, enabled by crypto technologies, allows users to own their username, and profile data, and use their accounts across different applications. This is the fundamental on which built Web3Auth was built — to leverage the power of threshold cryptography to shift the dynamic of power from entities to individuals. When the Ethereum Foundation announced Sign-in with Ethereum, it was not only an important(albeit silent) innovation for the internet, it was also a solid validation and acknowledgement of our core&nbsp;values.</p><p>Sign-in with Web3 adds on to that innovation with a powerful multi-chain twist. It extends that innovation to some of the biggest chain ecosystems. Starting today, users on the Ethereum, Solana, and Starknet chains can log in to any Web2 application using their web3 identities thereby bringing the security and privacy of Web3 authentication to&nbsp;Web2.</p><p>What Does Sign-in With Web3&nbsp;Solve?</p><p>Today, there are multiple blockchain platforms and thus naturally, there arises a need to have a standard specification for authentication with Web3 identities. This led to the birth of<a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-74.md"> CAIP-74</a> which allows for creating a chain-agnostic Object Capability (CACAO), based on a signing message as an IPLD object. Sign in with Web3 endeavours to maintain compatibility with CAIP-74, thereby adhering to a chain agnostic standard.</p> Supported Chains<a href="https://siww.web3auth.io/#supported-chains">​</a> <p>Currently, Sign-in with Web3&nbsp;supports</p>  Ethereum  Solana  Starknet  <p>**Support for more chains coming&nbsp;soon.</p><p>Do check our<a href="https://siww.web3auth.io/"> documentation</a> for a step by step guide on how to build a Sign-in with Web3 flow to navigate the authentication logic. Feel free to reach out to us in case you have questions on our<a href="https://t.me/web3authdev"> Telegram&nbsp;Chat</a></p><p>Additionally, Web3Auth, the creator of Sign-in with Web3, offers a dedicated <a href="http://docs.web3auth.io">suite of authentication</a> tools for all Web3 Developers. This includes support for OAuth and native biometric login using our Plug and Play SDK.

<p>In this episode from October 2019, a16z co-founder Marc Andreessen and former a16z podcast showrunner Sonal Choksi bring on MIT economist and bestselling author Andrew McAfee to discuss why the lessons of human growth in times past, from the Industrial Revolution onwards, might not apply to our future. It used to be that the only way for humanity to grow — and progress — was through destroying the environment. But is this interplay between human growth vs. environment really a zero-sum game? Even if it were true in history, is it true today? If capitalism is not responsible for environmental degradation, than who or what is? And where does (and doesn’t) technology come in?</p><p>The conversation is based on McAfee’s 2019 book <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/More-from-Less/Andrew-McAfee/9781982103576">More from Less: The Surprising Story of How We Learned to Prosper Using Fewer Resources -- and What Happens Next,&nbsp;</a> ranging broadly across many areas of growth, from the future of energy and agriculture to the role of capitalism and technology today and tomorrow, from dematerialization &nbsp;to Tesla, Buckminster Fuller, and more.&nbsp;</p>

  Forecasting &amp; Scenario Planning  <p>This was a presentation to our founders on May 19, 2022 to help them plan effectively in uncertain environments.

</p>  <p>By Ravi Gupta and Pat Grady</p><p>Published June 14, 2022</p>  



 
<p>This is a follow-up to our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/adapting-to-endure">Adapting to Endure</a>&nbsp;conversation. In this session, we dove into how forecasting and scenario planning come into play when the world around you is changing rapidly, as it is at the moment. It is not intended to give a comprehensive overview of forecasting and scenario planning, but rather, to help you modulate to the current environment.</p>

  Adapting to Endure  <p>This was a presentation to our founders on May 16, 2022 to help them navigate current market conditions.</p>  <p>By Team Sequoia</p><p>Published June 14, 2022</p>  



 
<p>We believe the current market environment is a Crucible Moment that will provide challenges but also opportunities for all of you. Many legendary companies are forged during challenging environments as competition thins, real businesses get built and the opportunity for innovation is seized by those who see it. </p>



<p>We shared this presentation with Sequoia founders in May, and are now sharing it publicly with the wider startup community. Whether you are a CEO, operator or an aspiring founder pondering what it will take to build a successful company in a rapidly changing business climate, we hope this will prove a useful toolkit. No matter your role, the key to thriving in the next period is confronting reality, and acting decisively to adapt.</p>

<p><br>Is privacy a human right? To get to the bottom of this discussion, first we must analyze many angles. Privacy is best conceptualized as the right to control information about yourself, selectively disclosing only what you intend to.<br><br>If you think about it, the way our society uses the words "public" and "private" gives up quite a lot of information about our nature. It speaks about how we perceive what we allow (or don’t allow) others to see. <br><br>We say of someone that they're very private if they don't post a lot about their lives on social media. A public building is a government facility or one the government pays for and maintains. And the private sector is constituted by companies that are overseen by a government but held privately by individuals who can operate as they think is best. <br><br>This is just one example of the many ways in which the desire for privacy influences our daily lives. As we’ll elaborate on throughout this article, privacy is more than a social construct —it is a key component of the human experience. We all have thoughts, memories, and aspects of our lives that we choose not to let everyone see. <br><br>If you're reading this, chances are you highly value the human right to privacy. However, you might not have thought deeply about the roots of this belief and why some might oppose it. You may also have never considered that privacy can be seen through the lens of philosophy, ethics, and legality. <br><br>Let’s see what happens once we put on these different lenses.</p> The New Secret: A framework to think about privacy and humans’ right to it <p><br>Panther's co-Founder Anish Mohammed and philosopher Shaj Mohan deeply explored privacy in their 2011 article <a href="https://www.epw.in/journal/2011/13/commentary/new-secret.html">The New Secret</a>. In the light of the previous year’s <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-wikileaks-enlightened-us-in-2010/">WikiLeaks scandals</a>, the authors delved into how secrets are traditionally viewed, kept, and treated.</p>Privacy could be considered an intrinsic part of human nature and so could the desire to uncover secrets.<p>The New Secret characterizes a secret as all information that one would like to keep from the knowledge of others, for whatever reason. A secret could range from your true feelings about your spouse's decoration taste to your credit history. In fact, secrets have a few fascinating properties of their own.</p> Characteristics and different flavors of secrets <p></p><p>Secrets have different structures and properties that cause quite unique social dynamics around them. These properties are that they have consequence, extractability, are weaponizable, and obey hierarchy.<br><br>Let’s start with consequence. A secret's importance (and therefore the care with which it is kept) is tied to its potential revealing's consequences. A secret's uncovering could result in a national security crisis, as WikiLeaks did for the United States, or in a $1 library fine.<br><br>Another, more abstract property of secrets is that they are extractable. <br><br>A spy on an enemy state can utilize her position to extract secrets for the benefit of her nation. This shows that secrets' importance often lies in their ability to be weaponized. Another way to extract secrets is by knowing a specific procedure, as a hacker can utilize his encryption knowledge to decrypt a password.<br><br>Secrets are also hierarchical. For example, in a private (again, pun intended) company, a CEO theoretically has the right to request all kinds of information from and of their employees, while this is often not true the other way around. In nation-states, the State sits alone at the top of the hierarchy of secrets.</p> Secrets in a digital society <p></p><p>In an era of non-stop data exchange, Instagram stories, leaked videos/photos, and a 24/7 need for social media scandals, the properties of secrets remain unchanged. Some would even say that they’re magnified.<br><br>Our authors argue that the WikiLeaks case also exemplifies that the more critical a secret is, the greater the credibility of its revealer becomes. That is that, by revealing a secret of a high member of a hierarchy, its revealer gains hierarchical importance as well.<br><br>WikiLeaks famously revealed secrets from the United States’ government, arguably the top member of most global hierarchies. These secrets carried great consequence to the reputation of the State, incentivizing it to prosecute their revealers with all its force. Having obtained secrets by extracting them from within the system (as opposed to the State voluntarily disclosing them), WikiLeaks gained great prominence as a source of truth. </p>Whereas previously a secret would have only helped the revealer gain a weapon, nowadays, it also can boost the revealer's reputation.<p>Another law that influences secrets is that information obtained by revealing a secret has a higher chance of being true, as demonstrated by video espionage. Leaks such as leaked celebrity videos, secret audio recordings, and photographs covertly taken with a telescopic zoom are perceived as carrying more truth and importance than statements to the press. Information extracted secretly or by force, even in the press, is more likely to be considered true. This makes entertainment portals and magazines that leak or divulge secrets for the first time have a great incentive to do so. <br><br>Another example that shows the laws that govern secrets at play is how, in the information age, victims of abuse by powerful people have a higher perceived credibility than ever. Abuse sufferers now have a better vehicles to reveal secrets without being censored, and the secrets that they revealed about members of high hierarchy can turn into powerful weapons, especially if presenting information obtained covertly or by force.</p> A brief history of privacy  Origins of privacy <p><br>It could seem backward to look at privacy through history after analyzing its implications and how it unfolds in our world. However, understanding privacy and secrets in a modern context will help you realize that very little has changed over time.<br><br>Throughout history, privacy has been proven to be innate to human beings. It is valued universally by all societies in one form or another. The most powerful individuals in all ancient societies had an undisputed right to the secrets of others and the ability to seclude themselves if they chose to.<br><br>There are hints that the desire for privacy is intrinsic to biological life. Many<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2021.784794/full#B1"> animals</a> (including powerful predators such as lions) have been observed to desire it. This hints at a non-socially constructed nature of the yearning for privacy in humans. You can see a brief list of these species and how and when they secure their privacy below:</p>Species showing privacy-related behaviors. Some of them, you may note, are incredibly similar to their human counterparts. (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2021.784794/full#B1">Source</a>) Privacy in the first modern societies and today <p></p><p>One area in which we can almost universally see the principle of privacy through history is democracy.<br><br>It didn't take long after the advent of democracy for ancient civilizations to figure out that privacy is an unimpeachable aspect of the democratic process. Secret ballot voting ensures a citizen can't prove (or be proven) to have cast a vote for a particular candidate, thus severely diminishing the efficiency of bribing, threatening, or intimidating voters to win elections.<br><br>Although secret voting was <a href="https://grbs.library.duke.edu/article/viewFile/7781/4839">partially adopted by the Athenians</a> and <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4477105">fully embraced by the Romans</a>, more than a millennium would elapse until it came back with the French Revolution. And, while it took a while to get fully adopted worldwide, democracy is nowadays considered a human right by the United Nations, and is omnipresent in all but the most blatant autocracies.<br><br>Other factors such as ancient records of Mesopotamian houses being designed with a heavy <a href="https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198788218.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780198788218-e-19">focus on privacy</a>, most ancient tribes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patterns_of_Sexual_Behavior">showcasing a preference for privacy</a> in their sexual lives, and secret confessions being a part of most religions (derived from ancient customs) - showcase that privacy has always been an integral part of the human experience.</p>Is it a coincidence that these raccoons “feel” more human to see when safeguarding their privacy? Possibly not!<p>Nowadays, the question of whether privacy is a right by its very nature is <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/privacy/">highly debated by philosophers</a>. Some attribute the right to privacy as an extent of the right to own and control property, or the right to self-protection. Others consider privacy to be an indissoluble part of the right to human dignity. There are still those who deny that privacy is a human right and consider it a contemporary, potentially disposable social value, but they’re hardly the majority.<br><br>Privacy in our times is a requirement for exercising one's individuality. Having your personal space and belongings and being able to control them as you see fit is crucial for the idea of being distinct from others. What a person chooses to do in their personal space or belongings is subject to their terms. Thus even in interacting with the outside world, explicit or implicit conditions preserve privacy to an extent. There’s even a comparative punishment in restricting someone’s privacy and freedom when putting them in prison.</p> Legality: is the law friendly towards our right to privacy? <p></p><p>The law has always played an interesting role in the relationship we have with our own privacy. Nowadays, the State attempts to do a balancing act between two major concerns: Individuals’ desire for privacy and nations’ interest in policing their populations. From some perspectives, privacy is more of an obstacle than an aid to this mission.<br><br>Interestingly, we can see that this has been the case for most of history.<br><br>In the English-speaking world, privacy rights slowly developed as an extension of the castle doctrine (for which registries go as far back as Ancient Rome). According to it, individuals “have the right to use reasonable force, including deadly force, to protect themselves against an intruder in their home.” Famously <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semayne%27s_case">cemented into English common law by a court case in 1604</a> reported by Sir Edward Coke, the castle doctrine has always retained certain exceptions within which public officials may enter uninvited. These exceptions, you could argue, have helped its replication in most Western nations.</p> Humans’ right to Privacy in the digital age <p></p><p>This blog has extensively covered <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/privacy-in-the-age-of-surveillance-a-pipedream-or-something-worth-fighting-for-341a67f1db76">(1)</a> <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/the-economics-of-privacy-an-overview-of-the-economic-consequences-of-total-transparency-fed489e71d47">(2)</a> <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/interoperable-privacy-building-privacy-bridges-to-all-of-defi-2eaa89c9c7ac">(3)</a> the importance of digital privacy, why it’s necessary, and the <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf">kind of privacy solutions we’ll need</a> as we move into Web3. Because of this, as opposed to covering the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zksnarks-through-the-lens-of-a-cypherpunk-f9f72a0f5bcd">cypherpunk fight</a> and the developments in encryption and zero-knowledge technology, we’ll only briefly focus on the government-initiated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars">Crypto Wars</a>.</p><p>It's no secret that governments are typically <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/26/government-is-racing-against-clock-keep-encryption-secure/">high spenders</a> on and hardcore users of cryptography.</p><p>What you might not know is that for most of modern digital history, several governments (the US' first and foremost) have <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/deciphering-the-cryptography-debate/">pushed back</a> against encryption-related exports and public products, arguing that they would enable a variety of crimes. Had these restrictions stayed in place, becoming as strict as intended, today we would live in a very different world. Backdoored software, unencrypted or only slightly encrypted Internet data (which would, paradoxically, enable several other crimes), and perpetual cellular surveillance would be an everyday matter.</p><p>This period of retaliation is now known as the Crypto Wars, and some consider it ongoing. Fortunately, largely thanks to the efforts put in place by intellectuals, civil rights and privacy advocates, and private sector pressure, the distribution and export of software related to encryption now enjoy a more solid, permissive <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/web-security-privacy/0596000456/ch04s04.html">legal stance</a>.</p> Is the access to our right to privacy getting better or worse? <p></p><p>We are also now seeing the first <a href="https://unctad.org/page/data-protection-and-privacy-legislation-worldwide">laws</a> trying to empower users’ digital privacy, as we let devices that can record our every activity into our homes, transact online, and unintentionally create <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/privacy/features/your-digital-footprint-its-bigger-than-you-realize/">deep digital footprints</a>. In fact, this is only possible thanks to technologies our governments previously worked against.</p><p>Nowadays, there are <a href="https://unctad.org/page/data-protection-and-privacy-legislation-worldwide">regulations around customer data</a> of many kinds. The European <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> is considered by many the most comprehensible legal framework around data privacy. At the same time, in the United States, a handful of domain-specific federal laws such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act">HIPAA</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COPPA">COPPA</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Credit_Reporting_Act">Fair Credit and Reporting Act</a>, dictate how businesses may handle customer data. However, a similar level of investment and policymaking goes towards surveillance and control of digital activity, leading to a “privacy vs security” discussion, although some may argue this is a false dichotomy.</p>At least in most polls, there is no clear winner in the privacy vs safety discussion. Economics of privacy  Financial Privacy <p></p><p>There is undoubtedly a <a href="https://assets.aarp.org/rgcenter/consume/2006_06_privacy.pdf">financial aspect to privacy</a>. </p><p>Most of our private activities<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/are-bitcoin-transactions-traceable-coin-security-privacy/"> leave financial traces</a> that may reveal sensitive business or personal data or point those interested in violating our privacy closer towards it. Campaign donations show where you lean politically, medical expenditures may <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/?sh=5ac329646668">expose</a> illnesses or concerns of a patient, and a credit card charge from a local business testifies that you have been there and consumed their goods or services.</p><p>Breaches of financial sensitive data can have significant negative consequences, not only of the monetary kind. These consequences include, but aren’t limited to:</p>  Harassment by salespeople.  Political, ethnical, identitarian, or religious persecution.  Increased exposure to cyber-attacks and fraud attempts.  Hyper-specialized targeting.  Digital price gouging, <a href="https://www.natlawreview.com/article/online-marketplaces-could-expose-third-party-sellers-to-price-gouging-liability">a very present, current issue. </a>  <p>All of the above can vary in gravity based on a number of factors, but the last one showcases one of the main issues with lack of financial privacy: the (sometimes hidden) exposure of an individual to being manipulated using their data. </p><p>For example, due to non-private financial data, a person that an algorithm detects has a family member with an illness could see an increase in price for medicine purchases. This can happen automatically through algorithms. However, it’s perhaps more preoccupying that a lot of our data may have been already irretrievably leaked.</p>Amazon claims that their algorithm <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/amazon-price-gouging-1.5719050">radically increasing the price of basic goods</a> during COVID-19 related shortages was merely incidental.<p>Unfortunately, if we can’t transact through means that are <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/privacy-finance-why-panther-is-different-and-necessary-e423b2993df9">inherently private</a>, our data won’t be so. It also sheds light on a major issue with traditional and on-chain payments, as they tend to carry with them a significant amount of data.</p><p>In the case of on-chain transactions, it’s also important to note that an additional danger associated with them is the transparency of public ledgers (<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/the-economics-of-privacy-an-overview-of-the-economic-consequences-of-total-transparency-fed489e71d47">of which we’ve also spoken at length</a>). This can lead to users being front-runned, arbitraged, having their value extracted, and similar problems.</p> Data leaks and consumer privacy <p></p><p>In today’s internet, the capability of service providers to collect and store data grows faster than their ability to secure it. For that reason, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_breaches">customer data leaks</a> have unfortunately become commonplace. Billions of database entries with personally identifiable information, credit card numbers, billing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and passwords are available all over the internet. Every new leak potentially worsens those that came before it, as data on an individual can be complemented and updated. With enough information at hand, <a href="https://youtu.be/WaaANll8h18">identity theft</a> becomes a trivial endeavor, and <a href="https://www.lifelock.com/learn/identity-theft-resources/lasting-effects-of-identity-theft">real-world consequences</a> are disastrous.</p><p>Government data leaks are also a predominant issue. The State’s power makes data breaches from government databases particularly severe. In the financial realm, the very existence of such a centralized database presents the risk of its citizens being compromised by hackers. This is why some, including Panther, might point out that in a digital era we should start heading in a direction of more, not less, financial privacy when it comes to disclosing information.</p> Is it possible to put a price on privacy? <p></p><p>Different economic studies have tried to <a href="https://techpolicyinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Prince_Wallsten_How-Much-is-Privacy-Worth-Around-the-World-and-Across-Platforms.pdf">price privacy</a> using several mechanisms. Using the "<a href="https://www.donotcall.gov/">Do Not Call</a>" registry in the United States is an interesting example.</p><p>Through this registry, economists have tried to put a price on privacy by contrasting the potential savings of users outside the registry vs. users that do not access the benefits offered by telemarketers. <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.54.2.442">Different studies</a> place privacy's "price" between $0.50 and $98 a year using this technique in the United States.</p><p>However flawed studies like the one mentioned above &nbsp;be, there is an indication that privacy could have an economic value. The transition to an on-chain economy might allow us to see this more clearly, as the adoption of tools for users to transact privately may showcase how much users are willing to pay to add privacy to their transactions, and at what point this barrier becomes too high.</p> (non-) Conclusion <p><br>Although the debate on whether privacy is a human right or a disposable aspect of our lives will likely continue through the ages, it’s more than clear that it is an all-encompassing matter in modern society.</p><p>There are still many debates to be had over privacy from many different possible angles. Some may even argue that definitions upon financial and data privacy will determine whether we continue to evolve to a more egalitarian society as a whole. Through action, regulations, and surveillance, we will collectively decide whether privacy becomes a default (and in what areas), our nations have complete control of all our information and what to do with it, or privacy is left to people's own devices.</p><p>Whichever side you stand on, what's important is that you're aware of the importance of privacy. As an issue that impacts everyone, it must be at the center of our political, ethical, and philosophical discussions before it is too late. The matter of privacy is indeed too important to leave in the hands of the few.</p><p>If this article made you think about what privacy means in your life and how important it is to preserve it, please make sure to share it with a friend.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol whose platform enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a><br><br></p>

<p>Nym components are continuously evolving to make it easier for all actors in the Nym ecosystem to contribute to and interact with the Nym privacy network. And this week is seeing some important updates to the Nym smart contracts and a new wallet&nbsp;release.</p><p>Firstly, a quick update on the contracts: these are being adjusted so that staking supply better matches real world numbers as well as implementing a more competitive active set. These are important changes that will result in a more dynamic token economics and will have the effect of increasing expected staking APY (up to 40% annualized) for the next couple of months, after which it will tail off to a more stable rate (<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-mixnet-apy-initial-simulations-for-first-quarter-139ac49d5348">read&nbsp;more</a>).</p><p>The wallet and the explorer have some exciting new features which should make it much easier&nbsp;to…</p>  manage your&nbsp;accounts  <a href="https://youtu.be/sRMZY6Ez1bA">bond</a> a node into Nym mainnet or Sandbox&nbsp;testnet  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZAVoCmYGNFQ">delegate</a> stake to mix nodes as reputation to earn a share of their&nbsp;rewards  <p><a href="https://nymtech.net/download/">Download</a> the new version of the wallet. The wallet is <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym">open source</a>, unpermissioned and can be forked by anyone wishing to extend functionality.</p><p>Now let’s go through the new features!</p> 1. Multi account management <p>Until now you could only have one account/address under your login. In this version of the wallet we have added the feature that enables creating multiple accounts under the same login or import existing ones. To create or import accounts, make sure you have a password set for your wallet and that you are logged in using password (as opposed to logging in using your mnemonic).</p><p>Then click on the “Account” notion on top of the wallet (as shown). In the next window import your accounts one by one using their mnemonic or create new accounts.</p><p>For each step you will have to confirm actions using your password. When creating a new account always remember to save your mnemonics in a safe&nbsp;place!</p> 2. Better overview of your delegated stake <p>Here is where we have added the most new features to the new wallet. If you hold NYM tokens, you can delegate your tokens to mix nodes operating the mixnet. This will boost that node’s reputation and enable you to earn a share of the rewards it receives for providing privacy.</p><p>In the new wallet release, it is now easier to maintain an overview of who you have delegated stake to and manage your delegations.</p><p>First thing you will notice is a new table that lists your delegations. If you have never delegated to a node before you can start doing so by clicking on the “Delegate” button.</p><p>To find a mix node to delegate to, go to the <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/network-components/mixnodes">Nym network explorer</a>, where you can sort the nodes based on their different parameters i.e Stake Saturation, Profit Margin, Uptime etc. or browse the delegators channel in the Nym&nbsp;<a href="http://discord.gg/nym">Discord</a>.</p><p>When selecting a node make sure not to select the ones with more than 100% stake saturation. Stake saturation of &gt;=100% is now shown in red on the explorer (see below image) meaning those nodes already have too much stake delegated to them and so any extra delegation will just lower the share of rewards for all delegators of that node. You can read more on how to select nodes to delegate to&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/want-to-stake-in-nym-here-is-how-to-choose-a-mix-node-to-delegate-nym-to-c3b862add165">here</a>.</p><p>Once you have selected a mix node, simply copy its identity key from the explorer and the amount you want to delegate and paste in the delegation window as&nbsp;below.</p><p>Once you confirm that you want to delegate stake to the given mix node, your delegation will be queued up and visible in the “Pending Delegation Events” in the bottom of the page. It can take up to an hour (one epoch) for your delegation to take effect. After that you can see the details of your delegation like the following.</p><p>You can keep delegating to more nodes by following the same process explained above. All your delegations will be listed on the same&nbsp;page.</p> 3. Easier interface for managing your delegations <p>Now let’s look into what you can do with each of your delegations. Click on the action menu shown with 3 dots on the right edge of the delegation table (as shown&nbsp;below).</p><p>You will notice 4 actions that you can take. Let’s explain each of&nbsp;them;</p><p>Delegate more: If you are happy with the performance of the node you have delegated to, you can always add more stake to&nbsp;it.</p><p>Undelegate: Undelegate your stake and withdraw the rewards you have accrued by undelegating from the mix&nbsp;node.</p><p>Redeem: Redeem rewards you have accrued from a node and transfer the amount to your account&nbsp;balance.</p><p>Compound: In order to get compounded rewards for your stake delegation, you will need to compound your rewards manually using this&nbsp;button.</p><p>Note that all of the above actions will require some tiny amount of NYMs to pay for transaction fees. Make sure you always have some NYMs left in your balance to be able to pay for&nbsp;fees.</p><p>This sums up the new features of this&nbsp;release.</p><p>Until next time, happy delegating!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-wallet-v1-0-5-is-out-f4ad282ee389">Nym wallet v1.0.5 is out!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>How when it comes to privacy — the more the&nbsp;merrier!</p><p>The mass surveillance of today’s internet has to be met by a movement for mass privacy, as the communications paradigm of tomorrow.</p><p>Privacy cannot be a question of individual preference because the nature of online surveillance means that one person’s choices and actions online reveals a lot about another person&nbsp;too!</p><p>Nym makes a collective approach to privacy possible, technically and economically. And the aim is to power up a whole ecosystem of privacy preserving applications.</p><p>This blogpost gives an overview of Nym and how it is built to bring forth an ecosystem approach to securing privacy. With the launch of the core Nym infrastructure the next phase is for a plethora of privacy enhanced apps (PEApps) to be built on this network layer privacy&nbsp;system.</p><p>As we’re fond of saying, privacy loves&nbsp;company!</p> A privacy layer for any app, wallet or&nbsp;chain <p>Nym is a privacy layer for any application and is chain agnostic. Nym is a mixnet that takes any digital communications, encrypts it and mixes it with other communications so that no one can trace the patterns of communication. Even when your communications are encrypted, the timings and patterns of communication traffic reveals a lot about you and your relationships. With Nym, your communications are effectively “lost in the&nbsp;crowd”.</p><p>What this means is that the more people communicating through the mixnet, the better for everyone’s privacy!</p><p>Whether a Telegram or Signal message or a cryptocurrency transaction broadcast across a peer-to-peer network, the network is designed to provide privacy for any app, wallet or chain. And in turn this generates an income for mix nodes and delegators who are rewarded through fees for providing this&nbsp;service.</p><p>This approach is an infrastructural approach, where privacy is not just reserved for technical experts (or those with enough money to hire them), but for everyone — integrated into the very apps and wallets you are already using. In this way, Nym is similar to a public utility, think of it like the water mains or the electricity grid.</p><p>By providing the infrastructure on which a truly private internet can be built and maintained, Nym frees up developer time to create user-facing apps that are private by design — just as protocols such as TCP provide the building blocks for the existing internet.</p> The Nym ecosystem <p>Nym is already made up of a global ecosystem of mix node operators and validators who are operating the Nym mixnet (mixing traffic) and the Nyx blockchain (maintaining the reputation and topology of mix&nbsp;nodes).</p><p>The Nym <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/">wallet</a> is the interface for anyone wishing to get involved with the core infrastructure. The wallet is a simple interface that allows people to either bond NYM tokens and run a mix node themselves, or delegate NYM tokens to mix node operators to earn a share of their&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>But this is just the core infrastructure….</p> It is now time for the&nbsp;PEApps! <p>This ecosystem now needs to grow, with user-facing apps so that ordinary people can finally go about their digital lives in the knowledge that what they do and say online will not be used to target themselves or&nbsp;others!</p><p>As the mass-adoption of Signal and Protonmail has demonstrated, when given half a chance, most people will not hesitate to adopt privacy preserving applications over other&nbsp;options.</p><p>Now is the time for PEApps! This is what we have started calling the privacy enhanced applications that will be running on&nbsp;Nym.</p><p>The Nym docs can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/overview/">here</a>.</p><p>Our <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-permanent-testnet-sandbox-264e561adb65">Sandbox</a> environment allows developers to explore&nbsp;Nym.</p><p>For more information on developer grants, contact: <a href="mailto:grant@nymtech.net">grant@nymtech.net</a></p><p>Join the privacy ecosystem</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/privacy-loves-company-dc877a672038">Privacy loves company</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Partnership includes bridging BAT cross-chain for Aurora ecosystem utility</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Announcing the news today in Austin at the Consensus conference, Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave and BAT, and Alex Shevchenko, CEO of Aurora Labs, explained how the companies will collaborate to integrate Aurora, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on the NEAR Protocol, into Brave Wallet. This means greater multi-chain functionality in Brave Wallet and expanded utility for the <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">Basic Attention Token (BAT)</a>.</p>
<p>In the coming months, this integration will bring support for Aurora as one of the preloaded chains in Brave Wallet (in addition to Solana and Ethereum). Complementing the addition of the Aurora EVM into the multi-chain Brave Wallet for Brave’s 60 million monthly active users, the partnership includes bridging BAT cross-chain for use in the growing  <a href="https://aurora.dev/ecosystem#exchanges">Aurora dApp ecosystem</a>.&nbsp;</p>

 More multi-chain functionality in Brave Wallet 
<p>Aurora will become a preloaded blockchain available in the multi-chain Brave Wallet (in addition to Solana and Ethereum). The integration with NEAR’s EVM comes on the heels of <a>last month’s announcement</a> of a full integration with the Solana blockchain, and shows Brave’s commitment to increasing the pace of development toward an open, multi-chain experience in Brave Wallet.</p>
<p>Addition of Aurora brings significant added value to Brave Wallet users. Aurora fees are up to 1,000x lower than Ethereum’s. For example, the cost of transferring an ERC-20 token is below $0.01, while for Ethereum (at 50 Gwei and an ETH price of $3,000), it’s around $5.40. Aurora is also able to host thousands of transactions per second, representing an increase of 50x compared to mainnet Ethereum.</p>
<p>In the coming months, this integration will mean Brave users can buy, sell, store, and swap Aurora tokens directly in Brave Wallet. It will also bring support for Aurora assets like NFTs, and DApp support on the Aurora chain.</p>
<p>“Integrating the Aurora chain with our Brave Wallet will enable more users and creators to participate in Web3 by taking advantage of low fees and fast transactions, right from the Brave browser,” said Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave and BAT. “Soon, access to Aurora tokens and assets will be just clicks away in the Brave Wallet, and the Aurora Bridge will enable BAT holders to easily use their assets on NEAR’s Aurora chain.”</p>
<p>“This is a very significant partnership for the future advancement of Web3 and mass adoption, offering a multi-chain integration bridging the Ethereum and NEAR communities via Aurora - and one of the first big integrations via Brave,” said Marieke Flament, CEO of NEAR Foundation. “With the new Brave Wallet there will be a host of Web3 functionality supported such as NFT and Swap - all of which will provide the protection of a privacy-preserving, in-browser wallet that’s secure and mass-market ready.”</p>

 Expanded utility for BAT 
<p>The NEAR ecosystem partnership also brings expanded utility for the <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">Basic Attention Token (BAT)</a>. It will allow BAT holders to use their assets on the Aurora chain, via <a href="https://near.org/bridge/">Aurora Bridge</a>. The Aurora Bridge (based on <a href="https://near.org/bridge/">Rainbow Bridge</a>) provides for the permissionless transfer of tokens and data between Ethereum and Aurora.</p>
<p>In the coming months, we will also expand access to the Aurora ecosystem by partnering with Aurora DeFi partners. For example, holders will be able to earn rewards by staking BAT in Aurora liquidity pools. In addition to DeFi, the <a href="https://aurora.dev/ecosystem">Aurora DApp ecosystem</a> has grown to include blockchain gaming and NFT marketplaces where BAT could be utilized through the Brave and NEAR partnership.</p>

 Brave Wallet: Secure, multi-chain access to Web3 
<p>From the start, we envisioned Brave Wallet as a secure onramp to Web3. The Brave Wallet enables multi-chain access right from the browser, and brings expanded utility for the Basic Attention Token. Today’s announcement of the NEAR partnership brings us closer to realizing that vision.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for specific timing about Aurora access, and more announcements about the Brave / NEAR partnership.</p>

<p>About Brave</p>
<p>Brave Software’s fast, privacy-oriented browser, combined with its blockchain-based digital advertising platform, is reinventing the Web for users, publishers, and advertisers. Users get a private, speedier Web experience with much longer battery life, publishers increase their revenue share, and advertisers achieve better conversion. Users can opt into privacy-respecting ads that reward them with the Basic Attention Token (BAT), a frequent flyer-like token they can redeem or use to tip or contribute to publishers and other content creators.

Start&nbsp;there.</p> Step 1: Log into “old”&nbsp;zk.money <p>In order to migrate funds, navigate to old.zk.money and click&nbsp;“Login”:</p>The <a href="http://old.zk.money">old.zk.money</a> homepage<p>Navigate to your MetaMask or WalletConnect supported wallet and use the Ethereum address that you originally used to register your alias with zk.money to log&nbsp;in.</p><blockquote>⚠️ Important note on aliases: only the most recent alias associated with each unique Ethereum address has been migrated to the new system.&nbsp;⚠️</blockquote><p>If you misplaced your old.zk.money alias at any point and had to re-register with a new alias, those older aliases are&nbsp;lost.</p><p>Sign the Signature Requests prompted by MetaMask.</p>Sign where it says&nbsp;sign!<p>You will then be prompted with the familiar old.zk.money account balance page. Click “Send” to initiate a withdrawal to Layer&nbsp;1.</p>The <a href="http://old.zk.money">old.zk.money</a> balance&nbsp;page<p>You will then be shown a Withdraw modal. Remember to follow privacy best-practices:</p>  Select a withdrawal amount not associated with your deposit — avoid unique quantities like&nbsp;0.696969  Withdraw to a fresh wallet that is NOT associated with your deposit&nbsp;wallet.

Then, when prompted, enter your existing alias. Your alias has already been migrated and preserved!</p><p>It’s important to note here that if you are registering a fresh address and want a new alias, you must now record your alias. Aliases can no longer be recovered, so if you forget your alias you will no longer have access to your account and&nbsp;funds.</p><blockquote>⚠️ Important note on new aliases: pick a memorable alias and write it down! Losing your alias means losing account access.&nbsp;⚠️</blockquote><p>Once you’re at the <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> Wallet screen, click “Shield more” to add funds to your&nbsp;balance.</p><p>It’s worth repeating deposit best practices:</p>  Do not deposit idiosyncratic amounts (e.g. 0.696969)  Depositing many smaller quantities is better than depositing extremely large quantities  Deposits are capped at launch to 5 ETH / 10,000&nbsp;DAI  Enter the amount you want to shield and click “Next.” Remember best practices!<p>On this screen you can also select your transaction speed and fee quantity. “Slow” transactions ride along with many others, and settlement time average approximately an hour. “Instant” transactions involve paying for the entire rollup to go, prompting the rollup to settle to Ethereum as soon as the proof is constructed.</p><p>Once you’ve entered your amount and speed, click&nbsp;Next!</p><p>You’ll be taken to a Transaction Confirmation page which summarizes the amount to be shielded along with the Transaction Fee. Click “Confirm Transaction.”</p><p>You should see a Transaction Confirmed! Acknowledgement once the transaction goes through successfully.</p>Woot woot!<p>You will then be taken back to the Wallet screen, which will show a fresh “Shield” transaction under “Transaction History.” It should show one green check ✅&nbsp;, which means the transaction has been sent to the Rollup Provider for settlement to Layer&nbsp;1.</p><p>Hovering over the ✅ will also tell you approximately when the transaction will settle (updated in real&nbsp;time!).</p>One ✅ means confirmed, two ✅ ✅ means&nbsp;settled!<p>Once you see ✅ ✅, the transaction is settled and your balance will show up in the “Net Worth” component up top on the Wallet&nbsp;page.</p><p>Note that “Net Worth” reflects the value of all your positions — liquid or illiquid — whereas “Available” funds reflects just your spendable balance.</p><p>These figures can therefore differ — don’t be&nbsp;alarmed.</p><p>Once you get the double-green checks, you’ve got <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> baby!

<p>I often hear people say that tools like mixers or using fresh addresses for every crypto transaction are sufficient privacy protections because they provide plausible deniability. This is a naive understanding of how surveillance works.</p>



 Military surveillance 



<p>In a previous life, I led a program to equip a country in the Middle East with surveillance capability. They were interested in tracking military movements of a nearby country that posed a threat. We built a rich dataset of “facilities and assets,” largely by ingesting satellite imagery, but also intelligence from drones and other sources. The imagery was processed, analyzed and augmented with third-party data sources, such as <a href="https://www.janes.com/">Jane’s</a>.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Source: <a href="https://www.janes.com/intelligence-resources/case-studies/air-weapons-case-study-platform-recognition">Jane’s</a></p>



<p>A signal snapshot of a facility at a given point in time revealed data. But, it was the changes in data that yielded the most meaningful information. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_detection">What aircraft is there</a>? Where did it come from or move to? What other types of supporting infrastructure is around? Has anything changed? Where is electricity being used in the buildings? Has that changed? Based on the data, and changes in that data, what might that country be intentionally or unintentionally signaling?</p>



 Commercial digital surveillance 



<p></p>



<p>Later, a coworker from the intel project and I used some of the same techniques to surveile the internet, first for targeted marketing campaigns, and then in an effort to help companies connect with freelance workers. We were able to combine data from over two dozen sources to create rich profiles of people. It was fairly trivial to obtain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data">PII</a>. But it was the aggregation of data over time that yielded the richest insights.</p>



<p>For example, you can infer how much money someone makes based on their job history and location. You can infer someone’s travel and spending habits by the pictures they post online, which contain both metadata (e.g., date, location) and also what’s in the photo, just as we could determine what type of plane was at a given airbase. Using clues from language and cross links, it was often the case that we could find pseudo-anonymous accounts of known profiles. What we were able to discover was troubling, and we shut down the program.</p>



<p>This is happening around the world, both commercially, as we were doing, and in countries like <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/techstream/how-china-harnesses-data-fusion-to-make-sense-of-surveillance-data/">China</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_center">US</a>.</p>



 Shield your assets 



<p>Mixers provide some level of <a href="https://twitter.com/0xfoobar/status/1502083108081963009?s=20&amp;t=GcOkAw3WIF14a-GNZsSriw">probabilistic privacy</a>. But that probabilistic information is extremely useful to surveillers, especially as the tapestry is woven over time. If a surveiller can create probabilistic models, it is enough to build incredibly rich profiles in order to predict, influence, or manipulate future behavior by testing and gauging responses.</p>



<p>The best means to protect yourself from this type of privacy intrusion is to reduce leakages. This makes it more difficult to create a complete picture. For example, it was more challenging to build rich profiles on civil engineers than programmers, simply because civil engineers tended to post less things online.</p>



<p>Reducing leakage includes limiting your use of public blockchains, where your financial dealings are stored in a public database, for everyone to see, for all time — and where it can be correlated with your other online behaviors. Tools like mixers may help obscure a particular transaction, but surveillance technology is rapidly getting more sophisticated, and it’s increasingly easier to probabilistically determine the counter parties of a single mixed transaction and to build profiles based on the aggregation of these probabilities over time. The best option in crypto to minimize data leakage is to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpRzKqEfpP4">store your wealth in a shielded address</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is no such thing as perfect privacy. But you can take steps to protect your current and future self from the prying eyes of others who may wish you harm.</p>

    <p>In preparation for moving <a href="https://testnet.tokenmint.global/">TokenMint</a> to mainnet, we will be performing maintenance and pausing functionality of Tokenmint and Cobalt between June 14th and July 5th. Here’s what you need to know!</p>
<p>Testing is coming to an end as we prepare for the mainnet launch. We appreciate everyone that helped test the latest Horizen products, especially AltTimeHigh and Gruyerman, who provided a great deal of valuable feedback that helped our team improve the product for everyone.</p>
 What Will Change? 
 
 We will be updating software based on findings during our community testing phase.
 
 <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/Sidechains-SDK/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">The SDK version will move from 0.3.3 to 0.3.4</a> 
 The TokenChain version will go from 1.0.1 to 1.2.0 
 We will share the release notes after completion&nbsp; 
 
 
 We will take a “snapshot” of the current TokenMint state 
 Test the backup &amp; restore functionality.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Begin prepping for the Mainnet launch.&nbsp; 
 
 What Should I Expect? 
 
 
 
 Transactions will be frozen on testnet.&nbsp;
 
 Wallet and Block Explorer will prevent the “send function”&nbsp; 
 
 
 The target time for the transaction pause will be June 14th and July 5th 
 Test ZEN ($TZEN) balances will be erased.&nbsp;
 
 You can claim more on the <a href="https://heap.horizen.io/">testnet faucet</a> after the maintenance is complete.&nbsp; 
 Or move out your TZEN to Sphere by Horizen by June 9th.&nbsp; 
 
 
 $TCAKE will be reissued on mainnet as $CAKE to each person that completed the form correctly. Even if there was an issue with receiving the $TCAKE drop 
 
 
 
 
 Your Test Zenny (TZNY) balances will remain available 
 TZNY balances will remain 
 
 What’s Next 
 
 Testnet will return after the maintenance window&nbsp; 
 The team will release update notes 
 TokenMint and Cobalt will be more prepared for mainnet!

<blockquote>“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us…” — Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two&nbsp;Cities</blockquote><blockquote>“We are as gods and better get good at it,” — Stewart Brand (updated)</blockquote><p>As we wrote in our <a href="https://medium.com/@blueyard/an-evolution-blueyards-v2-thesis-a-new-website-gm-new-york-84080f7b191d">v2 thesis</a>, humanity is very likely in its most important century ever: i.e. this might very well be our best century ever, or quite possibly our last century. Through technology, we increasingly will have the potential to become a resilient super species that further contributes to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xaj407ofjNE">cosmos knowing itself</a>, to create abundance for all, to move up on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale">Kardashev scale</a> — while doing so in harmony with our&nbsp;planet.</p><p>However, potential only implies “having or showing the capacity to develop into something in the future” — and by no means should we take our technological and societal advances for certain. In fact, recent events have reminded us that great darkness exists within humanity. But darkness also provides contrast, and contrast helps to see things more clearly. So we now more clearly see our v2 thesis and mission as a firm within the backdrop of having to ensure that liberal and open societies remain well ahead in terms of any thinkable technological advances before any other competing societal / governance system acquires them. We believe&nbsp;that:</p>  Capitalism paired with democracy is the best system bar none; while appreciating that capitalism has significant market failures and mis-priced externalities (see point on climate below), while democracies are increasingly vulnerable and under attack from&nbsp;within  We should be able to have an optimistic outlook on a growing humanity that has more energy at its disposal to advance civilization and the human experience; while acknowledging that on its current trajectory humanity might peak within the next decades and then potentially begin a phase of steady decline — magnified by our current creation and consumption patterns that will only further advance civilizational decline due to climate breakdown  In order to live up to our cosmic level responsibility to help the universe understand itself, we should aim to upgrade humanity’s resilience and longevity by using new capabilities to author life to understand, augment, and engineer our biology to a new level; while understanding that unless we unlock evolution’s algorithms more rapidly we will remain woefully unprepared, e.g. for the next pandemic, to defeat cancer as the emperor of all maladies and to remove chemicals from the environment that are increasingly disrupting the body’s core&nbsp;systems  We have to increase humanity’s computational capacity at an increasingly exponential pace to help us build and scale all of the technologies required for a thriving species that can live in harmony with the planet; appreciating that it will be a struggle to stay on the Moore’s Law&nbsp;curve  We must understand that climate breakdown is not only about the planet or nature, it is very much about the survival of the human species itself; while acknowledging that too few people understand that resource and nutritional volatility will lead to unimaginable global scalable conflicts. Markets, wealth and growth are irrelevant in a future with no humans (having squandered our rare cosmic scale potential)  Diversity and inclusion are not just a matter of fairness, but also about the ability to harness the full potential of humanity; while appreciating that much of humanity’s potential lies systematically idle as of&nbsp;today  <p>It is within this context that we are today announcing that we have raised BlueYard 3, a $185m early stage fund (bringing our AuM to $500m). We have increased our fund size slightly from BY1/2 ($120m each), but remain committed to small early stage funds — however had to factor in that market dynamics require slightly more capital to continue our early lead investor strategy.</p><p>BlueYard has made 17 investments (e.g. from zK-SNARK hardware acceleration, RNA to protein manipulation, to programmable chemistry) over the last twelve months across <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/blueyard-2-3d0bbaf1f1b6">BlueYard 2</a> and <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/blueyard-crypto-1-c0af4636bd24">BlueYard Crypto 1</a> and will continue to be active through economic cycles with BlueYard 3 along our v2&nbsp;thesis:</p><p>“BlueYard backs founders building the interconnected elements that can become the fabric of our future. A future where markets are open and decentralized, where we have solved our largest planetary challenges, where knowledge and data is liberated and humanity can live long and prosper.”</p><p>while allowing us to keep focusing on the technologies we think will have the highest impact as fabric layers for a positive future for humanity:</p> Web3: to create “open by default” and resilient infrastructure for free markets and self sovereignty   <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a> (next generation internet protocols)  <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> (distributed web protocol)  <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a> (safe and resilient storage network for humanity)  <a href="https://openzeppelin.com/">OpenZeppelin</a> / <a href="https://forta.org/">Forta</a> (security for decentralized applications)  <a href="https://radicle.xyz/">Radicle</a> (decentralized backbone for the world’s code&nbsp;base)  <a href="https://www.textile.io/">Textile</a> (interconnected tools for the decentralized web)  <a href="https://www.airtm.com/en/">AirTM</a> (p2p financial liberty platform)  <a href="https://centrifuge.io/">Centrifuge</a> (real world assets to&nbsp;DeFi)  <a href="https://violet.co/">Violet</a> (layer 2 for identity)  [Stealth] (mitigating negative externalities of&nbsp;MEV)  <a href="https://housecat.com/">Housecat</a> (broadening access to crypto and DeFI investing)  <a href="https://github.com/flashbots/pm">Massa</a> (L1 for both decentralization and scalability)  <a href="https://www.kiln.fi/">Kiln</a> (formerly Skillz) (staking as a&nbsp;service)  <a href="https://www.privy.io/">Privy</a> (user data and privacy layer for&nbsp;web3)  [Stealth] (zK-SNARK hardware acceleration)  <a href="https://cryptio.co/">Cryptio</a> (crypto accounting)  <a href="https://syndicate.io/">Syndicate</a> (A decentralized investing protocol and social&nbsp;network)  <a href="https://metapals.pet/">MetaPals</a> (Making web3 more fun and accessible)  <a href="https://dxos.org/">DXOS</a> (Decentralized application development and deployment platform)   Programmable biology: to enhance human resilience and mitigate planetary challenges   <a href="http://www.bit.bio/">Bit Bio</a> (programmable stem-cells)  <a href="https://www.meatable.com/">Meatable</a> (animal free&nbsp;economy)  <a href="https://www.positive.co/">Positive</a> (next-gen convenience food)  <a href="https://biofidelity.com/">Biofidelity</a> (accurate and affordable cancer diagnostics)  <a href="https://www.rarebase.org/">Rarebase</a> (rare disease therapy breakthroughs)  <a href="https://origin.bio/">Origin.bio</a> (bio based goods and materials)  Clock Bio (novel anti-aging therapeutics)  <a href="https://www.zafrens.com/">Zafrens</a> (manipulating how RNA become proteins)  [Stealth] (reinventing transgenes)   Breakthrough computation and engineering: to stay on (or exceed) Moore’s Law curve and to equip us with the tools and resources to support a growing&nbsp;humanity   <a href="https://seeqc.com/">SEEQC</a> (digital quantum computing )  <a href="https://marvelfusion.com/https://marvelfusion.com/">Marvel Fusion</a> (laser-induced fusion)  <a href="https://dance.co/https://dance.co/">Dance </a>(e-bike based clean urban transportation)  <a href="https://vsparticle.com/">VSParticle</a> (nanoparticles R&amp;D+&nbsp;scaling)  <a href="https://www.corintis.com/">Corintis</a> (enabler for high performance computing)  <a href="https://freedomfi.com/">FreedomFi</a> (personalized 5G network operator)  <a href="https://spaero.bio/">Spaero </a>(enabling scientists to quickly automate experiments)  <a href="https://www.chemify.io/">Chemify</a> (programmable chemistry)  [Stealth] (distributed electronic defense)   Knowledge and data liberators: because information wants to be&nbsp;free   <a href="https://pitch.com/">Pitch</a> (platform for creating and sharing&nbsp;ideas)  <a href="https://autocode.com/">Autocode</a> (low code platform)  <a href="https://www.nextmatter.com">Next Matter</a> (all-in-one platform for operators)  <a href="https://grid.is/">GRID</a> (new spreadsheet layer)  <a href="https://www.vectary.com/">Vectary</a> (VR/AR 3D design platform)  <a href="https://www.wonder.me/">Wonder</a> (where large groups meet&nbsp;online)  <a href="https://golottie.com/">Lottie</a> (reimagining a child’s first digital&nbsp;steps)  <p>And if this all sounds interesting to you, why not <a href="https://www.notion.so/blueyardcapital/BlueYard-Job-Board-d25e5dcbcfe448f19da666d94b5ddd97">join our&nbsp;team</a>?</p>

 The partnership will work towards making it easy for everyone to interact with the blockchain — self-custodially and without seed&nbsp;phrase <p>Web3Auth and StarkWare Sign-in a Strategic Partnership</p><p>Web3Auth and StakWare enter into a Strategic Partnership that will provide a major push to our shared vision of onboarding the next billion users into Web3. The genesis of StarkWare lies in improving scalability and privacy on the blockchain so as to accommodate more and more users. Web3Auth’s origins lie in the fact that seed phrases create a huge entry barrier in onboarding mainstream users into blockchain applications. Given their strikingly similar genesis, it is only natural that both ecosystem stakeholders joined forces to increase mainstream adoption of&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>What does the partnership entail?</p><p>Uri Kolodny, CEO &amp; Co-Founder, StarkWare:</p><p>“Our teams share the mutual goal of bringing web3 closer to mainstream users. With Web3Auth providing easy login and onboarding of users, and with StarkWare providing low gas costs and security, this partnership is a natural and important step in achieving this&nbsp;goal.”</p><p>StarkWare Offers Grant to&nbsp;Web3Auth</p><p>In a major endorsement for Web3Auth’s mission, StarkWare has offered Web3Auth a grant to ensure its self-custodial private key infrastructure powers as many dApps and wallets in the Web3 eco-system as possible. How we onboard users and handle their private keys in the next few years will largely determine the pace at which the Web3 eco-system will grow. The grant will be used by Web3Auth to to make its authentication suite available and accessible to as many developers as possible and by doing so, to more and more applications and&nbsp;users.</p><p>Web3Auth Announces Sign-in With StarkWare</p><p>Also as part of the partnership, last week, Web3Auth and StarkWare <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/sign-in-with-starkware-711d48f2dbbd">announced Sign-in With StarkWare</a>, a unique initiative that brings in the security of StarkWare to Web2 allowing users to sign-in to any Web3 application using their StarkWare account.</p><p>Quote from Zhen, CEO &amp; Co-founder, Web3Auth:</p><p>“Our partnership with StarkWare is a natural evolution of both our organizations’ genesis — to make blockchain more accessible to the masses. This partnership holds immense possibilities for the ecosystem overall and we are excited to see what it&nbsp;unfolds”</p><p>Web3Auth SDK now supports key generation and management on the STARK&nbsp;curve</p><p>Web3Auth strongly believes that ZK-Rollups such as StarkWare’s scaling solutions have played and will continue to play a huge role in making the Blockchain more usable and secure. Web3Auth extends 100% support to all developers building on the StarkWare family to seamlessly onboard their userswhile keeping core principles of self-custodiality intact.</p><p>Coming Soon…</p><p>From TSS on STARKs to JWT verification on StarkNet, stay tuned for more&nbsp;updates.</p><p>About Starkware family:</p><p>StarkWare develops STARK-based solutions for the blockchain industry.</p><p>StarkEx, is a standalone permissioned scaling engine that already powers few of the biggest applications such as dYdX, Sorare, Immutable, DiversiFi and Celer. StarkNet is a decentralized permissionless STARK-powered L2 ZK-Rollup over Ethereum, that supports general-computation based on the Cairo language.</p><p>About Web3Auth:</p><p>Web3Auth is a leading non-custodial private key management infrastructure that helps dApps and Wallets on-board users eliminating the need for seed&nbsp;phrases.</p><p>Stay in touch with&nbsp;Web3Auth</p><p><a href="http://web3auth.io/">Website</a> | <a href="https://docs.web3auth.io/">Docs</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/web3auth">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/web3authdev">Telegram</a> | <a href="http://discord.gg/web3auth">Discord</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/web3auth">Linkedin</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-and-starkware-announce-strategic-partnership-142ce14fda1a">Web3Auth and StarkWare Announce Strategic Partnership</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Brave’s native crypto wallet now features integrations from ApeSwap, Arken, Bogged, DODO, Open Ocean, and Skiff</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>The introduction of the multichain <a>Brave Wallet</a> in the Brave browser enables Brave’s 60 million monthly active users to easily onboard to Web3, the decentralized iteration of the Internet that will shift power from Big Tech to users. No other platform combines Brave’s privacy and security protections with such easy, user-first opportunities to directly connect with Web3 decentralized applications (DApps).</p>
<p>When Brave Wallet users have their wallets active, the Brave browser automatically detects Web3 DApps. However, many users benefit from the inclusion of the Brave Wallet as an option among those enumerated to DApp users, including users who have yet to discover Brave Wallet or are navigating the Web in Brave with their wallet still in a locked state.</p>
<p>To address this, we’ve created the Brave Wallet Partner Program. The pilot phase of the program involves outreach to the top DApps in decentralized finance (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835">DeFi</a>), exchanges, marketplaces, private email and collaboration, and gaming for networks supported in the multichain Brave Wallet.</p>
<p>The program aims to drive awareness about Brave Wallet, while providing an opportunity to discuss ways that Brave and partners can collaborate on additional BAT utility programs or integrations. Partners in the program integrate Brave Wallet into their wallet connection list, and co-promote their DApp integration with Brave through marketing channels in Brave, blog posts, communities, and social media.</p>
<p>The DApps that were first to integrate the Brave Wallet in the pilot program range from DeFi to Web3 utility, across networks currently supported by the multichain Brave Wallet.</p>
<p>Collectively, the first set of partner DApps for the Brave Wallet Partner Program have over 646,810 90-day unique wallets and over $3,663,404,340 total 90-day volume across over 10 blockchain networks.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to announce the first partners that have integrated Brave Wallet into their DApps through the program, as more and more users are looking to easily access DApps and take advantage of Web3 technology to be in charge of their data,” said Luke Mulks, Vice President of Business Operations at Brave. “We’re looking forward to sharing updates about more partners added through the program, as well as announcements about partners on BAT utility collaborations in the months ahead.”</p>
<p>ApeSwap</p>
<p><a href="https://apeswap.finance/">ApeSwap</a> is a decentralized finance platform offering a full suite of tools to explore and engage with the future of wealth building, overseen by the ApeSwap Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The community and partners can tap into the next generation of financial innovation through their decentralized exchange, utility token staking, premium launchpad, lending network, and NFT marketplace in a secure, transparent, and globally accessible way.</p>
<p>“Integrating Brave Wallet into the ApeSwap protocol is a natural partnership. We share the mission of giving our audiences the freedom to explore and innovate on their terms, without interference from other parties. Moreover, ApeSwap consistently holds the deepest liquidity for BAT on the BNB Chain, giving Brave Wallet users the most DeFi options to earn through staking, farming, or lending on one of the most secure platforms on the market,” said DK, Co-Founder and Head of Business Development at ApeSwap.</p>
<p>Arken Finance</p>
<p><a href="https://arken.finance/">Arken Finance</a> is an all-in-one trading portal for DeFi traders. It offers the best-in-class, multi-chain tool for DEX traders to track thousands of tokens and synthetic assets within a single point of entry. Users can get access to real-time trading views, and best rate swaps with complimentary trading features such as Limit Orders, Price Alerts, and Best Rate Cross-chain Swaps.</p>
<p>“Adding Brave Wallet to Arken Finance is just the beginning. Partnering with Brave is a big move for us in achieving our team’s mission: to support the mass adoption of DeFi and make the user experience more accessible for everyone. We really hope that, along with the Brave team, we will create stronger decentralized finance applications for the world,” said Por, Head of Business Development at Arken Finance.</p>
<p>Bogged</p>
<p><a href="https://bogged.finance/">Bogged</a> is a suite of powerful DeFi trading tools, including DEX aggregator, limit orders, stop-losses, and more. Bogged is trusted with over $2 billion of trading volume and is available on ten chains.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to give Brave users the chance to experience Bogged’s extensive platform, which includes a variety of tools designed to help you trade like a pro.</p>
<p>Traders can now use Brave to access Bogged’s market-leading DeFi trading tools directly. Thanks to our full integration, you may now place orders, make trades, and more, all within the Brave platform at lightning speeds,” said Luke Martinez, Co-Founder at Bogged.</p>
<p>DODO</p>
<p><a href="https://dodoex.io/">DODO</a> is a decentralized multi-chain trading platform that uses the innovative Proactive Market Maker (PMM) algorithm to provide efficient on-chain liquidity for Web3 assets, making it easy for everyone to trade crypto assets.</p>
<p>“DODO has a strong commitment to providing open financial access to everyone. Integrating Brave Wallet with the DODO DApp brings us closer to this goal and provides our users with more options than ever before,” said Diane Dai, CMO at DODO.</p>
<p>OpenOcean</p>
<p><a href="https://openocean.finance/">OpenOcean</a> is crypto’s most efficient DEX aggregator, providing users the best swap rates on all major blockchains with deep liquidity and low slippage.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to integrate Brave Wallet as one of our top wallet options for our users to use. Our partnership will bring our users a seamless and efficient experience in trading and earning crypto across multi-chain,” said Cindy Wu, Co-Founder at OpenOcean.</p>
<p>Skiff</p>
<p><a href="https://skiff.com/">Skiff</a>’s integration with Brave Wallet allows users to access privacy-first, end-to-end encrypted email and collaboration. With only two clicks, all Brave Wallet users can seamlessly log into Skiff’s privacy-first application suite and start using end-to-end encrypted email and collaboration. The integration allows for email and collaboration among Brave wallets as well, one of the first uses of a crypto wallet for end-to-end encryption.</p>
<p>“Bringing privacy-first collaboration and communication to all Brave users aligns deeply with Skiff’s and Brave’s mission. We’re thrilled to work with the Brave Wallet team to empower freer and more private communication and collaboration,” explained Andrew Milich, CEO and Co-Founder of Skiff.</p>
<p>For the current pilot phase of the Brave Wallet Partner Program, Brave is approaching leading DApps in each vertical that meet a minimum criteria of 90-day volume and unique wallet counts (on-chain). We also aim to adapt the pilot program to a public-facing program later this year so that additional DApps can submit requests to participate.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you’re a developer interested in simply integrating Brave Wallet into your DApp, we provide <a href="https://wallet-docs.brave.com/">detailed developer documentation here</a>.</p>
<p>About Brave Wallet</p>
<p>Brave Wallet is a crypto wallet built natively into the Brave browser, enabling Brave users to store, manage, grow, and swap their crypto portfolio from a single wallet. Unlike most crypto wallets, Brave Wallet does not require extensions; it’s browser-native, reducing security risks and reliance on extra CPU and memory. Users can transact with almost any crypto asset with superior safety and performance, as well as connect with other wallets and Web3 DApps. Brave Wallet is available on desktop and mobile.</p>

<p>Crypto has become a trillion dollar asset class, and is showing up on the balance sheets of thousands of companies, funds, DAOs, etc. Transparency, accountability and auditability has become key — especially as the crypto industry continues to mature. Yet accurately tracking transactions, asset values at a specific time, profitability of trades, gas fees, etc. is still hard — and it is even harder to combine this data into an enterprise grade audit environment.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://cryptio.co/">Cryptio</a>, which tracks crypto assets and transactions from DeFi protocols, wallets, exchanges, and institutional custodians to construct a complete picture of a company’s digital asset activity. Crypto is trusted by over 200 organizations and empowers them to transform digital asset data into auditable records for accounting, treasury, and tax filings. A few examples of Cryptio’s capabilities include</p>  Importing and processing fragmented crypto activity into GAAP &amp; IFRS-grade ledgers  Syncing unlimited blockchain transactions, wallets, exchanges and custodians  Tracking and reconciliation of DeFi activity, from swaps, lending, borrowing and liquidity margins  Automatic tracking of realized and unrealised gains and losses with cost basis details, live market rates and&nbsp;more  Powerful financial reporting, connected to current accounting tools  Seamless linking to existing accounting or ERP solutions ― e.g. Xero, Quickbooks &amp;&nbsp;Netsuite  Tracking of intangible impairments on digital assets and generation of IRS &amp; SEC-compliant reports  Export of asset-roll forward, historical balances and transaction history reports instantly   Thesis <p>Ensuring transparency and accountability will be key for the continued establishment of crypto as a major asset class. More trust and auditability will unlock more institutional engagement, further product innovations and will make crypto native companies more effective. If Cryptio can become the go-to platform for crypto accounting, it could become the de-facto back end infrastructure for all teams and companies with digital&nbsp;assets.</p>

<p>Recently, the Nano (XNO) cryptocurrency recovered, at least temporarily, from a nearly six week long denial of service (DoS) attack. According to a Nano Foundation blog post, the attack exploited five different attack vectors. Although varied, these attack vectors have the net effect of exhausting resources on Nano validator nodes.&nbsp;…</p><p>While the Nano developers issued a patch that helped clear backlogged transactions, much of the recovery from this recent attack can be attributed to a reprieve from the attack itself. Indeed, as of writing this post, a new attack on Nano is underway, temporarily crippling the Nano&nbsp;network.</p><p>In today’s blog post, I describe differences between the Stealth and Nano protocols, and how these differences result in Stealth’s having far better DoS resistance than Nano. These differences distill to the prohibitive difficulty of exhausting Stealth’s resources by spamming the blockchain. In this description, I underscore that one key to Stealth’s superior DoS resistance is Stealth’s novel network timekeeping mechanism.</p><p>— — — — — — —</p> Nano <p>Nano is arguably the leading cryptocurrency for feeless transactions. A feeless transaction does not require the sender or recipient to provide any extra money as transaction fees. Instead of a fee, a user includes a digital attachment with each transaction. This attachment of only a few bytes cryptographically proves that the user did a small amount of computational work specific to the transaction. This “work proof”, allows the transaction to be executed without any additional monetary fee. In other words, if a user sends 1 XNO, then the recipient receives exactly 1 XNO and the sender’s account is exactly 1 XNO&nbsp;smaller.</p><p>The Nano protocol has many unique features. Most notably, Nano has a block lattice wherein each account has its own blockchain. Each blockchain records all incoming and outgoing transfers for that account. The lattice structure arises from so-called receiving transactions, where the recipient makes a separate record keeping transaction that references the incoming transaction. The receiving transaction is a prerequisite for spending&nbsp;funds.</p><p>Importantly, only the account holder can modify the account’s balance. With spending transactions, the account holder specifies how much to reduce the account balance. With receiving transactions, the account holder specifies how much to increase the account&nbsp;balance.</p><p>Although the two-part transaction may seem unnecessary to those unfamiliar with Nano’s design, it is critical for Nano’s high throughput because it allows validators to approve transactions asynchronously. The reason is that validators are never required to consider the ordering of transactions when determining whether an account balance can be spent. The account holder specifies the ordering of credits and debits, making it straightforward for validators to calculate an account balance prior to approving any transaction.</p><p>The following figure shows a small block lattice as might be found within Nano’s distributed ledger. Pictured are three chains for three accounts: A, B, and C. Each chain has four transactions (diamonds), numbered 1 through 4. Transaction 1 in chain A is called “A-1”, and so on. Each transaction references up to two other transactions. The first reference points to the immediately preceding transaction in the account’s chain. These types of references are represented by solid arrows. The second type of reference connects a receiving transaction to a spending transaction. These latter types of references are represented by dashed&nbsp;arrows.</p><p>The flow of money can be inferred from the dashed arrows. For example, account C sent account B money in transaction C-4. The transfer amount of transaction C-4 was credited to account B’s balance in transaction B-3, so an arrow connects B-3 to&nbsp;C-4.</p><p>Note that all arrows point backwards in time. In this latter example, transaction C-4 preceded transaction B-3 in time. This elaborate cross-linking of account blockchains results in a multidimensional lattice, giving the Nano ledger its&nbsp;name.</p><p>While time relationships between explicitly linked transactions may be inferred from these references, a full ordering of Nano transactions can not be guaranteed. For example, it is impossible to know whether transactions B-3 and B-4 preceded any transaction in chain A because no path of arrows (moving from tail to head) connect B-3 and B-4 with any transaction of chain&nbsp;A.</p><p>A profound consequence of the structure of Nano’s ledger is that Nano has no mechanism for timekeeping. For example, transactions B-3 and B-4 could be separated by one millisecond, or they could be separated by one million years. We can only know, in some cases, a relative ordering by following references, as described above for transactions C-4 and B-3. That Nano transactions don’t have timestamps underscores this absence of timekeeping.</p><p>Because Nano has no mechanism for timekeeping, the ages of Nano transactions are impossible to determine with certainty. For transactions that have been approved by validators, the lack of timestamps amounts to little more than an accounting inconvenience. However, for transactions that have yet to be approved, the lack of timekeeping can pose serious problems because validators and other network participants have no temporal information with which to expire transactions.</p><p>At first thought, the ability to expire transactions might not seem important. However, the crippling DoS attacks suffered periodically by Nano could be rendered orders of magnitude more difficult if “backlogged” transactions expired and were completely cleared from the Nano&nbsp;network.</p><p>Consider the following backlog estimate, generated recently within the Nano Discord&nbsp;chat.</p><p>This output shows that over one million Nano transactions are backlogged. A result of the ongoing spam attack, the vast majority of these transactions are generated by the attacker. As transactions build up, the strain on computing resources makes it increasingly difficult for validators to approve (clear) new transactions, creating a vicious cycle of resource depletion.</p><p>— — — — — — —</p> Stealth <p>Imagine if unapproved Nano transactions expired after only two minutes. To maintain a crippling backlog of one million transactions, the Nano attacker would be required to create 500,000 transactions per minute, or 8,333 transactions per second (tps). Imagine further that Nano were redesigned such that it required a backlog of not one million transactions to cripple Nano, but around ten&nbsp;million.</p><p>Now, imagine further that Nano used a hashing algorithm wherein each transaction requires, on average, one second on one 3 GHZ CPU. Now imagine that when saturated with feeless transactions, the Nano network required on average about nine times the work for a single transaction. Translated to GPU computing power, about $7000 of GPU hardware could average about 9 tps. So it would require $63,000,000 of GPU hardware running at full capacity to saturate the Nano network with 5 million transactions per minute and create an ongoing backlog of ten million transactions, given this unimaginably effective design.</p><p>Not only would the attacker need $63,000,000 of hardware dedicated to this task, he’d have to pay the exorbitant electricity bills to keep it running all the time. Worse yet, if this nefarious mining setup ever went down, the entire backlog would expire after just two minutes. Even the “stuck” transactions of legitimate users would expire after two minutes, meaning Nano users would never experience the frustration of waiting hours or days for a transaction to&nbsp;process.</p><p>All that hardware and all those electricity bills would produce nothing but a temporary inconvenience for Nano users, completely remedied after two minutes of cessation. Clearly it would be foolish to attempt to attack Nano with spam, all because transactions can&nbsp;expire.</p><p>Even if an attacker mustered the bankroll to execute an effective attack, the notoriety of the expense itself would likely bring more positive attention to Nano, more than offsetting the potential negative attention that inspired the attack in the first place. Imagine the headlines: “Who is spending $400,000 per day to spam the Nano network?”</p><p>In case you are thinking that such a system is too good to be true<br>– I just described Stealth’s approach to fighting&nbsp;spam.</p><p>— — — — — — —</p> Stealth’s Distributed Network&nbsp;Clock <p>At the core of Stealth’s spam fighting technology is a novel and unique distributed network clock. I have discussed Stealth’s timekeeping <a href="https://medium.com/stealthsend/stealth-development-blog-017-04-12-2019-894a2e9f5c30">elsewhere</a>, but in short, it obviates the need for network-wide time averaging, depicted in the following image.</p><p>In the above image illustrating network time averaging, the network time is 00:00:02 while the real time is 00:00:00, as reported by an official timekeeper like NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). Each computer that joins the network queries the network time from its peers, then applies an offset to its own internal clock. For example, computer A has an offset of +1, while computer B has an offset of -1. If a block is produced (right), it carries a timestamp reflecting the network&nbsp;time.</p><p>Note that in this type of network timekeeping, no computer has any incentive to keep the correct time. In fact, keeping network time relies purely on altruism.</p><p>As a result, this type of network clock is highly fragile and can therefore result in fragile networks. The main reason is that this type of network clock is subject to clock drift. In the above example, the hypothetical network has drifted two seconds from the real time. In practice, cryptocurrency network clocks can drift by many minutes. For example, Solana’s network clock is currently <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/149112/solanas-blockchain-clock-loses-track-of-time-now-running-30-minutes-behind">30 minutes behind</a> real time. Barring a hard fork intervention, this clock drift will likely never be&nbsp;fixed.</p><p>Another problem with time averaged network clocks is that malicious computers can join the network and report the wrong time, starting a chain reaction of unsynchronized offsets. For cryptocurrencies, this has resulted in forks that arise because some subset of computers invalidate blocks with inappropriate timestamps. An example is a block that may have a timestamp in the future relative to the network time of some subset of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Instead of a time averaged network clock, Stealth uses a distributed network clock. In Stealth’s clock, computers never query the network time. Instead, they get network time from block timestamps. Blocks carry timestamps given to them by the computer that produced the block. Blocks are rejected or accepted independently by every computer on the network, based on comparison not to the computer’s internal clock, but to other blocks known to the computer.</p><p>In this system, block producers are incentivized to correctly guess the internal times of all other block producers without ever asking. If block producers guess incorrectly, they run the risk of having their blocks rejected.</p><p>This system distills to focal point game theory, where the best guess for the internal clocks of other computers is a known standard, like NIST time. In other words, no block producer is required to keep good time, but keeping good time maximizes their opportunity for block rewards. The bottom line is that the network doesn’t have clock synchronization, but it still has an emergent accurate and distributed network clock. This network clock is embodied by the chain of blocks produced by the&nbsp;network.</p><p>A critical feature of Stealth’s network clock is a robustness that arises from the fact that clock ticks are concrete events — namely blocks themselves. This design means that no amount of poor timekeeping by individual nodes, or spikes in network latency, ever influences network time. Moreover, the Stealth network never experiences drift because there is an ongoing incentive for block producers to keep good time, making best effort internal adjustments as needed. In practice, the absence of an offset, and the influence of game theory, means that block times will never deviate from real time by more than the network&nbsp;latency.</p><p>This robustness gives a dependable standard for the expiration of transactions. In Stealth’s feeless protocol, feeless transactions must reference a specific block, and therefore a specific time. This reference is one input for the work required to create the feeless transaction. A computer on the network will invalidate all transactions older than two minutes, by comparing the network time to the block timestamp referenced by the transaction. Invalidation means that the transaction is erased from memory and no longer communicated to any new&nbsp;peers.</p><p>A consequence of expiration is that the work required to create the transaction is also expired. To create a new transaction, a sender must create new work. This overwhelming burden of work results in considerable ongoing expense to aspiring attackers.</p><p>— — — — — — —</p> Stealth User Experience Under&nbsp;DoS <p>One question is whether users would be inconvenienced if an attacker attempted to spam the Stealth network. The answer is slightly.</p><p>First, users would be required to compete with the spammer for blockchain space. Users can do this in two ways. One way is simply by increasing the difficulty of their work calculations, waiting on average about ten seconds for the work calculation instead of one second. Another way is by paying a fee to ensure a spot in the blockchain. Currently the fee is equivalent to about 0.0001&nbsp;USD.</p><p>While a fee seems to forego the advantages of feeless transactions, this inexpensive work-around removes practically any reason to spam the Stealth network in the first place. In this way, the fee is a nuclear deterrent. It renders conventional warfare (spam DoS) obsolete, impotent, and certainly not worth the&nbsp;expense.</p><p>Second, users that do not produce enough work to compete with the sender will have transactions “stuck” in the mempool. Again, this inconvenience is mild and temporary. After two minutes, these stuck transactions will expire, even during an ongoing spam attack. Once expired, the user will be able to resubmit a transaction, either with more work or with the aforementioned small&nbsp;fee.</p><p>In summary, an attacker could attempt a DoS spam attack on Stealth. It would cost a fortune in equipment (millions of dollars) and another fortune in energy costs (tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars a day). It would likely bring much positive press to Stealth as well. A successful attack would mean that users would have to wait two minutes for stuck transactions, and likely need to pay a $0.0001 fee to create a successful transaction after their transactions became unstuck via expiration. Once an attacker gave up, the network would require no more than two minutes to completely recover from the&nbsp;attack.</p><p>— — — — — — — — —</p><p>Dr. James Stroud,&nbsp;PhD</p><p>— — — — — — — — —</p><p><a href="https://stealth.org/">Website</a> / <a href="http://discord.gg/qGwMQQeRPm">Discord</a> / <a href="https://t.me/stealthsend">Telegram</a> / <a href="https://medium.com/stealthsend">Medium</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/stealthsend">Twitter</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stealthsend">Reddit</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/stealthsend/stealths-network-clock-in-feeless-transactions-and-spam-resistance-ccecc3e6084e">Stealth’s Network Clock in Feeless Transactions and Spam Resistance</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/stealthsend">stealthsend</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Zcash’s Network Upgrade 5 was announced a few days ago. It includes a number of technical improvements to the protocol and is a massive step forward for our society and pursuit of economic freedom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The upgrades are technical in nature, but they have major implications for everyday users and their financial transactions. So, what does NU5 mean for all of us?</p>



<p>To truly appreciate its significance, we first need to understand our dependence on financial intermediaries.</p>



 The dependent financial system 



<p>The tech behind modern banking and financial services has made things infinitely more user-friendly. But as these services are made easier, corporations, governments, and other intermediaries gain access to our data. They often leverage this to surveil, censor, and at times, prohibit our means to transact.</p>



<p>We have to trust that these financial systems won’t shut down. We expect that banks and apps are always going to work. We rely on their infrastructure and, at times, doubt that potential single points of failure will ever be exploited.</p>



<p>We also hope that the controllers of these systems will never censor or block our ability to use, or access, our money.</p>



<p>Cryptocurrencies provide monetary systems that allow us to transact and store value without permission from centralized intermediaries. These systems of money are distributed, cannot be turned off by any single party, and to be completely censorship resistant, they don’t rely on any one person or group. In most situations, we shouldn’t view trust as a negative thing. However, trustlessness is vital for people to have maximum economic freedom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bitcoin is often seen as the pinnacle of decentralization, trustlessness, and censorship-resistant money. However, there have been instances where Bitcoin has fallen short of this goal, due to one major flaw.</p>



 Bitcoin’s failure 



<p>Bitcoin’s transparent blockchain gives governments and corporations an ability to surveil transactions and ultimately blacklist addresses (people) they don’t agree with.</p>



<p>When addresses are blacklisted, the owner (and likely any address associated with the address in the public ledger) cannot access services that make Bitcoin usable for most people. Think CashApp, exchanges, and Bitcoin ATMs.</p>



<p>In extreme cases, bad actors can even track down Bitcoin users, arrest them, and force them to give up their private keys. Users have physically seen their Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-protect-5-dollar-wrench-attack/">stolen by criminal groups</a>, or <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgmnpd/the-freedom-convoy-bitcoin-donations-have-been-frozen-and-seized">frozen and seized by governments</a>.</p>



<p>This failure has sparked many conversations around cryptocurrencies being incapable of being politically neutral money.</p>



Satoshi thought on the importance of a private Bitcoin implementation<br>



<p>When situations like this occur, many say that the victims should have used Zcash. And while that is a valid suggestion, Zcash has had its skeptics due to its origin involving a complex setup ceremony.</p>



<p>When Zcash implemented the first use case of zk-SNARKs, the cryptography that enables truly private crypto transactions, it required a <a href="https://z.cash/technology/paramgen/">parameter generation process</a> to launch the currency. People have called this a “trusted setup” because users of the protocol would have to trust at least one of the six participants to act in good faith.</p>



<p>The ceremony was very well <a href="https://radiolab.org/episodes/ceremony">documented</a>, and for almost everyone in the industry, there’s no legitimate reason to distrust it. If even one of the six participants in that ceremony was honest, the money supply would remain sound. A major upgrade of Zcash in 2018 required a new, even more secure ceremony involving hundreds of participants.</p>



<p>Further technical explainer: For any future counterfeiting of ZEC to occur, every ceremony participant would have to be a bad actor, and even in that case, the protocol’s privacy would remain uncompromised. We know no counterfeiting has ever taken place because we would be able to identify this in the liquidity pool.</p>



<p>But the reliance on a certain amount of “trust” has, in some people’s minds, prevented Zcash from reaching its goal as a truly decentralized, politically neutral money. This issue isn’t specific to Zcash. Every implementation of zk-SNARKs has required a setup ceremony.</p>



 No more tradeoffs 



<p>Halo’s zero-knowledge proving system, implemented in Zcash NU5, solved zk-SNARKs’ setup ceremony problem. The newly created Orchard payment protocol became the first payment network created without a so-called trusted setup.</p>



<p>This means when someone uses applications that support Orchard, they don’t have to put their reliance, or trust, in any one person or group. They can be confident that the system is completely censorship-resistant, will always allow them to transact, and the currency’s supply will never be altered.</p>



<p>This means users get truly private, fixed-supply, censorship-resistant money.</p>



<p>Zcash’s privacy has made it the best way to avoid financial censorship, and now the Orchard pool enables a unique system where users don’t have to choose between reliance on a group of people and privacy.</p>



 The future of peer-to-peer money 



<p>As mentioned in a <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/nu5-activates-on-mainnet-eliminating-trusted-setup-and-launching-a-new-era-for-zcash/">previous blog</a>, “the efficiencies built into this upgrade make possible — for the first time ever — private, trustless digital cash payments on mobile phones.”</p>



<p>This creates a digital peer-to-peer money that gives users ultimate confidence and sovereignty over their money. This level of ownership moves humanity closer to economic freedom and equality.</p>



<p>While we can get lost in the technical side of NU5, we mustn’t discount the impact it has on the future of our financial world. Its impact will be solidified as teams develop applications that deliver ZEC user experiences that rival modern, digital banking.</p>



<p>The future state of Zcash has yet to be fulfilled, but the NU5 announcement lays the foundation on which the future of money will be built. A future of money that is digital, private and not reliant on any person or group.</p>

<p>As Brave continues to grow, we find many users who haven’t heard of us yet, so we try new marketing channels for efficacy, reach, affordability, and of course, privacy.</p>
<p>Since 2020, Brave has been experimenting with direct mail via the United States Postal Service’s <a href="https://www.usps.com/business/every-door-direct-mail.htm">Every Door Direct Mail</a> (EDDM) program. EDDM allows businesses in the US to create and distribute mailers to addresses across one or more ZIP Codes. Direct mail allows Brave to reach more people across the country, including in regions where alternative marketing options—such as digital advertising—may be less effective.</p>
<p>EDDM is attractive to Brave because the process and system never expose any private, or otherwise sensitive, information regarding potential recipients. Further details about this effort and process were shared a few months ago in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/brave_browser/comments/t4gzuw/update_on_braves_ongoing_direct_mail_marketing/">a transparency post on Reddit</a>. To ensure privacy, also to avoid confusion, our mailers were intentionally designed to exclude names.</p>





    


    


    
    

<p>After having completed several test campaigns, Brave this year scaled up our efforts to reach seven major cities: Atlanta, Fresno, Milwaukee, Nashville, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and San Antonio. In this process, our EDDM vendor made a significant mistake by not excluding names, but instead including names before addresses, resulting in the distribution of personalized mailers.</p>





    


    


    
    

<p>Because addresses are printed only after Brave’s quality-assurance has finished (so as not to expose any sensitive information to Brave), this issue was not caught in time to prevent distribution.</p>
<p>Upon hearing from surprised recipients about this error, we froze any further printing of direct mail until the issue could be corrected. Any printed mailers with individual names which had not yet been sent were stopped and destroyed, while all future mailers were corrected to be anonymous (as originally intended), excluding printed names. We are evaluating whether further action needs to be taken due to the significance of the mistake.</p>
<p>We completely understand that some users are upset or confused about receiving a mailer addressed to them by name, and we sincerely apologize for this error. We’re committed to fixing this kind of issue systematically, so it never happens again, and we appreciate all of you who helped us catch and correct the problem.</p>

    <p>The last five years have been a whirl for both Horizen and the crypto industry. We started as a privacy coin inheriting a zk-SNARK circuit from Zcash and then we spent the next several years building a unique interoperability protocol,<a href="https://www.horizen.io/assets/files/Horizen-Sidechain-Zendoo-A_zk-SNARK-Verifiable-Cross-Chain-Transfer-Protocol.pdf"> Zendoo</a>, using SNARKs to network blockchains and designing a completely decentralized model for fully provable sidechains. Together with this, in these years we deeply worked on proving systems in order to make recursive proof composition effective.</p><p>Now we’re going all-in on building one of the best cryptographic teams in the industry. Our goal is to quintuple our group of cryptographers and cryptographic engineers across two teams: Proving System and Circuits, such that we can support short, mid-term, and long run zk product deliveries and make critical breakthroughs in the current state of the art.</p><p>Horizen’s Core Engineering Team is an innovative and collaborative group of researchers and software engineers who are dedicated to the design and development of world-class blockchain-based products.

<p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>Another month went by, and full of developments it was.</p><p>Looking back, it’s positively satisfying to see progress in so many areas of our project as we move towards delivering Panther Core v1.</p><p>Let’s have a look at what happened in the different areas of Panther.</p> Tech and Product  Proposal to fix the Classic Staking unstaking bug <p>We started the month with the discovery of a bug in our Staking solution as users tried to withdraw their Ethereum Mainnet rewards at the end of the staking period. This unfortunate event was quickly solved by <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x2bf595137b5fe3f0fdea29dcb85ab0a0be6fffbc3ea3b7cd9aecb966ab8aa887">Panther Improvement Proposal #5</a>, approved on May 9th and implemented on May 12th.</p><p>Anecdotally, solving the unstaking bug involved collaborating with Snapshot.org to solve a UI bug, resulting in a net positive for the multi-DAO ecosystem. Fixing the unstaking bug allowed us to finally move on to testing Advanced Staking.</p><p>For all relevant details about the unstaking bug and the fix’s implementation, see the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/post-mortem-for-the-classic-staking-unstaking-bug-fix-8e2d474a5b51">post-mortem blog post</a>. If you’d like to know more about the unique process Panther employs to apply fixes through its DAO and the community, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-road-to-decentralization-part-1-setting-our-foundations-2e7e3874c09e">refer to our road to decentralization piece.</a></p> Launched the Zafari incentivized Testnet <p>We debuted the Zafari incentivized Testnet on May 19th. <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testing-for-zkp-advanced-staking-is-now-live-19b51bc6b42b">Zafari</a> will help the Panther team thoroughly test different products and developments with the help of its community, giving away varied rewards for contributors that help discover bugs and issues.</p><p>The first round of testing using Zafari’s Beta is currently underway with <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testing-for-zkp-advanced-staking-is-now-live-19b51bc6b42b">Advanced Staking Testing</a>. Note that this program is still ongoing thanks to the community’s discovery of a couple of issues, highlighting the importance of initiatives that ensure a smooth final product rollout.</p><p>Below, you can see some metrics from testing so far. Make sure as well to check out our <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther/status/1530545013502902273">dedicated Twitter thread</a> to learn more about how testing is progressing!</p><p>More than 1400 individual contributions to Testing by Panthers!</p> Became ZPrize Silver Partners <p>Panther has joined forces with 40 other leading names (the Ethereum Foundation, Polkadot, Polygon, etc.) in the blockchain space to sponsor and orchestrate the <a href="https://www.zprize.io/">ZPrize competition</a>. ZPrize is a collection of challenges offering $7M in prizes to teams advancing the zero-knowledge scientific field.</p><p>As our first task as Partners, the Panther team architected the <a href="https://www.zprize.io/prizes/fast-hashing-for-zero-knowledge-applications">Accelerating the Poseidon Hash Function</a> challenge.

With half the length of the <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/resources/panther-protocol-v-1-0-1.pdf">Panther Whitepaper</a>, a more didactic and less technical approach, no compromise in essential talking points, and stunning visuals, we’re incredibly proud of it.</p><p>If you haven’t checked it out yet, make sure to give it a read after finishing this update!</p> Community  Debuted as a CoinMarketCap Gravity VIP member <p>CoinMarketCap recently debuted Gravity, their new blogging platform. Panther was invited to participate as a VIP member on Gravity, publishing exclusive content and re-publishing some of our existing articles.</p><p>Gravity presents a splendid opportunity for Panther to seize a spot of prominence among CoinMarketCap’s top projects. To help Panther shine in CoinMarketCap, make sure to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/gravity/profile/PantherProtocol">follow us</a> now.</p> Ambassador Program and Language communities <p>The launch of our Ambassador program is still fresh in our memories, but we definitely didn’t expect it to grow as fast as it has.</p><p>Merely a month and a half since we’ve introduced the program, we can gladly see the first fruits of our Ambassadors’ dedication. We’d like to give a big shoutout to everyone hard at work pushing exclusive content and moderating eight <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/dao/support/community">Panther regional and language communities</a>.

We addressed Terra LUNA’s collapse (the topic of the moment), e-Money’s sustainable model for interest-bearing stablecoins, the need for privacy in creating a surveillance-free online economy, and much more.</p>“The compliance use case [for zero-knowledge proofs] is particularly powerful when you think about private stablecoins, private dark pools, private payment networks, and so forth. (…) And again, stablecoins are the fastest growing and most relevant sector.”- Oliver Gale, Panther CEO.<p>This first Partner Spaces was an incredible opportunity to showcase how e-Money and Panther can profoundly benefit from our mutual partnership. Stablecoins need privacy, and Panther is more than glad to onboard them on our token-agnostic privacy solution. Partner Spaces will be an excellent tool for us to engage with and be on the radar of our Partners’ community, spreading the word about the need for privacy in DeFi.</p><p>Panther zTalks</p>If you’d like to get to know developments in the Panther ecosystem and meet the team more informally, Panther zTalks are a fun listen.<p>Our marketing team hosted the first <a href="https://youtu.be/watch?v=P7CbFUTKtaE">Panther zTalks</a> on May 9th, discussing our previous monthly update, news about Panther, and what’s on the horizon, including a DeFi integration Proof of Concept and Advanced Staking.</p><p>We’ll continue to issue episodes of Panther zTalks whenever they feel relevant, involving different members of our team. We’re also looking forward to inviting our Ambassadors and community members, so feel free to drop us a line if you’d like to participate!</p> Events We are almost certain that they did not spend the whole event sitting in this corner.<p>Mike Chan and Anish Mohammed, Head of Marketing and CTO, were busy on May 17–19th attending the Permissionless conference in Miami. <a href="https://blockworks.co/events/permissionless/">Permissionless by Blockworks</a> is a cultural event for the Metaverse and DeFi industries, attended by builders, investors, and leading voices in crypto.</p><p>We’d love to tell you all about the partnerships and discussions held throughout this event, but you’ll have to wait to learn about them through special announcements ;)</p> Hirings <p>This month, our HR team hired new team members for the following positions:</p>  Head of Delivery  Product Manager  Senior Solidity Developer  Front End Developer  Community Manager  <p>We still have multiple positions open on our <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol">Angel.co page</a>.

<p>Zcash Network Upgrade 5 (NU5) activated on mainnet today, May 31. It is the most important milestone for Zcash since the cryptocurrency launched in 2016 — and as our Electric Coin Co. (ECC) CEO Zooko Wilcox put it, “<a href="https://twitter.com/zooko/status/1524505677514698752">an historic step forward for human society</a>.”</p>



<p>NU5, the first major upgrade since November 2020, includes the launch of the Orchard shielded payment protocol, utilizing the Halo proving system to remove reliance on complex setup ceremonies. The efficiencies built into this upgrade make possible — for the first time ever — private, trustless digital cash payments on mobile phones. Halo also paves the way for increased interoperability by providing a system that could unlock private cross-chain proofs at scale.</p>



 
 <blockquote><p>It’s here!!! Zcashd 5.0.0! If the Zcash users choose to run zcashd 5.0.0, then at the end of this month Zcash Network Upgrade 5 will activate on mainnet. This is an historic step forward for human society.<a href="https://t.co/X5LT1H4rXq">https://t.co/X5LT1H4rXq</a></p>— zookoⓩ (@zooko) <a href="https://twitter.com/zooko/status/1524505675459891200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2022</a></blockquote> 
 



 



 No more ceremonies 



<p>When Zcash launched, its zero-knowledge proofs required a setup phase to produce public parameters that allowed users to construct and verify private transactions. This was called <a href="https://youtu.be/D6dY-3x3teM">the Ceremony</a>, or trusted setup. This technique was pioneered by ECC, and it required multiple parties in different locations and complex security measures. A similar process was required for the Sapling upgrade in 2018 and involved more than a hundred participants. (The story of Zcash’s original Ceremony was<a href="https://radiolab.org/episodes/ceremony"> well told</a> by Radiolab.)<br>Today, <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/03/14/trustedsetup.html#:~:text=A%20trusted%20setup%20ceremony%20is,some%20cryptographic%20protocol%20is%20run.">many protocols</a> rely on trusted setups, but as Joeri Cant at <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-company-behind-zcash-announces-proposed-solution-to-trusted-setup">Cointelegraph put it</a>, “they are difficult to coordinate, could present a systemic risk and always have to be repeated for each major protocol upgrade.” With the Halo proving system (<a href="https://filecoinfoundation.medium.com/new-agreement-between-filecoin-foundation-and-electric-coin-co-63df066212b1">open source</a>), reliance on these kinds of processes is eliminated and protocols like Zcash benefit in efficiency and safety.</p>



<p>Zcash Media released a video about the original Ceremony, its participants (including Edward Snowden), and how Halo makes “trusted setups” obsolete.</p>



 
  
 



 



 Halo proving system in NU5 



<p>The Halo <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1021.pdf">paper</a>, authored in 2019 by ECC.’s Sean Bowe, Jack Grigg, and Daira Hopwood, introduced a new technique for creating practical, scalable, and trustless cryptographic proving systems, ending an almost decade-long pursuit by the cryptography community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mike Casey, at Coindesk <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/14/zcashs-halo-breakthrough-is-a-big-deal-not-just-for-cryptocurrencies/">wrote</a> about Halo: “If the discovery by ECC researcher Sean Bowe holds up to scientific scrutiny, it could one day unleash a host of powerful, real-world applications for the digital age that go far beyond cryptocurrency.”</p>



<p>Zcash NU5 implements a “2.0 version” (<a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/announcing-zip-224-bringing-halo-2-to-zcash/">Halo 2</a>) of the new zero-knowledge proving system that was first detailed in that paper. It eliminates protocol reliance on complex setup ceremonies, as mentioned above, and provides a catalyst for Zcash user confidence and scalability while making the protocol more attractive, faster, and less expensive for others to build on.</p>



<p>A technique called recursion, or nested amortization, also introduced in the Halo paper, is under development at ECC, bolstered by <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ethereum-zcash-filecoin-collab/">an agreement</a> with Protocol Labs, the Filecoin Foundation, and the Ethereum Foundation. As Bowe put it, this cryptographic breakthrough “allows a single proof to attest to the correctness of practically unlimited other proofs, effectively allowing a large amount of computation (and information) to be compressed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recursion is a crucial building block for a layer 1 scalability solution on Zcash — and for many other projects in and out of the crypto space.</p>



 



 Unified addresses 



<p>A new address format in the Orchard payment protocol removes the complexity of a user having to juggle multiple address types. In NU5-supporting wallets, a <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/unified-addresses-in-zcash-explained/">unified address</a> is generated from a set of multiple Zcash address types (e.g., transparent, Sapling and Orchard). Combined with auto-shielding, a feature currently supported by the ECC mobile wallet SDKs, any ZEC received to a unified address can be automatically routed to the latest shielded pool supported by the user’s wallet. So, even if the sender is only able to send ZEC transparently, it will end up in the receiver’s private storage — shielded by default.</p>



 



 Summary 



<p>Here’s a full list of what’s included in NU5 plus upcoming ECC releases:</p>



 Included 



  Zcashd, NU5-compatible consensus node<br>Zcashd is the consensus node for Zcash. It includes the Orchard shielded payment protocol (<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-0224">ZIP 224</a>), non-malleable transaction IDs (<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-0244">ZIP 244</a>), a new transaction version format (<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-0225">ZIP 225</a>), unified addresses (<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-0316">ZIP 316</a>), and other various updates.  



 Coming soon 



  ECC wallet<br>The ECC wallet (yet to be officially named) will become available in the Android and iOS stores later this year. Our goal is to deliver a wallet that provides an industry-leading user experience for ZEC, as well as features that will benefit crypto more broadly. Releasing a wallet of our own will allow us to deliver more features, more quickly, than is possible through the normal protocol-upgrade cadence and through our influence over third-party wallet providers.  Updated ECC reference wallet (iOS and Android)<br>The ECC reference wallet is a reference implementation of a Zcash wallet for Android and iOS, available as open source. The next version will include the code for the ECC wallet, plus documentation.&nbsp;  NU5-compatible wallet SDKs<br>ECC maintains wallet SDKs for Android and iOS. The next major release of these SDKs will support NU5, including a new transaction format, the Orchard shielded pool, unified addresses and the following features:  Auto-shielding (update)<br>Auto-shielding lets users (more specifically their wallets) automatically move funds from a transparent address to the latest shielded ZEC pool. Auto-shielding, along with unified addresses, will facilitate increased user privacy and a better overall user experience. Through auto-shielding, wallets can offer their users funds that are shielded by default, regardless of the originating address.  Auto-migration<br>Auto-migration is a mechanism for wallets to seamlessly move funds to the most modern shielded pool supported by the wallet. This feature will also make it easier to deprecate older pools.  Improved note management<br>Improved note management reduces the time users need to wait between sending transactions. This means that lightclients will be able to send one transaction immediately after another.

<p>PRESS RELEASE</p><p>PRESS CONTACT<br>contact@pivx.org</p><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p><p>Private Cryptocurrency PIVX has New Core Team&nbsp;Members</p><p>PIVX launched six years ago, makes changes in its push for liberty and efficiency through cryptocurrency.</p><p>May 29, 2022 — The PIVX community, having committed time recently to form a clear picture of its purpose and direction, announced today the formation of a new core&nbsp;team.</p><p>Software developers are an important part of the core team, and PIVX has enjoyed outstanding programming talent over its six-year life. The community is grateful for all who have participated. Until recently, PIVX had three core developers. However, with sound technology in place, a change was recently made to support a single core developer.</p><p>This continuing core developer, who goes by the handle Fuzzbawls, is the new development leader. Fuzzbawls has been with the PIVX project for years and knows it&nbsp;well.</p><p>Under Fuzzbawls’ leadership, other community members are learning and mastering the PIVX source code. PIVX is a code fork of Dash, which was built on the Bitcoin source code, and this connection gives history, reference, and learning material to new PIVX developers that augment the teaching provided by Fuzzbawls.</p><p>Other team members have also changed, in the areas of project management, business development, and marketing. The new team is diverse with rich experience and exciting new ideas. One prominent team member, who goes by the handle Sparrow, is the new Project Management Specialist.</p><p>“Sparrow, with confidence from his business experience, is moving the project forward quickly,” said Eric Stanek. “He brings out the best in other community members.”</p><p>Other new team members can be seen on the PIVX website at <a href="https://pivx.org/team">https://pivx.org/team.</a></p><p>These personnel changes will advance PIVX’s mission. The source code defines how PIVX functions, but the community defines what PIVX is, and these new team members will each impact how PIVX is viewed and used in a different way.</p><p>“I love the new team,” said Leacymck. “They are welcoming, knowledgeable, communicative, and creative.”</p><p>Uniting the team is the mission. The PIVX mission statement is the following:</p><p>To become a leading cryptocurrency that empowers, protects, and delights those it&nbsp;touches.</p><p>As PIVX races to find its destiny and fulfil this mission, it will make the next six years as adventurous as the last.
