 🔦Resource: State of Crypto - Policy spotlight  <p>The internet is one of the most important innovations, and engines of progress, in human history — yet it is failing the people who rely on it most: consumers, creators, developers, and small businesses. Control (over decisions, data, and much more) is consolidated among a handful of big platforms, which unilaterally make decisions on behalf of their users; or change the rules suddenly on developers and other builders; and extract prohibitive fees from creators… and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>Blockchains have not only emerged as a credible solution, they also represent an important new computing movement that opens up new opportunities and use-cases well beyond web3. But despite the potential of this industry, critical regulatory guidance has been lacking.&nbsp;</p><p>To share what’s at stake — and provide a resource for anyone seeking to understand, or share more on blockchains &amp; crypto with others more — we put together a quick spotlight deck. It sets context for the why, what, and how of web3; and shares relevant data from our State of Crypto report that you can share with others more broadly. The deck also offers guiding principles to help U.S. policymakers meet their goals of protecting consumers, providing a path to compliance, and ensuring innovation.</p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/spotlight-on-crypto-policy/">check out the report here</a> [time: 10 minutes]&nbsp;<br>share: on <a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1727371567305470066">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/a16zcrypto_state-of-crypto-2023-spotlight-on-crypto-activity-7133137315786330113-wtfW">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0x48fdad58">Farcaster</a></p> 🎨Feature: A creator's journey to self-sovereignty: ‘The why is in the who’ <p>Singer-songwriter, rapper, producer, and performance artist Latashá shares her journey through art, technology (including crypto), NFTs, and “self-sovereignty” in this talk delivered at our second annual Founders Summit a few weeks ago.

Democratizing technology is ‘actually super-hard to do,’ says Andrew B. Hall, a professor of political economy at Stanford Graduate School of Business… Some big-name companies have responded to those concerns by looking for ways to give users more power to decide what guardrails are being put around their products… OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, is funding experiments in setting up a democratic process for deciding what rules its artificial intelligence systems should follow…</p><p>Hall says there may be an answer for boosting participation in online democracy — providing rewards to users who get (and stay) involved. In a new paper co-authored with Eliza R. Oak, a PhD candidate at Yale University, Hall studied the governance of Optimism, a startup that creates applications that improve the efficiency of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain platform… In what Hall and Oak believe to be the first study of its kind, they approach the project as ‘a novel laboratory for studying governance.’”&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/inside-government-where-people-are-paid-vote">read more</a> in “Insights by Stanford Business” [time: 5 minutes]</p>  <p><a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/working-papers/what-kinds-incentives-encourage-participation-democracy-evidence">download the full paper</a>, “What Kinds of Incentives Encourage Participation in Democracy?

 Episode Transcript 
<p>This transcript has been condensed and edited for readability and clarity.</p>
<p>Seema Amble: Zach thanks so much for joining me. If you could start off by just telling us a little bit about the founding story of Plaid and where you guys started off. </p>
<p>Zach Perret: Well, first off, thank you so much for having me. It’s an honor to be here and chatting about the early Plaid story is always fun for me. So Plaid had a bit of a rocky early start. So when my co founder William and I first founded Plaid, we had this vision that we wanted to create, tools to help consumers better analyze their finances. This was in 2012, and we were based in New York City. So we had this little tiny office about a block off of Union Square.</p>
<p>And in 2012, if you’ll remember, that was when they kicked all the Zuccotti Park protestors outta Zuccotti Park . They all moved up to Union Square and so we walked through the Occupy Wall Street protests a couple times a week as we were on the way to the office. And setting the politics of all that aside, the thing that we could really tell is that consumers were frustrated with their financial products.</p>
<p>They were not able to get the financial tools that they needed. They didn’t feel that there was a lot of trust in the financial system. They didn’t feel like the banks were looking out for them, and being these kind of naive, early 20-year-olds thinking about how we could go help people, we said, “Hey, well, we want to build better tools to help people analyze their finances.”</p>
<p>Now, we weren’t so sanguine and thoughtful to figure out the right kind of product to build. So we just started building any product that we could imagine. And we ended up creating basically tools to help consumers look at their money. We ended up building actually like 6 or 7 of these in different permutations. Some were focused on helping consumers analyze their spending. Some were focused on recommending places where you could spend less money as a consumer. And some were just fun tools and I could have analyzing your spend and putting a spotlight on all the places that you spend money and all of this is with with the intent of helping consumers better understand, how they were spending and maybe save more.</p>
<p>But as I said, we didn’t have a huge plan for what we’re going to build. We just wanted to build something to help people, the biggest shortcoming that we found is that if you build a consumer facing product that largely tells a consumer to stop doing some behavior that they want to do, it doesn’t go very well.</p>
<p>So we would oftentimes build a budget and say, “Hey, consumers, you’re spending too much on restaurants. You should spend less.” That’s not a very effective way to create behavior change. Now there are a lot of really smart, amazing entrepreneurs that have built much better products than we could have built, but what we found is that if we told the consumer to spend less money on restaurants, they would just delete our app.</p>
<p>They would stop using it. They would never show up again. And, I think they were right. It wasn’t an excellent product. We hadn’t thought through all the implications of how to create behavior change and we certainly weren’t giving them a lot of better options. But along the way we found that the tool that we’d built was really interesting to a lot of other developers.</p>
<p>So, myself and my co founder, we were kind of software developers, like kind of engineers by background. And, we were talking to a lot of our friends that were in the early fintech community. Now this was before fintech had a name, but these were friends that wanted to build financial products for consumers, and they were really intrigued by the way that we were able to collect the data on the consumer’s behalf and structure the data on the consumer’s behalf. And so we ended up making a pivot in the business to say, we’re not going to go direct to&nbsp; consumer because we’ve learned concretely that we are not only bad at building things for consumers, but we don’t even know what consumers want, and we pivoted and decided to go direct to businesses.</p>
<p>And so that’s where we ended up finding the sweet spot. It turns out the challenge that we’ve solved — how do you take bank data and structure it, and then put it into an application — was a really, really hard challenge. And we’ve been solving that to build our consumer product. That was kind of the early story. </p>
<p>Seema: A common theme in fintech has been that you can’t just go out with something that’s kind of half baked, but a lot of times people have pivoted into infrastructure from having built a consumer B2B facing application level product. How did you guys think about the API that you wanted to launch with for other developers to build on?</p>
<p>Zach: So I find that in financial services, it’s not often sufficient to solve part of a problem for a person, but what is sufficient is to solve a complete problem for a very narrow set of people.</p>
<p>So we were fortunate that we had built integrations into a couple banks. I think our first one was America Express and we built into a couple more in order to allow people to connect their bank account and use our budgeting tool. And when we made the B2B shift, we found that for many of the people that were initially interested in using Plaid, they were doing, let’s say expense management.</p>
<p>And so one of our very first customers was someone that was doing expense management and all they needed to do was collect all of the transactions, that you spent on your corporate card. And it turns out corporate cards are American Express cards. So we had this connection and could build a product that only works for corporate American Express customers, but it solved the entire problem for any corporate American Express customer. </p>
<p>So we actually were able to kind of launch Plaid initially, again, only with one bank account that we connected to one bank type, one financial institution, that we connected to, and found a couple of customers that needed this very narrow use case. And we were able to launch with them, and then eventually we added more and more connections.</p>
<p>Once we got to about 15 or so connections, we then started having very serious conversations with Venmo, and that was the first kind of big customer that ended up really scaling with us. It was a really wonderful story for us, but yeah, we had a very incomplete product at first.</p>
<p>Seema: One of my favorite things about the Plaid story is how you guys build community. Would love to touch on how you guys thought about who to target, and who you wanted to be your first customers.</p>
<p>Zach: So our early go-to-market was really just about talking to people. So, as I said, we founded Plaid in New York City and there were a lot of people in the New York community that were interested in building software for financial services. Obviously a lot of people coming out of the banks themselves that wanted to create better products and a lot of people that were thinking of new ideas. The reality is software in financial services at the time, the mindshare, was dominated by Mint, which had this phenomenal success story, and by a small handful of other very early stage companies. When you thought of financial software, it was Mint, PayPal, and then like a few people hadn’t heard of, and that was it.</p>
<p>And so, in New York, we ended up just going to a lot of meetups, talking to a lot of entrepreneurs, talking to a lot of people that were thinking about building startups generally. The 2012 New York startup community was very small, and it was very tight. And so you could kind of like go to a meetup and you’d meet half the companies in New York.</p>
<p>And so we did that a lot. Eventually we found a couple of early customers that were thinking about, as I said, expense management was the first real use case, where our product was the complete thing that you needed to serve a user, and that became our first customer or two. But one of the things that we did was just try to really deeply understand the people that we were talking to, initially, instead of doing contracts and sales and accounts management and things like that. </p>
<p>We said, “Hey, we’ll publish an API. You don’t have to sign any contract, just use it. And the only ask is that you give me your phone number so that I can text you.” And what I would do is I would just, text these people that said they would use the API, I would text them like every week, and say like, “Hey, what can we do better? Like, what, what feedback do you have? How’s this working?”</p>
<p>And the amazing thing is this concept of texting your customers, turned a lot of these people that were kind of like loose acquaintances in the startup ecosystem into really good friends. And this is something that persisted for a really long time. So, I was probably on text with our first 100, 200 customers, just directly.</p>
<p>And many of those have become lifelong friends for me. They’ve given great feedback. This concept of not being too formal about it, and being really genuine to the community and then like really deeply caring to the point of, maybe even annoying our first customers with too many texts to ask for feedback was very, very helpful.</p>
<p>Seema: How did you think about spending time with customers?</p>
<p>Zach: Well, the short answer is we did as much to spend time with them as we possibly could. I ended up just flying a lot back and forth between anywhere that our customers were. Our key would be we wanted to go spend time in their office. We want to build a personal relationship with them. We wanted them to tell us what was going on.</p>
<p>The first time we got an office, we started doing this thing called a Plaid Out. It’s a terrible name because it was actually in our office. But what we would do is we would invite anyone that we possibly knew in the startup community doing fintech, to come to our office and have a beer with us and talk to us about things. Initially it was me, William and an intern. Eventually, we had 4 or 5 other engineers and people come in and none of us were particularly social, all kind of introverted and none of us particularly drank very much.</p>
<p>So it would always be this like little bit of an awkward thing where we just invited a bunch of people to come to our office. And it was like hard to start the conversation. But you do it and you eventually meet customers and they would tell you things or you’d meet potential recruits and they would tell you things and little by little, we were able to build a community around just this fact that we would say, Hey, we’re always going to be there talking to you.</p>
<p>Like, we’re going to be texting you and we’re going to have you into our office whenever you want to come in. The interesting thing is it built an early kernel for a very genuine brand in the community, and it meant that people, just liked talking to the Plaid team when we first started hiring go-to-market people.</p>
<p>We didn’t call them account managers because we found that the people we were selling to were engineers, and we hired people that had some engineering background that really kind of like new financial services. And we called them growth, which was a very confusing name, but it kind of worked. We found that engineers and product managers didn’t want to talk to salespeople. They want to talk to growth people. And that was a much more interesting conversation. For all these people that we hired, we made a huge focus on building a relationship first and then selling the product, or account managing the product or whatever it is.</p>
<p> Seema: The one question that comes up a ton is, “How do I think about pricing in the early days?” I need to get feedback, but I also want to validate that there’s a market here. How did you guys think about pricing and how much time did you spend on that in the early days?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zach: So, we thought that having people build on the product that would eventually pay us was very important. We always had a pricing model. If we basically just like looked at what other players in the industry did, we did the same thing. We had approximately the same prices. It wasn’t too hard. Like maybe we’re a little less and eventually now we’re more than the average price in the market, but we didn’t over-engineer the model.</p>
<p>We did go to customers and say, “Hey, look, you’ll get X amount of time free if you launch within Y timeframe.” So again, the goal was to get to usage to get to traction. And so, we would even say you’ll get a year free if you launch in the next 4 weeks. Like, it would be just these crazy deals, which would oftentimes encourage them to do it.</p>
<p>But, behind that we did say, “Here is the likely pricing model when we start charging you. Here is the pricing sheet.” And we’d actually even give them the opportunity to renegotiate the pricing before they got charged.</p>
<p>I remember, there was this period of time where we’d signed a bunch of fairly decently sized companies, I think, including Venmo and Robinhood under free trials. And their usage was super high. And our revenue was $500 a month from the collective revenue from all the rest of our customers, because those 2 were paying us. And then, one day we went into a board meeting, and the revenue finally came in. Like, you see this huge jump in our metrics, and it feels good. But yeah, it was a long time before we got real revenue. </p>
<p>Seema: It sounds like you were very focused on getting people using it quickly and prioritizing the feedback, and all aligned from a company building perspective. How did you think about size of customer? You guys were at a really interesting time when fintech was sort of starting to really take off. And so your customers obviously grew up over time, but did you spend time thinking it’s better to just get smaller customers on board early, or to also chase some larger customers?</p>
<p>Zach: I think who you take as customers and who you talk to as customers are slightly different things. Our filters for who we take as customers was, “Are you going to launch fast? And can I have your phone?” and we apply that to everybody. </p>
<p>So if they weren’t going to launch fast and weren’t willing to talk to us a lot, then we didn’t really pursue it, which meant that we ended up pursuing a lot of smaller customers as opposed to bigger ones. That was who we ended up having go live.</p>
<p>We talked to companies from PayPal on down to, two-person companies in the garage. Getting that direct customer feedback was incredibly valuable. So, I would say we, we kind of bifurcated that we ended up with a lot of small customers that were using it initially, and then having a bunch of big conversations. And then once we knew that the product worked, that was when we started to say, all right, we need, we need lighthouse customers. We need one or two customers that have a big name. At the time, big name was a little relative, so we wanted a startup that had really good investors and, we were able to get Robinhood and Venmo early on. And like those, those were the two lighthouse names where we could say, “Hey, these two are using us, everybody else, we can now use those as examples.”</p>
<p>Seema: When did you think about your first go-to-market hire and what that might be like? You mentioned the growth folks. Is that what would think of as your go-to-market engine for the early days?</p>
<p>Zach: Our thesis was, we wanted to hire all engineers that would talk to engineers, and we never really needed to hire anyone else. We had a couple of early folks that were basically designers, that were not engineers, but almost everyone of the company was engineers. And, it quickly became apparent that I was the worst engineer in the room, and so I needed to go out and drive up business if I was to prove my value to the company. So, initially all of the go-to-market was me, and it was nice because I could sit with our customer engineers and help them do implementations and so forth.</p>
<p>Then at some point, I didn’t have time to do it all. , and so we took, another early engineer who was amazing at so many things, but also particularly gregarious and we said, “All right, you’re going to come do all the go to market stuff with me.” He and I worked together for 7 years and he was an amazing leader for the company. And then little by little, we hired another person and another person.</p>
<p>And we ran with this really small pod for 2, 3 years. We didn’t hire a sales leader until we were probably 4 years into the company. Nobody had a title of sales until we probably were even like 6 or 7 years into the company. We wouldn’t even let our sales leader call our sales team “sales.”</p>
<p>Then eventually we ended up splitting out of camp management and, we built a support team. So it ended up bifurcating later, but it basically was, it was founder driven sales with people that could effectively clone the founder-driven sales process and just create like a 3-person army to go chase down all the customers.</p>
<p>Seema: As you scaled up go-to-market, did you change the way you thought about the strategy of the customers you acquire and going after bigger ones, or was it more of a continuous transition over time.</p>
<p>Zach: For a long time, we really didn’t chase true enterprises. We didn’t chase anyone that made us do an RFP. I think we started doing RFPs like 18 months ago. Because we would say if we’re doing an RFP, then we haven’t built the relationship that we want with the customer. They’re putting us up against all these other competitors, which means they don’t really understand the value of the product.</p>
<p>That was perhaps short-sighted, and we should have done this sooner. But, for a very long time, we would really only focus on, kind of like high velocity, tech driven organizations. Those high velocity, tech-driven organizations could exist inside of the big banks, so eventually we did get a big contract signed with American Express, where they had a tech team that was moving quickly and we found it and we were happy to work with them.</p>
<p>As I said, we hired a really wonderful head of sales, even though we didn’t let him call his team sales, and then he kind of trained us on how sales could work. And you have these phases of sales and you have these different types of customers that you can sell to.</p>
<p>So, he was really helpful in transforming our business from one that almost treated sales as an afterthought into something that said, all right, well, it turns out a revenue team can be incredibly valuable for the company. We just have to do it correctly. I would say, we have become much, much more mature on this front. </p>
<p>But in terms of chasing those giant logos, we’re still wary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seema: Did messaging and your positioning change as you went after this set of larger customers?</p>
<p>Zach: Yeah, we had a very odd set of initial messaging. So when we first launched the company, it was myself and a co-founder. We were in our early twenties, and we were building something in financial services where we wanted people to take us seriously. And so our initial website design was designed to be boring. It was designed to look like a bank. It was designed to look like something that someone would get to and they would sort of understand and they would sort of be intrigued and they’d say, “Yeah, but the color scheme, I trust that color scheme.” Or, “that logo is a solid logo.”</p>
<p>We wanted to do the exact opposite of what everyone in Silicon Valley was doing, which was being really consumer friendly and talking about their tech and all this stuff. We wanted to not do any of that because we thought that financial services might be scared. And I think we were probably right. </p>
<p>So we initially created a really boring page and we also had a initial philosophy, other than doing one fundraising announcement which was purely focused on hiring engineers, we had a philosophy that we would never do press. So we never wanted to do press. We never wanted to do marketing. We never wanted to do publicity because we wanted to build a one-to-one relationship with our customer. And we wanted our brand to be, what our customers understood about us, not what someone else told about our story.</p>
<p>And so boring website, no press and just high degree of hustle. It was actually very effective and it worked for quite a long time. And the best marketing that we did was having Robinhood use our product and then having someone use Robinhood and say, “How did you do that to Robinhood?” And Robinhood would send it to us. And so there was this, this kind of like amazing, referral engine. </p>
<p>Over time we’ve, we’ve kind of thawed a little bit. So we’ve made our website a little bit more friendly and appealing. It is still, kind of a little bit more bank-y, traditional trust inducing. And, we started to do some more press because we realized we needed to tell our story and avoiding press was not a great long term strategy.</p>
<p>But, I would say, for the first, even like 4 or 5 years, it was a kind of boring website and very minimal press, really letting the product itself shine through excellent docs and letting our relationships shine through. </p>
<p>Seema: Last topic, do you have any advice that you would want to give your former self or future founders on acquiring their first set of customers?</p>
<p>Zach: Text your customers, get really close to them, optimize for velocity because the velocity matters matters a lot. Don’t pursue the big contracts with an expectation that they’ll close, but pursue them for learning, maybe almost exclusively.</p>
<p>And then, I think a lot about the product itself enabling distribution. One of our philosophies is that the products should have the distribution built in, or as best you can. In the early phases, that was doing something that was slightly different, which is publishing our docs online. Which our competitors didn’t do, which seems commonplace now, and also giving an online signup page for someone to come in to come and use the product. </p>
<p>Now, we think about building things like viral loops and such into the product itself. But really thinking about your distribution as a product strategy, as opposed to, distribution as being the sales team’s job, I think that’s a really crucial thing. And when talking with small companies, that’s something that I advise them to do. </p>
<p>Seema: It seems like you guys also built this network of a lot of folks who then went and started more companies and ended up being evangelists. For the product, which may not have been intentional at the time, but, also ended up driving, it seems like, a lot of the distribution, or at least the reputation.</p>
<p>Zach: Oh, it was totally intentional. We wanted to be friends with everyone. We want everyone to know us because we believe that the engineers that we’re working on plotted this company, were going to go start the next company.</p>
<p>And so, for us, when someone left a company, when one of our champions left a company, that was like a moment of sprint. So we would go in and say, “Who’s the new champion? And where is the other person going?” There’s this one engineer who installed Plaid at 5 companies. And when he went from the first company to the next company, we said, “All right, great. What’s your next company doing? How can we help?” And, he eventually became founder and built a product on top of Plaid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s been this wonderful story, we call them “free radicals.”</p>
<p>Like the person that was the champion, where are they going and what are they doing next and how do we kind of follow this free radical around? It was nice that we happened to be working with startups that had a lot of startup people, that then went to the next startup or started their own startup.</p>
<p>Seema: Yeah, I love that term free radical.&nbsp; Well, this has been a really fun conversation. Zach, thank you so much for, for joining me.</p>
<p>Zach: Thank you for having me.</p>

<p>Capital allocation is a core part of any CEO’s job, and it’s particularly critical for growth-stage CEOs. After all, once your company goes public, you’ll be expected to justify every dollar you spend.</p>
<p>Most growth-stage CEOs I work with know how to tell if they’re efficiently allocating capital in every part of their budget with one glaring exception: research and development (R&amp;D).</p>
<p>In board meetings, we scrutinize the efficiency of sales and marketing (S&amp;M) spend, costs of goods sold (COGS), and general and administrative costs (G&amp;A). But when it comes to R&amp;D, I consistently see CEOs allocate huge amounts of capital with very little rationale to justify or explain it.</p>
<p>R&amp;D spend is the lifeblood of technology companies—all the more so as companies race to build and incorporate AI into their products to remain competitive. Without a product that provides unique value to customers, nothing else matters. Every function of the organization is in service of getting the products in the hands of customers in exchange for money.</p>
<p>If R&amp;D is so critical to a company’s success, why then do R&amp;D budgets lack the same discipline of other spend categories? Because assessing the ROI of R&amp;D spend is far less straightforward. The return on R&amp;D is variable and often happens over a longer time horizon compared to other budget line items. Measuring the efficiency of S&amp;M spend is usually a matter of quantifying LTV:CAC, and most tech companies can identify inefficiencies within 2 quarters. To improve the efficiency of spend on cost of goods sold (COGS), most growth-stage leaders can optimize seat-based spend or renegotiate consumption-based contracts in a quarter or 2. And finding inefficiencies in overhead (e.g., G&amp;A), especially in tougher market conditions, is often a matter of assessing office space, worker productivity, legal costs, etc.</p>
<p>Ultimately, while R&amp;D is perhaps the most important capital to allocate, it’s also the hardest capital to efficiently allocate.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, when you’re at the beginning of your budget planning process, how do you figure out if you should spend $30M, $50M, or $100M on R&amp;D? And then how do you figure out where, exactly, those dollars go within R&amp;D? And, especially when you’re considering integrating a new technology platform into your business—like AI today, or cloud a decade ago—how do you invest in innovation without losing control of your runway and budget?</p>
<p>Here’s how I wish more growth-stage teams approached their R&amp;D spend:</p>
 
 Use benchmarks to initially ballpark your overall spend (but remember there are good reasons to vary from benchmarks). 
 Map your spend to your product roadmap, then attach an expected ROI and timeline for the expected return. 
 Focus on performance management of your product and engineering teams as early indicators for what R&amp;D investments are working, and which aren’t. 
 
  1. Start with benchmarks 
<p>Benchmarks are helpful to reference when you’re allocating capital across all budget items, and your board and investors can help with identifying the most relevant benchmarks for your company. Benchmarks don’t represent what you should spend, but are rather good starting points to help you articulate why you’re spending more or less than comparable companies, how long you plan to continue spending that way, and what you expect to get out of that incremental spend. Many companies have good reasons not to conform to R&amp;D benchmarks, especially if they’re creating new categories or building at the forefront of a new technology like generative AI. That said, if you’re spending a bunch more on a given product than your competitors are, you should charge more for that product because it offers more value to customers, or that extra spend isn’t worth it.</p>
<p>We pulled benchmarks for R&amp;D spend from private and public companies in application, infrastructure and security, and consumer internet.</p>
<p></p>
  2. Map spend to your product roadmap 
<p>As the CEO, you likely have no shortage of compelling ideas for what to build coming from your employees, customers, and investors. While benchmarks can provide some guidance on appropriate overall spend, really effective R&amp;D capital allocation involves mapping your spend to clear product roadmap priorities.</p>
<p>The challenge, of course, is that product roadmaps operate on multiple time horizons, and the ROI of different R&amp;D spends typically maps to those different horizons. Some investments will generate returns within a few months, while others may take years to produce results.</p>
 The 70–20–10 rule for allocating R&amp;D—sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t 
<p>How, then, do you prioritize? The best known framework for R&amp;D spend for companies that have found product-market fit is the 70–20–10 rule, where 70% of spend goes toward investment in the core product, 20% toward new product feature development or smaller products in their nascency, and 10% toward more speculative new products (sometimes called moonshots).</p>
<p>The problem with the 70–20–10 rule is that product is so multifaceted that it defies a generalizable rule or framework. Different companies operate in different markets and competitive dynamics, and your priorities and spend will depend on competitive intensity, market size and runway for your existing product, and how likely you are to win the market with an additional product.</p>
<p>In typical market conditions, new customers may be clamoring for new features. Building those features will increase adoption and expand usage, so it makes sense to allocate ~20% of R&amp;D to building them. But during major platform shifts, like the current shift to AI, many companies have to rapidly shift product direction. In the most extreme cases, a 10% moonshot can suddenly become the company’s core focus and 80% of R&amp;D spend. Unsurprisingly, many great product bets have come from veering from the 70–20–10 rule.</p>
<p>Imagine if, in 2007, Netflix decided to follow the 70–20–10 rule. They would have focused primarily on building a better DVD rental business and likely gone the way of Blockbuster Video. They succeeded, where Blockbuster failed, because they understood that a huge entertainment platform shift and change in consumer behavior was beginning. They wisely allocated the majority of R&amp;D to pivot to a new streaming product and reinvented themselves for a new platform era.</p>
<p>For many growth-stage companies, AI is a similar existential shift, likely to dominate workflows they previously owned. For these companies, innovation is a matter of life or death, and the best way to survive is to nail the product for a new platform—and that means nailing R&amp;D spend.</p>
 My 2×2 framework for the ROI of R&amp;D 
<p>The important product conversation to have with your board and your teams is the expected timelines and returns on your R&amp;D investments. Generally, I think of the ROI on R&amp;D investments as a 2×2 grid, in which bets are offensive or defensive with a short- or long-term time horizon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Offensive bets typically deliver paybacks as business growth, product features, and developments that unlock new markets or consumer spend. Short-term offensive bets have shorter development cycles and more predictable returns. Microsoft’s launch of the o365 Copilot <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-unveils-ai-its-office-suite-increased-competition-with-google-2023-03-16/">earlier this year</a>, for example, took less than 12 months to develop after the launch of ChatGPT with the potential to generate additional revenue as soon as it launched. Long-term offensive bets are usually multi-year, complex product developments that are higher risk and higher reward. Most moonshots fall into this category. For example, Meta made a long-term, offensive R&amp;D bet on a platform-size shift with <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/introducing-the-new-facebook-reality-labs/">Reality Labs</a>. Time will tell if the metaverse is the right bet, but Mark Zuckerberg has made the bet clear: a multi-billion dollar R&amp;D investment and corporate rebrand for the metaverse with a 10+ year payback period.</p>
<p>Defensive bets, on the other hand, avoid risk and minimize losses, often by saving costs or building a product feature to prevent a competitor from winning customers. For instance, a short-term defensive bet might add a feature a competitor launched that is luring away customers, such as when Instagram launched Reels in response to TikTok’s growing market share. A long-term defensive bet, on the other hand, might be a decision to build internal data centers and repatriate data from the cloud, or for an incumbent to replatform, such as when Adobe moved its creative suite to the cloud. In both cases, the initiative requires a big upfront investment that requires long-term dedicated engineering resources and capabilities, but if successful, it delivers compounding advantages over the long term.</p>
<p>The mix of short- and long-term, offensive and defensive bets depends on your product and business priorities. At the board level, it can be helpful to discuss the thinking behind your priorities as well as your expectations for the returns on your R&amp;D spend.</p>

 
  R&amp;D Questions for Board Discussion
   
 	 What product development priorities are you currently investing in?&nbsp; 
 	 Why do those priorities make sense in the current market?&nbsp; 
 	 How much are you investing in each product development priority? How did you decide that amount? 
 	 If you succeed, what will it deliver in terms of existing product performance and features or new products?&nbsp; 
 	 How much existing customer pull do you already see for proposed new products?&nbsp; 
 	 What do you hope a new feature or product will return in capital or customer value?&nbsp; 
 	 What risk is associated with failing to maintain parts of the core product?  
  
<p>Answering these questions is an annual exercise, and then requires monthly and quarterly management against performance goals that align to product progress.</p>
<p>Recently, I heard from a public company founder who had done a more intensive zero-based budgeting exercise. They felt that product and engineering spend had drifted, and they were spending on numerous R&amp;D areas without a clear understanding of the business objective. It’s likely not necessary to do this intensive of an exercise annually, but if you need a hard reset of R&amp;D priorities, it’s another tool to consider.</p>
  3. Performance manage your product and engineering teams 
<p>Once you’ve allocated R&amp;D with a clear set of expectations and timelines, performance management of your technical teams becomes the key to assessing whether the money you’ve allocated is translating into the product and product performance you expected. The down side of Metcalfe’s Law, which says a network becomes more valuable as it increases in size, becomes a very real challenge at the growth stages. Adding more people—in this case more engineers—requires exponentially more communication and vision alignment, and can also become a drag on productivity. (In fact, most growth-stage companies I’ve spoken with who have gone through RIFs found they got more efficient.) Add to that the long time horizon of some bets and the increasingly distributed and remote nature of engineering teams, and it can be easy for underperforming product or engineering teams—and underperforming R&amp;D budgets—to go unchecked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Missed timelines and overshot budgets tend to be the leading indicators that your R&amp;D investments, in the fullness of time, won’t deliver your expected objectives. Many companies are increasingly relying on engineering management tools to help optimize performance. While I won’t go into the details of performance management for technical teams here, the important thing for realizing the ROI of your R&amp;D is to measure product delivery and performance. (For a deeper look at effective engineering management, we recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Puzzle-Systems-Engineering-Management/dp/1732265186">An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management</a> by current Carta CTO Will Larson, who was previously an engineering leader at Stripe, Uber, and Calm).</p>
<p>Ultimately, applying a framework and rigor to ROI is as critical for R&amp;D as other areas of spend. I hope this serves as a starting point for how you should think about assessing your R&amp;D spend when the path and math are not as straightforward, and especially as you continue on your journey of building an enduring company.</p>

  In conjunction with Stanford researchers, Circle Research introduced the concept of “R-Pools” which can be used to exchange unsettled recoverable wrapped tokens for base tokens.  
  On November 30, 2023, Circle Research presented and published this idea as part of the DeFi Security track at the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security held in Copenhagen.&nbsp;  
  It is recommended for the reader to familiarize themselves with the research from our recent post on recoverability, which can be found <a href="https://www.circle.com/blog/a-configurable-and-programmable-wrapper-mechanism-for-recovering-erc-20-tokens">here</a>.  
  
<p>Previously, we introduced recoverable wrapper tokens as a configurable, programmable mechanism to add recoverability features that can help protect developers and users from theft and illicit finance. Different configuration sets suit different contexts and use cases. These sets can range from a general recoverable asset for consumers to a wrapper issued and arbitrated by DeFi protocols to protect their locked funds.&nbsp;</p>

 Digital wallets are essential to the Web3 ecosystem, providing a way for users to store and send digital currencies and serving as a hub to interact with applications. But digital wallets can be difficult for everyday users to set up and keep secure. Many wallets exist as independent products that can’t be easily integrated into existing payments platforms or applications.

 The integration is supported by an automated liquidity management protocol, ICHI Vault, that enables simple yield opportunities on day one for all users on EON. &nbsp; 



<p>The Horizen ecosystem is excited to announce its integration with <a href="https://docs.ascent.exchange/">Ascent Exchange</a> with simple yield opportunities via <a href="https://ichi.org/">ICHI Vault</a>. This integration is set to significantly enhance the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io">Horizen EON</a> platform’s capabilities in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, bringing a new level of innovation and efficiency to the industry.</p>



 A New Chapter in DeFi: Horizen EON Meets Ascent Exchange 



<p>This integration represents a major step forward for the Horizen EON ecosystem. By joining forces with Ascent Exchange, Horizen EON leverages Ascent’s expertise in decentralized exchange operations, propelling our platform to new heights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This integration allows for more seamless and secure trading experiences, facilitating asset and information transfer across the blockchain network. Moreover, this integration underlines a shared vision for a unified and interoperable digital asset ecosystem, where decentralized applications (dApps) can flourish across various platforms.</p>



<a href="https://ascent.exchange"></a>



<blockquote>
<p></p>



<p>“Our integration with Ascent Exchange is a testament to Horizen EON’s commitment to interoperability and resilience in the blockchain ecosystem. </p>



<p>Ascent’s expertise, coupled with Horizen’s EVM-compatible platform, marks a significant milestone towards creating a more interconnected and robust DeFi ecosystem. </p>



<p>Ascent Exchange’s early adoption of the Horizen EON platform is set to redefine the DeFi trading space.”&nbsp;</p>
– Rob Viglione, Co-founder of Horizen and CEO of Horizen Labs.</blockquote>



 Simple Yield Opportunities on Ascent Exchange via ICHI Vaults 



  
<p>Ascent Exchange was launched on day one with the support of an automated liquidity management protocol called <a href="https://ichi.org/">ICHI Vaults</a>. </p>



<p>This will enable liquidity providers to earn yield with their favorite tokens on Ascent Exchange. Each ICHI Vault allows a depositor to deposit a single token which will then be used as liquidity in an underlying liquidity pool. The Vault prioritizes deposit token yield while protecting from impermanent loss. ICHI Vaults will be launched for a wide range of assets supported by Ascent Exchange.</p>
 <a href="https://ichi.org/"></a> 



 The Ascent Exchange Impact on Horizen EON 



<p>The integration of Ascent Exchange into the Horizen EON ecosystem is expected to bring numerous benefits. As the first decentralized exchange with ve(3,3) tokenomics on Horizen EON, Ascent Exchange is poised to establish a new benchmark in DeFi trading. This strategic move by Ascent Exchange is anticipated to attract a substantial volume of trading activities and users, thereby reinforcing Horizen EON’s position as a leading platform for developers and DeFi enthusiasts.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“As Ascent Exchange embarks on its journey with Horizen EON. We are positioned at the forefront of decentralized exchanges, leveraging a first-mover advantage that sets the stage for unparalleled innovation. </p>



<p>Horizen EON’s exceptional scalability and efficiency empower us to process an increased volume of transactions swiftly and cost-effectively, revolutionizing our operational capabilities. Fundamental to our ethos, the robust security protocols of Horizen EON ensure an unwaveringly secure and trustworthy environment for our users. Embracing the shared values of decentralization and innovation, we join hands with the vibrant Horizen community, further enriching our community-centric approach. </p>



<p>This pivotal shift not only reflects our evolution but also embodies our commitment to exploring new horizons in decentralized finance, inviting our community to be a part of this exciting journey.”</p>
-Bones, Founding member of Ascent Exchange</blockquote>

  Partnering with Squint: Instructions for the Real World  <p>Devin and his team are bringing cutting-edge AR to the factory floor.</p>   
	By Jess Lee	 



Published November 29, 2023
  



Team Squint



 
<p>Every once in a while, technology brings us a magical moment of delight. I remember the first time I used an Apple AirTag. The navigational arrows, haptic feedback and “10 ft away” message created a simple, intuitive way to find my erstwhile keys—and effectively bridged the gap between my mobile device and the real world.&nbsp;</p>



Magic



<p>Squint brings that same Apple-like magic to industrial work. Much in the same way an AirTag can help you find your keys, Squint is a mobile app for the industrial floor—that shows workers step-by-step instructions for how to use machinery.</p>



More magic, on the factory floor



<p>Imagine you’re a worker in a high-stakes industrial setting, navigating a maze of complex equipment on a factory floor. You’ve just been asked to switch production lines because the factory is understaffed, but you’re not familiar with the new machine you need to use. Your options are: a) ask the worker who’s been at the factory for 10 years and knows how to use everything—but they’re super busy, b) read the paper manual—but it’s buried in a binder in the storage room and difficult to find, or c) just wing it—but that could be dangerous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Squint, you have a better option: simply point your mobile device at the equipment to get instant help. Teams can document and record every step of an important procedure, then the app guides workers through it in the real world, augmented with video and all the institutional knowledge they need to do their jobs effectively and safely. You can even use it to check logs, leave notes for the next shift and report maintenance issues. It’s the digital equivalent of the person who’s been at the factory for 10 years, hovering over your shoulder, helping you out.</p>







<p>As America faces an industrial labor shortage, Squint also offers a sorely needed boost in manufacturing productivity and worker retention. Manufacturing is the nation’s fifth largest employment category and growing, as more companies move operations to the U.S. from Asia. However, a quarter of industrial workers are older than 55 and will soon retire, leaving a widening skill gap behind. To bridge it, companies including Colgate-Palmolive, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Michelin, JTEKT, Siemens and Volvo are using Squint to train and retain employees, increase productivity and ensure safety. Colgate-Palmolive, for example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhGSvkapruc">found</a> procedures were completed 50% faster with Squint—regardless of a worker’s experience level with the equipment. They also saw greater accuracy and reduced training times, and unlocked new insights through Squint’s built-in analytics.</p>



<p>When I first met Squint founder and CEO Devin Bhushan in 2015, he was a 23-year-old software engineer at Yahoo, tasked with writing the Flurry mobile app all by himself. Despite having no prior iOS experience, he did just that—and helped Yahoo’s customers understand their product analytics. He later joined Splunk, where he led the mobile AR team that made data visible for industrial companies. There, he was inundated by requests from customers to see not just their Splunk data, but all their data—and thus Squint was born. Devin’s experience across mobile, AR and product analytics makes him uniquely suited to lead Squint and pioneer this new category of software.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sequoia had the privilege of leading Squint’s $3.5M seed round earlier this year, and we got a front-row seat to the team’s incredible pace of progress when Devin and founding PM Dylan Conway joined us for Sequoia <a href="http://arc.sequoiacap.com">Arc</a>, our catalyst for pre-seed and seed-stage companies. Over the last six months, Squint’s tremendous market pull gave us the conviction to lean in and lead the Series A.</p>



Squint Founding PM Dylan Conway and Founder and CEO Devin Bhushan at Sequoia Arc



<p>We’re thrilled to be in business with Devin and his team, and excited for the possibilities they’ll continue to unlock with AR and AI. While today Squint is focused on industrial use cases, we can imagine the app someday becoming the instruction manual for any device or place—from your new coffee maker or camera to your Airbnb stay. This is only the beginning for Squint, and we’re excited to be their partners for the journey ahead.</p>

 Episode Transcript 
<p>This transcript has been condensed and edited for readability and clarity.</p>
<p>Seema Amble: Would love to kick off with you sharing a little bit about the Marqeta founding story.</p>
<p>Jason Gardner: Yeah, an interesting path over 13 years. So, I co-founded another payments company called PropertyBridge, which allowed you to pay rent electronically. We sold that at the end of 2007 and I stayed on with MoneyGram International who acquired the company until the end of 2009. And I wanted to do another payments company, but I didn’t know what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>And I had gone out to dinner with my friend in San Francisco, and he literally pulled out a bunch of Groupon coupons out of his pocket. And he says, it’s so silly that I get to carry around these pieces of paper. You’re a payment nerd. Why don’t you put them on a card?</p>
<p>And it was like, I froze and I knew that’s exactly what I wanted to do was go solve that problem. And I think when you’re as an entrepreneur, like you want to go solve a problem and it’s a lot of fun using technology to go and do that. So I knew nothing about building a card product. And went out and spoke to a lot of folks and they said, well, you have to build what’s called an issuing processing system and what you’re trying to accomplish, put a bunch of cards on a single card, sort of like one card to rule them all has been done and it’s always failed. So there’s no way that you’re going to be able to do it because there’s a bunch of other people that have done it before. And that really drove me to go solve that problem, something that had never been done before. So, we started the company, it was about January 15th of 2010. That’s when I got the Marqeta URL and, kind of the rest of this history from there. But there’s a lot of different steps and pivots along the way to get to where we are today.</p>
<p>Seema: You’ve got about three phases in the business model. And I’m curious how you thought about MVP and what to start off offering customers.</p>
<p>Jason: In the very early days the original idea was let’s go solve, you know, the ability for you to put a bunch of Groupon coupons on a card.</p>
<p>So what we found through lots of discussions was that every terminal, whether online or offline, whether you swipe a card, insert a card, tap a phone. And we found that every transaction was globally unique amongst the millions and millions of transactions that happen every day. So what we started to go build as an MVP is how do we figure out where you are based on a card swipe, and then have a sort of a purse among many purses on a card, millions of them, and then we can authorize and move the funds out of that specific purse based on a card swipe, which happens within milliseconds.</p>
<p>So that was the original MVP that we had to go and build to solve that problem.</p>
<p>Seema: And that’s quite a lot to build. In Fintech often you can’t start with just a few lines of code and then launch it into the ether. How long did that take for you to get the MVP? And when did you sort of think, okay, this is good enough to actually put into customers hands?</p>
<p>Jason: It took us about 15 months. Cause I remember when we signed the program manager agreement with Discover, this was early 2011, and then we closed our Series A on June 2nd of 2011. We had raised, I believe, 5. 2 million was our Series A. And at the time we thought we were absolute rock stars. And then we started sort of testing. So we started our own product called the Marqeta card. And that was basically to prove that we could put a bunch of Groupons on a card, and then authorize and then move money based on those transactions.</p>
<p>So that was really the first step.</p>
<p>Seema: Would love to talk about finding those initial customers who you tested with. How you thought about the first few customers?</p>
<p>Jason: So, to your point, there are kind of 3, I would say, well, 2 real pivots, but 3 iterations of Marqeta. First was the Marqeta card. And so our customers were people that wanted to pay in advance for their groceries or pay in advance for their lunches or dinners. And that was moderately successful.</p>
<p>I’m more of an infrastructure person. I don’t know really how to build pretty things. I know how to edit them, but I don’t know how to build something specifically for a consumer. So we didn’t have product market fit for that. I wasn’t necessarily enjoying myself. I didn’t see the company as this consumer brand long term.</p>
<p>So the first move was we got a call from Facebook. And Facebook wanted to build what was called the Facebook card. A hundred friends want to send a hundred different gift cards to you on your birthday and it needs to live on one card. And I was like, wow, you know, this is, this is actually what we built, the ability to have many different gift cards or purses living on a single card.</p>
<p>And they said, Hey, we are talking to all of these companies in the payment space and they’re all mentioning you. And we were tiny. We were like 18 people at the time. And he said, we’re going to run a test to see if this is going to work.</p>
<p>So they loaded money into specific merchants. We didn’t know which merchants they were. We had like maybe 10 on our platform and they put 2 or 3, but they didn’t tell us which ones they were loading money on. We could see it happening, but they weren’t telling us in advance. And they went and tested it and it worked.</p>
<p>And I just I fell in love with that whole process of providing infrastructure to Facebook. So it worked successfully, but it didn’t get to where they wanted to be, which was at the time, I think, 1 to 2% of the gift card market in a year, which, in a payments world, to get people to adopt something that fast is very difficult. That was the sort of the second phase of what we were doing. And that’s where we ultimately decided that we shut down the kind of direct to consumer business and just focused on infrastructure.</p>
<p>And that’s when things got really, really interesting for the company.</p>
<p>Seema: You’ve obviously been in the payment space for a long time. How did you think about, who do I want to target for that product given where we are now.</p>
<p>Jason: That third phase was a bit like magic. So that’s where we found product market fit and product market fit is not binary, it’s more of like the stars align and you’re just like, Oh my God. Now I know what I want to do for the next 20 years is build this product as I can see how people light up when I’m talking about the value that I’m providing as a product and solving like real problems for them. And that’s how we knew what we wanted to go and do. We were deep payment nerds. So we were selling a payments technology to companies that didn’t necessarily know payments.</p>
<p>What they knew was they had a problem to go and solve. So we really had to figure out how to operationalize the business, help them become compliant. And when we started talking to the food delivery companies like DoorDash and Postmates and then Uber Eats and eBay had our product. That’s when we started to really see the value that we were providing and specifically.</p>
<p>I knew that we had something here when we were in the Postmates office in San Francisco. We were talking to Sean Place, who was the co founder and CTO, and it turned out that they were just giving gift cards to these drivers, but they had no way to authorize the right transaction at the right time for the right amount. And they were seeing lots of fraud. So we created a technology called JIT or just in time, which allows them to essentially authorize their own transactions.</p>
<p>So we send the transaction to them, they check as the driver on shift or in the right location using Google’s map API. And then they can authorize a transaction and the fraud went from a lot, down to virtually zero.</p>
<p>Seema: It’s a great use case, that just in time. Did you know that, or did you sort of stumble upon it or did you end up co building saying, okay, I know these guys need a card, we’ll figure out that just in time product with this customer.</p>
<p>Jason: So we co built in the sense that as we began working with them in the early days, they needed more data. They needed it to happen faster. They needed to have better control over the card products themselves. So how do they do an API call to turn off a card? If a driver was doing something that they shouldn’t be doing.</p>
<p>So the co building was more of feature and function in regards to the things that they needed. And of course, like we wanted to listen to what they had to say, because we obviously saw these businesses growing.</p>
<p>And it’s a unique position to be in because we’re helping them build their business. And what a great position to be in where you’re working with your customer and seeing their business grow. And you’re either supporting their card business or you are their card business.</p>
<p>So that symbiotic relationship is just really, really tight.</p>
<p>Seema: Did you say no to certain customers and say, Hey, wait, or did you kind of keep them warm in some way?</p>
<p>Jason: We said no, we said wait. Uh, and we kept them warm. Some went to other technology providers. They eventually came back to us, because we couldn’t keep up with the demand. We just found, and the team was like getting crushed. Like we were working seven days a week, 12 to 14 hours a day.</p>
<p>We became just really stressed around the business. And we just couldn’t keep the high quality that we wanted to keep and then be able to build the business at the same time. And we were doing great in revenue. We doubled revenue every year since 2015.</p>
<p>And we thought we were doing really well. So we decided that, you know, some customers were just going to say no to because we don’t want to fail them. And more importantly, we don’t want to fail our existing customers. Instacart and DoorDash are still our customers today. Uber Eats and Uber still our customers today.</p>
<p>That proves not only our customer service and our technology, but the strength of those relationships that we’ve maintained over time. And we felt that we couldn’t fail them and fail these new customers coming in at the same time.</p>
<p>Seema: Yeah, you don’t want to have churn, you want to build up a really good reputation in the market. And then that’s a obviously really important beacon to pull in more customers in the category and uses case studies even in other categories I can imagine as well.</p>
<p>Jason: I always felt like if we’re going to be a really good technology provider, we need to become virtually welded to our customers. We’re so tightly intertwined with them. Like we become like an appendage or an organ, like we need to be supporting their business in a way. Where they can’t go to somebody else because we’re so good at what we do.</p>
<p>They wouldn’t think about leaving us and going with another technology provider. And that, I believe, is still in the culture today. Like when someone calls, pick up the phone, someone texts, return the text. When someone emails and you email them and do it as soon as you possibly can. But if they text you like five minutes to an hour, respond.</p>
<p>And I’ve always found when you’re working in a business like this, where you’re either supporting the core business or you are the core business. Those response times are really, really important to building a trusting relationship. Yeah. And so, you know, when you say welded to the customer, is it mostly around just being super responsive or, you know, you, we also talked about like responding to their, you know, their product and either the, you know, responding to the pull you’re getting anything else that you did to really feel like you were quote unquote welded to the customer user products.</p>
<p>Like that was really important to us. Like I have my, my wallet and phone are full of our customers cards and I use them and I give them feedback on their products. Um, understand like who was your counterpart over there and that’s your business partner. Your job is to make them successful and how you make them successful.</p>
<p>Is responding and listening and, you know, if they need something, give them, you know, are potentially we’re going to deliver it in this quarter or we’re not going to deliver that or we’re going to deliver that maybe sometime next year, but things are going to change. Like don’t stress them out, make sure that they have everything they need to be successful.</p>
<p>And that’s the sign of a good business partner. Don’t make it just a transaction. If you want to make it just a transaction, then this is probably not the company you should be working for.</p>
<p>Seema: I’d love to transition a little bit into pricing and how you thought about that in the early days, because that’s a question that comes up a ton.</p>
<p>Jason: So the payment card industry has been around for a long time, and there’s already methods in regards to how, which is interesting is companies come to us to make money like we pay them in the very early days.</p>
<p>We didn’t do that because we, we were a new product. Like we didn’t know exactly how to go sell it. It wasn’t like a DoorDash or someone else was going to a bank and said, you know, I’m Instacart. I do grocery delivery. I mean, typically I remember when we got Instacart up and running, we talked to our bank.</p>
<p>And their response was literally, why would somebody want their groceries delivered? Like, it wasn’t, it wasn’t anything about like the cart or what they’re trying to accomplish. It was like, what a crazy business model. You California people are out of your minds. So in the early days, like they were, we weren’t sharing their revenue because we didn’t know what the business model would look like.</p>
<p>And then eventually, when we are really understanding of how do we create this symbiotic relationship based on how the current card market worked, we decided let’s start paying our customer based on volume, they deliver more volume to us, they make more money, and obviously that is a very high gross margin for them because they’re basically no infrastructure that they need to pay for.</p>
<p>It’s us. We get a portion of that, we split it, but this became, you know, a pretty great revenue stream for that. And in the early days, we didn’t know that sort of ignorance was bliss in regards to our revenue goals, but we found that within the card market that we needed to begin sharing back. And then that happened actually pretty fast.</p>
<p>And then obviously today, our customers, we pay that based on the volume of how many transactions are flowing through our system. And then we pay them based on that volume.</p>
<p>Seema: In the early days, were you thinking about the unit economics and what this might look like in the future? Or were you just saying, let’s get this product in folks hands, we know this works and let’s go from there?</p>
<p>Jason: I’m a product person at heart. And I care more about the product and the product market fit. I didn’t focus on the revenue in the beginning at all. Like it was important and we kind of knew what the moneymaking machine would look like, but I always felt that like, we need to build a great product and we need to have users that adopt that product.</p>
<p>We need to respond to them. And once we have that strong product market fit and we understand what the story is going to look like and the value of providing. Let’s figure out how to monetize that value. And that’s what we did. So we didn’t, we didn’t know what the unit economics would look like.</p>
<p>Obviously we had forecasts and the things that we were looking to get done, but the product became paramount to everything that we’re doing. I feel like if we decided in the very early days, like, let’s just build a product that go make money, we would have made terrible, terrible decisions. But if you’re looking to build a great product and have product market fit and then have revenue follow that based on the value you’re selling, um, that’s where we got it.</p>
<p>So we didn’t. We began to sort of 2017 was really kind of understand what we wanted to do in regards to revenue, and we still essentially have that same revenue model today. Uh, some things have changed, but, but demonstrably that’s the revenue you see, the revenue model you see today was the same one as back then.</p>
<p>Seema: The other area I wanted to touch on next was around team. You touched on this initial go-to-market team that you had, how you thought about sort of staffing up an initial go-to-market team?</p>
<p>Jason: Well, the core team was the original executive team. We had different roles and responsibilities in regards to talking with a customer and working with the customer. So, in the early days, you really can’t hand that off to an employee. They don’t have the incentive like you have when you’re building a business.</p>
<p>I mean, it’s really feast or famine. So, you want to go out and you want a customer, potential customer to see like the fire coming out of your eyeballs. Like, Marqeta is a fait accompli, like the train has left the station and You can join us and help. We can help you scale your business, or you can go with an inferior solution.</p>
<p>And that is going to, you know, not be great for your business. And eventually you were coming back to us. We didn’t sell in an obnoxious way, but we sold as if this was the solution, the be all end all solution for their business.</p>
<p>Seema: The next thing I wanted to touch on was feedback you learned through these initial set of customers and let’s say in food delivery, and then how you translated that into scaling up, and acquiring your additional verticals into other sets of customers. How did you sort of think about transitioning from food delivery into the subsequent verticals?</p>
<p>Jason: I think it was the first Money20/ 20 we’re in Europe. We’re sitting down with Klarna and they’re talking about onboarding merchants. So a lot of times in the early days of on-demand delivery, it took a lot of work for the merchant to go integrate together. So we need to figure out a way to sort of help the on-demand delivery companies onboard merchants much, much faster.</p>
<p>And how we did that was, it’s a card that’s already linking to the point of sale device. This goes back to sort of the original plan with, you know, Groupon’s on a card. So we knew the merchant, we could send them the data and then they can authorize or decline those transactions.</p>
<p>So that’s where we were like, Oh, this is actually another great use case. And let’s just go focus on on-demand delivery companies. And we are now the, you know, the probably the largest provider of card technology solutions to buy now pay later (BNPL) companies around the world.</p>
<p>So that was really the second one that probably ran into was just capacity. Like we saw Instacart and Uber Eats and Postmates and DoorDash, just their businesses were scaling so fast. And we were constantly trying to keep up to capacity. And then we’re like, Oh, wow. We’re going to add another vertical one.</p>
<p>We did that. And then we began to land a bunch of other customers, like Affirm.</p>
<p>Seema: So how did you pick BNPL as vertical number 2?</p>
<p>Jason: I think that it was the magic. It was just being in, I think it was in Copenhagen at the time as where the Money20/20 first started. It was talking to their CTO and team at the time.</p>
<p>And understanding, you know, what were the problems that they were facing and then like, just having sort of that vision match at a table and saying, I know how to do this for you. And let me, let me sort of lay this out of what I’m thinking in regards to how we go and accomplish this. And just to watch them light up.</p>
<p>Seema: I don’t know if this was intentional, but the food delivery was taking off as you were working with them. And then BNPL, I’d imagine you right around that time was starting to take off as well. So you kind of caught that, that tailwind for both of you to grow together. And I don’t know if that was premeditated, but it certainly worked out well.</p>
<p>Jason: I mean, I think we would all like to think it was premeditated. We were just really lucky at picking the right verticals at the right time. And then even, Square at the time, now Block and their cash app, they wanted to go build a card to help individuals who were sent money to move that money off.</p>
<p>Our opportunity to work with Square was amazing. And we thought, I don’t know if this is going to be a big product or not. And they didn’t even think at the time it was going to be a big product. And then obviously that completely blew away all of our predictions in regards to how Cash App would go and build.</p>
<p>And now it’s one of the largest debit programs in the world. So we’re both lucky in regards to finding the right partners and the right verticals. But I also think we’re very skilled at building the right technology and products and harnessing the power of what these businesses want to go build and fulfilling their vision around delivering this technology.</p>
<p>Seema: Would love to hear any advice that you have for early stage founders, either things you’ve learned or something you would guide your earlier self around.</p>
<p>Jason: I think it’s a several things. I think number one is you’re not special, like whatever you’re dealing with is not unique. There has been thousands of other entrepreneurs, both technology companies and small businesses that have run into exactly what you’ve run into. So, you know, dial a friend, you can reach out to me. You can reach out to others who have been through this at like different types of scale and different types of problems.</p>
<p>Everybody has dealt with it. You’re going to get lots of different advice. You’ve got to choose what’s, what’s the best path for you. Number 2 is focus on your product. Like product market fit is primary. Without product market fit, you have nothing. So in the early days is like really focus on your customers.</p>
<p>And if you can find one customer that really wants to work with you and really wants to buy you, treat them like gold, like make them family. And deliver and respond to make sure that they become a referenceable customer as you go build your business. And number 3 is, is just really hire the right people at the right time.</p>
<p>There were times that we scaled up in areas that we didn’t really need at the time. It was a strategy of hope. We hope that this becomes something that you really need because you can kind of see it. And we made poor investment decisions in those areas. Number 4 is, when you’re raising money, find people who understand your business.</p>
<p>And even if they say no to you now, still accept the no. And it’s great. Like I love them. No. Okay. No, but why? And they would share why and you just stay in touch with them, send them an email once a month. Say this is the success that we’re finding because eventually they’re going to invest in your business.</p>
<p>I can go on more and more, but I think those are kind of the 4 primary of going in and building a business successfully.</p>

<p>The conversation explores how AI advancements can revolutionize traditional healthcare models by enhancing efficiency, personalizing care journeys, and integrating real-time data insights. Mario also discusses “benefit-less” benefit designs, where healthcare plans learn from and adapt to individual consumer patterns, at least theoretically leading to the holy grail of better health outcomes and cost savings.</p>

<p>Multi-signature structures have been around for a while and are securing billions of euros in digital assets. But how do they work? And what are the main differences with a simple single-signature structure?</p>



<p>In this article we will discuss what multi-signature structures are, the use cases of multi-signature structures, and how multi-signature structures work.</p>



 What is a multi-signature structure? 



<p>In essence, a multi-signature structure is a key security feature employed within the blockchain ecosystem to ensure that specific actions require the approval and cooperation of multiple parties before they can be executed. Unlike signatures in the physical world, signatures on a blockchain are performed using digital keys belonging to a certain party.</p>



<p>Instead of relying on a single digital signature, a multi-signature structure mandates that a predefined number of authorised signatures need to happen before a transaction can be executed.</p>



<p>It is important to note that in certain cases a multi-signature structure may also refer to a structure in which an action may require only one signature but has multiple parties that can authorise this action.</p>



 Why multi-signature structures are essential 



<p>But why would anyone use a multi-signature structure in the first place? The answer is simple: security. In a digital ecosystem in which certain actions can not be undone, it is crucial that the integrity and security of these transactions is guaranteed. A multi-signature structure adds an additional security layer to the blockchain ecosystem and addresses some of the security risks of single-signature structures.</p>



 Security risks of single-signature structures 



<p>Single-signature structures, where a single key holder can perform certain actions, are susceptible to various security risks and challenges, such as:</p>



 
 Single point of failure: A single compromised key, whether due to theft, hacking, or human error, can lead to unauthorised access and the loss of digital assets. High-profile hacks and cryptocurrency thefts, such as the infamous Mt. Gox hack in 2014, have often resulted from this single point of failure, putting significant amounts of wealth at risk. 



 Lack of accountability: In a single-signature system, the responsibility and accountability for transactions and decisions rest solely on the key holder. This setup can lead to abuse of power, lack of transparency, and difficulties in tracing fraudulent or unauthorised activities. 



 Loss of keys: The loss of a single private key can result in permanent loss of access to digital assets, which is a common and irreversible issue in the cryptocurrency space. A multi-signature structure can help prevent this while also increasing security. 
 



 Use cases of multi-signature structures 



<p>As is clear from the above, single-signature structures are simple and convenient but can carry significant security risks. Multi-signature structures can address some of these risks in the following ways in various domains:</p>



 
 Secure transactions: Multi-signature structures in wallets, accounts, or smart contracts are used to secure cryptocurrency transactions, requiring the approval of multiple key holders. This approach significantly reduces the risk of unauthorised or fraudulent transactions. 



 Governance: In corporate environments, multi-signature structures can ensure checks and balances by requiring multiple key holders to approve important actions like financial transactions, board resolutions, or contract agreements. Furthermore, they can be useful for any decentralised multi-party decision-making, such as in DAOs or for blockchain governance. 



 Escrow services: Multi-signature escrow accounts keep financial transactions safe, especially in complex deals. Funds are only released when certain conditions are met. Several key holders must agree, ensuring that the deal terms are followed. This adds an extra layer of security and trust in financial transactions, reducing the chances of disputes and fraud. 



 Custody services: Cryptocurrency custodians and exchanges use multi-signature structures to protect customer assets from threats, including insiders and hackers. With multi-signature wallets, access to assets is controlled by a group of key holders (and often third parties for added security). This makes it tough for a single person to access or manipulate the assets without approval. 



 Legal and compliance: Multi-signature structures are important for legal and compliance processes in the digital world. They ensure that multiple parties must agree on actions like signing contracts or complying with regulations. This reduces legal risks and makes sure these procedures are done correctly. Multi-signature structures promote transparency and security in legal and regulatory matters. 



 Emergency recovery: Multi-signature wallets can act as an emergency recovery mechanism, allowing access to digital assets in case of the loss of one key holder, enhancing the security of digital holdings. 
 



 Why is blockchain needed? 



<p>However, why wouldn’t you use more traditional signature-collection methods? In comparison to traditional methods like multiple Docusign signatures, blockchain offers distinct advantages, particularly in transparency, execution speed, and versatility. Docusign, while efficient for collecting signatures, lacks transparency and doesn’t tie actions directly to signing. It merely signifies approval without immediate execution.</p>



<p>Contrastingly, blockchain’s strength lies in its inherent transparency; each approval is linked to an immediate and irreversible execution of the proposed action. Whether it’s a transaction or a governance proposal, blockchain ensures swift and transparent execution, fostering trust among parties involved. Moreover, Docusign doesn’t provide flexibility in assigning different weights or thresholds for signing. Blockchain, on the other hand, offers versatile permission settings, enabling the establishment of varying levels of authorization. This flexibility extends beyond simple signature collection, making blockchain an invaluable tool for diverse transactional and governance needs within enterprises and across various industries.</p>



 How multi-signature structures work 



<p>Multi-signature structures can be created in multiple ways, such as via account systems, smart contracts, and wallets. While the set-up process for each of these ways can differ, these multi-signature structures all function in a similar way. In order to explain how multi-signature structures work, we will explain multi-signature structures using an account system that can be found on popular blockchains such as <a href="https://eosnetwork.com/">EOS</a>, <a href="https://www.wax.io/">WAX</a>, and <a href="https://xprnetwork.org/">XPR</a>.</p>



 Understanding account systems 



<p>Unlike blockchains like Bitcoin or Ripple which use a single keypair for all transactions, an account system has two different permissions. Permissions can be seen as requirements that need to be fulfilled in order for a transaction to go through. Each permission has certain actions associated with it. A default account has 2 native permissions, namely:</p>



 
 Owner: Shows ownership of the account and is needed to make any changes to the ownership of the account. 



 Active: Used for transferring funds, voting for validators, and making other high-level account changes. 
 



<p>Each permission has one or more key(s) associated with it. Each key associated with a permission has a certain weight, and each permission has a certain weight threshold which needs to be met before a transaction requiring that permission is accepted. This is how an account system works.</p>



 Single-signature structure 



<p>The default structure for these accounts is always a single signature structure. But what does that mean?</p>







<p>As can be seen in the image above, the owner permission has a default threshold of 1, and 1 key with a weight of 1 associated with it. The same goes for the active permission which has a default threshold of 1, and 1 key with a weight of 1 associated with it. This means that only the (private) key associated with the owner or active permission is required to perform any transaction requiring the owner or active permission, respectively.</p>



<p>In essence, similar to a Bitcoin address, only 1 signature is required to perform any action on this account. This is a single-signature structure.</p>



 Multi-signature structure 



<p>Multi-signature accounts function similarly to default accounts, the main difference between the two is the permissions structure. In a default account all permissions have a threshold of 1 and only have 1 key with a weight of 1 associated with it, whereas the permissions in a multi-signature account have a threshold of 2 or higher and have multiple keys or permissions of other accounts with (possibly) varying weights associated with them. This also means that multiple keys or account permissions will have to sign any transaction from the multi-signature account.</p>







<p>An example of a possible permissions structure in a multi-signature account can be seen in the image above. Just like the default account described earlier, this account has both the owner and active permission.</p>



<p>However, the owner permission in this multi-signature account has a threshold of 3 and has 3 keys associated with it: The active key from John’s account, which has a weight of 2, the active key from Bob’s account, which has a weight of 1 and the active key from Stacy’s account, which also has a weight of 1. This means that to execute any transaction requiring the owner permission, both John’s active key and either Bob’s or Stacy’s active key would have to sign the transaction before it can be executed.</p>



<p>The active permission in this multi-signature account has a threshold of 2 and has 3 keys associated with it. The active key from John’s account, which has a weight of 1, the active key from Bob’s account, which has a weight of 1 and the active key from Stacy’s account, which also has a weight of 1. This means that to execute any transaction requiring the active permission (any combination) of 2 of the active keys would have to sign the transaction before it can be executed.</p>



<p>Multi-signature structures like these can be configured in any way, with as many participants as needed, for any goal, ranging from security to governance.</p>



<p>Lastly, it is important to note that in these account systems, or smart contracts, custom permissions can be created for certain actions, such as voting, staking, etc. In order to keep the other permissions separate and secure.</p>

<p>Homo- (Greek prefix meaning ‘same’); -morphic (Greek suffix meaning ‘having a specific shape/form’)<br>Intuitively, one could deduct that homomorphic encryption indicates that the initial data and the encrypted result (cipher) could share the same form. Based on this property, it can be inferred that computation can be performed on the encrypted data, without prior decryption. By decrypting the result, you get the same output as the computation performed on the unencrypted data. While homomorphic encryption can be either additive or multiplicative, fully homomorphic encryption supports both types of operations. Unlike ZKPs, which are proofs of computational integrity, fully homomorphic encryption allows for encrypted data computation, without revealing additional information about the original data. This could provide the missing link for ensuring private transactions on blockchains’ public ledgers.</p><p>We were joined by Rand Hindi, CEO of Zama, to discuss fully homomorphic encryption solutions, how they differ from ZKPs &amp; MPC, and how they can be leveraged to ensure compliant programmable privacy.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Rand’s background and his interest in privacy  Meeting Pascal and founding Zama  Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)  Zero knowledge proofs vs. Multi-party computation vs. Fully homomorphic encryption  Taking fully homomorphic encryption 'mainstream'  Zama’s products  fhEVM  How multi-party computation would secure fhEVM  Multi-key homomorphic encryption &amp; functional encryption  Deploying an FHE rollup  FHE use cases  Privacy  Zama’s business model  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/randhindi">Rand Hindi on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/zama_fhe">Zama on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/FhenixIO">Fhenix on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  dYdX Foundation: The recently launched dYdX chain features new governance and token economics, that empower stakers and promote validator decentralisation.

 ZenIP 42206 is open for voting. All ZEN holders have until 11/23/2023 00:00 AM UTC (11/22/2023 7:00 PM ET) to cast their vote via <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0xc4bc560e7a88348b98ab5c4aa57f847169713cf9280ff164d72302b78d1ae4f2">Snapshot</a>. 
<br>
<p>We’ve noticed that regardless of the voting instructions and documentation that have been provided and positive sentiment towards this proposal, some of the community members may be still experiencing technical difficulties in the voting process. </p>
<p>We have identified four blockers that may be preventing some community members from being able to vote easily. </p>
<p>Here are the solutions for each of these blockers:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 1) Voting from a multi-sig wallet 
<p>If you have ZEN on a multi-sig wallet, you are not able to link it to Horizen EON as this is currently not supported. Multi-sig wallet users can still vote by proving the ownership of their wallet that contains ZEN. Follow these steps:</p>
<br>
 
 You have until the last block before 11/22/2023 08:00 PM UTC (11/22/2023 3:00 PM ET) to send a transaction of 100 zatoshi (0.00001 $ZEN) to this address znmJjX4QyLeZJFawTCP35T7tqfdhNQMNZEJ (Horizen faucet) with the multisignature address you’d like to link. 
 <a href="https://forms.gle/fC24DFkMjPZiZu3dA">Submit this form </a>to claim your multi-sig wallet address before 11/22/2023 09:00PM UTC (11/22/2023 4:00PM ET). 
 Right after that, we will collect, share and apply the allowlist of multi-sig wallets eligible to vote. 
 







 2) Voting from a non-Sphere wallet 



<p>If you have your ZEN in a wallet other than Sphere, such as Arizen or a hard wallet, you can sign a message right from the application/hardware wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your wallet doesn’t support signing custom messages, you can paste your private key at <a href="https://getzen.cash/sign/">https://getzen.cash/sign/</a>, and produce the signature. The procedure is the following:</p>



<p></p>



<p>Paste your private key making sure you are in a private location.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Paste your EON wallet address, and press on “Sign”.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Copy the signature you have generated.</p>



<p>Then head over to <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">the linking page to link your wallet to Horizen EON</a>.</p>



<p>NOTE: Make sure no one can look at your screen, you may expose your private key. Do it at your own risk.</p>



 3) Voting with ZEN staked on a Horizen Node 



<p>If you have ZEN staked on a Horizen node, you can just sign the message with the command:</p>



<p>zen-cli signmessage %ZEN_ADDRESS% “%YOUR_EON_ACCOUNT%”</p>



<p>Then head over to <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">the linking page to link your wallet to Horizen EON</a></p>



 4) Voting with ZEN stored on an exchange&nbsp; 



<p>Unfortunately, there isn’t a way to vote using a ZEN balance that is stored on an exchange at the moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NOTE: miners may experience a discrepancy between the balance available on the explorer and the one available as voting power. That’s because the new Coinbase output is not seen until it’s involved in the first transaction.</p>

<p></p><p>London, 20th November 2023 – The GBBC Digital Finance (GDF) team led engagements around the world last week. Whilst our policy team and Chair of the Board soft-launched GDF’s Digital Finance All-Party Parliamentary Group in London at Digital Assets Week, GDF CEO, Emma Joyce and GDF Head of Community, Madeleine Boys, made their way to Asia to join many industry leaders, regulators, and policymakers at Singapore FinTech Festival (SFF).</p>
<p>As a prelude to the Festival, Elevandi – a not-for-profit organisation set up by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) – curated and hosted Elevandi Insights, a day of thoughtful roundtable discussions focused on digital finance. AI and Financial Inclusion were both important themes of the day, alongside tokenisation, payments, and digital financial market infrastructure as prevailing discussion topics which set the tone for SFF.</p>
<p>Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and tokenised money took the centre stage for the Festival’s payments discussions. Several panels mentioned the crucial role of interoperability in the evolution of CBDCs. Speakers also emphasised its broader application in asset tokenisation, which was highlighted from both the public and private sector – find out more from MAS’ recent <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/development/fintech/guardian/interlinking-networks-technical-paper-vfinal.pdf">“Interlinking Networks Technical Whitepaper</a>”.<br><br>Central banks examined the role of CBDCs as drivers of financial inclusion and vehicles to minimise prudential risks once the onset technological risks are overcome. Large financial institutions and private sector representatives highlighted the importance of tokenised money – whether it be in the form of a CBDC or other forms of tokenised money – as the key to settlement as well as the broader scalability of the industry.</p>
<p>Building on these discussions, MAS published the <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/development/fintech/project-orchid/orchid-blueprint-final.pdf">Orchid Blueprint</a> outlining the necessary technological infrastructure for future digital currency transactions in Singapore. This blueprint, derived from insights gained during the Project Orchid industry trials, identifies four essential building blocks to support the effective use of digital money in Singapore:</p>
 
 Settlement Ledger: This component is designed to record digital money transfers, featuring native programmability and the atomic settlement of digital tokens. 
 Tokenisation Bridge: Serving as a vital link, this bridge connects existing account-based settlement systems with ledgers that are compatible with tokenised forms of digital money. 
 Programmability Protocol: The blueprint proposes a common protocol, known as Purpose Bound Money (PBM), enabling the specification of conditions for the use of digital money. 
 Name Service: To enhance accessibility and verification, a Name Service is recommended, translating between complex wallet addresses and alternative name identifiers that are readable and meaningful. 
 
<p>The importance of resilient digital Financial Market Infrastructure (dFMI) emerged as another theme in these discussions, emphasising its role as a key enabler to the broad adoption and growth of digital assets. The value of open and interoperable networks among global banks and regulators cannot be understated, and the SFF set the scene for another major announcement in this area.</p>
<p>MAS also unveiled a significant expansion of <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2023/mas-partners-financial-industry-to-expand-asset-tokenisation-initiativeshttps:/www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2023/mas-partners-financial-industry-to-expand-asset-tokenisation-initiatives">Project Guardian</a>, which will delve into promising use cases of asset tokenisation on a public blockchain. The most significant aspect is the introduction of new initiative called Global Layer One (GL1), conceived as an open, digital infrastructure fostering cross-border transactions and global liquidity pools. Major institutions such as BNY Mellon, JP Morgan, DBS, and MUFG will participate. This marks a pivotal step toward integration across the entire capital markets value chain, encompassing listing, distribution, trading, settlement, and asset servicing. Key highlights include:</p>
 
 J.P. Morgan and Apollo are collaborating on leveraging digital assets to facilitate more seamless investment and management of discretionary portfolios and alternative assets. The collaboration also involves automated portfolio rebalancing and customization at scale, promising time savings and a reduction in manual processes related to asset servicing. 
 BNY Mellon and OCBC are engaged in a trial for a cross-border FX payment solution, aiming to facilitate secure and interoperable payment solutions across diverse networks. 
 
<p>GDF convened its members its members together on two distinct occasions, both characterised by the same positive atmosphere that resonated with the overall optimistic outlook of SFF.</p>
<p>Our dinner, which we hosted in partnership with Hogan Lovells, focused on the challenges to building digital trust, and facilitating tokenisation of real-world assets (RWAs), and the role regulators and policymakers have to play in balancing innovation with safe regulatory frameworks. Ken Coghill from the DFSA and Danny Russell from the Bank of England joined us and shared some opening remarks on behalf of their agencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our lunch, which we hosted in partnership with Clifford Chance, brought together technologists and policy experts for a comprehensive discussion on challenges and essential components for institutionalising digital assets, emphasising ongoing technical efforts to enable financial institutions to leverage public blockchain technology. Malcolm Wright, OKX and former VARA regulator, and John Ho, Standard Chartered, opened the lunch with some optimistic remarks about the&nbsp;direction of travel for industry, with a keen focus on the APAC region.</p>
<p>We could not be more grateful for the continued support of our association’s mission to promote best standards of practice for the digital asset ecosystem, and look forward to continuing to bring together and building our community in the APAC region.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Basic Attention Token announces the ‘Sage Burn’, the final mint phase of the BAT x Adam Ape for Brave NFT collection, set for December 7th, 2023. NFT holders can join this event on Bandit Network, exchanging three NFTs for a rare Sage NFT. This event kicks off a series of exciting BAT NFT collaborations with Bandit.</p>
<p>December 5th, 2023—Basic Attention Token (BAT) is thrilled to announce the “Sage Burn,” the concluding mint phase of the <a>BAT x Adam Ape Brave NFT collection, first launched in November 2022</a> on Solana. Starting on Thursday, December 7th, 2023, we invite holders of BAT x Adam Ape NFTs to participate in the Sage Burn event by <a>“burning”</a> a set of three specific NFTs—Curious, Dabbler, and Degen—to receive one of the highly exclusive Sage NFTs, featuring bespoke artwork from <a href="https://twitter.com/adam_ape_">Adam Ape</a>, and limited to just 300 pieces.</p>

The Sage</p>
<p>Bandit Network, a Web3 platform focused on developing multi-blockchain NFT minting and quests, is hosting the Sage Burn event. With their expertise in crafting engaging and accessible NFT experiences across the many networks supported in Brave Wallet, Bandit brings a fresh perspective to this project. We look forward to this being the first of many BAT NFT collaborations with Bandit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the outset, the goal of the BAT x Adam Ape NFT project has been to showcase BAT/NFT capabilities within the Solana ecosystem. During the premiere mint on November 9th, 2022, fans could purchase BAT x Adam Ape NFTs using <a href="https://solscan.io/token/EPeUFDgHRxs9xxEPVaL6kfGQvCon7jmAWKVUHuux1Tpz">Solana-wrapped BAT</a> in addition to SOL, Solana’s native cryptocurrency. The BAT and Solana NFT communities launched the mint with tremendous success, with all 2500 NFTs from the first three tiers minting within three hours.</p>
<p>For collectors and enthusiasts of Brave and Basic Attention Token, owning a Sage NFT is akin to possessing a piece of digital history. These NFTs symbolize the culmination of the first-ever cross-chain BAT NFT mint, and the inaugural BAT NFT collection launch on Solana.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For existing BAT x Adam Ape for Brave NFT owners, access to our exclusive #holders-chat and #holders-giveaways channels is available upon verification.</p>

 What does ‘burning an NFT’ entail, and is it reversible? 
<p>‘Burning an NFT’ refers to the irreversible process of permanently destroying it by transferring it to an address from which it cannot be retrieved. In the Sage Burn event, you’ll encounter several prompts to confirm your decision, emphasizing the irreversible nature of burning your NFTs. Once an NFT is burned, the action cannot be reversed.</p>


    
    

    




    
    


 Who can join the Sage Burn, and is it limited to certain regions? 
<p>Anyone worldwide can participate in the Sage Burn, as long as they possess the requisite set of NFTs.&nbsp;</p>

 Which specific NFTs are required to participate in the Sage Burn? 
<p>You must possess at least one NFT from each of the three tiers: Curious, Dabbler, and Degen. The NFTs can be purchased separately on secondary marketplaces. (See below.)&nbsp;</p>

 I missed the first phase of the mint. Can I still join the Sage Burn? 
<p>Absolutely! You can purchase BAT x Adam Ape for Brave NFTs on secondary marketplaces using Solana (SOL). These marketplaces include <a href="https://magiceden.io/marketplace/bat">Magic Eden</a>, <a href="https://hyperspace.xyz/collection/batxadamape">Hyperspace</a>, and <a href="https://www.tensor.trade/trade/bat">Tensor</a>. Acquiring a set containing a Curious, Dabbler, and Degen NFT enables you to participate in the Sage Burn event.</p>

 What do the numbers on my BAT x Adam Ape NFTs signify, and do they impact my participation in the Sage Burn? 
<p>The number on each BAT x Adam Ape NFT indicates its minting order within the collection. For instance, an NFT numbered #139 signifies it was the 139th to be minted. These numbers do not influence your eligibility for the Sage Burn. To participate, you must possess at least one NFT from each of the three tiers—Curious, Dabbler, and Degen – in your connected wallet at the time of the Burn.</p>

 Is it possible to burn multiple sets of Curious, Dabbler, and Degen NFTs to acquire several Sage NFTs? 
<p>Certainly. You have the option to burn any number of Curious, Dabbler, and Degen sets that you possess. If you own multiple NFTs from each tier, you can decide to burn only some of the sets. The choice is yours!</p>

 What if I choose not to burn my Curious, Dabbler, and Degen NFTs? 
<p>That’s completely fine! Holding onto your Curious, Dabbler, and Degen NFTs is entirely your choice. Participation in the Sage Burn is optional, and you are free to decide whether or not to take part.</p>

 Is it possible to get a Sage NFT without participating in the Sage Burn? 
<p>Certainly! After the Sage Burn event, Sage NFTs will be available for purchase on secondary NFT marketplaces.</p>

 What happens if not all 300 Sage NFTs are minted? 
<p>In the event that not all 300 Sage NFTs are minted, the outcome is a smaller circulation of these NFTs. This limited availability inherently increases the rarity of the existing Sage NFTs.</p>

 What is the total supply for each tier in the collection? 
<p>The BAT x Adam Ape for Brave NFT collection is distributed across four tiers:</p>
 
 The Curious: 1400 NFTs 
 The Dabbler: 800 NFTs 
 The Degen: 300 NFTs 
 The Sage: 300 NFTs maximum*&nbsp; 
 

 What Web3 wallet is needed to participate in the Sage Burn? 
<p>To join the Sage Burn, you can use your Brave Wallet or any other Solana DApp-compatible wallet, such as Phantom, Backpack, Solflare, and more. You can also use a hardware wallet, such as a Ledger or Trezor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please ensure that all the BAT x Adam Ape NFTs you plan to burn are consolidated in the same wallet. This wallet should be connected to Bandit Network at the time of the Burn.</p>

 Do my BAT x Adam Ape NFTs need to be in the same wallet? 
<p>All NFTs you plan to burn for the Sage Burn event must be in a single Web3 wallet. This wallet should be the one you connect to Bandit Network for participation in the Burn.</p>

 Can I use the Brave Wallet in my Brave mobile app to participate in the Sage Burn? 
<p>Absolutely. To participate, visit Bandit Network and connect using your Brave Wallet when prompted.</p>

 How can I see my NFTs in the Brave Wallet? 
<p>To view your NFTs, simply go to the NFTs tab in your Brave Wallet.</p>

 I want to sell, trade, or transfer my NFTs. Where can I do this? 
 
 To transfer an NFT: In your Brave Wallet, select the NFT you wish to transfer, click on ‘Send,’ and enter the recipient’s address. 
 To sell or trade: Visit platforms like <a href="https://magiceden.io/marketplace/bat">Magic Eden</a>, <a href="https://hyperspace.xyz/collection/batxadamape">Hyperspace</a>, or <a href="https://www.tensor.trade/trade/bat">Tensor</a>. Connect your Brave Wallet or another Solana DApp wallet to carry out the transaction. 
 

 What are wrapped tokens and what is sBAT (Solana-Wrapped BAT)? 
<p>Wrapped tokens facilitate the use of assets across different blockchains, improving functionality and interoperability. This process locks the original tokens on their native blockchain and creates an equal number of wrapped tokens on a smart-contract blockchain such as Ethereum</p>
<p>sBAT is an example of this. There are several ways to buy or bridge BAT on Solana:</p>
 
 Purchase wBAT directly in the Brave Wallet using Ramp’s fiat-to-crypto service or convert existing SOL to wBAT. 
 Bridge BAT from Ethereum to Solana using the Wormhole Bridge. 
 

 Where can I purchase SOL? 
<p>You can purchase SOL, the Solana network’s cryptocurrency, directly in the Brave Wallet using fiat or crypto via Coinbase Pay, Link by Stripe, Ramp, or other available options. Alternatively, SOL is also available on any cryptocurrency exchange that supports Solana.</p>

 When will you reveal utility for the Sage? 
<p>While there is no guarantee of added utility for the Sage at the time of the Burn, we are collaboratively exploring future options with the BAT Community. Join our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/batbrigade">BAT Brigade Discord</a> and Tuesday <a href="https://talk.brave.com/this--is--your--weekly--bat-community--call">BAT Community Calls</a> at 2pm PST/5pm EST to contribute to this ongoing process.</p>

 Deploy a bridged USDC token contract with optionality for native issuance  
<p>Permissionless composability is one of the hallmarks of Web3, contributing to the rapid growth of new applications and blockchain networks by leveraging existing open technology. Circle’s <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/usdc">USDC</a> is no exception, stemming from the innovations of the ERC-20 standard and countless third-party frameworks to become the trusted dollar-backed stablecoin that it is today.</p> 
<p>As of November 2023, USDC is issued and circulating natively on 15 blockchains – 7 more than last year – and yet it is also clear to Circle and the broader community that many more blockchains may emerge and rise to prominence over the next several years. These new blockchains could benefit significantly from having access to USDC.</p>

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>It’s time to review what Team Panther was up to last week. Here's everything that transpired at Panther last week:</p> Marketing Updates  Extension of the Advanced Staking Program <p>Advanced Staking V4 is now live for the next four months and $ZKP holders can now stake their tokens again. This was made possible due to the successful approval of PIP-19 and the commendable efforts of our <a href="https://github.com/pantherprotocol/panther-core/pull/12/commits/eb1a943766befac076922ffd5f7d1d1ceac616fa?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">community members</a> for updating related smart contracts and deploying a new frontend on IPFS. You can learn more about how to stake your $ZKP <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/staking/advanced-staking-v0.5?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a>.&nbsp;</p> Panther Protocol’s CEO, Oliver Gale, at the European Blockchain Convention <p>Panther Protocol’s Co-founder and CEO, Oliver Gale, joined a panel discussion on web3 privacy along with leaders from Secret Network and Zama at the European Blockchain Convention. This panel was part of the Secret Soiree side event on the final day of the convention. You can watch a recording of the session below.</p> Product Updates  Stage 2 Developments  Recharge Functionality <p>Making further advancements on Stage 2 of the protocol, the development of recharge functionality for Protocol Rewards has been completed and will be announced separately once the vesting of $tZKP is configured. The Recharge function is the cornerstone of the protocol’s reward system and allows protocol rewards vested on Mainnet to be injected into the reward distribution process on Polygon (viz the one-sided AMM launched in Stage 2). This dynamic interplay with the AMM pool through the Recharge function fosters active user participation while maintaining a responsive and adaptive reward structure within the protocol.&nbsp;</p><p>You can learn more about our reward structure <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/fees-and-rewards-structure/prps?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a></p> Stage 3 Developments  Circuits <p>The main transaction circuit is ready for Stage 3 and the team will perform the unit testing of the Rewards Extended Circuit and Balance Checker this week. Panther Core dApp user interface is dependent on the smart contract interactions and the circuits designed for these interactions. The design of these circuits is planned in stages to cover basic scenarios first and then move to more complex handling of input parameters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Contracts <p>The main transaction function of the Pool contract which is the foundation for the stage 3 development has been implemented. We expect to complete integration testing by this week. The Vault V1 contract was delivered earlier and is in review now.&nbsp;</p><p>UI/UX DesignA new version of Panther V1 Design is being worked on and the community should expect a brand new design work to be released as part of Stage 3.</p> Community Questions <p>When will the team publish the updated roadmap?</p><p>The team plans to release an updated product roadmap this week. </p>  About Panther <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther's zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

      The Next Billion Developers         
	By David Cahn	 





Published November 15, 2023
        The developer revolution will be as important as the AI revolution.      



 
<p>Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is Silicon Valley’s latest obsession. Brilliant minds like <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/elon-musk-reveals-xai-efforts-predicts-full-agi-by-2029/">Elon Musk</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond">Sam Altman</a> believe achieving AGI is not just likely, but inevitable. Others disagree. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yann-lecun_i-think-the-phrase-agi-should-be-retired-activity-6889610518529613824-gl2F/">Yann LeCun</a>, one of the godfathers of machine learning, has said “there is no such thing as AGI.” <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23779413/silicon-valleys-ai-religion-transhumanism-longtermism-ea">Jack Clark</a> of Anthropic has described the “breathless enthusiasm” for AGI as a “misplaced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3M2DaQxTihc">religious impulse</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a lightning rod, AGI captures our imagination. AGI promises <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/sam-altman-on-the-a-i-revolution-trillionaires/id1548604447?i=1000525043188">free education and housing</a>, the eradication of poverty with universal basic income, and a reallocation of human capital to science and art. These are worthwhile objectives.</p>



<p>But what if AGI is a distraction? What if there’s another path to this same future—one that does not require a technological leap of faith and is already underway?</p>



<p>There are more developers today than ever before. And the population is starting to snowball. Our thesis is that bringing 1B developers into the software economy could rival AGI in terms of its economic impact.1</p>



<p>Software engineering is one of the most powerful tools that humans have ever invented. If we can make it even more widely available—assisted and accelerated by AI—it could result in the automation of many non-tech industries, creating an economic surplus.</p>



<p>But is this target of 1B developers really achievable? Isn’t software engineering too hard to teach to so many people? And what would we do with all those developers?</p>



<p>Let’s start with the goal of 1B developers. This year, the developer population crossed <a href="https://github.blog/2023-11-08-the-state-of-open-source-and-ai/">100M</a>, up from 24M when Github first started reporting the metric in 2017.2 In Github’s recently published <a href="https://github.blog/2023-11-08-the-state-of-open-source-and-ai/">State of the Octoverse</a> report, they shared that the global developer population grew 26% in the last year. Github added 21M new accounts in 2022.</p>



<p>We have three reasons to believe hypergrowth in the developer population will persist.<br></p>



<p>First, it’s been getting much easier to become a developer, and we expect this flywheel to continue. In just the last decade, Cloud abstracted away the server. Databases like MongoDB and Postgres simplified the back-end. Vercel and React reshaped the front-end. The best software engineers continue to focus on improving the discipline itself. By iteratively building better and better abstractions, software engineers have created a flywheel that reduces complexity while increasing potency. As a result, a 12 year-old in India can now build a web app in a matter of days, something that would have taken a professional developer weeks before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, market forces continue to attract more and more young people to become software engineers. Already, the best and brightest are disproportionately learning to code. Rather than dampening as more talent has entered the field, the economic returns to software engineering only seem to be expanding. What this means is that the productivity of software engineers, and the applicability of their skills, is expanding faster than the supply.</p>



<p>Third, AI has been an unanticipated accelerator. Today, <a href="https://github.blog/2023-02-14-github-copilot-for-business-is-now-available/">Github Copilot</a> is writing 46% of users’ code. <a href="https://zapier.com/ai">Zapier</a> enables developers to build automations with text descriptions. <a href="https://openinterpreter.com/">Open Interpreter</a> is turning the command line into a chat interface. With AI copilots, we may eventually be able to program computers using natural language alone.</p>



<p>Growth in the developer population enables the software economy to broaden its scope and impact. For example, companies like Stripe, Twilio and Plaid have created essential building blocks for payments, telecommunications and banking. Traditional companies in mature industries are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/18/despite-mass-layoffs-led-by-meta-its-still-hard-to-fill-tech-jobs.html">bringing on</a> more and more software engineers to drive internal digitization. Newer startups are also taking software and AI and applying these technologies to sectors like mining, robotics, construction, accounting and legal. The opportunity with 1B developers is to drive automation not just in the digital economy, but in the physical economy as well.</p>



<p>Unlike AGI, the promise of 1B developers is not about eliminating work altogether. Rather, it is about taking our resources—human resources—and leveraging them to have more and more impact. Thus, the story of the coming decades may be about the increased power of AI. But more quietly, the methodical march of the developer revolution will continue.&nbsp;</p>

 <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/replit-remix-the-internet">Amjad Masad</a> was one of the first visionaries to articulate this goal and has been at its forefront

      Finding Her Place in the Sun         
	By Harry Spitzer	 



Published November 14, 2023
        Lynn Jurich’s unwavering determination to unlock cleaner, greener energy powered the rise of Sunrun.      



 
<p>In March 2023, solar entrepreneur Lynn Jurich took the stage for the Stanford Graduate School of Business’s Climate, Business &amp; Innovation Summit. In the 15 years that had passed since she had attended the school herself, solar energy had come of age.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the first time in history, the cost of solar energy has fallen below that of fossil fuels, and Sunrun, which Jurich co-founded in 2007, is now the largest installer of residential solar panels in the U.S., with more than 800,000 customers in 20 states plus D.C. and Puerto Rico. Her unwavering determination to change energy infrastructure (and the world) is what brought Jurich back to GSB that day. But these achievements, and the survival of her company, were never a given.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jurich took her audience back to Sunrun’s early days, to a time when consumer solar was still the wheelhouse of “hippies and hobbyists,” and installation and hardware were expensive. Back then, Jurich and her co-founders had waded through the complexities of the green energy space without a clear sense for how to make their business model, much less the world, sustainable. And they were perilously close to burning through their venture capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our initial vision was that we would be pretty asset-light,” Jurich told the audience. “The existing solar installers out there would be doing the construction and selling to homeowners. We would raise the capital, and own and monitor the systems. So we’d only need a few employees. But we were wrong. Very, very wrong.”</p>



 



<p>The sun had already set, but the teenage Jurich refused to go back inside without sinking a few more shots. She wouldn’t feel content calling it a day until she was, according to her sister Tracy, “basically shooting NBA free-throw percentages.” Focus, which in this case earned Jurich a spot on the Pac-10 recruiting list for basketball by 8th grade, had been Jurich’s speciality since kindergarten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At five years old, Jurich had started writing to-do lists. “My list would be like, ‘invent something.’ Or, ‘make a scientific discovery,’” she remembers. At age six, reading biographies became her pastime of choice, an activity that suited her introverted nature. She’d go to the public library in her neighborhood near Point Defiance, a lush peninsula jutting into the Puget Sound, and work her way through their nonfiction section. She had lots of things she wanted to accomplish, and was looking for proofs of concept. “I was always attracted to people who mastered their craft,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her early favorites centered on strong women: Florence Nightingale, Betsy Ross, Anne Frank. But fittingly, no biography captivated her more than that of Thomas Edison, inventor of the lightbulb (and 1,000 or so other things). In a prescient 1931 exchange between Edison and Henry Ford, Edison notes, “We should be using nature’s inexhaustible sources of energy—sun, wind and tide.” (According to recent sources, the sun produces enough sunlight to power Earth’s electricity needs for a year every hour.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But truly mastering one’s craft was no easy feat—Jurich had internalized this from her biography obsession. It required resolve and concentration, which Jurich maintained through high school and then college at Stanford, where she earned top honors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After graduating, Jurich landed a competitive role at a prestigious private equity firm. Her job was to get in front of entrepreneurs by any means necessary—cold-calling, attending the same conferences as them, befriending their assistants so that she could sit next to them on a plane—and evaluate them for potential investment opportunities. This was daunting for the self-described “strong introvert,” but once she worked up the nerve she found that pushing herself had an important upside. Like her biography kick on steroids, she got to observe dozens of highly accomplished individuals modeling potential paths to success, an experience that made it clear to her that “if there’s a good company out there, it’s going to get funded.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>After three years working on the investor side, she needed no further proof of concept. “It was just very clear to me that I wanted to be on the entrepreneur side,” says Jurich. This hard-earned clarity led her to return to Stanford for business school.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>“How do we get people to give solar a shot?” It was January 2007, and this was the question Jurich, Ed Fenster, a Stanford GSB classmate, and Nat Kreamer, a childhood friend of Fenster’s, had been debating for weeks over pizza and Diet Coke in the living room of Fenster’s San Francisco apartment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They’d filed the paperwork for their company Sunrun just a few days earlier, officially making this question of particular interest for the group. Jurich was fresh off a summer banking internship in Shanghai, where she had been struck by the density of construction and urban energy infrastructure. She couldn’t stop thinking about clean energy and how to make continued infrastructure development more sustainable. Kreamer was recently back from a tour in Afghanistan and motivated to seek energy independence after fighting in a war he’d concluded was mostly about fossil fuels. Fenster had connected the dots, uniting the team in his apartment to solve the challenge of solar expansion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fueled by cheesy carbohydrates and artificial sweetener, they concluded that the real opportunity lay not in developing cleantech, but in deploying it. “We saw that VC money was already being put toward making solar panels cheaper. We were quite certain that innovation was going to happen,” says Jurich. “So we thought, ‘Why don’t we solve the problem of convincing people to give solar panels a shot, and figuring out how to interface with the electric grid?’ That was gonna be the bigger challenge and the bigger area to add value.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer they settled on was to lower the barrier to solar adoption as much as possible for homeowners. Sunrun would offer ‘solar-as-a-service,’ leasing solar panels with a small upfront cost at a time when owning and installing one’s own solar panels was still logistically challenging, and prohibitively expensive for many. “The business model innovation was that we would put solar panels on your rooftop for very little money, and you would sign a 20-year contract to buy the electricity from us for X cents per kilowatt hour,” says Jurich. “So it was a long-term contract for us, the customer didn’t have to spend the money up front, and they could get cheaper power. Win-win all the way around.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Going the consumer route, as opposed to leasing solar panels to corporations, was an added challenge, however. It meant figuring out how to install and operate panels on houses of all shapes and sizes in varying conditions around the country. But if they could manage all of that, Jurich believed this approach would ultimately make a more defensible business. “We believed costs would hit grid parity first at the consumer level because consumers pay the most money for power,” says Jurich.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By narrowing their focus to homeowners, the founders were actually thinking bigger—not only would they be spreading clean energy, they could reduce inefficiencies in energy infrastructure. “What’s really innovative about solar is you can use an existing roof,” says Jurich. “You don’t have to acquire land. You don’t have to build big transmission lines. You don’t have to interrupt the ecosystem.” The value prop and climate impact seemed undeniable. They’d soon find out it wasn’t such an easy sell.&nbsp;</p>
 







 
<p>Jurich’s voice was hoarse from hollering at passersby. This was her third county fair in as many days, dusty and hot, and a far cry from her time in private equity traveling on private jets (which, at least on an environmental level, felt like karmic justice). Again, Jurich had found herself in the challenging situation of having to talk to strangers. This time, Jurich was donning her company swag (an oversized white tee that read, “A penny for your watts?”) and standing next to an oversized pumpkin. She was desperate to make a sale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fenster, they decided early on, would take the role of CEO and focus on raising capital; Kreamer, as president, would take on installations, billing, and system monitoring; and it was up to Jurich as COO to build out their business pipeline (read: sales). She had deduced that the quickest way to sell consumers on solar panels was to go straight to the source. “This was 2007. There weren’t a lot of people online searching, you know, ‘I want a solar energy system,’” says Jurich. “So we were like, ‘Where do you find a homeowner who would be interested in Sunrun?’ I decided to go to places with lots of homes and lots of sun.”</p>



<p>From the rare fair-goer who agreed to chat, Jurich gleaned that “going green” still wasn’t enough—they were willing to consider solar only if it saved them money. Even after Sunrun’s upfront costs (initially about $10,000 for installs, still well below the cost of buying and installing one’s own panels), Sunrun would save them money, but only over the course of years—a commitment most consumers weren’t willing to make with a startup that had existed for just a few months. “What I always told them was, ‘If someone came to your house and said they would install a gasoline tank, and you could buy gas for $1 per gallon for the next 20 years, would you do it? That’s what we’re offering: Electricity at a fixed price for 20 years and it’s cheaper,’” says Jurich. “People thought it was too good to be true.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After dozens of refusals, Jurich finally caught the attention of a woman named Sue who ran a trucking company. Jurich made her pitch, highlighting the fixed, long-term rate, which was much lower than traditional electrical costs. She told Sue that Sunrun would own, operate and maintain the solar panels on her roof, but that they outsourced sales and installation to existing solar installers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sue, excited to bet on a young female entrepreneur, was convinced. And Jurich, after months in the summer heat hawking her solar wares, made her third sale (Sunrun’s first sale was to Fenster, and the second was to his therapist). “Seeing that there was actually consumer interest in this helped me so much,” says Jurich, “It gave me the conviction that this was gonna work, that all the hustle was worth it. That conviction can get you through some pretty hard times.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hard times turned out to be just around the corner, and she’d need all the conviction she could muster.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>“We’re done for,” Jurich thought as she read the headlines announcing the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Bank. It was September 2008, and Sunrun was desperately in need of funding—money that suddenly seemed entirely unattainable.</p>



<p>Sunrun’s early sales had put its business model to the test. Since the company was covering most of the upfront purchase and installation costs, its ability to sell was contingent upon its ability to raise money. But banks wanted proof of sales before lending. “We had a chicken and an egg problem,” says Jurich. The co-founders were forced to use their seed money—a few million they’d managed to raise from contacts in private equity and banking—to finance their earliest installs. But with dwindling funds and no guarantee that they could secure investments to stay afloat, “it made for an extremely stressful time,” Jurich says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They had finally managed to raise $12 million in June 2008, a lifeline as sales were starting to take off—but nothing close to what they needed to scale. Just as new term sheets began to come their way, Lehman Brothers went under, signaling a complete collapse of the financing ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every day, another bank pulled out of negotiations. Sunrun’s point of contact would be fired, or the entire financial institution would dissolve. But then, in November 2008, there came a flicker of hope. The Sunrun founders received a callback from U.S. Bank, the rare financial institution that hadn’t been decimated by the collapse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Knowing this was likely their only shot, the founders negotiated a deal they hoped would be hard to refuse. “We were panicking,” Jurich says. “But at the same time, we were like ‘We are going to close this deal because we have no choice.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In late 2008, Sunrun closed a $40 million debt financing round from U.S. Bank. “Looking back, we call this moment our big awakening,” Jurich says. Fenster agrees. “Had we not gotten that deal,” he says, “the company might not have made it another four months.”</p>



 



<p>Six years after bringing Sunrun back from the brink, Jurich’s sense of solar inevitability was feeling like less of a moonshot with every passing day. For one, Sequoia became a believer (and led Sunrun’s Series C), as did traditional energy giant, PG&amp;E, who had invested an additional $100 million to finance installations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Which isn’t to say things were entirely sunny. Solar gaining traction threatened most other incumbent utilities, who did all they could to block Sunrun’s growth through lobbying. And then there were the government subsidies—hugely positive in the ways they pushed growth in a sustainable direction, but wildly destabilizing from a business perspective, with one subsidy or regulation unlocking a market one month, and an expiring subsidy making another disappear the next.</p>



<p>In 2009, the Obama stimulus package extended a solar tax credit to homeowners who bought their own system. This lowered the purchase price of solar panels overall, which made it harder for Sunrun to convince homeowners to buy into their leasing model, in particular paying for the company’s upfront installation costs. “That blew up our whole transaction model,” says Fenster. Jurich and Fenster, by then co-CEOs (Kreamer left the company in 2009), decided they needed to eliminate upfront costs entirely in order to remain competitive. To compensate, they increased their new customers’ monthly payments while still managing to stay below traditional utility rates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their new no-upfront pricing structure made it easier than ever for homeowners to give solar a shot, but not enough to edge out their competition. Elon Musk’s SolarCity had just gone public and was starting to outpace Sunrun. And SolarCity had something crucial that Sunrun lacked: their own operations and installation capabilities. Seven years in, Sunrun was still essentially operating as a management and financing company, relying on third parties for construction, installation and maintenance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If they wanted to scale, Sunrun would have to take over the third-party labor themselves. This, of course, required a huge amount of capital that Sunrun didn’t have. But, no stranger to complex negotiations, Jurich and Fenster managed to secure a massive acquisition of their largest installations partner, REC Solar’s Residential Division (AEE Solar and SnapNrack), in an all-equity deal as a workaround. Overnight, Sunrun grew from 150 employees to 550. That same year, signaling just how much Jurich had grown as a leader since her days of reluctant cold-calling, Fenster stepped down as co-CEO of Sunrun, and Jurich stepped into the role. “Lynn was a better head for the company than I was,” he says. “There are really smart people who are excellent at making decisions but who aren’t great at managing people. Lynn’s unique in that she can do both.”</p>



<p>Poised for expansion, and in the wake of SolarCity’s IPO, the pressure was on for Sunrun to follow suit. “I knew we needed to go public,” Jurich says. “There were a handful of solar IPOs that had just happened that we didn’t believe in, and we thought they were gonna spook the market. So I didn’t really feel that I had the luxury to slow down at any point in the process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not even when she learned she was pregnant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jurich’s daughter Blythe was born just a few weeks before Sunrun’s IPO on August 5, 2015, and was in Jurich’s arms when she rang the Nasdaq bell. “I got on a conference call the day I got home from the hospital, and my mom moved in and helped me,” says Jurich. (While Jurich, who had her second child in 2018, didn’t take maternity leave, she expanded maternity leave benefits for the rest of the company, signaling that she didn’t expect others to make the same choice that she had.)</p>



<p>Sunrun’s share price dropped roughly 20% on its first day of trading, which only fed Jurich’s resolve to be as present at the company as possible. She started her investor roadshow when Blythe was just five weeks old, bringing her mother and a nurse along for support. “I was constantly pumping and shuttling milk back and forth between hotels and hedge fund offices,” Jurich says. “It was exhausting.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>By 2017, Sunrun had rebounded from its post-IPO dip to become the largest publicly traded rooftop solar company in the U.S. following Tesla’s 2016 acquisition of SolarCity. After years of fundraising, surviving a recession, battling incumbent utilities, navigating company altering climate legislation, IPOing and becoming a mother, Jurich felt like things were finally in a good place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s when the Wall Street Journal article came out.</p>

<p>In the May 2017 piece, former Sunrun employees claimed the company hadn’t reported order cancellations that may have affected sales data in financial disclosures leading up to the IPO. Jurich denied all wrongdoing, claiming the journalism was “not representative of the company and suspect.” Despite Sunrun’s assurances, the article triggered a probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) of Sunrun and its competitor, SolarCity. Sunrun’s stock bottomed out. And shareholders filed a class action suit against Sunrun.</p>



<p>Jurich remembers this time, as her company’s reputation and her own integrity were called into question, as one dominated by a profound sense of grief and powerlessness. Ever since her days of writing her first to-do lists, she’d been laser focused on success. But suddenly, no amount of resolve, no degree of hustle could change the way the world perceived her and her company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, months after the initial article broke, Sunrun released a statement saying that after conducting an internal audit, the SEC didn’t find any evidence of manipulated sales data. Still, the company ended up making a $30 million settlement with shareholders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although Sunrun’s name had technically been cleared, in the weeks following, Jurich continued to struggle emotionally from the toll the probe had taken. For the woman who had defined so much of her life by her achievements, this failure—which she certainly saw it as—felt existential. She faced a choice: “Your options are either to crumble because you can’t deal with it, or to figure out how to keep going and operate at a higher level,” says Jurich.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the first time, she decided that “higher level” didn’t mean working harder. It meant “reflecting on my values, starting a meditation practice, keeping my fitness going, and not caring too much about what other people think,” says Jurich. She was able to let go, minding public perceptions less as her company slowly but surely regained its footing and earned back consumer trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then, from their all-time low in share prices, something surprising happened. “The WSJ article was an interesting inflection point for the company,” says Fenster, “because after it caused the stock to bottom, momentum started to come back.” Over the next two years, Sunrun’s stock rose roughly 400%, signaling to the world that Sunrun had staying power.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Just before Thomas Edison’s death, in that same 1931 conversation with Henry Ford, he said, “I’d put my money on the sun and solar energy. What a source of power! I hope we don’t have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that.” Today, Jurich feels closer than ever to paying out her hero’s bet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2007, Sunrun has deployed 5.7 gigawatts of total solar capacity, making it one of the world’s largest sources of networked solar energy. In 2019, Sunrun overtook Tesla’s SolarCity as the leading installer of residential rooftop solar panels in the U.S. “We’re at this inflection point where consumers have wrapped their minds around solar power, and they accept it,” says Jurich, who stepped down as CEO of Sunrun in 2021, but remains the company’s Co-Executive Chair.</p>



<p>Part of that acceptance comes from a greater understanding of climate urgency. It comes from legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other clean energy initiatives, reinstates generous tax credits for homeowners who install solar panels. And it comes from increasingly affordable solar hardware, a trend the founders predicted at Sunrun’s outset (today, solar panel prices are down nine times since 2006). An additional factor is technological advancement: “One of the challenges with solar was always that you couldn’t store it,” says Jurich, “but now, batteries have completely changed that. You can generate, store and distribute energy to the grid without building new plants, or even solar farms. You can just use existing roofs!” To that end, in 2020 Sunrun funded and helped found Lunar Energy, an independent company focused on building the next-generation home battery system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A decade and a half working in clean energy has made Jurich a realist about the magnitude of her company’s undertakings. Which is why, more than ever, she’s looking to others to share the burden, and in part why she returned to her alma mater in March 2023. This was a chance to speak to a new generation of potential clean energy leaders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I do worry that the United States broadly has lost the skillset to develop large-scale infrastructure,” Jurich said toward the end of her keynote. “But I encourage all of you to help. I’ve already talked to a couple of you who have great business ideas around trying to make labor more efficient, making large-scale construction more efficient. And I do think we will get there.”</p>



<p>By “there,” Jurich means a sustainable future of clean energy abundance. And on a personal level, she hopes for a future with more balance, filled with more of the hard-earned equanimity on display at the GSB climate summit. “One of the things I’ve come to appreciate in life is that in order to be most effective, you need periods of both intensity and periods of rest and renewal,” says Jurich.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rest, as always with Jurich, is a relative concept. She’s Co-Executive Chair of Sunrun, Chair of Lunar Energy, and she’s launching a women’s health institute and writing a novel—imagining different worlds while working to improve our own. But at the very least, “I’m no longer trying to do it all at once,” she says. That simply wouldn’t be sustainable.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a> (ZCG) program funds independent teams to perform major ongoing development (or other work) that benefits the Zcash ecosystem. Grants are chosen by a five-person committee whose members are elected by the<a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/"> Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP)</a>. </p>



<p>Three of the current members’ terms are expiring at the end of this year (Amber O’Hearn, Michael Harms and Jason McGee). Therefore, we are inviting nominations for an election to be held in December. </p>



 How to Stand for Election to the Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) Committee 



<p>Anyone can stand for election to the ZCG committee. Existing members may stand for re-election, and there are no term limits. </p>



<p>Candidates should submit a forum post (ideally five paragraphs or less) in the&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/governance/zcg-elections/38">ZCG Elections category of the Zcash Community Forum</a>, announcing their candidacy, and outlining why they believe they should be elected to the ZCG Committee. Community members will have an opportunity to ask candidates questions directly by replying to their individual posts.</p>



<p>The deadline for nominations is 09:00 UTC on Monday 4th December 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We cannot prevent anyone from talking about their candidacy in other media, but we encourage candidates to use the forum threads as their primary method of “campaigning.” Doing so will make it easier for Zcash community members to interact with and assess candidates.</p>



<p>In mid-December the Zcash Foundation will host a community call, during which the candidates will have an opportunity to introduce themselves, and answer questions from the Zcash community. </p>



<p>After the community call, ZF will open a Helios poll of <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">ZCAP</a> to select three candidates to join the ZCG Committee. The poll will close at 09:00 UTC on 1st January 2024.&nbsp;As with previous polls, the election will be decided by approval voting. The three candidates with the most approval votes will become the new ZCG Committee members. They will serve a one-year term, ending on 31st December 2024. </p>



<p>Prospective candidates should beaware of the Conflict of Interest policy (see below). </p>



 About the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>The largest slice of the&nbsp;<a href="https://zfnd.org/how-the-zcash-foundation-is-funded/">Zcash Dev Fund</a>&nbsp;is earmarked for major grants “<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">to fund independent teams entering the Zcash ecosystem, to perform major ongoing development work (or other word) for the public good of the Zcash ecosystem</a>”. While the funds are administered and disbursed by the Zcash Foundation (ZF), applications for major grants are subject to approval by a five-seat Major Grant Review Committee, which is elected by the <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/"></a><a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP)</a>.</p>



<p>The Committee reviews, assesses and approves or rejects grant applications. Committee members currently meet for brainstorming sessions every week, with formal committee meetings held every two weeks.</p>



<p>The first Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/fd30d13c-e010-11ea-88f3-4a6a23563c24/view">September 2020</a>, and adopted the moniker Zcash Open Major Grants (ZOMG). The second Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/2d0787fc-61de-11ec-8619-8ee85a8a1b8a/view">December 2021</a>, and re-branded itself&nbsp;<a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a>&nbsp;(ZCG).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Committee is responsible for reviewing, assessing and approving or rejecting grant applications, in accordance with the strictures and guidelines set forth in <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">ZIP 1014</a>. Currently, formal Committee meetings are held every two weeks, and the Committee meets informally for brainstorming sessions on a weekly basis. </p>



<p>From January, Committee members will receive a nominal stipend of $650 per calendar month from ZF (paid as shielded ZEC). This stipend may be subject to review, given the budgetary constraints that ZF currently faces.</p>



 Conflict of Interest Policy 



<p>As a 501(c)(3) non-profit, the Zcash Foundation is subject to rules regarding private benefit and inurement, and is obligated to have an appropriate policy and processes in place to ensure that actual and potential conflicts of interest are disclosed and managed appropriately, in order to avoid the appearance or actuality of private benefit to individuals who are in a position of substantial authority.. </p>



<p>Before taking their seat on ZCG Committee, newly-elected Committee members are required to undergo the ZF’s KYC process, complete a conflict of interest questionnaire, and sign an independent contractor agreement with ZF (to ensure that their status and relationship with ZF is clearly-defined). Additionally, serving ZCG Committee members are required to notify ZF of any new actual or potential conflicts of interest that develop or emerge during their tenure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The following policies also apply in relation to ZCG Committee members and entities in which a serving ZCG Committee member is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest:</p>



 
 Serving ZCG Committee members, and entities in which a serving ZCG Committee member is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest, are ineligible to submit a new grant application to ZCG. 



 A person who has submitted a grant application (or who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that has submitted a grant application) on which the ZCG Committee has not yet rendered a decision is ineligible to serve as a ZCG Committee member (unless the grant application is withdrawn). 



 A person who is a current grant recipient (or a person who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that is a current grant recipient) is eligible to serve on the ZCG Committee so long as the decision to accept their grant application was made before they began serving as a member of the ZCG Committee. 



 Milestone payout decisions that relate to a serving ZCG Committee member’s grant (or a grant awarded to an entity in which a serving ZCG Committee member has a financial interest) will be taken by the executive director or other officer of ZF. 



 Before taking their seat on ZCG Committee, newly-elected Committee members will be required to undergo the ZF’s KYC process, complete a conflict of interest questionnaire, and sign an independent contractor agreement with ZF (to ensure that their status and relationship with ZF is clearly-defined). Additionally, serving ZCG Committee members are required to notify ZF of any new conflicts of interest that develop or emerge during their tenure. 
 



<p></p>



<p>If prospective candidates have any questions about the role, they should post them to this topic on the Zcash Community Forums.</p>

 The Horizen DAO increases community involvement in decision-making for improvements to the protocol and ecosystem. 



<p>The Horizen community is excited to announce the Horizen DAO is now open for all $ZEN holders to participate in governance and take an active role in the direction of the project!</p>



<p>Horizen is an open-source, public protocol with a broad and diverse ecosystem that includes developers, miners, node operators, and $ZEN holders across multiple blockchain networks. A strong social layer is crucial for maintaining integrity across the ecosystem. This approach is informed by the guiding values of:</p>



 
 Transparency 



 Accountability 



 Security 



 Community involvement 



 Continuous improvement 



 Social responsibility 
 



<p>Read more about the Horizen guiding values on the <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/guiding_values">Horizen governance page</a>.</p>



 How to Participate in Voting 



<p>Voting for the Horizen DAO is done on Horizen EON, an EVM-compatible sidechain on Horizen. The Horizen DAO uses <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot</a> and <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Discourse</a> for governance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Voting power is determined by the amount of $ZEN you hold on the Horizen mainchain and on the Horizen EON chain including the $ZEN you have staked with the Horizen EON validators. Therefore, the more $ZEN you hold,&nbsp; the more voting power you have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


 
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image.jpg"></a> 


<p></p>



<p>The voting period for any given proposal will have a specified start and end date and will last 72 hours. For more information about the process of voting, please start <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 Introducing the Horizen DAO Special Council 



<p>What is the Horizen DAO Special Council?</p>



<p>The Special Council serves as a steward for the Horizen DAO and provides oversight of the Horizen Foundation with security of the Horizen DAO and ecosystem as its paramount focus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What exactly does the Special Council do?</p>



<p>Special Council members serve as a DAO committee and function as a liaison between the Horizen community and the Horizen Foundation. In practical terms, this means providing review and oversight during the improvement proposal process, calling emergency operational meetings as needed to discuss and address security threats to the Horizen DAO, any protocol utilizing the Token, the Tokenholders, or the Foundation, and serving as signers on the Horizen community multi-signature wallet.</p>



<p>Who are the Special Council members?</p>



<p>Initially, the Special Council will be made up of 7 individuals initially appointed by the Foundation Director(s):</p>

<p>This post describes work done by Principal Engineer Anthony Tseng and Staff Engineer Anirudha Bose. We also thank Anxo Rodriguez from the CoW Swap team for his code-review on our work done for CoW Swap.</p>
<p>Written by Anirudha Bose.</p>

 Summary 
<p>With our recent Brave browser release version 1.60, we are excited to introduce two powerful features for the Brave Wallet.</p>
<p>Sign-In With Ethereum (SIWE) gets a major overhaul, with first-class support for parsing ERC-4361 messages, and a brand new UX. We also extend our redesigned signing experience for Brave Swap to CoW Swap orders. Both these features enhance the security and UX of signing messages in Brave Wallet.</p>

 Sign-In With Ethereum 

 What is Sign-In With Ethereum? 
<p>Sign-In With Ethereum (or SIWE for short) replaces traditional login credentials with wallet-based sign-in functionality. Imagine a world where your wallet can help you login stamped with the indelible ink of an Ethereum wallet address of your choosing. This functionality shifts the role of authentication away from large centralized identity providers, into the hands of the individual.</p>
<p>The Sign-In With Ethereum protocol defines a method by which Ethereum accounts can sign in to external services by signing a standard message format as defined in <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361">ERC-4361</a>.&nbsp; Thanks to this standard, you get the power of self-custodial identity while remaining portable across wallet implementations.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    


 Next-level SIWE 
<p>Brave Wallet always had basic support for SIWE. Since SIWE uses <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-191">ERC-191</a> (Signed Data Standard), we’ve been able to display SIWE prompts as human-readable plaintext messages, but without any validation by the wallet.</p>
<p>In this latest update, we’re introducing a significant improvement to Sign-In With Ethereum support with our implementation of an <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/19443">ABNF parser</a> for ERC-4361 conformant messages. This allows us to not only interpret SIWE messages and present them with a better look and feel, but also to improve the safety of signing into third-party apps and services. However, since there may still be cases where the SIWE message does not conform with these specifications, we fallback to legacy ERC-191 signing for maximum interoperability.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    


 Safety features 
<p>Once a SIWE message is successfully parsed, we verify the message for binding of domain, account, and chain ID fields, and display an appropriate error message if there’s a mismatch. This measure is designed to prevent phishing attacks, where a malicious actor may obtain a valid authorization to a legitimate third-party service. This is particularly important for SIWE, since the sign-in action is basically producing a signature for a message, which is susceptible to spoofing by a motivated attacker.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    


 CoW Swap 

 What is CoW Swap? 
<p>Coincidence of Wants (CoW) is a concept from the field of economics, particularly related to the barter system. It describes a situation where two parties each hold an item the other wants, so they agree to trade these items directly.</p>
<p><a href="https://swap.cow.fi">CoW Swap</a> leverages this idea for trading on-chain assets. It is an interface built on top of the CoW Protocol—a fully permissionless trading protocol that leverages batch auctions as its price finding mechanism. CoW Protocol enables batch auctions to maximize liquidity via CoWs in addition to tapping all available on-chain liquidity whenever needed. Users express off-chain intents as signed <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712">EIP-712</a> typed messages through the CoW Swap interface. The CoW Protocol gathers these intents into a batch auction, to be settled by solvers that compete to find the most optimal CoW. The winning solver then executes all intents in a single on-chain transaction, maximizing trade surplus and saving on network fees.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    

<p>A CoW settlement transaction</p>

 The dangers of off-chain messages 
<p>Signing off-chain messages, such as CoW orders, is unfortunately not the most friendly UX on any wallet. While off-chain messages significantly improve usability by providing a reliable way to exchange data through a gasless experience, such messages are largely opaque and unreadable to users. This is very similar to blind-signing of transaction calldata (which we have discussed in depth in a <a>previous blog post</a>). Because signing off-chain messages does not incur a gas fee, users are very likely to blindly approve a signing request without verifying the details. A maliciously crafted message is more than capable of draining assets from users’ wallets, without raising any suspicion because of its verbosity.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/Serpent/status/1604074440941506560">December 2022</a>, a scammer stole 14 <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub">BAYCs</a> worth over 852 ETH ($1.07 million USD) at the time, through a sophisticated, month-long social engineering scam. The victim was tricked into signing a gasless <a href="https://docs.opensea.io/reference/seaport-overview">Seaport</a> message, which actually created a private bundle listing all of his BAYCs to the scammer for 0.00000001 ETH. Such attacks are becoming increasingly common due to the massive adoption of off-chain messages in NFT marketplaces, DEXs, etc.</p>

 EIP-712 to the rescue 
<p>EIP-712 proposed a standard for signing typed structured data as opposed to bytestrings. While typed messages are easier for machines to read, they are still not user-friendly enough for most people. For users to be able to confidently approve signing requests for CoW orders, they need to clearly see all the order details such as formatted amounts, token symbols, logos, etc.</p>
<p>We conceived the idea to solve this problem at <a href="https://www.dappcon.io">DappCon 2023</a> in Berlin where we met CoW Swap’s engineering team. After brainstorming together, we came up with the <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/20203">solution</a> to implement a message parser for CoW orders, to be able to extract the relevant parameters, and render them in a familiar way that’s easy to understand. The parser is tied to the <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712#rationale-for-typehash">type hash</a> of the specific order struct used by CoW Swap, to prevent the parser from being used on non-CoW messages. We’ve also implemented calldata parsers for cases where the swap involves an on-chain transaction like, for example, when the user is swapping a native asset (such as ETH, or XDAI). Here’s what the final result looks like:</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    


 Conclusion 
<p>In the 1.60 release of the Brave browser, we have completely revamped the experience of Sign-In With Ethereum using Brave Wallet. We’ve added safety features and UX improvements that make the SIWE experience comparable to signing in on websites with traditional login credentials. You can try it out at <a href="https://login.xyz">https://login.xyz</a>, which also has developer documentation for supporting SIWE on your websites.</p>
<p>We have extended similar improvements to the signing of CoW Swap orders, turning the unreadable off-chain messages into something that users can easily audit. You can try it out at <a href="https://swap.cow.fi">https://swap.cow.fi</a> on Ethereum and Gnosis Chain.</p>
<p>We intend to bring similar improvements to the signing experience in Brave Wallet, in order to protect users from inadvertently signing malicious messages and transactions. Stay tuned for major updates on these improvements coming soon to Brave Wallet.</p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of Zebra version 1.4.0.</p>



<p>This release includes support for mining RPC methods in all release builds, bundles the Zcash verification parameters into the zebrad binary, and updates Rust dependencies to match the zcashd 5.7.0 release.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some notable improvements from our previous release include <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/7772">better recovery from brief network interruptions</a>, and mitigation of potential network and verification denial of service and performance issues. We have restored our macOS tests in CI, and now support macOS on a best-effort basis.</p>



<p>We have also changed our documentation website URL, and are considering deprecating some Docker image tags from release 1.5.0 onwards.</p>



 Mining RPCs in Production Builds 



<p>Since the 1.4.0 release, Zebra’s mining RPCs are <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/7740">available in release builds</a> so that any Zebra instance can be used by a solo miner or mining pool. With this release, we are providing production level support to 12 mining related RPCs, including getblocktemplate,&nbsp; submitblock, getmininginfo, getnetworksolps, [z_]validateaddress and getblocksubsidy. Do <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=C-enhancement%2CS-needs-triage&amp;projects=&amp;template=feature_request.yml&amp;title=feature%3A+">let us know</a> if your mining pool requires any extra RPC methods or fields!</p>



 Zcash Parameters in zebrad Binary 



<p>zebrad now bundles zk-SNARK parameters directly into its binary. This increases the binary size by a few megabytes, but reduces the size of the Docker image by around 600 MB because the parameters don’t contain the Sprout proving key anymore. We have also removed the “zebrad download” command as it is no longer necessary. If you have upgraded zebrad to 1.4.0 or later, and zcashd to 5.7.0 or later, you can delete the zk-SNARK parameter files to save approximately 700 MB disk space. For more details, please check out our <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.4.0">release notes</a>.</p>



 macOS Support 



<p>We have restored support for macOS x86_64 on a best-effort basis. macOS builds and some tests run in Zebra’s CI. You can check out the list of Zebra <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/supported-platforms.html">supported platforms</a> for more details on the different tiers of support we provide for the listed platforms.&nbsp;</p>



 Deprecation Warnings 



<p>In an effort to remove redundancies and simplify things, we would like to share the following deprecation warnings.</p>



 DockerHub Image Tags 



<p>Zebra currently publishes 11 DockerHub tags for each new release. We want to reduce the number of DockerHub tags we publish in a future minor Zebra release. Based on usage and user feedback, in release 1.5.0 we could stop publishing:</p>



 
 The 1 tag, which updates each release until NU6 



 The 1.x tag, which updates each patch release until the next minor release 



 The 1.x.y tag, which is the same as v1.x.y 



 The sha-xxxxxxx tag, which is the same as v1.x.y (for production releases) 
 



<p>We also want to standardise experimental image tags to -experimental, rather than .experimental.</p>



<p>This means that, for release 1.5.0 onwards, we are considering only publishing the following tags:</p>



 
 latest&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 latest-experimental (a new tag) 



 V1.5.0 



 v1.5.0-experimental 
 



<p>Please let us know if you need any other tags by <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=C-enhancement%2CS-needs-triage&amp;projects=&amp;template=feature_request.yml&amp;title=feature%3A+">opening a GitHub ticket</a>.</p>



<p>We recommend using the “latest” tag to always get the most recent Zebra release.</p>



 Documentation Website URL Change 



<p>We have replaced the API documentation which was previously available on the doc.zebra.zfnd.org website with <a href="https://docs.rs/releases/search?query=zebra">docs.rs</a>. Zebra’s API documentation can now be found on:<br></p>



 
 <a href="https://docs.rs/releases/search?query=zebra">docs.rs</a>, which renders documentation for the public API of the latest crate releases; 



 <a href="https://doc-internal.zebra.zfnd.org/zebrad/">doc-internal.zebra.zfnd.org</a>, which renders documentation for the internal API on the main branch. 
 



<p>This API documentation is in addition to the <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/">Zebra Book</a> user documentation, which is still available as usual.</p>

<p>“Michelle has worked hard to support Zcash and the cause of financial freedom for years,” Fairless said. “We love her insight and imagination on tech product use cases.”</p>



<p>A graduate of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania (2007), Michelle has spent half her career in crypto and half in financial services, including stints at Anchorage Digital, Bitpay, Credit Suisse, a private equity buyout fund, and as a consultant to CEOs of large financial services companies. She’s performed a wide range of roles, including COO, BD and product roles, and says she most enjoys solving tricky business problems and managing high-stakes negotiations.</p>



<p>She is passionate about crypto-related technology as “a means of achieving a fairer and freer world.”</p>



<p>In Michelle’s words:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My journey with Zcash started in 2018 when I worked at a crypto asset custodian and we were looking to support $ZEC. Since then, I’ve fallen further down the privacy money rabbit hole, becoming a member of the first grant organization in 2021 (the Zcash Open Major Grants committee) and then staying involved as someone who actively advocates for privacy and freedom applications in crypto.</p>



<p>My vision of tomorrow’s Zcash is one that earns its place back as a leader of privacy tech in crypto so that we can keep supporting the universal values of privacy and freedom. We did it once with the best talent in ZK and engineering, and we can do it again.</p>



<p>Today, as the crypto privacy community faces several challenges, including market sentiment and regulatory onslaught, I join the Bootstrap team to navigate the turbulent waters we find ourselves in. I have had professional experience in turnaround situations and hope to bring that to bear in this new role on the board of Bootstrap.</p>



<p>The road ahead is strewn with both extremely difficult questions and compelling opportunities for all ZK and privacy projects, including us. It will take a grand effort for us to arrive at a new horizon, but this is the moment where we dig in, gear up, and keep marching on in service of humanity.</p>



<p>If you have ideas and opinions from anywhere in the crypto community, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me.</p>

<p>The very nature of Ethereum addresses, expressed as random hexadecimal character strings, represents a big hurdle for mass adoption, as they are not human-readable. ENS domains were envisioned to not only solve this and provide a seamless UX, but to also be the cornerstone of on-chain identities. However, in the current multichain landscape, a plethora of decentralised naming services arose, which led to a heterogeneous domain name pool. As a result, ENS aims to expand to L2s and non-EVM chains, attempting to provide consistency, in order to further reduce user friction and limit conflicting domain names.</p><p>We were joined by Nick Johnson, founder of ENS, to discuss the current state of decentralised naming services from a multichain and L2 perspective, and how these ultimately tie into decentralised identities.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Nick’s background and ENS history  The plethora of decentralised naming services  ENS use cases  Interacting with Web2 DNS  L2 compatibility for ENS via CCIP Read  ENS wrapper and subdomains  CCIP Read  Bridging ENS to non-EVM L2s  Coinbase’s cb.id  ENS and on-chain privacy OPSEC  Account abstraction  The future of ENS  Governance   <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/nicksdjohnson">Nick Johnson on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ensdomains">ENS on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Sebastien Couture.

<p>A busy month just went by! Here’s everything we did and what’s on the horizon for Panther.</p><p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>October has been a productive month for us, and we’re excited to share our progress in many areas as we work towards Panther v1. <br>Without further ado, let’s dive in.</p> Tech Updates  Stage 2 <p>The latest development sprints were focused on solving a bug related to an external library used for Stage 2, an external factor that has caused a delay. <br><br>Our Incentivized <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testnet-stage-2-is-now-live-and-its-all-about-rewards/">Testnet Stage 2 </a>is now officially underway, bringing a wave of features and rewards to the Panther community. <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testnet-stage-2-is-now-live-and-its-all-about-rewards/">Stage 2</a> is critical as it puts our user interaction and reward mechanisms to the test, laying the groundwork for Panther Protocol’s privacy-preserving features. Our protocol’s privacy is intricately tied to unique game-theoretical features that encourage active user participation, making this stage a pivotal moment for the upcoming Panther Protocol v1.</p><p>Stage 2 includes creating and activating your Panther Account, finding your onboarding bonuses, and claiming your vouchers. <br>Your participation and feedback are crucial as we move closer to our v1 release. Thank you for being a part of Testnet Stage 2, and don't hesitate to share your thoughts through our community channels!</p> V1 redesign <p>Over the past weeks, we have done some UX refinements too. The focus was reviewing what we have learned from the previous design iterations and expanding on it further while also elevating the user experience. Another objective was to revamp and update the onboarding process for more seamless account setup.</p><p>You can take a look at a quick preview below:</p> Ecosystem  Panel with PureFi Protocol <p>Just in case you missed our last update, on October 2nd we hosted <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1zqKVqmnqaaxB?s=20&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">a great conversation via Twitter Spaces</a> with our partners at PureFi.

<p>Now and through the end of January 2024, Electric Coin Co. (ECC) objectives center on delivering an improved ZEC user experience, primarily through the Zashi wallet. Across teams — Product; Engineering; PeopleOps; and Communications and Advocacy — ECC employees are focused on work that either directly contributes to the wallet or in some way makes ZEC and Zashi adoption more viable.</p>



<p>Background: ECC uses an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectives_and_key_results">OKR process</a> for prioritizing and delivering measurable work on four-month cycles. In October, teams met and finalized planning for T3 2023-24 (October-January).</p>



<p>Priorities were developed to accomplish or make meaningful progress on the following:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Release the next version of the Zashi app including a new UX and UI 



 Transition more responsibilities to the wider Zcash community so ECC can focus on building Zashi, starting with the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/decentralizing-zcash-digital/45349">Decentralizing Zcash Digital</a> effort.&nbsp; 



 Take meaningful steps in the effort to transition Zcash from proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS), Zashi’s eventual consensus mechanism, by publishing a design with security arguments, and a protocol simulator. 



 Maintain policy efforts to ensure Zashi and Zcash are (1) accessible and usable by people in the United States and (2) considered socially beneficial. Continue hosting notable policy events and publishing episodes of the PGP for Crypto Podcast. 



 Support select ecosystem teams and projects that directly benefit Zashi users
 
 Support Brave’s integration of Zcash and encrypted media/files. 



 Support Edge, Unstoppable, and Nighthawk’s use of the ECC mobile wallet SDKs. 



 Build and/or improve Zashi features (e.g., implementing ZIP-317 and Orchard). 
 
 
 



<p>Each ECC team has built their OKRs to support these company objectives.</p>

 Intro <p>Panther community,</p><p>As we conclude Testnet Stage 1 with a number of learnings and upgrades, we are thrilled to announce the commencement of Stage 2 of our Testnet.</p><p>This second phase is designed to test the user interaction and reward mechanisms that set the foundation for the protocol’s privacy-preserving features. As Panther’s privacy is built upon unique game-theoretical features fostering user activity, Stage 2 is key for the upcoming Panther Protocol v1.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look at Stage 2. It comprises three main categories of reward mechanisms: Rewards, Recharge pool, and Vouchers.</p> 1. Rewards <p>Rewards or protocol reward points (PRPs) are created as an incentive for users to join and continuously use Panther Protocol. This implies converting the ‘Available PRP’ to ZKP which is accomplished via a <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/fees-and-rewards-structure/prps/single-side-automated-market-maker?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">single-sided AMM</a> (automated market maker) pool. It is one-sided because users can only convert their PRP to ZKP and not vice versa. The exchange rate of this conversion is dynamic in nature and depends on several factors, including the amount of ZKP in the pool and the total available PRP held by users at any given point in time, among other factors. For details on how Panther Rewards works, please see <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/fees-and-rewards-structure/prps?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther docs</a>.</p><p>There are two types of PRPs:</p>  Available PRPs which can be exchanged to zZKP (ZKP within the MASP) immediately.  Pending PRP is the accrued rewards that are not realized yet because a user has not spent those UTXOs. To make it available, the UTXO's should be included in transactions that a user performs within Panther.<br>   2. Recharge Pool  <p>The Recharge function is the cornerstone of the protocol’s reward system and allows protocol rewards vested on Mainnet to be injected into the reward distribution process on Polygon (viz the one-sided AMM launched in Stage 2). This dynamic interplay with the AMM pool through the Recharge function fosters active user participation while maintaining a responsive and adaptive reward structure within the protocol. </p> 3. Vouchers <p>Vouchers are a reward mechanism that can be used by the Protocol to incentivize certain functions that have to be triggered by Users. We refer to them as Admin functions. Those could include but are not limited to functions such as:</p>  Recharging Reward Pool  Trigger conversion of token&nbsp;  <p>Note: the onboarding reward voucher issued atThe voucher this Stage is only for testing purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When a new account is created and activated successfully, a user gets (a) 100 zZKP onto his zAccount and (b) 1 voucher which is worth 500 PRP. This is valid for all new users and the users who have created accounts during Stage 1.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: it can take up to a minute to get the voucher screen updated to let a user find his onboarding voucher.</p><p>The voucher has a stable predefined value which can be different depending on the type of performed action (onboarding = PRP 500, triggering recharge the reward pool = PRP 100). The voucher is nominated in PRP.&nbsp; To get those PRP, one should claim a voucher - it is about submitting a transaction “burn a voucher - get the corresponding PRP”.&nbsp;</p><p>Vouchers are grouped per type of action performed. Stage 2 will have two such groups - (1) Onboarding bonus voucher and (2) Recharge bonus voucher. Vouchers can be claimed by group only, which means a user gets the total PRP for all vouchers in a given group. When claiming is completed successfully, a user will see an updated balance on his (a) Dashboard → Panther Rewards Points section → Available PRP amount and (b) Rewards page → Redeem PRP screen → Available PRP section. &nbsp;</p> STAGE 2 TESTING <p>As we progress through our Testnet stages, we want to express our gratitude for your continued support, feedback, and enthusiasm. To start testing Stage 2, please visit Panther docs <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a> to get the most updated test link and follow the steps:</p>  New user creates and activates Panther Account (existing users go through the same step but the onboarding process bypasses the KYC verification) - see <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage-1-compliance-integrations-is-now-live-heres-how-to-test/">the Stage 1 functionality and instructions</a>.&nbsp;  <p>Note 1.1: both (a) new accounts and (b) previously created during Stage 1 Panther accounts both are valid.&nbsp;</p><p>When your account is successfully created, you will find a success screen:</p>  Find the first part of your onboarding bonus on your dashboard. This bonus is in the form of Panther Account zZKP which is expected to fuel all types of transactions within Panther such as paying Protocol fees, paying to Relayer for gasless transactions, paying Miner’s fee etc. Users are expected to maintain a sufficient balance of this account in zZKP using transfer functions available in later stages.&nbsp;&nbsp;    Find the second part of your onboarding bonus - an onboarding voucher,, which equals 500 PRPs. The voucher should be claimed to get the PRPs into your account. To find the second part, please follow the Rewards menu item =&gt; Vouchers screen =&gt; Onboarding Reward Vouchers.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Note 3.1: It takes time to detect and reflect the corresponding group of vouchers so there can be a case when the screen is empty before the data is updated:</p><p>Note 3.2: It takes time to make your voucher available for claiming, as the zAccount UTXO must be mined in advance. The UI will reflect your bonus voucher. Please be aware that claiming the voucher may take a few minutes in the test environment (due to lower mining activity which impacts transaction processing in the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/ecosystem-roles/miners?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Bus Queue</a>). The claim button is disabled until claiming is available.&nbsp;</p>  Claim your voucher via the Vouchers screen functionality. After Voucher is claimed successfully (Voucher screen will go back to the state mentioned in Note 3.1 upon a successfully claimed transaction), you can find the corresponding amount of PRP on the Redeem PRP screen, Available PRP field&nbsp;  <p>Note 4.1: Sometimes, it may take a few minutes to display the PRP available for redeeming (due to lower mining activity in the test environment, which impacts transaction processing in the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/ecosystem-roles/miners?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Bus Queue</a>). The button is disabled until Redeem is successful.&nbsp;</p>  Redeem your PRP from the Redeem PRP screen to get your zZKP. This zZKP will now be available in your Private zAssets section and zAssets Summary section balance in the Dashboard screen.  <p>6. Recharge the reward pool of PRP/zZKP AMM:</p><p>Step 1: Go to the Rewards page and click on recharge pool.</p><p>Step 2: Switch to the Goerli network. The recharge triggers the Vesting contract on the Goerli testnet (Ethereum on production). This requires users to switch networks if they are not on Goerli. This can be done using either in-dApp functionality (Switch Network option) or via Network Management modal (when you are already connected to the product), or via MetaMask functionality. </p><p>Step 3: Check available $ZKP for recharge. Checking that there is enough $ZKP for recharge helps make the decision to trigger the function. The Recharge button will be active only when the ‘Recharge size’ field is non-zero, however, it is not recommended to trigger this function for a smaller recharge amount. </p><p>Also, a zero or a low ‘Recharge size’ means that the recharge was done by other users.&nbsp;</p><p>Step 4: Check and top-up your Goerli ETH balance - this is required to pay for gas to trigger this functionality. To get a test Goerli ETH use the faucet e.g. <a href="https://beyondfaucet.com/goerli/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">https://beyondfaucet.com/goerli/</a>.<br></p><p>Step 5: Complete the recharge-triggering transaction on the Goerli side by pushing the Recharge Reward Pool button.</p><p>Note 6.1: The recharge executes through bridging functionality which moves $tZKP from Goerli (Ethereum) to Mumbai (Polygon). This operation is dependent on the bridge and may take up to 20 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Step 6: Check the updated current recharge ratio field. Recharging the pool means injecting more rewards into the Reward AMM, hence, it impacts the ZKP:PRP ratio. The new ratio can be viewed here: </p><p>Note 6.2: Smaller recharge size value will make an insignificant impact on the rate. Testnet allows for multiple recharge to test functionality and bridging.

  Partnering with Factory: Autonomous AI for All  <p>Matan and Eno are building fully-autonomous programming “Droids” to unlock creativity within and beyond engineering teams.</p>   
	By Shaun Maguire	 



Published November 2, 2023
  



 
<p>Like any VC partner, I get a lot of cold emails. But when Matan Grinberg’s note appeared in my inbox in March, it got my attention right away. Just from the subject line—”Chat with a fellow former hep-th physicist”—I knew we shared a background in the same tiny sub-field of high-energy physics theory. And as I read on and Googled a bit, I discovered that what he humbly described as having “worked with Juan” actually referred to co-authoring a paper with Juan Maldacena—a professor at the elite Institute for Advanced Study and arguably the world’s best-known living physicist—when Matan was still an undergrad.</p>



<p>I wrote back in less than an hour.</p>



<p>A few days later, Matan and I went for a walk. He’d been working at the intersection of physics and AI at Berkeley and pursuing a PhD, but was considering a transition from academia to a start-up—and though he hadn’t yet settled on a specific idea, it was clear that he wanted to build a company. It was also clear that he had a high EQ to match his exceptional background. I encouraged him to take the leap.</p>



<p>He started iterating, and within a week was working on the autonomous coding project&nbsp; that would become <a href="https://www.factory.ai/">Factory</a>—and working with a co-founder who, as it turned out, was in Sequoia’s orbit as well.</p>



<p>Eno Reyes, who grew up in Atlanta and first met Matan at Princeton, had recently accepted a job as an ML engineer at Hugging Face and moved to San Francisco’s Mission District—just a block from where his grandparents had settled down and set up a restaurant after immigrating from Puebla, Mexico. Shortly before he and Matan reunited at a hackathon and started building Factory, the Sequoia team met Eno at AI Ascent, a small gathering of the leading minds in AI that we held in March. Just a year out of college and a few months into his new role, he had already impressed enough to join CEO Clem Delangue at the event.</p>



<p>Matan and Eno’s idea was to build on the historic momentum in AI and unlock even more creativity in software development—and not just among engineers. In the face of a persistent tech talent <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/cracking-the-code-on-digital-talent">shortage</a>, with many Fortune 500 companies still running infrastructure built decades ago simply because they don’t have enough people to update it, these two co-founders understood that handing off time-consuming tasks like code review, documentation, testing, project management and debugging to fully autonomous “Droids,” or agents, would indeed be a game-changer for engineering teams. But they also understood that for every software developer, there are another 100 people who don’t have highly technical backgrounds—but do have great ideas that software could bring to life.</p>



<p>It is a next-generation vision for AI, and just a year ago, it would have been too ambitious. But Matan and Eno’s timing is perfect—and they are perfectly suited to the task, not only because of their deep domain expertise in ML, AI and physics, but also because they move at lightning speed. Once they’d landed on an idea, it took them a day to sign a term sheet, incorporate the company and start to build.</p>



<p>Six months later, Factory is delivering value to early customers that include two public companies and two decacorns. Meanwhile, Matan and Eno have more complex functionality on the roadmap, and they are <a href="https://www.factory.ai/careers">growing</a> an amazing team to build it. It has been a joy to welcome them to the Sequoia community, and we look forward to supporting them over the months and years to come as they work toward a world where programming capacity no longer limits our collective creativity.</p>

<p>Brave is also introducing Leo Premium, a paid plan featuring Anthropic’s Claude Instant with faster response times</p>
<p>Three months ago, Brave previewed <a>Leo—the browser-native AI assistant</a>—on its Nightly channel for developers and testers. Since then we’ve seen great adoption, with tens of thousands of users globally. With user feedback, we’ve been able to improve much faster than we’d hoped—on response-times, the quality of responses, even the product UI. Today, we’re excited to announce that Brave Leo is ready for all Brave users, available in desktop release 1.60.</p>
<p>With that testing, we also received requests for new features. The most common one has been to add different AI language models in Leo. To that end, we’re bringing our users advanced conversational AI experiences through <a href="https://account.brave.com/?intent=checkout&amp;product=leo">Brave Leo Premium</a>—our new paid option featuring Claude Instant, Anthropic’s state-of-the-art AI assistant.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    


 What is Brave Leo? 
<p>Leo, Brave’s browser AI assistant, can help with all sorts of tasks. It can create real-time summaries of webpages or videos. It can answer questions about content, or generate new content. It can even translate pages, analyze them, rewrite them, and more. Whether you’re looking for information, trying to solve a problem, or creating content, Leo can help.</p>
<p>Leo combines this easy, free access to AI with the privacy focus of Brave. Chats with Leo are private, anonymous, and secure. Leo doesn’t record chats, or use them for model training, and no account or login is required to use Leo. With cutting-edge technology and privacy, Brave Leo pushes the boundaries of typical AI chatbot services.</p>
<p>“It is increasingly common today to use AI to ask questions and get assistance. AI can be a powerful tool but it can also present growing concerns for data privacy and there’s a need for a privacy-first solution,” said Brian Bondy, CTO and co-founder of Brave. “Brave is committed to pairing AI with user privacy, and will provide our users with secure and personalized AI assistance where they already spend their time online. We’re also thrilled to work with Anthropic to bring Claude’s exceptional conversational abilities to the millions of Brave users worldwide.”</p>

 Introducing Leo Premium 
<p>By default, Brave Leo is free for all users, with easy access to the Llama 2 large language model from Meta. For users who want additional models, Brave is also releasing a premium version of Leo for <a href="https://account.brave.com/?intent=checkout&amp;product=leo">$15/month</a>. Leo Premium subscribers will get access to Claude Instant, Anthropic’s faster and lighter model that excels at logical reasoning and coding. The current version of Claude produces longer, more structured responses, follows instructions better than previous versions of Instant, and shows improvements in math, coding, multilingual abilities, and question answering. Additional models will be available to Leo Premium users, as well as access to higher rate limits, higher-quality conversations, priority queuing during periods of peak usage, and early access to new features and improvements.</p>
<p>This integration represents a milestone in delivering sophisticated natural language conversations powered by AI directly within the browser environment. With Claude’s advanced capabilities and Brave’s focus on user privacy and control, we hope to set a new standard for helpful, responsible, and context sensitive AI interactions. Anthropic used <a>Brave’s Search API</a> to train their latest model, Claude 2, on high-quality data to help optimize Claude’s outputs for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) queries.</p>
<p>“We’re excited that Brave is going to bring our state-of-the-art large language model Claude Instant directly into their browser. Integrating access to Claude seamlessly within Brave gives users assistance whenever they need it, right in the context of the page they are on,” says Matt Bell, Head of Product Research at Anthropic. “Whether Brave users are analyzing text, editing documents, or writing code, they can now benefit from having personalized help from Claude at any time. This integration unlocks the potential for AI to enhance people’s browsing and productivity in an intuitive, contextual way.”</p>

 Brave Leo and unparalleled privacy 
<p>As a privacy-first company, Brave is dedicated to releasing leading alternatives to popular Web tools that also protect user data and anonymity. Leo is no different:</p>
 
 
<p>Reverse proxy: All requests are proxied through an anonymized server so the request and user-address cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address.</p>
 
 
<p>Immediate discarding of responses: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded immediately after they’re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers such as your IP Address that can be linked to you. No personal data is retained by the AI model or any 3rd-party model providers.</p>
 
 
<p>No login or account required for access: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo.</p>
 
 
<p>Unlinkable subscription: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you used to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience.</p>
 
 

 Accessing Brave Leo 
<p>Leo is now available to Brave desktop users with version 1.60. It will be rolled out in phases over the next few days, so users should check back soon if they’re not seeing it today. It will be available on mobile (Android and iOS) in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learn more at <a>brave.com/leo</a>, and see details about Leo’s roadmap <a>here</a>.</p>
<p>It’s easy to get started with Brave Leo because it is built right into the Brave desktop browser, and no extra apps or extensions are required. It provides seamless access to AI experiences via the browser address bar, or also as a sidebar, a chat-like interface positioned beside any webpage.</p>
<p>To access Leo, existing Brave users can simply ask a question in the address bar and click  “Ask Leo”, or click  in Brave Sidebar.</p>

<p>A journey that began in the late summer of 2022, has finally come to a joyful end. Third-party Zcash wallets are working again, and Electric Coin Co. (ECC) is exiting Emergency Mode.</p>



<p>During this time, ECC released multiple updates to zcashd and lightwalletd, plus new mobile SDKs that, together, introduced new innovations (and learning) in the world of cryptography and decentralized money. These releases provide massive upgrades to privacy, scalability, and user experience in Zcash, and they have implications for all privacy-focused crypto projects.</p>



<p>Before going further, we need to give the hugest THANK YOU to our wallet partners Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable who worked with us to test releases and submit bugs, then were quick to implement SDKs 2.0 when they were ready.</p>



<p>The ECC engineers deserve special recognition —&nbsp;and possibly a vacation — after putting in long hours over many months on complicated discovery and development. Working through the <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ecc-restructuring-to-better-serve-zcash/">ECC restructure</a> and battling tough deadlines, while tackling other crucial emergencies like the <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-releases-remediate-memory-exhaustion-vulnerability-in-zcash/">Halborn disclosure</a>, they delivered groundbreaking technology that elevates ZEC user experience.</p>



 Background 



<p>Starting in June 2022, the Zcash network began experiencing a huge increase in shielded transaction volume. This additional network load caused a “data pileup” that prevented Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable wallets from being able to sync in a reasonable amount of time. These three wallets rely on ECC’s mobile SDKs.</p>



<p>Wallet syncing processes required scanning the entire blockchain before funds were available to be spent. And when the wallets wouldn’t sync, users couldn’t access or spend their funds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October 2022, ECC went into Emergency Mode and put aside all other roadmap priorities. From our blog in March 2023:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s a complicated challenge to address, and at minimum, it requires developing and implementing (1) a faster algorithm that does not require a linear sync of all blocks on chain and (2) tooling modifications that will give users the ability to spend funds without having a fully synced chain. As mentioned, the solution comprises changes to every component in the shielded mobile wallet stack: zcashd, lightwalletd, the ECC wallet SDKs, and the ECC prototype wallet.</p>
</blockquote>



 Emergency Mode exit criteria 



<p>Our top priority was ensuring users could access and spend their ZEC (Zcash coins). This is fundamental to our mission of economic freedom and a requirement for real-world private digital cash.</p>



<p>Speed and reliability are also critical to Zcash user experience, and these were our criteria for exiting Emergency Mode:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Users of Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable can spend their current funds (funds that are already synced when they open their wallet). 



 Users of those wallets can receive and become able to spend new incoming funds at a rate of a month’s worth of transactions in 1 hour. 



 Users of those wallets see sync updates which are minimally confusing about progress. 



 None of those wallets are impacted by frequent crashes or inconsistent behavior (such as failing to display some already synced transactions), nor do they require work-around behaviors due to the ECC SDK. 
 



<p>With the release of new mobile wallet SDKs 2.0 in September, ECC delivered the final piece in our efforts to mitigate third-party wallet performance issues. Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable quickly implemented the SDKs, and as of today, we are pleased to report that the criteria above have been met.</p>



 What is Spend Before Sync and why is it important? 



<p>Available now in Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable, Spend Before Sync (SBS) introduces non-linear sync, which allows wallets to scan chunks of the blockchain out of order and/or in parallel. This makes it possible for users to spend their existing funds without requiring the wallet to fully sync the entire blockchain.</p>



<p>Separately, but also important, the data structures that enable SBS substantially improve the performance of note commitment tree updates. As an example, Zingo! didn’t adopt SBS, but just by using the updated data structure that wallet got a better than 10x improvement in linear scanning speed.</p>



<p>Aditya Bharadwaj, better known as Adi, founder of Nighthawk, called SBS “a groundbreaking advancement that promises to revolutionize Zcash’s peer-to-peer usage for payments and shielded app interactions.”</p>



 What we learned during Emergency Mode 



 
 Our mobile SDK code did not meet the needs of a typical Zcash user. The syncing UX was confusing and the API design precluded wallets from spending funds until the wallet had fully synced the chain. 



 Before Emergency Mode, and to some extent before the ECC restructure, our team was spread too thin and trying to focus on too many things, which allowed issues like transaction load impact to surface. 



 We knew long ago that a transaction-load issue was possible, but we prioritized other Zcash features and improvements. This challenge of prioritizing new feature improvements versus making the existing system more resilient or robust is always present. In this case we underestimated the likelihood of this problem and the amount of effort it would take to mitigate it. 



 We chose to address the issue in the most thorough manner by making wallets function during high transaction load, rather than the expedient of short-term interventions to lessen the transaction load. We believed those short-term interventions would lead to more complexity without fully resolving the issue in the long run. We still believe our approach was best for the long-term robustness of the Zcash ecosystem, yet we underestimated the time and effort and the overall disruption to Zcash users in the interim. 



 We also learned about comms. It took us too long to define Emergency Mode and communicate a concise explanation and plan, both internally and externally. 



 Having our own wallet in development (Zashi), which uses our SDKs, was key to speeding up the process because it allowed us to test our solutions before deploying and/or sharing with third-party wallets. 
 



<p>With Emergency Mode complete, ECC is turning its attention to our main focus areas: proof-of-stake Zcash, development of the Zashi wallet, continued improvements to SDKs and Zcash Core Libraries, and US Policy work.</p>

      Battling the Trojan Horse in Open Source         
	By Ananya Menon	 



Published November 1, 2023
        Chainguard’s Dan Lorenc is taking on software supply chain security.      



 
<p>Dan Lorenc was at a restaurant in downtown Austin with friends when he received an unusual text. It was the summer of 2021, and the message was from his former coworker, Matt Moore. Lorenc was a software engineer at Google, and he and Moore had worked together on its cyber-security team. The past year had been especially challenging, as the security industry as a whole had faced a reckoning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December 2020, SolarWinds reported that its network monitoring platform had been hacked by operatives suspected of working for Russian intelligence. The attackers had planted malware in SolarWinds’ code, which allowed them to access the data of thousands of SolarWinds’ clients, from Microsoft to the U.S. government. The hack exposed a critical flaw in the security of software supply chains. Just as in real-world manufacturing, software is assembled from components created by developers all over the world. At some point during SolarWinds’ development process, malicious actors inserted malware into two software updates, which were then installed by customers all around the world. SolarWinds’ data breach was a wake-up call. Without verifying the integrity of software at every stage of its lifespan this type of hack could and would happen again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moore had left Google earlier in the year, and Lorenc had called him every month since, hoping to convince him to return. Moore was one of the finest software engineers Lorenc knew, and if anyone could find a solution to supply chain security, it was him. That night, Moore’s text to Lorenc said he was ready to get back to work—but not at Google. “Let’s start a new company,” Moore texted. Lorenc didn’t need to think twice. He was in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next day, Lorenc put in notice at Google, bought a new laptop and began work on Chainguard, a company focused on software supply chain security. Although technically the company was born that night in Austin, Lorenc had been preparing for this moment for years.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>The late 2000s ushered in a fundamental shift in the way tech companies approached security, as alarm around new types of digital threats grew. In what became known as Operation Aurora in 2009, Chinese hackers attempted to access and change source code in a series of attacks against companies like Google and Adobe. In the Snowden leaks in 2013, a contracted employee for the NSA hacked its database and leaked classified documents.</p>



<p>Lorenc joined Google in 2012, working on the company’s efforts to secure its own code and protect its databases from external or internal attackers. In 2016, after he and his team had implemented Google’s new, refined security system, Lorenc shifted focus to work on Minikube, a tool for open-source Kubernetes container management. This was Lorenc’s first time working predominantly with open-source code—code that’s freely available for anyone to download, modify and exchange. As Lorenc was building and shipping Minikube to users all over the world, he realized he could have easily slipped malware into the software. The container’s label would read “Minikube,” but few would take time to comb through the thousands of lines of code in every directory of the program to determine exactly what was inside. Proper verification was something that would take an engineer days, weeks or even months to complete—bandwidth they almost certainly didn’t have, and therefore a task that would fall by the wayside.</p>



<p>Lorenc was terrified. Wasn’t it just a matter of time before someone packaged up open-source software that secretly contained code that could put an entire company and its community at risk? “I realized how much damage I myself could do, and how easily,” Lorenc says. “And if I could do that, so could anyone.”</p>



<p>The concern over how to protect software from hidden malware isn’t a new one. In 1984, an engineer named Ken Thompson wrote an article called “Reflections on Trusting Trust” that demonstrated how easy it was to hide Trojan horse viruses in a computer program. Thompson’s point was that you could never fully trust any code you hadn’t written yourself. According to Lorenc, 90-98% of code used today is open source. Most companies focus resources on making sure the tiny amount of code they write themselves is secure, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. “The 2% of proprietary code is the only part you see over the water, but beneath that is the 98% of code you’re not responsible for yourself,” Lorenc says. “In some ways, open-source code is amazing. It’s enabled all this innovation and velocity and reuse. But it’s also scary because that means 98% of your code is written by strangers on the internet. Which is great when people are well-intentioned, but not everyone on the internet is nice.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite evidence of the risks open-source code can pose to a company’s security, Lorenc learned that managing these risks wasn’t something widely prioritized. When he spoke with engineers at other software companies, supply chain security wasn’t a top concern. “Being a software engineer is like playing Whac-A-Mole. There are so many issues you have to deal with on a constant basis that you can’t spend time on preventive measures,” Lorenc says. “You only pay attention to a problem when it rears its head. At this point, there hadn’t been large instances of open-source vulnerability being a problem, so no one seemed to think much about it.”</p>



<p>No one but Lorenc. That is, until December 2020.</p>

<p>Lorenc was at home when he received a news alert about the SolarWinds attack. Thousands of companies were reporting their data, networks and systems compromised—exactly what Lorenc had been worried about. He stood and walked to his car. Lorenc’s house in Austin was close to SolarWinds’ headquarters. He drove there and took a picture of himself in front of its sign. It would serve as a reminder of how important it was that he continue to raise a red flag about the software supply chain. But it was also a moment of validation—he had seen this coming, and he felt vindicated that his concern was justified. Maybe now people would take the problem seriously.</p>



<p>Although Google was not affected by the breach, Lorenc and his coworkers were intimately familiar with the type of attack that SolarWinds fell victim to because they had spent years building internal systems at Google to prevent it. Dan and team would end up working closely with engineers from SolarWinds to help them do the same. (The following year, when Chainguard held a conference to announce its launch, a SolarWinds engineer spoke about how instrumental Lorenc’s team had been in designing its new security system.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the question of how to entirely prevent these attacks remained: When programs are built on hundreds of thousands of lines of open-source code, how do you ensure that every line is as advertised and secure? It’s a problem so large in scale that it feels almost impossible to figure out. Luckily, that’s kind of Lorenc’s thing.</p>



 



<p>Lorenc’s love of solving difficult problems began when he was a kid, fixing up damaged stock cars with his grandfather. They’d spend hours after school and on weekends tinkering together in a small garage. Once the cars were up and running, Lorenc’s grandfather (and after he got his license, Lorenc himself) would race them in community events. When the cars would break down, they would take inventory of the problems and fix them up again. This was the part Lorenc loved most—looking at the engine as a system of parts, understanding how each one functioned and then using that knowledge to fix what wasn’t working.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In college, Lorenc pursued mechanical engineering. During his junior year he took a programming class and was hooked. “I was building stuff, but it was a lot faster,” Lorenc says. “You didn’t have to order parts and wait a week for them to ship. You could build those components yourself with a laptop, anywhere.” Software engineering offered the same thrill as fixing up old cars. “It’s that loop of trying to solve a problem, and then either seeing it work or seeing it fail miserably and getting to debug it live. You keep going and get real-time feedback until you solve it. That’s why I liked the computer world. I could do more of that in a lot less time.”</p>



<p>One of the first pieces of code he wrote was a program to solve Rubik’s cubes. The program didn’t work—it kept running without ever arriving at a solution. One of his peers laughed when he saw the code and showed Lorenc how to fix it. It was an important moment. “That’s when I realized, with programming, there’s always a solution,” Lorenc says. “It might not be obvious at first, but it’s there. You just have to find it.”</p>



<p>Lorenc began working at Microsoft soon after he graduated college. He remembers the environment as rewarding, but also stressful. There was a weekend when he and his colleagues were working overtime for an upcoming release, and during a particularly tense moment, his manager pantomimed a Monty Python sketch. Lorenc and his team broke into fits of laughter, and the mood instantly brightened. This left an impression on Lorenc: the need for a work environment that balanced hard work with humor.</p>
 



Chainguard founders Kim Lewandowski, Ville Aikas, Dan Lorenc and Matt Moore.



 
<p>“You’re doing what?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bogomil Balkansky, Chainguard’s partner at Sequoia, sat across the table from Lorenc and Moore, not sure he was hearing them right.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the months since Moore’s initial text to Lorenc at the restaurant in Austin, Chainguard had officially launched, and its founders had begun building its product and seeking out investors. Lorenc says starting a company at the beginning of 2022 wasn’t easy. Inflation was rising and a wave of layoffs at tech companies meant Lorenc would pitch Chainguard to software engineers—potential customers—one day, only to learn the following week that they had been laid off. After months of meetings, they finally gained traction. The need for supply chain security tools was too great, and companies realized they couldn’t handle the job alone.</p>



<p>Lorenc and the Chainguard team first met with Sequoia in the spring of 2022. Balkansky was impressed by Chainguard’s initial product in development, Chainguard Enforce, a program that scans containers and produces an itemized list of the code inside. Engineers can then review the list for malware and loopholes that might make the containers vulnerable to hackers. And so Balkansky was surprised to learn, just days after Sequoia’s partnership with Chainguard was finalized, that, according to Lorenc, Chainguard was in the midst of building out a far more ambitious product: Chainguard Images.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In computing, a “container image” refers to a static collection of executable code. Chainguard Images would be a library of these files, made from open-source code that Chainguard engineers would verify, sign, patch and secure. With Chainguard Images, customers would no longer have to opt for open-source code they’d found on the internet and hope for the best. Instead, they could select an image from Chainguard’s library and feel confident that their code was as advertised and could not be edited by bad actors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This was a massive undertaking, which explained Balkansky’s incredulity when he first learned of it. To execute Chainguard Images, Lorenc and his team would first have to build a Linux distribution, an operating system on which Chainguard Images could run. Balkansky had worked with other companies who had endeavored to do this but hadn’t succeeded; he knew it was an incredibly complex task that could take years to complete, and even then there was no guarantee it would work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Balkansky wasn’t the only one who was skeptical. Other software companies with thousands of engineers struggled to believe that Chainguard, with only 25 engineers, could not only build a Linux distribution, but also comb through and verify numerous libraries of code. “Yes, it seemed impossible,” Lorenc says. “Yes, just based on the sheer numbers, the lines of code we would need to pore over and adjust to make secure, it was daunting. Everyone else looked at it and saw it as too hard of a problem, too massive to actually solve. But it seemed obvious it was something we needed to do.” Lorenc shrugs, “To me, it didn’t seem impossible, it just seemed hard. And I’m okay with hard.”</p>



<p>“Hard” paid off. Lorenc and his team spent a year working tirelessly on Chainguard Images. To motivate and energize his team during long days and even longer nights and weekends, Lorenc pulled from the lesson learned at Microsoft, making sure that hours of focus were interspersed with jokes, lighthearted stories and plenty of room for laughter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Balkansky was sitting in a conference room in early 2023 when Lorenc let him know Chainguard Images was live. Balkansky’s first thought: “Pretty damn impressive.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, Chainguard has rebuilt around 80% of the open-source code most companies use, and because Chainguard is the only company offering access to this type of library, they’re racing to keep up with demand for the remaining 20%. Chainguard also takes custom orders—if a company needs a certain container specific to their product verified, Chainguard will take it on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As time consuming and challenging as building out Chainguard Images continues to be, Lorenc recognizes its payoff for users. It’s akin to building a house—yes, you can use cheap and readily available materials for construction and deal with a rickety staircase or a toilet that won’t flush later, but Chainguard’s philosophy is that it’s worth the extra time, money and labor to start with high-quality products. Lorenc believes in taking every measure possible, no matter how complicated it might be, when it comes to keeping software and its users safe.</p>



 



<p>Working in security necessitates a certain amount of paranoia—the fear of what you’ve missed, of an unseen crack or fatal flaw, is relentless. Lorenc’s use of humor to assuage the high-risk, high-anxiety environment has paid off in more ways than one. He regularly makes his own memes, many of which have gone viral within software development communities. One meme shows Ken from the Barbie movie, with the caption “My job is just CVEs.” (CVEs meaning “Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures.”) Another depicts Ned Stark from “Game of Thrones,” with a caption that reads “Brace yourselves. VEX is coming.” (VEX is an open platform for sharing information about software vulnerabilities.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lorenc’s goal in creating memes was originally to provide levity and form a community with people working in security, so he was surprised when his social media presence ended up being one of Chainguard’s most successful marketing strategies. Lorenc regularly sees his memes making rounds on LinkedIn and X, formerly Twitter. Chainguard’s TikToks are also popular among engineers, many of which feature Lorenc, in his trademark backward baseball cap, speaking to viewers as though he was guiding a friend through a casual tutorial on software security. Lorenc attributes the love for Chainguard’s social media to his users’ desire for authenticity. He’s not some faceless CEO of a corporation; he’s a software engineer, just like his customers, and he speaks their language. It’s not a traditional avenue for a security company to market itself, but Chainguard has always done things its own way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite his numerous duties as CEO, Lorenc’s favorite part of the job is still working with other engineers to solve complex and granular problems. He thinks Chainguard was able to attract some of the best engineers in the industry precisely because the company has such lofty goals. “The people on our team were drawn to the difficulty of our mission,” he says. “Smart people want to work on hard problems.” Often when people encounter what seems like an impossible series of problems, they get overwhelmed, but not Lorenc. He knows every inch of this engine, and working on it part by part, he’s confident he can get it to run.</p>

<p>While competition fosters innovation, the proliferation of different blockchains has resulted in the fragmentation and isolation of liquidity within each ecosystem. Early attempts to address this issue primarily involved bridges and wrapped assets. Unfortunately, these solutions were often vulnerable to hacks and exploits, and the value of wrapped assets was contingent on the security of the wrapper contract, rather than the underlying asset. Cross-chain swaps of native assets hold the promise of resolving liquidity fragmentation, but numerous technological challenges must be overcome to make them as seamless as same-chain swaps.</p><p>We were joined by Simon Harman, founder of Chainflip, to discuss multi-chain liquidity fragmentation and how Chainflip’s JIT AMM (Just in Time) aims to solve this, by providing cross-chain native swaps.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Simon’s background  (Legacy) Bridging vs. Threshold Signature Scheme  Chainflip’s Just in Time (JIT) AMM vs. Uniswap’s V3/X  Providing liquidity on Chainflip  Slippage and UX  Deciding trading pairs  Chainflip validators  Validator stake auctions  Governance  Roadmap and bootstrapping liquidity  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/SimonAHarman">Simon Harman on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/Chainflip">Chainflip on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Felix Lutsch.

<p>We are excited to announce the official mainnet launch of <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/">Horizen EON</a>, Horizen’s fully EVM-compatible sidechain and smart contracting platform. Developed and powered by Horizen, Horizen EON is poised to play a pivotal role in the web3 revolution. Horizen’s goal is to offer a market-leading solution to drive the industry forward – a permissionless, interoperable, customizable multi-chain network with EON being the first of many smart contracting sidechains on Horizen that will onboard the next generation of builders and users to the web3 economy!</p>



 Why Build on Horizen EON? 



<p>Horizen EON (Ethereum Open Network ) is a scalable blockchain platform optimized for streamlined and diverse dapp development. It is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, leveraging Ethereum’s vast resources and community for easy and seamless dapp deployment on Horizen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Ethereum has been driving broad adoption of DeFi ecosystems and smart contracts, Horizen has been developing its ZK-powered cross-chain protocol and horizontal scaling solution, <a href="https://www.horizen.io/zendoo/">Zendoo</a>, that allows a wider adoption of blockchain technology with full customization at the protocol level. With the addition of Horizen EON, Horizen now also opens its fast-growing ecosystem up to more opportunities for efficient development and usage of a wide range of dApps and services than ever before.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>


 
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ZBF_EVM_mainnet-build-on-EON.jpg"></a> 




 Horizen EON’s mission is to empower the next generation of Web3 developers 



<p>Focus: Horizen EON is dedicated to nurturing the next wave of Web3 developers. These are innovators eager to introduce groundbreaking web3 products, but are hindered by the limitations of existing chains, such as inadequate tooling, network congestion, centralization, and lack of growth support.</p>



<p>The EON Ecosystem: Horizen EON is committed to establishing a robust ecosystem tailored for visionaries aiming to challenge and replace the status quo by offering best-in-class launch and growth support including :</p>



 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;Comprehensive toolings that ensure seamless integrations and dapp deployment&nbsp; 



 &nbsp;&nbsp;Business development assistance 



 &nbsp;&nbsp;Access to liquidity, grants, and more. 
 



<p>The EON Identity: Horizen EON also positions itself to be the new hub for consumer dapps aimed at bridging the Web2 – Web3 divide. This ambitious goal is supported by EON’s hands-on approach to crafting an ecosystem optimized for everyday users. The EON platform is designed to provide both the technical infrastructure and a nurturing environment for builders, complete with product support and incubation.</p>



 The EON Launch is Joined by a Vibrant Range of Protocol Integrations and Partnerships 


 
 


<p></p>



<p><a href="https://eon.horizen.io/ecosystem">The Horizen EON ecosystem </a>welcomes protocols, builders, and dapps that resonate with its<a href="https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/web-assets/eon-litepaper-april-2023.pdf"> core values</a>:&nbsp; Transparency, Accountability,&nbsp; Security, Community Engagement, Continuous Growth, and Social Responsibility. </p>



<p>The EON ecosystem is launched with a wide range of protocols and dapps, providing a vibrant ecosystem for its new users starting day one. These integrations, partners and supporters include developer toolings, bridges, DeFi protocols, liquidity providers, and infrastructure essentials. Some of the integrations and supporters currently live on Horizen EON include LayerZero, Tatum, Pyth, Band Protocol, Ankr, Third web, Stably, and with many more that are forthcoming in the next few days, including SpookySwap, Chainalysis, and Granary.&nbsp;</p>



 Embrace the Web3 Revolution 



<p>Horizen EON’s foundation rests on the belief that the path to web3 adoption involves enhancing the web2 experience. It is not looking to reinvent the wheel but to optimize it, ensuring that the unique features of web3 (like Tokenization, Authentication, and Interoperability) seamlessly integrate into applications that are familiar and user-centric.</p>



<p>Across cutting-edge verticals, EON aims to support innovative application ideas that can bring the next generation of builders and consumers to web3.</p>



<p>As the world has been ushering in a new era of decentralized applications, Horizen invites developers, innovators, and users to join the Horizen EON ecosystem and work together to drive mainstream adoption of web3 technologies, foster a more connected multi-chain world, and create solutions that cater to users at every stage of the Web3 journey.</p>



<p>For more insights into this launch and the future of EON, stay tuned to the upcoming EON Mainnet Launch Summit joined by the teams behind Horizen EON and the launch integrations and partners and ambassadors of the Horizen community. </p>

  Partnering with Chkk: Your Kubernetes Co-Pilot  <p>Awais, Fawad and Ali are helping devops catch problems before they lead to downtime.</p>   
	By Bogomil Balkansky	 



Published October 25, 2023
  



Awais, Bogomil, Fawad and Ali at Sequoia.



 
<p>If you’re building an application hosted in the cloud today, there’s a very good chance it’s running on Kubernetes. In fact, a 2021 <a href="https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2022/02/10/cncf-sees-record-kubernetes-and-container-adoption-in-2021-cloud-native-survey/">survey</a> by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) found an impressive 96% of organizations using or evaluating K8s—and as ever-more business-critical apps land on the platform, its uptime and availability have become a top concern for Platform Engineering, SRE and DevOps teams. But some of Kubernetes’ main strengths, its flexibility and its vibrant ecosystem of add-ons, come with a price: complexity. Navigating the multiple configs and tracking intricate dependencies, across multiple layers and multiple add-on solutions, is not for the light-hearted. A typical Kubernetes footprint is not a single platform or product; rather, it is a complex environment built using components from add-ons in the CNCF ecosystem, many of them open source, and some of them commercial products. Each add-on has its own release and upgrade schedule.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The seams between these products are where failures most often occur, and most current tooling is designed to address problems after the fact—meaning devops and SREs get stuck in fire-fighting mode. This reactive troubleshooting is both painful and resource-intensive, with even mundane config changes and upgrades taking a lot of time and effort.</p>



<p>But what if you could add a proactive tool to your toolbelt, to warn you about potential issues—and help you fix them—before they ever lead to downtime? That tantalizing possibility is now a reality with <a href="https://www.chkk.io/">Chkk</a>, a first-of-its-kind platform that allows enterprises to identify and address availability risks and upgrade their Kubernetes deployments safely, quickly and with confidence. Think of it like the X-ray that diagnoses your health issue early on—so it doesn’t land you in the ER.</p>



<p>Chkk co-founders Awais Nemat, Fawad Khaliq and Ali Khayam took inspiration from best practices in cybersecurity, where security vulnerabilities are reported publicly. Similarly, Chkk is building a database of availability risks by tracking the behavior of hundreds of Kubernetes projects. Powered by this innovative Collective Learning technology, the platform then continuously scans your environment to find and prioritize risks and prevent disruptions—and even creates pre-verified plans to reduce upgrade time from weeks to days. Teams learn from other’s mistakes so they don’t repeat them, and developers spend far less of their valuable time putting out fires.</p>



<p>Awais, Fawad and Ali are a founding dream team who worked together for more than a decade, including at AWS and on the team that built Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), and they understand the challenges Platform, SRE and DevOps teams are facing firsthand. Now, they’re on a mission to solve those same problems for all developers, and we at Sequoia are thrilled to support them and lead this seed round. With their Kubernetes Availability Platform now in general availability and with more infrastructure teams adopting Kubernetes every day, we believe this is just the beginning—for Chkk’s growing team, and for the indispensable technology they’re building.</p>

<p>Stablecoins represent a safe haven against crypto’s volatility, allowing participants to remain in the market, without off-ramping to fiat. While the major stablecoins are centrally issued (e.g. USDT, USDC, BUSD), there is a pressing need for an algorithmic variant or a synthetic dollar asset. (DAI is somewhere in between since approximately 50% of its collateral is USDC). After Luna’s collapse, many jumped to point out its design flaws, yet such a concept would be crucial for crypto’s decentralisation and self-sustainability. Arthur Hayes proposed an interesting concept of NAKA synthetic dollar (NUSD), backed by Bitcoin and its inverse perpetual swap short. However, yield generation on $BTC is significantly lower than that of $ETH. A sustainable yield would help balance the cases in which funding rates would be negative (a minority in crypto).</p><p>We were joined by Guy Young, co-founder of Ethena, to discuss the stablecoin landscape and their synthetic eUSD, backed by staked ETH and its inverse perpetual swap.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Guy’s background and founding Ethena  The history of stablecoins  The stablecoin trilemma and transparency  eUSD synthetic dollar mechanics  Ethena’s insurance fund and hedging  Minimising the impact of depegging  Leveraging centralised liquidity while maintaining self custody through MPC  User experience  Risk factors  CEX vs. DEX: liquidity, infrastructure, UX  The potential of fixed return rates  Supply &amp; rates equilibrium  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/leptokurtic_">Guy Young on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ethena_labs">Ethena Labs on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/dust-on-crust-300d4b5cf3ec">Arthur Hayes' article proposing the Naka synthetic dollar</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Felix Lutsch.

    <p>Q3 2023 was full of growth and exciting milestones for the Horizen ecosystem! The Horizen DAO went live and the core team launched the Alpha version of Horizen’s EVM sidechain, EON on mainnet. This alpha launch has activated increased developer activity and&nbsp; BD partnerships – watch out for more news in the coming weeks!</p>
<p>We look forward to another fruitful and productive quarter!</p>
<p></p>
 Launch of the Horizen DAO 
<p></p>
<p>Last month, the Horizen DAO officially launched, marking the beginning of a new era of participatory governance for the Horizen community!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Horizen is an open-source, public protocol with a broad and diverse ecosystem that includes developers, miners, node operators, and $ZEN holders across multiple blockchain networks. The launch of the Horizen DAO makes it easier for Horizen community members to get involved in governance and make their voices heard in the direction of the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Detailed information about Horizen DAO, including the improvement proposal phases, voting process, Constitution, and more, can be found on <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/about">the Horizen Governance page</a>. So check out the site and get involved to help shape the future of Horizen–we’re glad you’re along for the journey!<br><br><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/introducing-horizen-dao/">Learn more about the Horizen DAO launch in our blog post.</a></p>
 Horizen EON Alpha Launch&nbsp; 
<p>On August 1st, Horizen EON Alpha was activated on mainnet, marking the beginning of the on-boarding phase for launch partners &amp; early builders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All Horizen EON documentation can be found in our <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/">documentation hub</a>, featuring content around different network environments, developing and deploying smart contracts, staking, service providers, and tutorials.</p>
<p>The core team has also worked to release a new software upgrade that adds a new voting power contract for the Horizen DAO governance, improved the node synchronization speed, and enhanced security&nbsp; features.</p>
 Horizen EON Q3 Partnerships and Integrations 
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-partners-with-wanchain-to-expand-cross-chain-interoperability-for-eon-horizens-evm-compatible-smart-contracting-platform/">Wanchain Expanding Cross-Chain Interoperability for EON</a></p>
<p>Wanchain is an R&amp;D-focused blockchain interoperability project whose mission is to drive blockchain adoption through interoperability by building fully decentralized bridges that connect the world’s many siloed blockchain networks.</p>
<p>This collaboration will enhance Horizen EON’s potential by adding it to the roster of chains that users can bridge their funds to using Wanchain.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-partners-with-tatum-to-enabling-blockchain-application-development-and-integrations-on-eon-horizens-evm-compatible-smart-contracting-platform/">Tatum Enabling Blockchain Application Development And Integrations On EON</a></p>
<p>This collaboration aims to make it much easier for developers to build using Horizen ecosystem by integrating Tatum’s easy-to-use blockchain development tools and framework. By leveraging Tatum, Horizen EON will offer developers the ability to seamlessly integrate blockchain functionalities into their applications, coded in JavaScript.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-and-pyth-network-join-forces-to-amplify-decentralized-oracle-services-for-eon-horizens-evm-compatible-smart-contracting-platform/">Pyth Network Amplifying Decentralized Oracle Services For EON</a></p>
<p>Pyth Network is a specialized oracle solution, to provide decentralized oracle services for EON. This collaboration will bring accurate and trusted on-chain market data to EON, empowering developers to enhance their smart contract capabilities and expand the possibilities for DeFi, gaming, and NFT applications.</p>
 Horizen EON Welcomes NTT DATA, Joining The Network As A Certificate Signer Node To Support The Growth And Security Of The EON Network 
<p>Last month, a leading IT service provider and global innovation partner, NTT DATA, is deploying a Horizen EON blockchain Certificate Signer Node on the NTT DATA infrastructure, which will contribute proactively to the credibility, security, and robustness of the Horizen EON network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Horizen EON chain will have a total of 47 certificate signer nodes. These signer nodes provide credibility to the transactions on the EON chain and ensure decentralization. They are responsible for signing backward transfer requests allowing the flow of ZEN from the EON chain to the Horizen mainchain.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-eon-welcomes-ntt-data-joining-the-network-as-a-certificate-signer-node/?utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=marketing+EON">Learn more about this announcement here.&nbsp;</a></p>
 Q3 Core Software Releases 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/new-software-release-eon-1-0-0-is-available-to-download-now/">EON 1.0.0 Release</a></p>
 
 EON 1.0.0 is used for GOBI Testnet nodes and EON Mainnet nodes. Deployment guides can be found at <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/develop_and_deploy_smart_contracts/local_build_and_deploy">EON Documentation</a>. 
 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/node-software-upgrade-zen-4-1-0-is-available-to-download/">Node Software Upgrade ZEN 4.1.0</a></p>
<p>Learn more about ZEN 4.1.0 in <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/node-software-upgrade-zen-4-1-0-is-available-to-download/">our blog post.&nbsp;</a></p>
 ZenIP 42206 – Redirecting Secure Node Rewards into Horizen EON 
<p></p>
<p>Horizen’s Community Council has recently submitted <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/zenip_42204-draft/zenip_42206.md">ZenIP 42206</a>, which proposes a redirect of the portion of the Horizen mainchain block reward currently paid to Secure Nodes to an EON Forger Subsidy Fund. The purpose is to drive the success of the Horizen EON network by increasing the security and decentralization of the network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zendoo has increased the requirements of mainchain nodes so that the Secure Node minimum requirements are no longer sufficient to provide any benefit to the Horizen chain. Furthermore, with the removal of the shielded pools on the mainchain, the need for Secure Nodes is diminished. The subpar performance and the lack of usage of Secure Nodes pose a burden to the chain.</p>
<p>ZenIPs are for the community to approve or decline. Please join the conversation and make this decision with us. <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42206-explained-redirect-horizen-secure-node-rewards-into-horizen-eon/">Learn more about ZenIP 42206 </a>and let us know what you think by submitting the community survey:</p>

 Community Voting Proposals 
<p>During Q3, the Horizen ecosystem saw a few different community voting proposals ongoing. Featuring a proposal for <a href="https://debank.com/proposal/15639">Rabby Wallet to support the EON chain</a>, Tally, a leading DAO tool to join the EON chain, and a request for Phantom Wallet to integrate with EON.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also saw a proposal to deploy Synapse on Horizen EON, this deployment aims to establish connectivity between the Horizen Ecosystem and a wide range of popular Layer 1 and Layer 2 chains connected to the Synapse Bridge.&nbsp;</p>
 Node Growth 
<p></p>

<p>The hype of web3 in marketing has entered the chat. More and more businesses from various industries turn towards leveraging web3 opportunities within their marketing campaigns. To put this into reality, so has the <a href="https://www.glossy.co/beauty/how-loreal-is-gearing-up-for-the-metaverse/">L’Oréal Group</a> utilised the variety of web3 in several of their latest marketing campaigns, especially the metaverse, gamification as well as NFT drops. As more companies seek innovative ways to connect with audiences, the marketing department often takes the lead in experimenting with these modern approaches. Let’s dive in and explore what web3 means for the future of marketing.</p>



 Traditional vs. Web3 Marketing: Effectiveness&nbsp; 



<p>In the dynamic landscape of marketing, two distinct paradigms emerge: web3 marketing and traditional marketing. Web3 marketing harnesses cutting-edge technologies like blockchain to empower users with greater control over their digital presence. In contrast, traditional marketing relies on established channels and centralisation. Web3 marketing is an unchartered field with creative means of disrupting traditional marketing models. The characteristics of web3 marketing are (logically) close to what benefits web3 can offer in general:</p>



 
 Decentralisation  



 Transparency  



 Tokenisation  



 Community  



 Ownership  
 



<p>Especially decentralisation is the pillar that differentiates web3 marketing from traditional marketing practices. Decentralisation is giving individuals control over their data. This shift creates a cooperative and mutually beneficial environment, strengthening the bond between brands and consumers.</p>







<p>When evaluating the effectiveness of web3 marketing in both the short and long term, one key aspect stands out: customer loyalty. Ultimately, it’s the bedrock of long-term success in web3 marketing. Without a loyal customer base, your marketing endeavors lack purpose. While many aspects of web3 may currently seem like mere buzzwords, the cultivation of a strong community sets apart effective web3 marketing from fleeting traditional campaigns (through e.g., print, radio, TV, or social media), as the latter often yield only short-term results. By embracing the user-centric essence of Web3 technologies, businesses can lay the foundation for long-lasting effectiveness. This approach enables them to cultivate trust and engagement with their consumer base, and forge meaningful connections with their target audience, ultimately leading to sustainable marketing success in the long run. One of many ways to achieve this is through, e.g., the introduction of loyalty programs, to keep customers hooked and committed.</p>



 Community-centricity: Reinvented brand-customer power dynamics 



 The community 



<p>“Commonality is a purpose, meets frequency of touch” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3qu5KQJGCs">Swan Sit – web3 developer</a>). Establishing meaningful connections between a brand and its customers is a fundamental objective in marketing. This involves not only targeting customers who align with the brand’s values but also striving for maximum customer engagement. What sets web3 marketing apart is its participatory nature, where customers are not only part of a group but actively engage within that collective. Furthermore, the notion of tangible value comes into play, as the community can receive incentives or rewards from the brand they support, fostering a sense of pride in being part of that specific community. How these incentives could look like, is touched upon later in the article (see NFTs).</p>



<p>Navigating the integration of web3 into your marketing practices may encounter resistance from existing communities that are resistant to change. To overcome potential backlash, open and transparent communication is essential. Engage with your community, address their concerns, and emphasise how the shift to web3 benefits them. Demonstrating a clear understanding of their needs and a commitment to preserving what they value can help ease the transition. Additionally, gradual implementation and education about the advantages of web3 can mitigate resistance and pave the way for a smoother transition, ultimately ensuring the long-term success of your brand’s evolution.</p>



 New power dynamics  



<p>In today’s evolving landscape, we can witness a shift in power dynamics, where the consumer takes a central stage and wields a more significant influence on brand decisions. This represents a stark departure from the traditional paradigm where brands held the upper hand, often due to information imbalances. Web3 technology is a game-changer in this context, offering the potential to rebalance these dynamics. What’s particularly noteworthy is the active involvement of brands in these online communities, signifying a fundamental transformation in how businesses approach marketing.</p>



<p>In this new era, understanding your audience and constructing strategies tailored to their preferences and behaviours becomes paramount. It’s a shift towards a more consumer-centric approach, where the community’s voice plays a crucial role in shaping brand decisions and forging stronger, mutually beneficial relationships.</p>



<p>Web3 technology, thanks to its transparent and authentic nature, helps build trust between brands and consumers. Using blockchain, brands can provide proof of where their products come from, their authenticity, and their sustainability, giving consumers the information they need to make informed decisions. In this context, deceptive marketing practices struggle to gain traction, highlighting how important transparency and authenticity are in web3 marketing. This shift represents a significant departure from traditional marketing, fostering a more genuine and accountable connection between brands and their audiences.</p>



 The web3 marketing trends 



<p>Web3 marketing allows for various new trends, which enrich ways of doing marketing:&nbsp;</p>



 
 NFTs 



 Virtual experiences 



 Decentralised (social media) platforms  
 



 NFTs 



<p>A Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is a one-of-a-kind digital asset, which replicates real-life items in the form of e.g., art or music and can be sold or bought online. NFTs have gained popularity as a means for brands to enter the web3 marketing space, and hold the promise of serving as valuable bridges between brands and their communities.</p>



<p>NFTs serve a dual purpose:</p>



 
 NFTs can expand the current audience of the brand, and reel those in, that show a clear interest in the web3 space.&nbsp; 



 Additionally, they can also be harnessed for branding and communication strategies. Businesses can use NFTs as a means to incentivise their fans and followers. Within the NFT ecosystem, the range of possibilities is vast: this includes providing discounts, delivering rewarding products, or crafting unique digital items exclusively available to members of the NFT community. 
 



<p>To put this into reality, <a href="https://raritysniper.com/news/adidas-tokenproof-partnership-to-reward-loyal-nft-holders/">Adidas</a> has explored web3 marketing through NFTs. They recently collaborated with Tokengate, where an NFT loyalty program grants access to exclusive Adidas sneakers. Furthermore, Adidas has also teamed up with the Doodles collection and had a partnership with Pharrell &amp; Adidas for an exclusive Samba sneaker drop.</p>



 Virtual experiences 



<p>One of the major trends within web3 marketing revolves around creating virtual experiences, primarily through the metaverse or Virtual Reality (VR). The core concept of such, in a marketing sense, is to offer a fluid experience that seamlessly bridges the gap between the physical and virtual worlds. This enables users to engage with both one another and digital elements in real time, soaking up the person into the action. As previously mentioned, consumers are part of a brand experience, giving them a sense of belonging to the particular brand, as well as active participation in the experience. This emotional side of marketing can often be more important than the actual physical product being sold.</p>



<p>In November of 2021, Nike solidified its position in the nascent metaverse with the launch of <a href="https://www.nike.com/kids/nikeland-roblox">Nikeland</a>, a branded virtual interactive space, marking a significant step in blending sales, marketing, and gaming.</p>



 Decentralised (social media) platforms  



<p>Worries regarding privacy and the handling of personal data have surged, and the demand for replacing platforms is growing. Think of web3 as the rebel of the internet world, challenging the status quo. It’s all about giving you, the user, the reins to control your online experience. Unlike those traditional social media giants that hoard your data on their servers, web3 rides on blockchain technology, creating decentralised networks where you are the data owner. Privacy, anonymity, security, and ownership are redefined in web3 (social media) marketing, creating a more trustworthy digital ecosystem.</p>



 Conclusion: Embrace the shift  



<p>As we navigate the evolving landscape of marketing, it’s crucial for brands to adapt and embrace the shift towards integrating web3 into their practices. This means staying true to your brand’s core values while modifying your existing products or services to align with the futuristic space. In this context, experimentation is not an option; it’s a necessity. Embracing web3 in your marketing strategies is the path forward to ensure your brand remains relevant and competitive in an ever-changing digital world.</p>

<p>One of the best known memes in crypto is: 'Not your keys, not your coins'. This usually resurfaces whenever a (custodial) centralised exchange is hacked or goes bust altogether. Although Web3 provides the infrastructure for self custody, this often shares the fate of Pandora. Self-custody requires increased security measures, from both end-users, as well as application developers. Web3 wallets are the interface between users and decentralised applications deployed on blockchains. While Metamask still maintains the largest market share, a multitude of wallets have emerged, promising additional features and a better UX.</p><p>We were joined by Evgeny Yurtaev, co-founder &amp; CEO of Zerion, to discuss the challenges of building a Web3 wallet and how Zerion aims to improve user experience, while still maintaining security.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Evgeny’s background  The motivation behind building a Web3 wallet  Zerion UX and security  Seed phrase storing  Zerion user profile  Challenges in building a new wallet app  Protecting users and potential attack vectors  Supported blockchains and (seamless) bridging  Account abstraction and MPC  Business models for Web3 wallets  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/evgeth_">Evgeny Yurtaev on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/zerion">Zerion on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Friederike Ernst.

<p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>It’s the end of the month again! Here’s a round-up of everything that went down this September.</p> Tech Updates  v1 Testnet update <p>Stage 2 of our v1 Testnet is still in the making. This Stage is predominantly about converting Panther Reward Points to $zZKP. The introduction of an additional feature ("vouchers") will enable users to test this conversion while remaining in a testnet environment, an addition that slightly differs from this Stage's original design. The function is still undergoing internal testing.</p><p>Concurrently, Stage 3 work has already started and is in progress. This Stage will be centered around depositing assets into Shielded Pools.</p><p>We're excited to get Panther v1 in your hands. Look out for more updates on the Testnet launch in the coming weeks!</p> Update to the Stage 1 Testnet’s url <p>As we progress on the above, we have updated the link for Stage 1 on our Testnet information repository. The new version contains a few tweaks and upgrades.</p><p>To access it, go to: <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet/testnet-stages?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet/testnet-stages</a></p> Comparing Panther’s approach to ‘Privacy Pools’ <p>The recent <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4563364&amp;download=yes&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Privacy Pools paper</a> struck a chord with the Web3 community. It's clear that preserving users' privacy in a compliant way is crucial for the mass adoption of decentralized technologies.&nbsp;</p><p>After carefully reviewing the paper by <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Vitalik Buterin</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ameensol?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Ameen Soleimani</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mat_nadler?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Mat Nadler</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/chainalysis?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Chainalysis</a>' J. Illum, and <a href="https://twitter.com/fschaer?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Fabien Schär</a>, we wrote an article comparing Panther's solutions to ‘Privacy Pools’.&nbsp;</p><p>Both protocols attempt to exclude bad actors from a privacy-preserving system based on disclosures that can be legally adopted. However, although there are clear similarities, there are also key differences in how we tackle this challenge.&nbsp;</p><p>Read our in-depth analysis:</p><p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol-privacy-pools-approaches-compared/">https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol-privacy-pools-approaches-compared/</a></p>We analyze Panther's solutions against ‘Privacy Pools’, both aiming to exclude malicious actors from privacy-preserving systems. Integrating PureFi as Panther’s first accredited compliance integration <p>Although PureFi’s integration into v1 had already been approved by the Panther DAO, this month we formalized it with an announcement. With this, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol-joins-forces-with-purefi-to-enable-compliance-in-prifi/">PureFi joins Panther in enabling compliant DeFi privacy</a>.</p><p>Privacy integrations enable Panther to:</p>  Improve its decentralization  Apply compliance at a protocol level  Provide on-chain support for ZK-compatible attestations &amp; signatures  <p>These&nbsp; integrations also prioritize neutrality. Through our team’s collaboration with compliance providers like PureFi Protocol, they will be able to issue zero-knowledge proofs for Panther users that submit their data and achieve passing AML scores, ensuring Panther remains uninformed of user data.</p><p>Integrating third-party compliance tools like PureFi underscores Panther's dedication to shaping a DeFi ecosystem where privacy tools are normalized and malicious actors are diligently screened out.</p>PureFi &amp; Panther’s integration illustrated. Ecosystem  Panel with PureFi <p>We hosted a meeting with PureFi Protocol to discuss our upcoming v1 integration.</p><p>Panther’s CEO Oliver Gale, CTO Anish Mohammed, and Head of Product Saif Akhtar joined PureFi’s CEO Slava Demchuk, CTO Mykhailo Tiutin, and COO Vasily Vidmanov to break down the complexities of the integration and answer all your questions.&nbsp;</p><p>This was a great opportunity to showcase how Panther and PureFi are working together to make privacy-preserving DeFi a no-brainer.</p><p>You can listen back to this Twitter Spaces at:</p> <blockquote><p>We'll be hosting a panel with <a href="https://twitter.com/PureFi_Protocol?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@PureFi_Protocol</a> to discuss our v1 integration!<br><br>We'll have Panther CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/OriginalOlii?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@OriginalOlii</a>, CTO <a href="https://twitter.com/anishmohammed?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@anishmohammed</a>, Product Head <a href="https://twitter.com/saifonblock?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@saifonblock</a> with CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/demchukvm?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@demchukvm</a> , CTO <a href="https://twitter.com/mtiutin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@mtiutin</a> and COO Vasily Vidmanov from PureFi.<br><br>Set a reminder: <a href="https://t.co/HXZ3933KX8?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">https://t.co/HXZ3933KX8</a></p>— Panther Protocol (@ZKPanther) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther/status/1708924109906727164?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">October 2, 2023</a></blockquote>

<p>Danny Ryan is a coordinator at the Ethereum Foundation. He’s been on Bankless many times before. Usually, we’re talking about the Ethereum roadmap and what’s coming next. This time we’re talking about something different…a risk to Ethereum that Danny sees. A little over a year ago, Danny wrote a blog post titled “The Risk of LSDs”... discussing the various risk vectors that a dominant LSD presents to Ethereum…even naming Lido specifically in the process.&nbsp;</p> <p>------ ✨ DEBRIEF | Ryan &amp; David unpacking the episode: <a href="https://www.bankless.com/debrief-danny-ryan">https://www.bankless.com/debrief-danny-ryan</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ A lot of people have decided that liquid staking with Lido is the place to do it. At the time of recording Lido has over 30% of all staked Ether. Does this present a systemic risk to Ethereum?</p> <p>We did an episode called, “In Defense of Lido” with researcher Hasu who argued that Lido does not pose a systemic risk to Ethereum. In fact, Lido’s dominance is better than many other alternatives. We left that conversation half-finished when we published it in August 2023.&nbsp;</p> <p>In today’s episode, we cover part two of that debate with Ethereum researcher and guest Danny Ryan who argues the opposite. Lido is a systemic risk to Ethereum and what to do about it.</p> <p>We believe our role as podcasters for issues like this is to voice both sides of the argument in long-form conversations and healthy debate. It is exactly the kind of thing you don’t get on Twitter. That’s why we’ve given voice to both sides of this issue.&nbsp;</p> <p>We think there are good actors who care about this ecosystem at Lido and in the broader Ethereum community and we’re sure this episode won’t be the last word on this subject.</p> <p>----- 🏹 Airdrop Hunter is HERE, join your first HUNT today <a href="https://bankless.cc/JoinYourFirstHUNT">https://bankless.cc/JoinYourFirstHUNT</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ 📣 a16z Startup School | Apply Before Oct. 20th <a href="https://bankless.cc/a16z-startup-school">https://bankless.cc/a16z-startup-school</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>🐙KRAKEN | MOST-TRUSTED CRYPTO EXCHANGE ⁠<a href="https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2%C2%A0%20%E2%81%A0">https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2&nbsp; ⁠</a></p> <p>🦊METAMASK PORTFOLIO | MANAGE YOUR WEB3 EVERYTHING <a>⁠https://bankless.cc/MetaMask&nbsp;</a></p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM ⁠<a href="https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a></p> <p>🗣️TOKU | CRYPTO EMPLOYMENT SOLUTION <a href="https://bankless.cc/Toku">https://bankless.cc/Toku</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🦄UNISWAP | ON-CHAIN MARKETPLACE ⁠<a href="https://bankless.cc/uniswap">https://bankless.cc/uniswap&nbsp;</a></p> <p>🔗 CELO | CEL2 COMING SOON <a href="https://bankless.cc/Celo">https://bankless.cc/Celo</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ TIMESTAMPS</p> <p>0:00 Intro 7:41 Is Lido a Threat to Ethereum 8:57 &nbsp;Blog Post Thinking Change? 19:30 Uniswap 21:20 Theoretical Main Risks 25:45 God Mode&nbsp; 27:20 Practical Main Risks 34:00 Hasu Counter-Arguments&nbsp; 38:25 Permissionless Validator Set Mitigation 42:30 Veto Power Mitigation Argument 46:55 How Likely is the Lido Risk? 51:26 Client Team Positioning&nbsp; 55:00 How Special is the Lido Case?&nbsp; 57:45 One LST Inevitability &nbsp; 1:02:30 Solutions&nbsp; 1:06:55 Profit Maximization&nbsp; 1:09:00 Action Steps For Ethereum Decentralization&nbsp; 1:11:53 Can Ethereum Devs Do Something?&nbsp; 1:20:10 Hasu Questions Answered by Danny&nbsp; 1:22:45 Magnitude of the Lido Threat 1:24:20 How Can Lido Fix This?&nbsp; 1:25:59 Stick &amp; Carrot for Lido 1:26:27 Silverlining of Lido Threat 1:29:05 Next Conversations&nbsp; 1:32:16 Closing &amp; Disclaimers &nbsp;</p> <p>----- RESOURCES</p> <p>Danny Ryan <a href="https://twitter.com/dannyryan">https://twitter.com/dannyryan</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Danny Ryan Blog Post <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd">https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Hasu’s Bankless Interview <a href="https://youtu.be/IfuUdIblfrY">https://youtu.be/IfuUdIblfrY</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>----- Not financial or tax advice.

<p>Back in 2017, there was no DeFi as we know it today, yet MakerDAO were already envisioning and building towards what they thought to be a certainty. The backbone of DeFi is represented by stable coins, and MakerDAO quickly understood this: they set out to build a decentralised stable coin, $DAI (and its precursor $SAI). Being collateral-backed, the smart contract needs to know the value of that collateral, but any off-chain price data is not readily available on-chain. This is where oracles come in and provide data feeds on-chain. MakerDAO’s internal oracle has been active since 2017 on Ethereum and has recently branched out, forming Chronicle. By using aggregated Schnorr signatures, Chronicle solves the problem of oracle cost-efficient scaling.</p><p>We were joined by Niklas Kunkel, founder of Chronicle, to discuss the challenges and tradeoffs that oracles regularly face, and how Chronicle is solving them, continuing the ethos of early MakerDAO.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Niklas’ background and the early days of MakerDAO  How MakerDAO evolved over time and the adoption of DAI  MakerDAO’s core principles  Why Chronicle branched out from MakerDAO  Oracle challenges &amp; tradeoffs  Oracle validators  Business model for oracles  Providing oracle services to different blockchains  Schnorr signatures  Chronicle’s supported chains and oracle offerings  Real-world assets (RWA) and credit delegation  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/nomos_paradox">Niklas Kunkel on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ChronicleLabs">Chronicle on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/MakerDAO">Maker DAO on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Sebastien Couture &amp; Felix Lutsch.

<p><code>zcashd</code> 5.7.0 deprecates <code>fetch-params.sh</code> and <code>zcash-fetch-params</code> and bundles zk-SNARK parameters directly so they do not need to be downloaded or stored separately.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unless you need to generate transactions using the deprecated Sprout shielded pool, you can delete the parameter files stored in these directories to save space, as they are no longer read or used by <code>zcashd</code>: </p>



 
 <code>~/.zcash-params</code>&nbsp;(on Linux); or 



 <code>~/Library/Application Support/ZcashParams</code>&nbsp;(on Mac); or 



 <code>C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\ZcashParams</code>&nbsp;(on Windows) 
 



<p>If you do wish to use the Sprout pool, you will need the <code>sprout-groth16.params</code> currently available for download <a href="https://download.z.cash/downloads/sprout-groth16.params">here</a>.</p>



<p>Additionally, 5.7.0 reports new mempool metrics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>All node operators, which include our mining and other ecosystem partners, should upgrade to this latest version as soon as possible. Please note that version 5.6.1 will expire on or around Wednesday, October 11.</p>



<p>Additional changes have been included in this release. For technical details, please read the full release notes available at <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/releases/tag/v5.7.0">https://github.com/zcash/zcash/releases/tag/v5.7.0</a>.</p>

							<p>Over the past few months, members of the Zcash community have begun discussing what should happen after the current Dev Fund sunsets in late 2024. The Zcash Foundation (ZF) looks forward to supporting the Zcash community in debating and deciding whether or not to institute a new ecosystem funding mechanism.&nbsp;</p><p>As a party to the Zcash <a href="https://zfnd.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Zcash_Trademark_Donation_and_License_Agreement_20191106.pdf">Trademark Donation and License Agreement</a>, ZF is committed to enacting the clear consensus of the Zcash community when it comes to approving and implementing proposed changes to the Zcash protocol (aka network upgrades). The introduction of a new funding mechanism to replace (or extend) the current Dev Fund falls within this remit, as it would involve a change to the Zcash protocol.</p><p>Therefore, ZF proposes that we follow a similar approach to the tried and tested process that resulted in the creation and adoption of ZIP 1014.&nbsp;</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 History Lesson: How the first Dev Fund was created 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>During 2019, the Zcash community began discussions about what should happen after the end of the Founders Reward in late 2020. In August 2019, the Zcash Foundation set forth a <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcash-foundation-guidance-on-dev-fund-proposals/">process and timeline</a>, and described how it would assess community sentiment towards proposals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Community members drafted <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/future-of-zcash-dev-funding-megathread-everything-in-one-place/34063">twenty proposals</a>. Following extensive community debate, these twenty were whittled down to thirteen (preserved in the <a href="https://zips.z.cash/">Zcash ZIPs repository</a>, as ZIPs 1001 thru 1013), which were presented to the community in November 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Community sentiment was gathered using three mechanisms:&nbsp;</p>
 
 a <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/68dcd8ba-08b5-11ea-95c2-1a34a475f69c/view">poll of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel</a> (previously known as the Community Governance Panel or CGP), in which 48 people voted, 
 a <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/community-sentiment-collection-poll-on-nu4-dev-fund-zips/35439/">forum poll</a>, in which people who had joined the forum before March 2019 were eligible to vote, and in which 71 people voted, and 
 a <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/staked-poll-on-zcash-dev-fund-debate/34846/7">staked poll</a> of coinholders (in which <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AHq-KoiE0mKmllcr_LTwS5tNacf5HHt_VFKPL_tYlHU/edit#gid=0">over 105,000 ZEC was staked for polling purposes by 17 distinct Zcash addresses</a>).&nbsp; 
 
 &nbsp; 
<p>ZF also <a href="https://zfnd.org/restarting-community-sentiment-collection-for-dev-fund-proposals/#on-miner-signaling">invited miners to signal their sentiment</a> but no miners did so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results of the ZCAP (CGP), forum (F), and staked poll (CH) can be found <a href="https://electriccoin.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Dev-Fund-Results.pdf">here</a>&nbsp;(with credit to ECC for creating the graphic).&nbsp;</p>
<p>ZF and ECC worked together to draft a new, mutually-agreeable proposal based on the proposals that had received the most support from the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result was a draft of <a href="https://zfnd.org/polling-community-sentiment-on-zip-1014/">ZIP 1014</a>, which proposed instituting a Dev Fund, consisting of 20% of newly minted coins and lasting until the next halving event (projected for late 2024).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In January 2020, two mechanisms were used to assess community sentiment regarding ZIP 1014, and to decide on some final details, including how the Dev Fund should be divided among its recipients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Zcash Foundation conducted a <a href="https://zfnd.org/polling-community-sentiment-on-zip-1014/">combined poll</a> of users who participated in the forum poll during the first round of community sentiment gathering, alongside the pre-existing Zcash Community Advisory Panel. This combined group numbered 119, and <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/43b9bec8-39a1-11ea-914c-b6e34ffa859a/view">88 voted in the poll</a>, which approved ZIP 1014 by 77 votes to 11.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/staked-poll-on-zcash-dev-fund-debate/34846/111">staked poll</a> of coinholders was coordinated by Zooko and Andrew Miller, in which 24 distinct Zcash addresses staked over 119,000 ZEC for the purposes of the poll. All but one of the participants in this poll (representing 99.9% of the staked coins) voted to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSlHXhA_NoJy0RW3Gc6YY3bmYcKT_YF8oS_BrSkBnvEGGaJ56WYo7iL_9shuoh-z_DZMYojA6FpLoJv/pubhtml">approve ZIP 1014</a>.</p>
<p>ZF and ECC subsequently agreed that ZIP 1014 should be implemented in the Zcash protocol, and it duly activated in November 2020.&nbsp;</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			  Process and Timeline for Submitting Proposals 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>Both ZF and ECC agree that it is desirable to gain clarity regarding the future of funding in the Zcash ecosystem sooner, rather than later. Therefore, we aim to conduct a first round of community sentiment gathering by polling ZCAP in December (alongside the Zcash Community Grants election).&nbsp;</p><p>With that in mind, teams and organisations that are interested in receiving protocol funding should publicly announce their interest as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>As with the process that led to ZIP 1014, we invite community members to post proposals to the Zcash community forums, in the form of a draft ZIP for review and discussion by the community.</p><p>We will consult with the ZIP editors on whether they are willing to provide editorial feedback on the draft ZIPs (something that Daira and str4d did last time, and which was very useful in clarifying the proposals), and, if so, what deadline would be appropriate for submitting pull requests to the ZIPs Github repo in time for a December round of community sentiment gathering.&nbsp;</p><p>We will host community calls where specific proposals can be discussed, and the community can ask questions of those who are putting forward proposals.&nbsp;</p><p>After the first round of voting, we will assess the results and, if necessary, do further rounds of proposal revision and sentiment-gathering, in order to zero in on a proposal that we are confident represents the clear consensus of the Zcash community</p><p>While we don’t currently intend to formally analyze sentiment beyond the ZCAP poll, we are interested to hear suggestions and ideas&nbsp; for other means of assessing community sentiment, and we will consider other forms of community feedback collected by other parties if it is valuable and informative, and was collected in good faith.</p><p>If you have suggestions or ideas, please post them to the Zcash Community Forum, in the Governance category.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 A Note on Impartiality 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>We at the Zcash Foundation believe that the work we have carried out over the past few years has been of benefit to Zcash and the Zcash community. We hope that the Zcash community agrees, and is willing to continue funding the work of the Foundation.</p><p>However, for the avoidance of any doubt, if the Zcash community decides that the Dev Fund should end and not be replaced (or that it should be replaced but that ZF should not receive any funding), ZF will support that decision, and do what is necessary to enact it (including implementing the new consensus rules in Zebra).&nbsp;</p><p>If the Zcash community does decide to create a new Dev Fund, ZF recommends furthering the decentralization of the Zcash ecosystem by increasing the number of Dev Fund recipients, with at least one recipient in a jurisdiction outside the United States. We also recommend that any new recipients should be nonprofit entities with tax-exempt status, that are subject to legally-enforceable governance requirements similar to those required of&nbsp; 501(c)(3) organizations (e.g. prohibition of private inurement, restrictions on excessive executive compensation, financial disclosure requirements to ensure transparency and accountability).&nbsp;</p><p>We look forward to helping the Zcash community reach consensus on this important decision, which will have a far-reaching impact on the future of Zcash!</p>

							<p>In August, we invited applications for the <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcash-minor-grants-round-2/">second round of the Zcash Minor Grants program</a>. This program is aimed at individuals and teams who are seeking funding of up to $25,000 for work that benefits Zcash, or other approaches to financial privacy, in line with our charitable purpose. The total budget for this round of Minor Grants is $75,000.</p><p>Minor Grant applications are submitted to a poll of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP). To be eligible for funding, applications must receive greater than 50% approval in the poll, and grants will be funded in order of priority determined by the level of ZCAP’s approval, and as the total budget ($75,000) permits.</p><p>We’re pleased to present 20 applications that were submitted to this round of the Minor Grants program. Below are the links to the grant applications (in PDF format), listed in alphabetical order:</p><p>You can also <a href="https://zfnd.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zcash_Minor_Grants_applications_October_2023.zip">download a ZIP file containing all 20 PDFs</a> (6MB).&nbsp;</p>

 Why release a transparency report?

<p></p><p>Horizen EON Forger Nodes will soon be available to the public for anyone who wishes to participate in the EON network.</p>



<p>Available on the Proof-Of-Stake Horizen EON chain, these nodes are different from the Proof-Of-Work Horizen mainchain nodes. How do these two types of nodes differ, and how do they each play a critical role in securing the network?</p>



<p>Before understanding the importance of these forger nodes, it’s important to first remember or learn some blockchain terms.</p>



 What is the Horizen mainchain and the Horizen EON sidechain? 







<p>The Horizen mainchain is a <a href="https://www.horizen.io/academy/layer-0/">layer 0</a> chain whose native cryptocurrency is ZEN. It doesn’t natively support smart contracts but natively supports the creation of sidechains.</p>



<p>A sidechain is an independent blockchain that runs parallel to the Horizen mainchain and inherits its security. Sidechains can be used to extend the capabilities of the mainchain, for example by enabling smart contracts, token minting, voting, etc. In addition, ZEN can be transferred back and forth between the mainchain and sidechains (as a gas token) using the forward and backward transfer mechanism.</p>



<p>The Horizen sidechains and the mainchain are independent of each other. A sidechain can have its own consensus and does not rely on the mainchain to grow and add more blocks.</p>



<p>Horizen EON is a dedicated sidechain that implements an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This brings smart contract capabilities to the Horizen ecosystem.</p>



<p>Thanks to the forward and backward transfer mechanism, it’s possible to mint ZEN on Horizen EON by locking an equal amount of ZEN on the mainchain and vice versa. This is important for two reasons:</p>



 
 ZEN are required to pay gas fees on Horizen EON. 



 Horizen EON brings programmability to ZEN. Once ZEN are transferred to Horizen EON, it’s possible to operate on them with all the flexibility enabled by smart contracts.&nbsp; 
 



 Why does the Horizen EON sidechain need forger nodes? 







<p>Horizen’s mainchain operates on a proof-of-work consensus, meaning that it is the miners (in this case, ASICs) who compete to add new blocks to the blockchain and validate transactions.</p>



<p>Currently, The Horizen blockchain has a block reward system where the miner who completes the block receives 60% of the reward for this work. Then 10% goes to the Secure Nodes operators, 10% to the Super Nodes operators, and 20% to the ecosystem Treasury.</p>



<p>Secure Nodes and Super Nodes may sound like a hybrid POS/POW system, but they’re not. On Horizen, Secure Nodes and Super Nodes were created to add an extra layer of security to the network by allowing the community to keep a copy of the blockchain and be compensated for verifying transactions validated by miners.</p>



<p>This multi-layer node system has been in place since 2018. In the meantime, the needs of the network have evolved, particularly with the release of Zendoo and Horizen EON, Horizen’s EVM-compatible sidechain. As a result, the current Secure Node minimum requirements are no longer sufficient to provide any benefit to the Horizen network. Furthermore, with <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/upcoming-deprecation-of-the-horizen-mainchain-shielded-pools/">the removal of the shielded pools on mainchain</a>, the need for Secure Nodes is diminished. The subpar performance and the lack of usage of Secure Nodes pose a burden to the chain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, there is a strong need for forger nodes in the EON chain. The Horizen EON chain is consensus and scalability-independent. To achieve consensus independence, it is necessary for the chain to have its own nodes to validate the transactions taking place on its chain.</p>



 Forger nodes permit to secure the network 



<p>In a Proof-of-Stake chain, the nodes are called forger nodes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forger nodes play a critical role in PoS consensus by creating blocks, validating transactions, enhancing security, and promoting efficiency and decentralization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forger nodes are critical to Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus for several reasons:</p>



 
 Block production: They create new blocks in the blockchain, with their chance of being selected often based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold as collateral. 



 Transaction validation: Forger nodes validate and add transactions to the blockchain, ensuring that only valid transactions are recorded. 



 Security: They’re financially motivated to act honestly because they’ve staked their own tokens as collateral, risking loss if they behave maliciously. 



 Energy efficiency: PoS is more environmentally friendly than PoW because it doesn’t require the same amount of computing power. 



 Sybil attack resistance: PoS networks are less vulnerable to Sybil attacks, where an attacker creates many fake nodes to gain control. 



 Decentralization: Forging nodes contribute to network decentralization, allowing a wider range of participants to be involved. 
 



<p>There is an open Zen Improvement Proposal (ZenIP) for redirecting Secure Node block rewards to EON forger node. The purpose of this proposal is to drive the success of the Horizen EON network by increasing the security and decentralization through forger nodes. The current Secure Node operators are well-equipped to provide this type of support. For more information about this ZenIP, please visit “ <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42206-explained-redirect-horizen-secure-node-rewards-into-horizen-eon/">ZenIP 42206 Explained: Redirect Horizen Secure Node Rewards Into Horizen EON</a>”.</p>

 The launch of the Horizen DAO marks the beginning of a new era of participatory governance for the Horizen community. 



<p><a href="http://horizen.io">Horizen</a> is an open-source, public protocol with a broad and diverse ecosystem that includes developers, miners, node operators, and $ZEN holders across multiple blockchain networks. The launch of the Horizen DAO makes it easier for Horizen community members to get involved in governance and make their voices heard in the direction of the project.&nbsp;</p>



 About Horizen DAO 



<p>DAO stands for “Decentralized Autonomous Organization,” which has emerged as the standard for decentralized governance in the blockchain space and beyond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Horizen has always been a community-driven project and has long recognized that a strong social layer is crucial for maintaining integrity across the ecosystem. This approach is directed by the guiding values of:</p>



 
 Transparency 



 Accountability 



 Security 



 Community involvement 



 Continuous improvement 



 Social responsibility 
 



<p>Read more about the Horizen guiding values on<a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/about"> the Horizen governance page</a>.</p>



 Proposal Phases and Voting Process 



<p>The Horizen DAO further decentralizes decision-making for technical, non-technical, and other substantive improvements to the system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Protocol Improvement Proposals (IPs) are an established mechanism used to select and implement new features and core protocol changes in many blockchain projects. In Horizen’s case, this IP process is the key tool for the Horizen DAO’s community-led governance. With Horizen’s native token, $ZEN, serving as the governance token for both the Horizen mainchain and the EON sidechain, IPs for each are called, respectively, ZenIPs and EONIPs.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>


 
 


<p>$ZEN holders are the ultimate decision-makers for the future of Horizen and exercise governance over the network’s evolution through participating in the Horizen DAO. Any $ZEN holder can vote on improvement proposals, and those who hold (or who have been delegated) the requisite amount of $ZEN may put forth proposals to the community. To facilitate effective community governance, users will also be able to delegate voting power to individuals they view as effective stewards of the Horizen ecosystem guiding values.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Detailed information about Horizen DAO, including the improvement proposal phases, voting process, Constitution, and more, can be found on <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/about">the Horizen Governance page</a>. So check out the site and get involved to help shape the future of Horizen–we’re glad you’re along for the journey!</p>

<p>With the <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/node-software-upgrade-zen-4-1-0-is-available-to-download/">hard fork that was activated at block 1426200</a> (September 26th 2023), private addresses can no longer receive ZEN from transparent addresses. This affects both Secure and Super Nodes’ ability to continue to perform challenges, and the ability to set up new nodes which currently requires a balance in a shielded address.</p>



<p>Starting September 26, 2023, challenges in both systems are suspended indefinitely. The increased requirements of successfully validating certificates introduced with the registration of EON will serve as a substitute for challenges in the interim.</p>



 Steps for Node Operators 



<p>Existing Nodes<br>There should be no effect on any existing nodes unless the node’s wallet is replaced. See New Nodes below.</p>



<p>Any API calls from a node operator requesting a manual challenge should be stopped.</p>



<p>New Nodes<br>If a new node is created (or a new wallet is created) it will need to follow the current guide. One private address will still need to be created and a very small amount of ZEN sent to it to give the private address a balance. The ZEN will need to be sent from another private address. This is a workaround until a new version of the Nodetracker is published.</p>



 System Changes 



 
 An updated version of the Nodetracker software that removes the check for private addresses will be available for new nodes once testing is complete. 



 An updated version of the tracking server software that disables challenges (instead of just suspending) will be rolled out once testing is complete. 
 



<p>After the system changes have been implemented, Node Operators are free to start withdrawing funds previously required for challenges from their shielded addresses to transparent addresses.</p>

  Partnering with PartyKit: Everything is Better with Friends  <p>Sunil and his team are turning lonely online tasks into collaborative multiplayer experiences.</p>   
	By Bogomil Balkansky	 



Published September 26, 2023
  



Team PartyKit: CXO Sylwia Vargas, Founder Sunil Pai and CTO Jani Eväkallio.



 
<p>I am a student of antiquity. At age 10, while many of my peers in the tech industry were learning how to code, I was buried somewhere between the sixth and fifth centuries BC, learning Latin and ancient Greek. (To this day I have some highly marketable skills—like reciting Virgil in the original.) One lesson that stuck with me from those studies is something Aristotle said many centuries ago: that we humans are “social animals.” As markets and technologies have come and gone, this part of our nature has been slow to change; <a href="https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/this-study-of-300000-people-reveals-1-secret-to-living-a-longer-healthier-life.html">dozens of studies</a> on health and longevity show that no matter what we do in life, it is better with friends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By that measure, the Internet is not an ideal environment for us—because our digital experiences are so often lonely. We spend 8-10 hrs a day in front of our screens largely alone. Collaborative editing in Google Docs, collaborative design in Figma, and multiplayer video games are the rare exceptions that give us a taste of what the good life on the internet could be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The view that all business apps require multiplayer collaboration is not necessarily universally held. The skeptic might ask how many Google Docs and Figmas there can be, i.e., how many apps truly require real-time, multiplayer collaboration?</p>



<p>Such skepticism is a failure of imagination, anchored in how things have been rather than how things can be. The fact is very few business processes are truly single-player; even something as mundane as expense reports requires collaboration, as does every other workflow that involves approvals. But these naturally multiplayer experiences have been artificially constrained into sequential, asynchronous workflows that can take weeks to complete.</p>



<p>Imagine instead you could just tag your manager or colleague in finance—or your friendly AI-driven finance copilot—to review your expense report, and they could flag anything that needs fixing on the spot. Historically, creating that kind of collaborative experience required a lot of hard work and technical sophistication. The likes of Google could do it, but your average SaaS startup could not. And while some new technologies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">CRDT</a> libraries have been inching us closer to multiplayer experiences, they still require a lot of technology integration and many hours of engineering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enter <a href="https://www.partykit.io/">PartyKit</a>, a developer-friendly platform for real-time human-to-human and human-to-AI collaboration. PartyKit does the heavy lifting for you, enabling multiplayer experiences with a few lines of Javascript code. It is easy to customize; it includes all the analytics, and other tools you need to build production apps; and because it is open source, it can run on your organization’s own infrastructure—or even your own laptop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we first met PartyKit founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunil-pai-a47732253/">Sunil Pai</a> earlier this year, we fell in love with his velocity and can-do attitude. Case in point is the way he got hired at Cloudflare: after he complained on X (formerly known as Twitter) about certain aspects of the developer experience, they invited him to join the team and fix it—which he did. During <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/sequoia-arc/">Sequoia Arc</a>, we got to know Sunil very well, and were impressed with his contagious enthusiasm for his creation; he was quick to show anyone who was interested a demo on his phone. As they say, ABC—always be closing!</p>



<p>During the beta period, we were also impressed with the diversity of applications users found for PartyKit, from a <a href="https://www.tldraw.com/">drawing app</a> to a <a href="http://v/">state machine</a> to an <a href="https://sitegpt.ai/">LLM-based customer service agent</a>. And those are just small hints of what’s to come; as we celebrate the general availability of the platform, we will no doubt be surprised in the weeks and months ahead by the multitude of use cases PartyKit enables! We are proud to support Sunil and his team as they continue to grow, and we look forward to the better, less lonely internet we’ll all enjoy as they work to make collaborative multiplayer experiences the norm.</p>

 📖 Deep dive: How Machiavellian principles could help fix decentralized governance <p>Miles Jennings</p><p>Whatever you make of Renaissance-era Italian philosopher and political operator Niccolo Machiavelli (who inspired the word “Machiavellian” for better or worse), many of the principles he explored in his writings remain relevant today. For instance, we can see echoes of such principles -- on leadership and the preservation of political liberty -- in both the Federalist Papers and design of the U.S. Constitution.&nbsp;</p><p>But several Machiavellian principles can also be applied to fix decentralized governance, particularly issues with DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) in web3. How? Because Machiavelli’s philosophy during that time was developed with a very pragmatic understanding of the struggle for social power, as well as the premise that no mechanism exists to guarantee virtuous actions.&nbsp;And while most DAOs have developed, as a first step, simplified models of governance based on direct democracy, indirect democracy, and corporate governance -- these approaches have failed to overcome the complex sociopolitical realities involved in decentralized governance. </p><p>So in this set of articles, Jennings examines issues facing DAOs today; and outlines current solutions such as subDAOs, delegate programs, governance minimization, and others, as well as their limitations. Jennings then shares how 4 Machiavellian principles can help design more effective DAOs and better decentralized governance, including minimizing governance and checking-and-balancing the leadership class.</p><p>read more on Machiavelli for DAOs:<br>…<a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/machiavelli-principles-dao-decentralized-governance/">Principles for Fixing Decentralized Governance</a> (part 1)<br>…<a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/machiavelli-daos-designing-effective-decentralized-governance/">Designing Effective Decentralized Governance</a> (part 2)</p><p>share on: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1705276359831060654?s=20">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0x22ba35">Farcaster</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7111042659175059456">LinkedIn</a><br><br>see also: </p>  <p>“a16z suggests Machiavelli to fix decentralized governance”, by Ana Paula Pereira in <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/a16z-machiavelli-fix-decentralized-governance">Cointelegraph</a>&nbsp;</p>  <p>“Lightspeed Democracy: What web3 organizations can learn from the history of governance”, by Andrew Hall and Porter Smith on <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/lightspeed-democracy-what-web3-organizations-can-learn-from-the-history-of-governance/">a16zcrypto.com</a></p>   🇬🇧 Announcing: Crypto Startup School goes to London <p>Jason Rosenthal&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/crypto-startup-school/">Crypto Startup School</a> (CSS) is our popular accelerator program for early-stage companies, providing expert guidance, capital, and resources tailored for crypto founders.

<p>Protecting users from total transparency is crucial for addressing one of the main hurdles facing DeFi adoption: data privacy.</p><p>In a system where blockchain transparency can be maliciously exploited, alpha decay and surveillance are inevitable, making the current state of decentralized finance incompatible with traditional services. As such, addressing our networks’ inherent concerns can only be done with robust controls and proactive strategies in place to prevent the misuse of decentralized tools.</p><p>To this end, and in an ecosystem milestone, <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther Protocol</a> and its DAO are debuting a suite of zero-knowledge compliance solutions. This initial release integrates <a href="https://purefi.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">PureFi</a>'s services to create a path to compliance and data privacy in DeFi. </p> Panther Protocol’s approach to compliance <p>Panther Protocol’s goal is to create a cross-chain architecture that enables seamless access to DeFi while preserving the privacy of users’ data and activity. The protocol leverages the security and liquidity of existing networks while integrating zero-knowledge technology for users to have full control over their data. The protocol’s v1 also integrates these features into a solution that DeFi enthusiasts can use to access their favorite protocols.</p><p>In a first-of-its-kind approach that complements its decentralized structure, Panther introduces an innovative method to manage compliance risks. Panther integrates third-party<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/"> compliance providers</a>, operating autonomously from the protocol, to authenticate users, offering them a unique set of credentials after users complete a series of verifications. These credentials then serve the dual purposes of:</p>  Crafting zero-knowledge proofs directly within their browsers.  Seamlessly integrating with blockchain-based <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">DIDs </a>and similar platforms.  <p>Due to the flexibility of this design, Panther users can access the protocol without being bound to a single compliance provider, being able to choose from a variety of them. Once verified, users can then present these credentials as an irrefutable attestation to their authenticity, granting them unhindered access to the protocol. As a result, Panther can retain its neutrality while giving users a path to complying with regulations.</p> Integrating PureFi<br> <p>In the process of selecting a compliance vendor suitable for Panther’s compliance flow and willing to support the proposed architecture, the Panther DAO elected PureFi.</p><p>PureFi has gained recognition in the Web3 space by pioneering the use of technologies such as decentralized verifiable credentials. The protocol’s goal is to become a one-stop decentralized compliance solution that onboards institutional money to DeFi. PureFi also actively participated in the Panther DAO’s discussions surrounding compliance integrations.</p><p>For Panther’s v1 release, the integration will fulfill the following functions (with all zero-knowledge capabilities built by the Panther team and PureFi in charge of compliance procedures):</p>  Capturing users’ data (email, name, birth date, and nationality) upon their first attempt to access the protocol.  Issuing a signed zk-friendly attestation of the user sharing their data, tied to the user’s wallet (which the user can use as a “Master” account to identify themselves).  Running KYT checks (aka “wallet screening”) to analyze AML/CTF risks of a deposit/withdrawal, both on the receiver’s and sender’s end, and issuing zk-friendly KYT attestations upon passing.  Maintaining an on-chain list of valid cryptographic keys (i.e., certificates) of compliance providers, including the EdDSA public key available on Polygon.  Escrowing the compliance provider’s backup keys with a reliable 3rd party, e.g., a law firm, to be used in case PureFi goes offline.  <p>Importantly, the integration is designed to be compatible with any compliance provider or multiple of them simultaneously.</p> In Summary <p>Zero-knowledge, decentralized compliance, and self-sovereign identity solutions create a technology stack that, for the first time ever, opens a seamless path to compliance while protecting users’ privacy. Panther and PureFi are proud to announce a collaboration that will set the foundation for greater adoption of these solutions and Decentralized Finance as a whole.</p><p>Panther’s <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/">compliance integrations</a> can already be tested by ZK technology and DeFi enthusiasts at <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet/testnet-stages?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther’s Testnet Stage 1</a>, released earlier this month.

Testers can go through the verification flow, create Panther Accounts, and get an exclusive look at Panther's v1!</p> About PureFi Protocol <p>PureFi Protocol allows dApps to fully comply with local and global regulations while preserving decentralization and user anonymity.</p><p>Developed by AMLBot in partnership with Hacken Foundation to provide a full-cycle solution for crypto asset analytics and AML/KYC procedures for the Web3 infrastructure.</p><p><a href="https://purefi.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> |<a href="https://dashboard.purefi.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Dashboard</a> |<a href="https://wp.purefi.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Whitepaper</a> |<a href="https://t.me/purefiprotocol?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> TG Chat</a> |<a href="https://t.me/purefipro?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> TG ANN</a> |<a href="https://medium.com/purefi?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Medium</a> |<a href="https://twitter.com/Purefi_Protocol?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Twitter</a></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther's zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>
