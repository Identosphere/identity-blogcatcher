      Partnering with Tavus: AI-Personalized Videos        In a video-first world, how do you create customized outreach that scales? Hassaan and Quinn are using AI to crack the code.  <p>By Stephanie Zhan</p><p>Published March 20, 2023</p>      



Tavus co-founders Hassaan Raza and Quinn Favret



 
<p>We live in a world where sales emails often seem too impersonal, where many marketing materials are filled with stock content, and where the efficacy of traditional performance marketing has declined severely. Audience engagement has become a scarce and valuable resource—and capturing attention has become an increasingly acute challenge. Customers want only the content most relevant to them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tavus co-founders Hassaan Raza and Quinn Favret knew this pain all too well. By experimenting at their previous company, they discovered that personalized videos that touched on the specific needs and desires of each customer received far higher click-through and response rates compared to content meant for the masses. And so they labored away, creating hundreds of clips for their customers during overnight recording marathons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But they knew there had to be a better way. How could you build a workflow tool that would empower business professionals to create personalized videos, but without needing to manually record each and every one?</p>



<p>Enter <a href="https://www.tavus.io/">Tavus</a>: a platform that can build a personalized AI version of any sales or marketing professional. A rep starts by completing a 15-minute&nbsp; recording to train their personalized AI, then records a single template for each set of videos they want to create. Using a simple yet powerful text editor, designing individual videos for every customer is as easy as typing up a script, with unlimited variables for personalization to address their specific needs—and voilà! Tavus automatically creates clips with pixel-perfect videos of you that replicate your facial expressions and voice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I first tried the product in late 2021, the night after meeting Hassaan and Quinn. It was in alpha at the time, but even then, it felt like magic. We were delighted to partner with them at the beginning of their journey, and to lead their seed round. They are a special pair, with vision, grit, customer obsession, and a creative lens through which to redefine the way sales and marketing should be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, just 18 months later, Tavus creates video on par in quality with anything you would create manually—and makes it a whole lot easier and faster! Even better, Tavus integrates into a company’s programmatic workflows: if a lead submits a form from your website, for example, they can automatically receive a customized Tavus video follow-up instead of a standard email. Already, these customers are seeing results—including 10x higher engagement and 300% increases in response rates, all while reps report saving 10+ hours per week.&nbsp;<br><br>AI is reshaping every industry, and sales and marketing tools are no exception. We’re excited to be working with the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/tavus-io/jobs/">growing Tavus team</a> to supercharge the work of the next generation of sales and marketing professionals. Come check it out here: <a href="https://www.tavus.io/">tavus.io</a>.</p>

   Hester Peirce is one of five SEC Commissioners. She's been a Commissioner since 2018, with her term ending in 2025. Peirce, a previous podcast guest of Bankless, consistently makes first principles statements and is known to often dissent for her colleagues on crypto-related actions…we talk about that in today’s episode.

<p>A letter from the labyrinth – Bristol, UK. Note the <a href="https://discoveringbristol.org.uk/browse/slavery/historic-site-quakers-burial-ground/">Quaker involvement</a> in the early slave trade as ship owners and financiers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>March 18, 2023</p>
<p>Hi Alison,</p>
<p>It’s Sea, from Bristol, UK. I thought I’d write and send a few links concerning developments around 4IR and smart cities from my corner of the labyrinth. Bristol is home base for the Merchant Venturers Society, the historic colonialist and technocratic chattel slave masters that operated the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The Merchant Venturers were major players in capitalism’s early technological development and&nbsp; the expansion of the British Empire.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They were also the appointed rulers of the city through the Royal Charter of King Edward in 1552. The charter is still in force to this day, though in the modern times they fob us off with one of their ‘democratic’ tentacles, the Bristol City council. The Merchants made headlines following the toppling of Edward Colston’s Statue a number of years ago. Local people pulled it down following demonstrations here in 2020.</p>
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/who-was-edward-colston-and-why-was-his-bristol-statue-toppled-slave-trader-black-lives-matter-protests"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/who-was-edward-colston-and-why-was-his-bristol-statue-toppled-slave-trader-black-lives-matter-protests">https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/who-was-edward-colston-and-why-was-his-bristol-statue-toppled-slave-trader-black-lives-matter-protests</a>
<a href="https://www.merchantventurers.com/news/statement-from-the-society-of-merchant-venturers/"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://www.merchantventurers.com/news/statement-from-the-society-of-merchant-venturers/">https://www.merchantventurers.com/news/statement-from-the-society-of-merchant-venturers/</a>
<p>Bristol was selected as a smart city testing ground back in 2014/15. I thought I’d send the links below, as you may be interested. It shows the big push from organisations inside and outside the city that are attempting to develop a framework and infrastructure for the future here. One recent development on the streets, a pilot to draw us in, is cashless payment e-tech skooters and e-bikes for rent. They are leaving this e-tech around all areas and neighbourhoods of the city. This is a test project/partnership between our local council and VOI, a company that’s involved in Bristol’s smart tech roll out.</p>
<a href="https://www.intelligenttransport.com/transport-news/141804/voi-technology-expands-e-scooter-operating-area-to-south-of-bristol/"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://www.intelligenttransport.com/transport-news/141804/voi-technology-expands-e-scooter-operating-area-to-south-of-bristol/">https://www.intelligenttransport.com/transport-news/141804/voi-technology-expands-e-scooter-operating-area-to-south-of-bristol/</a>
<p><br>
Also homeless vendors I know for&nbsp; The Big Issue Charity (a homelessness charity and newspaper), were issued cashless payment devices during the COVID crisis. This paper prints articles in support of e-tech and has entered into charitable promotions with VOI, allegedly donating credits that people spend while using the companies e-bikes to the charity.&nbsp; The general narrative pushed around the tech by local authorities, political parties, and business concerns is that these projects are sustainable, ecological alternatives to conventional transport, with the adage to convince us, they are supporting charity.&nbsp;</p>
<a href="https://www.bigissue.com/life/money/more-big-issue-vendors-are-now-taking-contactless-payments/"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://www.bigissue.com/life/money/more-big-issue-vendors-are-now-taking-contactless-payments/">https://www.bigissue.com/life/money/more-big-issue-vendors-are-now-taking-contactless-payments/</a>
<p>It’s a bit weird seeing a once quite rebellious rural, working class city turning into a gentrified technological smart hub, in what is obviously a propaganda exercise for spreading future developments around this island and elsewhere. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>There is a lot more going on in Bristol that can be found online, this city is one of the main testing grounds for 4IR and the promotion of smart cities. I hope this information is helpful. </p>
<p>Much respect,<br>

      Vijaye Raji Wants You to Think Impact        <p>By Paul Boutin</p><p>Photography: MERON MENGHISTAB</p><p>Published March 16, 2023</p>        After 20 years working with the powerful tools used inside Microsoft and Facebook, Statsig’s CEO is building versions that can help every company deliver measurable real-world results.      



 
<p>“It takes a special courage to say look, I understand where the data is going, but we’re going the other way,” Vijaye Raji tells me with contagious cheer. The statement might seem against Raji’s interests given that his startup, Statsig, founded in 2021, builds testing and validation tools designed to give organizations the rich real-world data they need to make product decisions.</p>



<p>The more you learn about Raji’s life, however, the more it makes sense that his product isn’t going to tell you what decisions to make. In a 20-year career, he’s learned to defy conventional wisdom and make his own decisions—most recently leaving a post leading thousands of engineers to found an 8-person startup.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Sequoia partner Mike Vernal’s words, “Vijaye is the most impactful engineer that I’ve ever worked with. He’s incredibly pragmatic and punctual and just a get-shit-done kind of person. If I could have just one engineer on anything, that would be Vijaye.”</p>



<p>Raji is clearly confident but not overly eager to talk about himself. He’d rather explain at length that organizations often make decisions without the data they really need. Or they look at limited-scope data, which leads to short-term focus while missing the big picture. Or (there are so many ways to fail!) they’ll go overboard the other way and let the numbers decide everything against their better sense.</p>



<p>“Data is always optimizing locally,” he says. “Follow it and you’re climbing to the highest local ground. To get to much higher ground, you may need to go through a dip first.” Collecting data from a wider area, with more local details, is like getting the best possible map of uncharted waters ahead. “You need to have product sense and apply it to the data,” he cautions. But first, you need the data.</p>



<p>With Statsig, Raji wants to give other organizations the breadth and depth of data enjoyed by tech giants.&nbsp; He thinks this will let them make better decisions and choose new directions, informed by real-world data about their customers’ behavior.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Vijaye is the most impactful engineer that I’ve ever worked with.… If I could have just one engineer on anything, that would be Vijaye.”</p>

<p>As a boy in Puducherry, India, young Vijaye took an interest in programming at age 12. A computer was beyond his family’s budget, so he did his coding on a machine at the local library. Once, he convinced the librarian to lock him in overnight so he could pull an all-nighter.</p>



<p>Despite his enthusiasm for tech, Raji was cautious about leaving his family behind. When it came time for college, he attended nearby Pondicherry University rather than one of the top IT schools from which many Indian-born engineers in Silicon Valley have graduated. “I got into a bunch of colleges that were outside my town,” he says, “but I didn’t want to go far from family. My dad was working abroad, so my mom definitely loved for me to stay close. But it was a big decision—there are better colleges that I had to give up.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the time he graduated, Raji’s father had returned home. Vijaye felt OK to take a job 500 miles away in Hyderabad. Before long, Indian outsourcing giant Wipro tapped him to relocate to Finland for Nokia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having never traveled far, Vijaye says he had to learn a lot that others took for granted: “I had never flown on a plane before. I had to learn how to fasten my seat belt.” In Finland, he quickly learned that spicy food and a meat-free diet were still an anomaly at the time. Then there was Finland’s weather: “I moved there in spring, and when November came I didn’t know what hit me.” Puducherry, on the Bay of Bengal, rarely dips below 70 degrees in winter. Yet, he says, he enjoyed discovering new ways of living and came to appreciate them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After two winters in Finland, Raji got an offer from Microsoft in Seattle. Wipro was paying him $2,600 per year—good for India at the time—but Microsoft’s offer letter promised a $72,000 annual salary. The still unworldly Raji believed that, of course, the number was a ridiculous typo.</p>



<p>Once his friends had convinced him it wasn’t, he was all in to relocate halfway around the world for a company he admired. “I had learned to program on QBasic, and then Visual Basic and Visual C++, all thanks to Microsoft,” he says. “It was like a dream when I got that offer.”</p>



<p>He didn’t know it, but he would work for Microsoft for nearly a decade. He stayed longer than he’d have preferred, to avoid the risk of losing his visa should he leave. “I was stuck in green-card hell for 9.5 years,” he quips. “There was a running joke that the fastest way to get a green card was to get married, have a kid in the U.S., and when that kid is 18 years old, they can sponsor you for your green card.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not that he hated his job. Raji worked on critical projects including the Windows Application Framework, SQL Server Modeling Language, Microsoft TV and Visual Studio, which grew into the VS Code application that millions of programmers worldwide are using today. As a side project, he created the Small Basic programming language designed to appeal to beginners.</p>



<p>Four years in, he met local high-school teacher Ashley Lauren. When they eventually married in 2009, Ashley sponsored him for his green card, which he obtained a snappy three months later. He says now, “Microsoft wasn’t bad, but I was ready to go.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“It was time for something new. For that, there’s nothing better or bigger than starting your own company and making it successful.” </p>
vijaye raji</blockquote>



<p>Sequoia partner Mike Vernal had worked at Microsoft in those same years and then moved to Facebook. When Raji, whom he hadn’t met, arrived at Facebook later, Vernal says other ex-Microsoft coworkers told him to pounce to get Vijaye on his team. What they didn’t tell Mike was to make sure he was early. At that point, Raji had no patience for people who don’t show up on time. He passed on joining Vernal’s group, but the two became friends over time.</p>



<p>Raji hadn’t planned to stay at Facebook a full decade either, but they kept promoting him. He joined Facebook’s Seattle campus when it was an office with a dozen people, and ended up leading the operation as it grew to 6,500 people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, he says, a startup seemed the one big thing he hadn’t done: “I’ve done engineering. I’ve done large orgs, I’ve made decisions on where to invest in real estate to house 20,000 planned Facebook employees in Seattle. I’ve done commerce, I’ve done ads, I’ve done gaming, I’ve done entertainment.</p>



<p>“It was time for something new. For that, there’s nothing better or bigger than starting your own company and making it successful. And what I’m doing now is data infrastructure, something completely different from everything I’ve worked on before.”</p>



<p>To be clear, both Raji and Vernal—who had left Facebook to become a partner at Sequoia—toyed with several startup ideas in the late 2010s. When they eventually converged in early 2019 on the idea for Statsig, Raji made plans to wrap up his role at Facebook, when he was still head of Facebook Seattle and also of Facebook Gaming.</p>



<p>CEO Mark Zuckerberg himself—by then only two levels up on the org chart—pinged Raji on Messenger (they had chatted often) with a counter-offer: the head of the company’s Entertainment group was taking the place of another departing executive. To Zuckerberg, Vijaye seemed the obvious choice to step up from managing not only gaming but video, music, movies, sports and who knows what next.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Entertainment was a major part of Facebook’s future. Even Raji agreed it could be a tough year for Facebook if anyone else took the job. “Organizations are very resilient,” he says, “nothing ever breaks because somebody leaves… but, I felt a sense of obligation. I committed to another 18 months.”</p>



<p>Finally, nearly two years later in February 2021, Raji handed in his Facebook badge to start Statsig.&nbsp;</p>
 



statsig office dog kirby contemplates impact



 
<p>Raji says that what he experienced at Facebook was a builder-centric culture that most companies just don’t have from the top down. “Decisions were all data-driven,” he says. “No more debates in conference rooms. Products are built quickly, validated with testing, and the successful ones survive while the unsuccessful are discarded.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Facebook engineers can do this because the entire company uses the same set of infrastructure tools. It doesn’t just make work more efficient, it enables a cultural shift. Facebook engineers don’t measure themselves by ship goals—“I shipped two features this year”—but by performance results: “I shipped a feature that boosted engagement by 2.5 percent.”</p>



<p>Statsig is the latest of several companies like Honeycomb and <a href="https://www.scuba.io/">Scuba.io</a> that were founded by Facebook alumni looking to bring these tools and the culture they enable to as many other companies as possible—a chance to have an impact on the way software is built at any company, maybe even as an industry.</p>



<p>“So far, we’ve built our own versions of a half dozen of Facebook’s tools,” he says. “We’re adding more every few weeks.” For example, Statsig’s <a href="https://blog.statsig.com/introducing-pulse-b38f25790d09">Pulse</a> is a powerful tool for internal A/B testing based on Facebook’s Deltoid. It’s the kind of super tool that big companies like Uber and Spotify can afford to build for themselves, but most startups can’t. Raji is certain that Statsig will empower a foundational cultural shift among customers—from ship goals to metric goals. For non-engineers: It’s not what you build, but what’s your impact?</p>



<p>“What amazed me off the bat with Statsig was the strength and breadth of user-love that the team has garnered,” shares Dannie Herzberg, a Sequoia partner.&nbsp; “Join their Slack community and you’ll see prospects and customers from early-stage startups all the way to enterprise companies sharing their enthusiasm for the product and celebrating new features as they’re launched.”</p>



<p>For Raji and several Facebook colleagues who jumped ship to join him, starting Statsig meant suddenly downshifting to work with eight people instead of eighty thousand, having to learn the partner ecosystem, having to learn to manage a startup business P&amp;L, and so much else they’d been able to leave to others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like most startup teams, they found this exhausting and also exhilarating. But as Statsig sailed off on its own, Raji looked back to Facebook’s shores and realized he’d missed the chance to take something valuable with him: “As the head of Entertainment I had access to the world-class sales team and world-class marketing team, and never once bothered to learn that. Now I kick myself: If only I could go back and spend quality time with the sales leaders, the marketing leaders, the business leaders. I had the opportunity.”</p>



 Delivering impact 



<p>Regrets aside, Raji has a track record of identifying projects and companies where he can have an impact on the outside world. What does he look for?</p>



 
 A unique perspective. A credible vision that isn’t shared by the majority. “If an idea and its value proposition is super-obvious to you, but not so obvious to others, that’s an idea worth exploring.” 



 A short time from plan to product. “The implementation of a minimum viable product should take weeks or months, not years. You don’t want to be developing in a vacuum for too long. Take it to potential customers as soon as possible.” Many startups have gone heads-down for nearly a year, only to emerge with a product that isn’t what the market wants at all. 



 VCs getting excited. “Venture capital investors have a broad line of sight into the market. They can quickly spot if something solves a real pain point.” Few ideas are 100% novel. They’ve seen similar ventures crash, so they perk up when they see one with an approach that could avoid known roadblocks. 
 



<p>Raji is indeed known for being reliably punctual, and impatient with those who aren’t. Contrary to popular tech-industry myth, you don’t win by simply working all waking hours, but by developing good time management. Vijaye keeps a well-honed startup parent schedule: A tightly managed workday, followed by never missing playtime with his children after office hours. Then, after they’re tucked in, you can count on him to respond to critical messages later in the evening.</p>



<p>More important, he says, is not letting your first win or two convince you that you’re always right. He’s seen successful people presume that they have superior insight and use their past success—coupled with either undeniable charisma or a bulldozer persona—to get their way contrary to evidence and objections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Statsig is meant to be a set of tools to keep that from happening, by letting more organizations develop a nimble culture of real-world testing and measurement to drive decisions. “A lot of companies debate the merits of ideas in a conference room,” he says. “Every idea has its merits. The way you understand which one’s working and which one’s not working is actually putting it out to the people that use the product. You don’t have heated debates. If the customers like it, the numbers go up. If they don’t, the numbers go down.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m never attached to a decision that I make,” he concludes. “If there’s new data or evidence that proves that I’m wrong … well, I’m wrong.”</p>

<p>Last night I streamed the third installment in our “Flow Life” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnNSjVGWqTO6YRd1cmyVYDXEF6ShTsqQR">series</a> examining themes related to the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90847220/adam-neumann-a16z-flow-startup-real-estate-explained">new collaborative venture</a> of Adam Neumann (WeWork) and Marc Andreessen (a16z). I was joined by Lynn Davenport, a close friend and diligent advocate for children, who is based in Dallas. In this episode we discuss issues of education privatization (including pre-k debt), affordable housing, and the planned role for faith institutions in administering the Web3 global behavioral experiment. This is <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EoorV600wnPpuZqshHpzK7Xf-1lCGV922OVu0PT-tG0/edit?usp=sharing">a link to the slide deck</a>. Part 3 starts at slide number 128.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was working on basting a quilt, listening to a talk that Jason shared with me a few weeks ago by Augustin Carstens of the Bank of International Settlements on plans to create a unified ledger system – a “heart” to pump the blood of innovative programmable money around the world. I’m pasting in a short clip below.</p>
<p>The BIS is hosting an innovation summit next week, March 21 and 22 starting at 8am Eastern Time. <a href="https://bis.webex.com/webappng/sites/bis/meeting/register/47c4086ab6cc45a69245af2b362eba0a?ticket=4832534b00000006641b70792a8ee1f6ace82e86fbc17bc96a6b7f1721d2b4d0421c9ecc8cffaae7&amp;timestamp=1678971177654&amp;RGID=r8f5b7dc5ebc5687a4f5043972c1cc971">Registration is free</a>. I just listed myself as an independent researcher, and it seemed to go through. I’d encourage as many people as possible to watch. I’m thinking it would be useful to do a debrief. If any of you out there want to watch, at least some of it, and talk about it later, shoot me an email to timpsila@protonmail.com. Check out the agenda <a href="https://www.bis.org/events/bis_innovation_summit_2023/overview.htm">here</a>. Second on deck after Agustin Carstens is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_M%C3%A1xima_of_the_Netherlands">Queen Maxima of the Netherlands</a>. Much of Leo’s research into regenerative finance and biodiversity seems to lead back to the Netherlands. The same goes for my investigations into complexity theory and emergence.</p>

<p>Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a revolutionary concept that is gaining traction in the world of digital identity management. In simple terms, SSI is a way for individuals to take control of their own digital identity and personal information, and use it to interact with the world around them. This has the potential to revolutionise many industries, including the travel industry.</p>



 The Benefits of Using SSI in the Travel Industry 



<p>In short, the benefits using SSI in the travel industry can be summarised as follows:</p>



 
 Travellers control their own personal information 



 Travel companies do not have to worry about storing sensitive personal data 



 The travel process is more streamlined 



 Identity can be verified more efficiently and securely 
 



<p>Let’s explore these benefits more in-depth below!</p>



 Streamlining the Travel Process 



<p>One of the biggest challenges facing the travel industry today is the need for passengers to provide a vast amount of personal information to various parties throughout the travel process. This information is often collected, stored, and shared in an unsecured and decentralised manner. This leads to vulnerability to security breaches and identity theft. And as shown by various research, <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/news/article/marriott-british-airways-and-easyjet-fail-on-data-security-with-hundreds-of-security-risks-exposed-by-which-a6a2q2L2YtdZ">many travel companies’ websites suffer from serious data security risks.</a></p>



<p>With SSI, individuals can create a digital identity that includes all of their personal information and documentation, such as passport and visa details. This digital identity can then be used to quickly and easily verify one’s identity with various organisations and services throughout the travel process, such as airlines, airports, and hotels.</p>



<p>This has several benefits for travellers. Firstly, it eliminates the need for passengers to carry physical copies of their documents, which can be lost, damaged, or stolen. Instead, passengers can access their documents digitally. This is done by using their self-sovereign identity, which provides a more secure and convenient way to verify one’s identity.</p>



<p>In addition, it reduces the time and effort required to provide personal information and documentation. It makes the overall experience smoother and more efficient. Finally, it allows travellers to have greater control over their personal data. They can choose which information to share with which organisations. Furthermore, they can revoke access to their digital identity at any time.</p>



 How SSI Helps Companies in the Travel industry 



<p>Another benefit of self-sovereign identity for companies in the travel industry is that it reduces their risks related to storing customer data. With traditional forms of identity verification, companies are often responsible for collecting, storing, and protecting large amounts of personal information about their customers. This can be a costly and time-consuming process. It also exposes companies to potential liabilities in the event of a security breach or data leak.</p>



<p>With self-sovereign identity, customers can securely and easily share only the necessary information with companies. Consequently, this reduces the amount of data that companies need to store and manage. This can help to reduce the risks and costs associated with managing customer data. It can also help to protect companies from potential liabilities.</p>



<p>Additionally, using self-sovereign identity can allow companies to build trust with their customers. It shows that they are committed to protecting personal information and providing a secure and convenient experience. As a result, self-sovereign identity can be a win-win for both companies and customers in the travel industry.</p>



 The Potential Downsides of Using SSI in the Travel Industry 



<p>Using self-sovereign identity in the travel industry has a lot of potential for both companies and travellers. One must know that there are also potential downsides and risks. Namely the following few:</p>



 
 Lack of adoption: Self-sovereign identity is a relatively new concept. It may take some time for it to be widely adopted by individuals and organisations in the travel industry. 



 Compatibility issues: Not all organisations and services in the travel industry may be able to accept self-sovereign identity as a form of verification. This could limit its usefulness for some travellers. 



 Potential for misuse: As with any technology, self-sovereign identity has the potential to be misused by individuals with malicious intent. For example, individuals could create false or fraudulent digital identities in order to access services or commit crimes. 



 Security concerns: While self-sovereign identity can provide a more secure way to verify one’s identity, it also introduces new security concerns, such as the need to protect digital identities from hacking and other forms of cyber attack. 



 User error: Self-sovereign identity relies on individuals to manage their own digital identities. Mistakes or errors made by users could potentially compromise the security of their personal information. 
 



<p>While these potential downsides and risks should be taken seriously and should be addressed adequately, traditional forms of identity (verification) suffer similar downsides and risks. And if implemented correctly while taking various precautions, self-sovereign identities will be able to provide a more efficient and secure way of handling your identity and personal information.</p>



 Introducing: A Self-Sovereign Identity Tool for Travellers 



<p>Zaisan offers tooling that is helping to make SSI a reality for travelers. A <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/identity/">self-sovereign identity platform</a> that allows individuals to create, manage, and share their digital identity in a secure and convenient manner. With this tooling, travellers can easily access and share their travel documents, such as passports and visas, with the relevant parties, making the travel process smoother and more efficient.</p>



 Conclusion: Self-Sovereign Identity is Poised to Transform the Travel Industry 



<p>In conclusion, self-sovereign identity has the potential to revolutionise the travel industry. It allows individuals to take control of their own digital identity and personal information. Despite the potential risks and downsides, SSI is looking to be a solid way to handle personal data. Web3 identity tools are helping to make this vision a reality, making it possible for travellers to securely and easily access and share their travel documents. As SSI becomes more widely adopted, the travel industry is sure to see significant benefits in terms of security, convenience, and efficiency.</p>

<p>Network Disruption Resolution</p><p>On March 11, 2023 the DERO network suffered a chain split due to issues with developer controlled seed nodes. These nodes act as an anchor for network participants to uniformly sync with the rest of the blockchain network. Since services have yet to be restored, the blockchain remains split, which includes a chain that is stuck (seed nodes) and a heavier chain that has more mining activity. Since DERO utilizes proof-of-work consensus and the absence of our seed nodes, all network participants are left to choose which chain to&nbsp;follow.</p><p>Together with various esteemed members of our community, we have collectively decided to move forward with the heaviest chain as we continue to restore service to our seed nodes. Below, you will find instructions on how to get your node up and running by using community and foundation hosted public&nbsp;nodes.</p> UPDATE (3/19/2023): The DERO network is no longer reliant on seed nodes. <a href="https://github.com/deroproject/derohe/releases/tag/Release117">The latest release provides these updates</a>. The following solution is no longer required.  Remote Node (Wallets) <p>The default remote nodes are also down, so you will need to specify a node address when launching your CLI wallet. Instead of using the ‘- -remote’ argument, run your wallet with the following arguments:</p> ./dero-wallet-cli-linux-amd64 --daemon-address=node.derofoundation.org:11012 <blockquote>Or specify node.derofoundation.org:11012 in your connection settings when using&nbsp;Engram.</blockquote> Daemon (Node) <p>Run your daemon with the following arguments:</p><p>CLI</p> ./derod-linux-amd64 --add-priority-node=78.159.118.236:11011 --add-priority-node=209.58.186.186:11011 --add-priority-node=23.81.165.146:11011 --add-priority-node=85.17.52.28:11011  <a href="https://github.com/DEROFDN/netrunner">Netrunner</a>  ./netrunner --add-priority-node=78.159.118.236:11011 --add-priority-node=209.58.186.186:11011 --add-priority-node=23.81.165.146:11011 --add-priority-node=85.17.52.28:11011 <p>Alternatively, you can download the following files and place them in your mainnet&nbsp;folder:</p>  <a href="https://git.dero.io/DERO_Foundation/temp-peer-settings/raw/branch/master/peers.json">peers.json</a>  <a href="https://git.dero.io/DERO_Foundation/temp-peer-settings/raw/branch/master/ban_list.json">ban_list.json</a>  <p>You can right-click and “Save As” each file above, or visit the repo: <a href="https://git.dero.io/DERO_Foundation/temp-peer-settings">https://git.dero.io/DERO_Foundation/temp-peer-settings</a></p><blockquote>Please note: You may need to replace these files before each launch of your&nbsp;daemon.</blockquote><p>Below is a list of public nodes that are available:</p>  ams.derofoundation.org:11011  213.171.208.37:18089 (MySrvCloud)  5.161.123.196:11011 (MySrvCloud VA)  51.222.86.51:11011 (RabidMining Pool)  74.208.54.173:50404 (deronfts)  85.214.253.170:53387 (mmarcel-vps)  163.172.26.245:10505 (DeroStats)  44.198.24.170:20000 (pieswap)   Explorers   <a href="http://explorer.derofoundation.org">explorer.derofoundation.org</a>  <a href="https://explorer.deronfts.com">explorer.deronfts.com</a>  <a href="https://derostats.io">derostats.io</a>   Moving Forward <p>During this time, the decision has been made to keep exchange wallets in maintenance mode for the time being. We will send out further communication once we have an ETA of when they will become available.</p><p>We also aim to eventually remove the use of seed nodes in the future, but our young network and on-going development may require their usage for a bit longer. There are also plans to prevent such issues in the future, which will be provided at a later date. We were delighted to see solidarity win in the end and could not have done it without the help of our community.</p><p>We would like to take this time to thank the DERO community again for their efforts and patience during this&nbsp;time.</p> Privacy together. <p>—</p><p>Join the DERO community!</p><p><a href="https://forum.dero.io/">Forum</a></p><p><a href="https://discord.gg/29GNSJ4">Discord</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/DeroProjectGroup">Telegram</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/DERO_Foundation">Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeroProject/">Reddit</a></p><p><a href="https://dero.io/">Website</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/deroproject/dero-network-update-2def3c133f38">DERO Network Update</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/deroproject">DERO</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>As of close of U.S. banking operations Wednesday, March 15, we have cleared substantially all of the backlog of minting and redemption requests for USDC.<br><br>Since Monday morning, Circle has redeemed $3.8 billion USDC and minted $0.8 billion USDC.<br><br>The events of the past week have impacted the liquidity operations for USDC. Circle has worked tirelessly to re-initiate services with alternative banking partners, particularly payment and USDC redemption services. We would like to thank our customers for their patience during these unprecedented times.&nbsp;<br><br>On Tuesday, March 14, we went live with a new transaction banking partner for domestic U.S. wires in and out. Today, we went live with that same partner for international wires to and from 19 countries. We also went live today with an existing transaction banking partner for international wires. We expect to bring more capabilities back on line tomorrow.&nbsp;<br><br>We would like to extend our thanks to all the teams that have worked tirelessly around the clock with incredible professionalism to stand up these new services at unprecedented speed. We will continue efforts to add additional transaction banking partners.</p>

  It was a wild weekend for stablecoins. USDC depegged from a dollar to as low as
$0.88 on Saturday, before bouncing fully back to its dollar peg on Monday. Today
we’re looking back over the wild weekend and figuring out what a depegged
stablecoin and failing banks could signal for DeFi.

<p>The research below was put together by a friend, Daruchan, who shares my interest in slime mold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a story about the Blob, also known as slime mold.</p>
<p>Physarum Polycephalym</p>
<p>Is it an <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blob">alien</a> who came to earth to end humanity?</p>
<p>Or a space traveler who came here to start a (new) life?</p>
<p>It is an enigma wrapped in mystery…</p>
<p>So far, we know that it is an acellular organism.</p>
<p>It’s not fungal, though it thrives between two vegetative states, amoebae and plasmodia.</p>
<p>It propagates via growth and nuclear division without cytokinesis.</p>
<p>It has about 720 different sexes to ensure it can find an appropriate mate for future generations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It cannot see or hear.</p>
<p>But it moves and shows an incredible ability to read environmental clues.</p>
<p>It changes its shape and behavior to survive in its habitat, shadowy and damp places.</p>
<p>It is obvious that it possesses some primal intelligence and senses, but does it feel?</p>
<p>So far the Blob’s <a href="https://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012%2F01%2F01%2F185653">cleverness</a> has not been decoded.</p>
<p>Though since its reappearance as a part of a wacky scientific project in Japan in 2000</p>
<p>and after a sci-fi movie career that took the art and technology communities by storm,</p>
<p>the Blob became a science super star.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s helping scientists at the International Space Station study the influence of microgravity or near zero gravity on living organisms.</p>

<p>Today, <a href="https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/halborn-discovers-zero-day-impacting-dogecoin-and-280-networks">Halborn disclosed vulnerabilities in some code forks of Bitcoin Core</a>, which could be exploited to crash nodes. An attacker could potentially take advantage of these vulnerabilities to crash mining nodes, and thus reduce (by approximately 50%)&nbsp; the amount of hashpower required to mount a 51% attack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zcash was one of the currencies affected by this disclosure, as zcashd is a code fork of Bitcoin Core. <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-releases-remediate-memory-exhaustion-vulnerability-in-zcash/">ECC has released new versions of zcashd that remediate the vulnerabilities</a>. Anyone who runs a zcashd node should update immediately.</p>



<p>There is no evidence to suggest that these vulnerabilities have been exploited on the Zcash network, and there is no reason to suspect that the Zcash network is susceptible to a 51% attack (even if the required hashpower were reduced by 50%).&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra">Zebra</a> is an independent Zcash node implementation, and is not based on Bitcoin Core. Halborn has confirmed that Zebra is not vulnerable to these issues. However, we have taken the precaution of hardening certain sections of our codebase to make Zebra more resilient to similar memory exhaustion attacks.</p>



<p>We would like to express our gratitude to ECC for coordinating the Zcash ecosystem’s response to this security disclosure.&nbsp;We would also like to thank Halborn for responsibly disclosing these vulnerabilities. </p>

<p>Development of new privacy-enhanced zero-knowledge tech can revolutionise the identity industry by ensuring anonymity.</p><p>Austin, Texas, USA — Sunday, 12 March 2023: Today at South by Southwest 2023, <a href="https://nymtech.net/">Nym</a>, the leader in network layer privacy, announced a new privacy-preserving zero-knowledge technology called zk-nyms at a <a href="https://schedule.sxsw.com/2023/events/PP1143244">featured session</a> with CEO Harry Halpin and Chelsea Manning (famous whistle-blower and now-Security Consultant for&nbsp;Nym).</p><p>Combining the key attributes of zero-knowledge technology and anonymous credentials, zk-nyms allows users to selectively only reveal certain information about themselves, such as their nationality or age, to generate credentials. This prevents compromising additional unnecessary and sensitive personal data. Using the strength of cryptography, zk-nyms puts the power of this selective disclosure into the hands of users rather than large companies via decentralisation.</p><p>Harry Halpin, CEO of Nym Technologies, said, “Identity technologies run the risk of reducing us to a number in a database. Our new zk-nym technology puts the power to reveal your identity back in your own&nbsp;hands.”</p><p>The zk-nym technology works like a new kind of drivers license, except that when showing the license, only the parts needed for immediate purpose (for example, name, duration of validity and photo) are revealed while information that is not required is hidden (such as addresses or precise birthdate).</p><p>Unlike previous zk and identity schemes, zk-nym is decentralised and trustless. The zk-nym technology is based on prior work on what is called the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07344.pdf">Coconut signature scheme</a> and has now been extended by Nym researchers Ania Piotrowska and Alfredo Rial Duran. Coconut enables distributed issuance of anonymous credentials, meaning zk-nyms avoid a trusted centralised issuance authority.</p><p>“We analysed the security of zk-nyms and have proven that this technology offers strong user privacy protection. Moreover, we have extended zk-nyms to provide anonymous payment mechanisms that enable both on-line and off-line payments. Off-line payments allow service providers to verify and accept a payment without contacting any issuing authorities.” said Alfredo Rial Duran, Cryptographer, Nym R&amp;D&nbsp;team.</p><p>The first use case for zk-nyms is access credentials to the <a href="https://nymtech.net/about/">Nym mixnet</a>, ensuring a person can prove they have paid for and therefore have the right to use the digital service, without revealing name, wallet address or other sensitive information. Other use cases that are being developed include privacy preserving KYC process, e-cash and a general purpose single-sign on. In general, zk-nyms can be used to ensure privacy, while proving a person’s right to use a digital&nbsp;service.</p><p>The Nym team is releasing a sandbox for zk-nyms. The zk-nym technology represents a breakthrough in making privacy as easy as building a JSON object for programmers, where certain values can be easily hidden (or ‘shielded’) to prevent information leakage. As opposed to more complex zero-knowledge systems, it is meant to be easy for ordinary programmers to use and for people to understand as a list of attributes about themselves.</p><p>The core technology behind zk-nyms was previously demonstrated with various kinds of data including being used for proving COVID-19 vaccination status in a privacy-enhanced and decentralized manner with the support of the <a href="https://ledgerproject.eu/">European Commission via the LEDGER project</a>. Although the European Commission did not use the technology during COVID, zk-nyms represent a privacy-enhanced alternative to current plans in Europe to build centralised identity databases that could be used to track and surveil ordinary&nbsp;people.</p><p>-END-</p><p>About Nym:</p><p>Nym is an open-source, incentivized, and decentralized platform that protects privacy at the network level of any application, wallet or digital service. Nym protects against traffic pattern analysis and metadata surveillance.</p><p>Media Contact</p><p>Candice Teo, <a href="mailto:candice@nymtech.net">candice@nymtech.net</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/press-release-nym-unveils-zero-knowledge-anonymous-credentials-zk-nyms-at-sxsw-6d56bd31802a">Press Release: Nym unveils zero-knowledge anonymous credentials, zk-nyms, at SXSW</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Releases 5.3.3 and 5.4.2 harden zcashd code and remediate vulnerabilities inherited from Bitcoin Core that may have affected more than 280 chains,<a href="https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/halborn-discovers-zero-day-impacting-dogecoin-and-280-networks"> according to blockchain security firm Halborn</a>.</p>



<p>We have no evidence that an exploit has occurred on the Zcash network, and these bugs do not compromise user privacy or impact Zcash supply. As always, if you notice any unusual activity in your node, please report it to security@z.cash.</p>



<p>All Zcash node operators on 5.3.1 or 5.3.2 should update to <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/releases/tag/v5.3.3">5.3.3</a> immediately, and all Zcash node operators on 5.4.0 or 5.4.1 should update to <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/releases/tag/v5.4.2">5.4.2</a> immediately. <a href="https://z.cash/download/">Prebuilt binaries and Debian packages</a> will be available in the next few hours.</p>



<p>The vulnerabilities, discovered by Halborn in a 2022 audit of Dogecoin, were first disclosed to ECC and contributors to other affected networks on Feb. 14, and more details were relayed in a Feb. 17 call. ECC initiated our security process immediately and began coordinating with ZecSec.com, the independent Zcash-community-funded security team, and with Zcash Foundation, who analyzed the impact on zebrad, its own implementation of a Zcash node. We also reached out to Horizen, Komodo, and other teams with whom we have disclosure agreements.</p>



<p>Within days, we had zcashd patches ready for third-party testing, but the public releases have been delayed to allow other projects time to complete their own remediations and to allow for coordinated comms, given the sensitive nature.</p>



<p>Halborn found that the bugs could allow an attacker to utilize peer-to-peer network messages to fill the memory of a node and crash it. By crashing other people’s mining nodes, an attacker could potentially reduce, by around one half, the amount of hashpower they would need to mount a 51% attack on the Zcash network. A successful 51% attack could potentially be used to execute a double-spend attack, which could result in users who received transactions from the attackers losing their funds. We have no reason to believe that the Zcash network is currently vulnerable to a 51% attack — with or without the “one half discount” on the attack cost — but out of an abundance of caution, we’ve hardened the zcashd nodes so that they cannot be crashed using this bug.</p>



<p>ECC has a record of fast, coordinated responses to incidents like this and is well-known for delivering safe and secure technology for Zcash users and other privacy-minded projects. For our latest news and product updates, please follow @electriccoinco on Twitter.</p>

 A giant leap toward a fully programmable encrypted zkRollup <p>Today we’re announcing the sunset of Aztec Connect, our privacy infrastructure that served as the encryption layer for Ethereum.</p><p>One week from today, deposits into the Aztec Connect contract both from <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> and other front-ends like <a href="https://zkpay.finance/">zkpay.finance</a> will be disabled.</p><p>Users will continue being able to withdraw with no fees for one&nbsp;year.</p><p>Our sequencer will slowly reduce the frequency of rollup blocks for withdrawal, with a final sunset date approximately one year from now: March 21st, 2024. Here are the critical&nbsp;dates:</p>  13th — 21st March: Aztec Connect normal functionality  21st March 2023 at 2PM UTC: Deposits&nbsp;disabled  One-year withdrawal window (March 13th, 2023 — March 21st,&nbsp;2024)  March 21st, 2024: Last Aztec rollup sent from Aztec sequencer  March 21st, 2024 onwards: users will have to run withdrawal software or rely on community-run sequencers  <blockquote>▶️ Head to <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> today to begin withdrawing funds.<br>▶ View withdrawal instructions <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/aztec-connect-sunset">here</a>.</blockquote> What’s Next <p>As of March 21st, 2024–approximately one year from now–Aztec will no longer run a sequencer. That means the current system will no longer publish rollup blocks processing Aztec Connect transactions, contract permissions will be renounced, and all rollup functionality will be&nbsp;ceased.</p><p>At that point, withdrawals will be highly technical. While we remain optimistic that a community-operated sequencer will be functional, everyday users will have to rely on that infrastructure or run their own sequencers to withdraw.</p><p>Thus, while withdrawals will always be possible, they will become significantly more burdensome after March 21st, 2024. We therefore recommend users withdraw funds as soon as possible.</p><blockquote>▶️ Head to <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> today to begin withdrawing funds.<br>▶ View withdrawal instructions <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/aztec-connect-sunset">here</a>.</blockquote> Open sourcing Aztec&nbsp;Connect <p>As of today, Aztec has fully open sourced the entire Aztec Connect protocol complete with scaling upgrades and a new secure&nbsp;SDK.</p><blockquote>▶️ See the open source Aztec Connect repo&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect">here</a>.</blockquote><p>We encourage the Aztec community to fork, deploy, and operate a new version of the system. We’d love to see an independently-operated Aztec Connect and are ready to fund it. Head to our open-source repo and docs to learn more about running an Aztec Connect&nbsp;fork.</p><p>The second wave of our grants program is coming up in April, and we look forward to funding community-run infrastructure then. In the meantime, keep in touch on our <a href="http://twitter.com/aztecnetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://discord.gg/aztec">Discord&nbsp;server</a>.</p> Aztec’s Vision <p>At Aztec, our goal has always been to develop a truly decentralized general-purpose encrypted zkRollup with the security of Ethereum.</p><p>While Ethereum has created a world computer that can read and write to public state, Aztec aims to fulfill the vision by adding the ability to read and write to private&nbsp;state.</p><p>In our mission to achieve that vision, we’ve taken a step-wise, incremental approach to the development of encrypted transactions on Ethereum.</p><p>The first attempt at on-chain privacy using a zkRollup was Aztec 1. Aztec 1 was slow, inefficient, costly, and limited in its functionality to basic private transfers.</p><p>Our latest effort was a set of privacy infrastructure and tools for Ethereum called Aztec Connect. It not only extended privacy functionality on Ethereum beyond simple payments and toward arbitrary smart contract interactions, it hinted at the cost savings that encrypted rollups are ultimately able to achieve through transaction batching.</p><p>Aztec Connect was a critical step in our mission to build a fully programmable encrypted zkRollup. Not only did it provide critical feedback, it proved to us the battle-worthiness of our sequencer and rollup contracts.</p><p>The immense research invested into Aztec Connect will be usable and indeed critical to the development of our next-gen product. Having an encrypted rollup live and in production gives us confidence in our shift to focusing on a fully programmable version.</p> The Future is&nbsp;Noir <p>As we move forward, our mid- and long-term focus will be solely directed towards the development of two major products, which are mutually compatible and interlinked:</p>  Noir, the universal language of zero knowledge  Our next-generation encrypted zkRollup  <p>Noir continues to gain new features by the day, with the Noir tooling team publishing regular releases. We are convinced Noir is the simplest, most powerful way to write programs in zero-knowledge.</p><blockquote>▶️ <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/developers/noir">Install Noir today</a> and go from 0 to programming in zkSNARKs in less than an&nbsp;hour.</blockquote><p>With additional resources at their disposal, the Noir team will only grow its functionality. Not only is Noir useful today as a generalized programming language for zk development — capable of using multiple proving backends and verifying to any EVM chain — a modified version of Noir will be the smart contract language for Aztec’s next-gen zkRollup.</p><p>Expect more Noir features and a full set of specifications for our newest zkRollup in the first half of 2023. To learn more about our next-gen system, check out our&nbsp;docs.</p><blockquote>Learn more about the next generation Aztec protocol&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aztec.network/aztec3">here</a>.</blockquote> Onward <p>The Aztec community has been a vital part of the development and success of Aztec Connect, and we are incredibly grateful for the 100,000+ users who have used Aztec Connect for private DeFi. It has long been obvious that privacy in a blockchain context is an absolute necessity, and Aztec Connect further validated that&nbsp;thesis.</p><p>It’s undeniable that Aztec Connect was an important stepping stone towards realizing our ultimate goal. It’s now time for us to focus fully on that goal: a decentralized general-use encrypted zkRollup.</p><p>To all our partners: thank you for betting on Aztec. We’re excited to bring you a fully-featured Noir and local devnet for our next-gen network by the end of 2023.&nbsp;Onward!</p> Frequently Asked Questions <p>Q: How do I withdraw&nbsp;funds?</p><blockquote>A: Navigate to <a href="https://zk.money">zk.money</a> or your preferred front-end. View withdrawal instructions for <a href="https://zk.money">zk.money</a> here: <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/aztec-connect-sunset">https://docs.aztec.network/aztec-connect-sunset</a></blockquote><p>Q: Is Aztec done building privacy products?</p><blockquote>A: Not even close. We’re laser-focused on building more Noir features and bringing you a programmably private L2 to be announced in the first half of&nbsp;2023.</blockquote><p>Q: Is Aztec shutting&nbsp;down?</p><blockquote>A: Nope. Our team has raised <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/aztec-raises-100-million-to-build-encrypted-ethereum-dd5062ba949c">over $125 million</a> from investors like a16z and Paradigm to bring encryption to blockchain. Our team is over 40 strong and we’re still hiring aggressively for open roles. <a href="https://boards.eu.greenhouse.io/aztec?gh_src=935e32f2teu">Join&nbsp;us</a>!</blockquote><p>Q: Is Aztec building an&nbsp;L1?</p><blockquote>A: No — we are utilizing the same rollup technology used in Aztec Connect in a new encrypted L2 powered by Noir, our universal zk language.</blockquote><p>Q: Why are you sunsetting Aztec&nbsp;Connect?</p><blockquote>A: We simply are not able to commit sufficient resources to simultaneously support Aztec Connect and the development of an encrypted zkRollup. Not only are we in the midst of inventing a groundbreaking new proving system, we are building a network with significantly higher complexity than Aztec&nbsp;Connect.</blockquote><p>Q: Are you sunsetting Aztec Connect due to regulatory pressures?</p><blockquote>A: No. We were under no regulatory pressure nor have we fielded any inquiries from law enforcement. Aztec Connect is and was compliant with UK law, given Aztec is a UK&nbsp;company.</blockquote><blockquote>We believe the practical enforcement measures we implemented <a href="https://twitter.com/aztecnetwork/status/1560710567249096704">last August</a> have deterred illicit activity on the rollup without materially restricting users.</blockquote><blockquote>Rest assured our next-gen product will have higher programmability, more functionality, and the same or stronger privacy guarantees than Aztec&nbsp;Connect.</blockquote> Join the Aztec Community <p>We’re always on the lookout for talented engineers and applied cryptographers.

<p>Today, almost everyone uses the Internet on more than one device (like your laptop at home, and your phone on the go). Brave’s new cross-device VPN subscription model lets you connect and protect five devices—across Android and iOS, macOS and Windows—to one subscription. Brave’s Firewall + VPN service is available for $9.99/month, or $99.99/year (annual plans for desktop purchases are coming soon). With five supported devices per account, you can protect each device for less than $2 a month.</p>
<p>The Brave browser blocks ads and trackers on every webpage, keeping you much safer while you browse; the Brave Firewall + VPN blocks trackers in every app on your phone, even outside the Brave browser.</p>

 Already using Brave Firewall + VPN on your mobile device? 
<p>If you already have a Brave Firewall + VPN subscription on your Android or iOS devices, visit the VPN section of the Brave browser settings. This will take you to <a href="https://account.brave.com/">account.brave.com</a>, where you can manage your subscription and automatically link more mobile or desktop devices.</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    


 How to get started with Brave VPN on mobile or desktop 
<p>We’ve made the setup process for Brave Firewall + VPN as simple as possible. Don’t worry about downloading any extra apps; simply open the settings menu in the Brave browser on desktop or mobile, and toggle on VPN. You’ll then be taken to account.brave.com, where you can easily complete the setup.</p>
<p>Brave Firewall + VPN is the easiest way to protect all your devices—and all your apps—directly from the browser.</p>

 Brave-level protection, even outside the Brave browser 
<p>Brave browser puts your privacy first by blocking ads, trackers, cookies, scripts, and more while you browse the Web. Brave Firewall + VPN is a premium service that goes even further by enabling you to:</p>
 
 Mask your IP address 
 Change your location online 
 Prevent your ISP from snooping on your activity 
 Access your favorite content no matter where you are 
 Protect your Internet traffic on apps outside the Brave browser 
 
<p>Brave Firewall + VPN, powered by Guardian, extends all the protection you expect from Brave outside of the browser on Android, iOS, and macOS (and Windows, <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/11973307463181">with an added workaround</a>). That means giving you network-level protection against unwanted surveillance on the apps you use, across all your devices. Guardian is a leading Firewall + VPN technology platform that was recently acquired by DNSFilter.</p>
<p>Note that iOS and Android users can use our integrated <a>Privacy Hub</a> (a feature coming soon to desktop as well) to check exactly which trackers are blocked, including outside of Brave. The Privacy Hub highlights risky pages and trackers, and ties those trackers to the tech companies and publishers behind them, showing users how often sites try to invade their privacy.</p>

 Your privacy and anonymity guaranteed 
<p>When choosing a VPN, you’re trusting the provider with your data. Brave’s VPN service is powered by Guardian, stores no log files, and uses no cookies. We can’t store any of your connection or browsing data, because we don’t collect any of it in the first place.</p>
<p>We’ve also implemented an onboarding process that enables you to sign up for Brave Firewall + VPN using only an email address and payment information.</p>
<p>Once you sign up, you’re issued unlinkable daily tokens that validate your subscription when using the VPN. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you used to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of the VPN, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience.</p>

 Protect yourself from ISPs 
<p>Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are the backbone of Internet connectivity; virtually all Internet traffic passes through them. This puts many of them (depending on their jurisdiction) in a position where they could easily collect and sell user data; in fact, various ISPs sell this data to advertising brokers to build a more comprehensive ad profile of the user. Because they have privileged access to user Internet traffic, they can even monitor your activity and slow down your Internet connection speeds as they see fit. But with Brave Firewall + VPN, you can easily mask your IP address and cloak your Internet activity, even from the prying eyes of ISPs.</p>

 More online freedom 
<p>While traveling abroad, you might find that your favorite sites or news outlets no longer work. That’s due to geo-restrictions that prevent certain sites and apps from being accessible from certain locations. With Brave Firewall + VPN, you can connect to the Web from local servers around the world, making it appear like that’s where your traffic is originating. This enables you to bypass geo-restrictions in the browser and access your favorite content no matter where you are.</p>

 Added firewall protection 
<p>A VPN is great for encrypting your internet traffic, but it can’t block harmful trackers and other online nuisances. That’s where a firewall comes in. Most standard, free, and even other premium VPNs don’t include a firewall—which serves as a secure barrier between your device and the Internet. It blocks unwanted trackers, harmful traffic, and other malicious things from ever reaching your phone, tablet, or computer.</p>
<p>How does it work? Brave’s built-in firewall monitors and controls incoming and outgoing flows of data based on a set of rules. So if an app is secretly broadcasting tracking data, Brave Firewall + VPN will detect and block the offending activity while still ensuring the app functions normally.</p>

 Try Brave Firewall + VPN today 
<p>Ready to protect your Internet traffic across all your devices? You can try Brave Firewall + VPN  with a free 7-day trial. To do so on your desktop device, open the Brave browser and click the new VPN icon in the browser address bar. Or, when using the Brave browser on your phone, go to the Settings menu, and toggle Brave Firewall + VPN to on. (If you don’t see this option, update to the latest version of Brave on your device.) It’s the safest, easiest way to protect yourself online, on every app, on every device.</p>

<p>With the upcoming launch of Polygon's zkEVM mainnet, L2s are undoubtedly a huge narrative that is unfolding in 2023. It is time to take a step back and recognise the incredible amount of effort that has gone into researching and building L2 scaling solutions in general and zk rollups in particular. Tech-wise, we barely scratched the surface of general purpose processors that can handle zk circuits, so there is still tremendous room to grow. As layer 2s become more efficient, so will the applications that are dependent on blockchain throughput.</p><p>We were joined by Jordi Baylina (tech lead) &amp; David Schwartz (CTO) from Polygon's zkEVM, to discuss the different milestones &amp; challenges they had to overcome in designing a zk rollup, from circuits to mainnet.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Jordi’s &amp; David’s backgrounds  The idea behind Hermez Network  zkEVM scaling &amp; validity proofs  How different ZK rollup models function  What challenges zkEVM encountered during development  Evolutionary pathways in the realm of ZKPs  Auditing zkEVM  Trusted setup requirement for zkEVM  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/jbaylina">Jordi Baylina on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/davidsrz">David Schwartz on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/0xPolygonZK">Polygon zkEVM on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  Omni: Access all of Web3 in one easy-to-use wallet!

 The rise of decentralised finance (DeFi) has made Ethereum the go-to platform for building decentralised applications (dApps). One of the most popular stablecoins used in DeFi is USDC (USD Coin), a faster, safer, and more efficient way to send, spend, and exchange money around the globe. It powers apps to provide anytime access to payments and financial services.

  Brave Wallet on desktop now allows users to sell crypto for fiat with expanded Ramp integration.

<p>Starting today, Brave Wallet users in select countries will see a new option to sell crypto into fiat currencies, including US dollars, euros, and pound sterling.</p>
<p>In May 2022, Brave <a>announced</a> a partnership with <a href="https://ramp.network/">Ramp</a> that enabled Brave Wallet users to buy crypto with fiat currency—or “on-ramp”—in Brave Wallet, the Web3 wallet natively-integrated into the Brave browser.</p>
<p>This week, with v1.49 of the desktop browser, we’re delighted to announce the expansion of that partnership: Brave Wallet users can now sell crypto for fiat—or “off-ramp”—with Ramp as well. Users now have the option to both move in and out of crypto entirely through their self-custody wallet, rather than through centralized exchanges that hold custody of users’ assets. With Ramp’s on- and off-ramping services integrated into Brave Wallet, users no longer need to relinquish ownership of their crypto to transact.</p>
<p>After recent events where centralized exchanges mishandled customer funds, it’s more important than ever to offer secure and easy-to-manage self-custody. Before the creation of Bitcoin and the ensuing emergence of Web3 technologies, self-custody wasn’t a common word in most people’s vocabulary. While self-custody has grown in popularity over the past decade, the most common way to hold digital currency and tokens remains with centralized exchanges. We expect to see that shift with innovations in user-experience, like the one we are releasing today.</p>
<p>Off-ramp is available for over <a href="https://support.ramp.network/en/articles/432-what-cryptoassets-does-ramp-support#h_04e4875f6a">38 currencies</a> including Solana, Ethereum, USDC and BAT. For a running list of supported payout methods, see <a href="https://support.ramp.network/en/articles/8992-what-payout-methods-does-ramp-support-for-selling-crypto">their support page.</a></p>

 Using Ramp to sell crypto in Brave Wallet 


    
    

    


    


    
    

 
 
<p>Open the expanded Brave Wallet screen in Brave. This can be done either by clicking the wallet icon in the top right of your browser, or by visiting brave://wallet in the URL bar.</p>
 
 
<p>From the main portfolio page, click the asset you want to sell.</p>
 
 
<p>If the asset is available to off-ramp, you’ll see a Sell button among the list of accounts that hold that asset.</p>
 
 
<p>Click Sell and enter the amount you wish to off-ramp.</p>
 
 
<p>Click Sell with Ramp once you’re ready, and proceed to Ramp’s site to complete the process.</p>

 The humble beginning <p>At Privy, we are building the simplest way to onboard all your users to web3, whether they are new to the space or tried-and-true experts. This means building a library that enables developers to <a href="https://blog.privy.io/web3s-coming-of-age-c588af57c94d">meet users where they are</a>, and cater to diverse audiences whose product experiences grow with their engagement.</p><p>Privy’s <a href="https://blog.privy.io/web3-for-users-not-experts-52c692c25bb1">embedded wallets</a> allow applications to create fully-functional Ethereum wallets on-demand without requiring users to leave the app. With this feature in place, we believe we are about to unlock a significant UX boost for the Web3 ecosystem!</p><p>The space itself is abuzz with changes that will profoundly shape UX, as threshold-based multi party computation matures, and smart contract wallet architectures (often called “account abstraction”) are standardized. While we are extremely excited about these evolutions and are working with partners to bring them into our own product, our core focus is enabling developers to build meaningful end-to-end solutions from day 1. To that end, we wanted this post to share some technical details on how embedded wallets got their&nbsp;start.</p> In the beginning, there was&nbsp;entropy <p>A wallet is born when 128 bits of entropy are chosen randomly by a CSPRNG. These bits are converted to a mnemonic via <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki">BIP-39</a> which is used to derive the user’s wallet key&nbsp;pair.</p><p>While wallet software is many things, the entirety of the wallet can be reduced to these 128&nbsp;bits.</p><p>The choices are 128, 160, 192, 224, or 256 bits. These map to 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 word mnemonics. 128 was chosen for its simplicity. This will be configurable by integrating applications.</p> Sharing is&nbsp;caring <p>It’s critical the entropy (henceforth referred to as the mnemonic) is secured and only accessible by the end-user it belongs&nbsp;to.</p><p>Privy’s embedded wallets achieve this by deploying a Shamir Secret Sharing scheme where the mnemonic is split into N shares and can be recovered using M of N shares. In our implementation, three total shares are allocated, with two belonging to the end-user and one secured by Privy. This has two core advantages: Privy alone cannot reconstruct the mnemonic and access user keys, and the user can always access their keys without needing to go through&nbsp;Privy.</p> We value our&nbsp;clients <p>To protect users and remain non-custodial, mnemonics and other plaintext key material are never transmitted over networks or exposed to servers. Everything happens on the end-user’s device. Wallets are created on the end-user’s device. Shares are reconstructed on the end-user’s device. Requests are serviced on — you get&nbsp;it.</p><p>Thus, clients are responsible for protecting the user’s wallet. While the UI remains under control of integrating applications, we leverage headless iframes to create a sandboxed environment where keys can safely be used to service requests sent to the&nbsp;wallet.</p> Compatibility is&nbsp;key <p>We value interoperability and choice. Users must be able to take their wallet keys with them in the event they no longer wish to use&nbsp;Privy.</p><p>Like all modern wallets, embedded wallets are <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki">Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets</a> and adhere to the multi-account hierarchy specified in <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki">BIP-44</a>. This ensures compatibility across existing wallet software and thus enables users to switch clients at any time with the click of a&nbsp;button.</p> User experience is paramount <p>Private keys and mnemonics are not particularly human-friendly, especially for non-technical users. Therefore, it is imperative that Privy shield users from the technical underpinnings. To the extent possible, Privy creates a Web2-like experience with features your every day user would expect. Examples include social logins, cross-device support, and simple account recovery.</p><p>One feature to highlight here is enabling developers to craft human-readable messages for their users. This enables signature and transaction requests to be on-brand and contextually relevant.</p> Looking ahead <p>Enabling users to come in with their existing wallet, or create one on the fly for app usage unlocks new possibilities in web3. Building for diverse audiences is essential to driving web3 forward all while maintaining that which makes the space exciting: ownership, interoperability and composability of data and&nbsp;assets.</p><p>We believe embedded wallets are going to be huge. Even though we’re just getting started, we’re excited about various improvements across the UX, DX, and the overall security of these wallets. If this sounds like a feature that would give your app a boost, <a href="https://50fzxaracbi.typeform.com/to/v5gtHb74?typeform-source=www.console.privy.io">we’d love to help get you&nbsp;started</a>!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.privy.io/embedded-wallets-a-birds-eye-view-85557184bfb6">Embedded Wallets: A bird’s eye view</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.privy.io">Privy Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p>
 STEP 3: Create your code on Open Zeppelin and create a new contract on Remix 
<p>Now we are ready to create your ERC-20 token! To do so, a simple way is via the <a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/wizard">Open Zeppelin wizard</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we are going to create a Javier Token in honor of our team member Manon’s #ZenCat Javier. Here is him supervising Manon.</p>
<p></p>
 
 Select the “ERC-20” tab&nbsp; 
 Complete the following fields:
 
 Name: think of a cool name for your token 
 Symbol: your token symbol 
 Premint: The amount of token you want to create 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 When you are done, click on “Open in Remix” and it will lead you to the Remix webpage 
 Rename your file according to the name of your token/ smart-contract 
 
<p></p>
 STEP 4: Deploy your smart contract on Yuma Testnet 
<p>To deploy on the Yuma testnet, first, make sure Yuma testnet is selected and connected on MetaMask</p>
 
 On Remix, go to “Deploy and run transactions” by clicking the Ethereum icon on the left&nbsp; 
 Select “Injected Provider – MetaMask”&nbsp; 
 Be sure that the address here matches your MetaMask address in the “ACCOUNT” field 
 
<p></p>
<p>Go on the Compiler and make sure that the “Enable Optimization” is checked</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Image-3-7-23-at-9.04-AM-5.jpg"></a></p>
 
 Go back to “Deploy &amp; run transactions” and click “Compile” (The green play icon)<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Image-3-7-23-at-9.04-AM-6.jpg"></a> 
 Click on “Deploy”  
 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Image-3-7-23-at-9.04-AM-7.jpg"></a></p>
 
 Click on “Confirm” on MetaMask 
 
<p></p>
 STEP 6: Verify your smart contract on the Yuma block explorer 
 
 On Remix, your contract should appear on the left. Click on “Copy” 
 
<p></p>
 
 Import your token on MetaMask
 
 Click on “import a token” 
 Paste the contract address 
 Click on “Add a custom token” 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 Go on the Yuma Explorer <a href="https://yuma-explorer.horizen.io/">https://yuma-explorer.horizen.io/</a> 
 Paste on the search bar and press “Enter” 
 Your contract should appear&nbsp; 
 
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Image-3-7-23-at-9.04-AM-11.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Image-3-7-23-at-9.04-AM-12.jpg"></a></p>
 STEP 7: Flatten and publish 
 
 On Remix, go back in “File Explorer” 
 Use the right-click and select “flatten” 
 Click on the flattened contract 
 Copy the data on the right, you can select all with “Crtl+A” 
 
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Image-3-7-23-at-9.05-AM-1.jpg"></a></p>
 
 Go back on the Yuma Explorer at your contract address and click on “Code” then on “Verify and Publish” 
 Select “Via flattened source code”, then click on “Next” 
 Make sure to have the same data on the Solidity Compiler, and the data that appears on the Yuma block explorer and paste the code on “Enter the Solidity Contract Code” 
 Make sure to enter the “Contract Name”. Here “Javier Token” 
 Click on Verify and Publish. Your code is now verified!&nbsp; 
 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Image-3-7-23-at-9.05-AM-2.jpg"></a></p>
<p></p>
 STEP 8: Send tokens 
 
 Go on MetaMask, to your newly created token, and click on “send” 
 Enter the address where you want to send your tokens to&nbsp; 
 Enter the amount and click on “Next” 
 Click on “Confirm” 
 The tokens are sent, and you can view them on the Yuma explorer! 
 
<p>The recipient may have to import your token in MetaMask. To do so, he must click on “import a token” and then paste the token contract address available on the Yuma explorer. (You can also send him the token contract address, the one you used to import the token on your MetaMask at the beginning of the tutorial)</p>

  Arc Founders on the Problems that Drive Them  <p>Four founders in the Spring ‘23 cohort of Arc, Sequoia’s pre-seed and seed-stage catalyst, share the ideas that brought us together.
</p>  <p>By Team Sequoia</p><p>Published March 9, 2023</p>  



 
<p>This week, we welcome a new cohort of 10 companies to <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/arc/">Arc</a>—including one second-time applicant. These companies, the majority of which are in stealth, span a variety of industries including health tech, fintech, crypto, AI and more. We asked a few of the founders to share their thoughts on the problems they’re solving, and what drives them and their teams.</p>



 



<p>What problem are you trying to solve, and why is it important?</p>



<p>Devin Bhushan, <a href="https://www.squint.ai/">Squint</a>: In industries like manufacturing, a lot of training is done one-on-one or with outdated manuals—people have to navigate multiple sources of information just to get the job done. It’s a slow and frustrating process, and it can undermine productivity and safety. Squint is a mobile app that uses computer vision techniques and augmented reality to help workers quickly map machines and complex processes, to create seamless guides that show the right thing at the right time.</p>



<p>Colin Dunn, <a href="http://visualelectric.ai">Visual Electric</a>: We created Visual Electric because we wanted to make design more accessible by giving people better-designed tools. Artists and designers still get a familiar, moodboard-like environment—but it’s powered by AI, so they can combine inspiration images with text prompts for tasks like “landing page” or “brand.” From there, they can remix and refine to create new concepts.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessechor/">Jesse Chor</a>, Tanda: People who are early in their financial security journey may not have access to—or trust in—traditional banking. They need tools to help them save money, build credit and grow their community. Tanda is a social savings app based on the concept of ROSCA, or Rotating Savings and Credit Association, which is popular around the world. Group members deposit money every few weeks, then each person takes a turn to withdraw—and the ones who go last are rewarded with interest.</p>



<p>Mayank Kishore, <a href="https://www.mirageml.com/">Mirage</a>: Right now, creating in 3D is time-consuming and takes years of experience and specialized training. It’s a very steep learning curve. Mirage uses generative AI to democratize 3D. It allows you to enter prompts to search assets, generate models, add VFX—so you can build an environment in minutes, with no complex software. It’s a resource for game designers, but also concept artists, product marketers, interior designers, VFX artists. We want to make 3D accessible to everyone.</p>



<p>Why now? What has changed—or is changing—about the world that makes this the right time to take this on?</p>



<p>Mayank, Mirage: We’ve seen with diffusion models how AI can aid in the creative process. But it’s still a challenge for designers and other creators to retain sufficient control when they’re using these tools. By redesigning the 3D canvas from the ground up, Mirage gives individuals the control they need over their AI-assisted creations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jesse, Tanda: Access to savings and credit is an ongoing problem, but the recent financial slowdown put a spotlight on it and exponentially increased the need and opportunity for a product like Tanda. In the U.S. alone, close to 20% of adults are either unbanked or underbanked.</p>



<p>Colin, Visual Electric: Generative AI is a paradigm shift in the way we create, and we believe that presents an opportunity to build a new class of design tool—where you are the art director instead of the designer. Visual Electric has the potential to accelerate the work of existing designers, but also to expand the market and empower others to create work of their own.</p>



<p>Devin, Squint: Over the last several years, mobile devices and AI have improved to a point that allows for a product like Squint. In manufacturing, experienced operators are retiring and complex new machines are constantly being introduced, so the need for more intuitive digital tools has never been greater. But we also believe Squint can have applications beyond the factory floor. AR is going to fundamentally change how we interact with information, and it can help all of us spend less time hunting down the knowledge we need.</p>



<p>Why you? What compels you to work on this problem?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jesse, Tanda: I’ve built Tanda before, at Yahoo, and it worked amazingly well. It was killed as part of an acquisition, but in the five years since I’ve been thinking about it non-stop. I always said that if I ever did another startup I would bring it back, better than before.</p>



<p>Colin, Visual Electric: We are our own customers. Visual Electric is built for designers, by designers—along with engineers and ML experts who are passionate about creative tools. We’ve all been thinking about this problem for a long time—working in design at Dropbox, Facebook, and Apple, among other companies, and for my co-founders Adam and Zach, in their previous experience as founders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Devin, Squint: I’ve been working in AR since the early days of ARKit on the iPhone, and I believe it is the future of how we’ll consume content. I have also seen firsthand how clunky user experiences and high barriers to entry can hold back products from breaking through in this space. That’s why it’s so important to me to make Squint simple and seamless.</p>



<p>Mayank, Mirage: My co-founders, Aman and Sree, and I have worked together on 3D software for years—including at NVIDIA, where we developed infrastructure and AI algorithms for autonomous vehicles. We saw how progress could bottleneck because it was so difficult to create environments quickly enough. So we started Mirage to enable anyone to unleash their creativity by replacing complex design software with AI-augmented tools.</p>

<p>Today, all of us at Web3auth moved a step closer to realising our mission of passing the identity ownership back to the individuals and users. We partnered with FOX -owned Blockchain Creative Labs (BCL) to provide a seamless Web3 user onboarding experience for The Masked Singer Experience.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1626028978220990464">https://twitter.com/i/status/1626028978220990464</a></p><p>A typical web3 wallet’s user onboarding experience involves setting up a seed phrase for authentication, which is a complex and tedious task. It takes the user anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes. This timeframe has churn written all over it, and it is quite significant in web3 user adoption standards.</p><p>But this has been the standard practice over the years. After we launched Web3Auth and had numerous customers using our wallet infrastructure, several consumer-focused applications have seen a 3x increase in conversion rates, from 24% to about 63%, as opposed to conventional seed phrase wallet solutions.</p><p>In a significant paradigm shift that we have been able to enable today, we joined forces with FOX Entertainment-owned Blockchain Creative Labs (BCL) to offer the most seamless onboarding experience possible for the fans of The Masked Singer Experience. This digital fan community is an evolution of the singing competition The Masked Singer — television #1 unscripted series.</p><p>With this partnership, Web3Auth will allow the fan community to connect to The Masked Singer Experience seamlessly, by logging in to the experience and setting up a web3 wallet directly via email, social and Google accounts instead of having to use the conventional seed phrase-enabled wallets. After this collaboration with us, users will need only less than a minute to set up their wallet accounts.</p><p>We decided to give this renewed onboarding journey a special&nbsp;name.</p><p>Two-Factor Wallets&nbsp;(2FW)</p><p>Users can set up a 2FW via 2FA flows — including social logins, phone, laptops, or even biometrics which would take less than a minute. The 2FW also significantly enhances wallet security — if one factor is damaged, users can still recover the wallet using the other&nbsp;factors.</p><p>Our Co-founder and CEO Zhen Yu Yong recommends three key factors for web2 businesses to consider for a successful web3 project&nbsp;launch:</p>  intuitive user experience  familiar user&nbsp;journey  security  <p>He believes that intuitive user experience and accessibility are paramount to allow the show’s fans and crypto enthusiasts to enjoy the reimagined Masker Singer NFT experience.</p><p>But the partnership only makes more sense for Blockchain Creative Labs (BCL). It empowers creators to build their communities through web3-centered fandom experiences that allow people to interact with content in new ways, ultimately reshaping the entertainment industry as we know it by infusing it with a new sense of freedom, access and control. BCL believes the future of the entertainment industry lies within Web3, which will help democratize access to Hollywood, strengthen the bond between creators and their communities and pave new avenues for creativity, innovation and&nbsp;success.</p><p>Today, we have been able to scale Web3Auth to a place where we have already onboarded over 500 web2 and web3 applications and wallets. Today, we are able to clock over 12 million user keys a month, which is an exponential growth from that of last year. But this is only scratching the surface. Having said that, our larger goal is to provide users with Two-Factor Wallets that are secure and seamless.</p><p>“We are all set to partner with larger enterprises within entertainment, gaming and blockchain industries. We want to close the gap between Web2 and&nbsp;Web3.”</p><p>~ Zhen Yu Yong, Co-founder and CEO, Web3Auth.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/how-web3auths-two-factor-wallet-infra-empowered-the-masked-singer-experience-onboarding-experience-83c3498675">How Web3Auth’s Two-Factor Wallet infra empowered The Masked Singer Experience onboarding experience</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Web3Auth Self-host SDK is now Core&nbsp;Kit <p>Simplification in access — a core principle our entire team at Web3Auth consistently strives for. It has been a significant part of our engineering culture. Today, we move a step closer towards our mission to simplify Web3 wallet infrastructure for everyone.</p> Our Self-host SDK is now Core&nbsp;Kit <p>We decided to do a little rebranding to our Self-host SDK, and call it Core Kit. Because it is the core infrastructure that resides underneath all of our products. Simple and&nbsp;easy.</p><p>Of course, there are reasons why we chose to change the&nbsp;name.</p>  The very term self-host could possibly imply that our customers had to do a lot of heavy-lifting.  It could have been very easily interpreted with our Plug &amp; Play&nbsp;SDK.  <p>Here is a little context pertaining to the underlying technological architecture in our two flagship SDKs — Core Kit (previously Self-host) and Plug &amp;&nbsp;Play.</p><p>These SDKs are built on top of an underlying SDK called tKey, which stands for Threshold Key. The <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/tkey/">tKey SDK</a> manages private keys by generating shares using Shamir Secret Sharing, a threshold cryptographic algorithm technique. The image below shows how the tKey SDK architecture plays out in a virtual environment.</p>Web3Auth’s tKey SDK architecture<p>Now when it came to Self-host as a term, ‘hosting by the self’ was a possible misinterpretation we did not want our customers to take away from&nbsp;it.</p>  Self-host offered a bundled package of core components or UI-less SDKs to help a customer customize their desired user interface (UI) to further generate and manage their shares. This implies only one thing — it empowers you to retain your own brand’s user interface (UI) and user experience (UX)&nbsp;flow.  On the other hand, the core purpose of our Plug &amp; Play SDK was to offer a standardized and default user interface (UI) and a user experience (UX) flow from Web3Auth — so that our customers could seamlessly generate and manage their desired number of&nbsp;shares.  <p>By definition, this particular SDK is supposed to be a set of tools that would help you build an authentication engine for your platform — essentially, a non-custodial wallet. But the problem is that our Plug &amp; Play SDK also has a similar purpose, but the only differentiation is that — it allows no room to customize any&nbsp;shares.</p><p>The change of name to Core Kit also refers to exactly what our SDKs offer — a bundled package of UI-less SDKs (or core components) to help you gain better access and control over the user experience (UX) flows, while retaining your&nbsp;brand.</p><p>Here is what the Core Kit&nbsp;entails:</p>  tKey JS SDK, which works on web and react&nbsp;native.  A web-based Single Factor Auth&nbsp;SDK.  A NodeJS Server SDK hosted on the backend nodejs&nbsp;server.  <blockquote>“Owing to this potential misinterpretation, we wanted to take this space and opportunity to explain why we decided to do this rebranding.”</blockquote><p>As we move forward, we are soon going to launch the tKey Android iOS SDKs over the coming few months. Besides, we are also going to launch an aggregator SDK for all of the Core Kit in Web, to allow for better ease of integration.</p><p>If you are an enterprise looking to add a powerful web3 component to your existing systems, look no further — Core Kit is&nbsp;here!</p><p>Furthermore, below is a summary of all the other product updates we&nbsp;have:</p> A revamped Plug &amp; Play&nbsp;SDK <p>Our Plug &amp; Play suite now has all UI SDKs, giving you quick and easy access to our platform.</p><p>Here is what the suit includes:</p>  a <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/web/modal/">Web Modal&nbsp;SDK</a>  a <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/web/no-modal/">Web No Modal&nbsp;SDK</a>  an <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/android/">Android SDK</a>, an <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/ios/">iOS&nbsp;SDK</a>  a <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/react-native/">React Native&nbsp;SDK</a>  a <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/flutter/">Flutter&nbsp;SDK</a>  a <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/unity/">Unity&nbsp;SDK</a>  a Unreal SDK is out, documentation will be launched&nbsp;soon   Updated documentation <p>All of our documentation has been revamped with a new <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/quick-start">quick start</a>, and general flows to highlight our products and integration better.</p><p>Check them out&nbsp;<a href="https://web3auth.io/docs">here</a>.</p> We’re on Discourse, our newest community portal! <p>We have now fully migrated from GitHub Discussions to a brand new community forum on Discourse to enable a superior community support experience, better search capabilities, more accurate suggestions, and quicker responses.</p><p>Join our community forum&nbsp;<a href="https://community.web3auth.io/">here</a>.</p><p>Over the last 4 years, our team at Web3Auth has been able to onboard over 500 applications and wallets across Web2 and Web3. Today, we manage more than 12 million user keys a month, a growth that is significant and exponential from that of our previous&nbsp;years.</p><p>Traditional wallet authentication methods such as seed-phrases, are difficult to remember and are vulnerable to phishing attacks. We have been working hard the last 4 years on various key management technologies and we believe we have been instrumental in pioneering this paradigm shift in the industry, especially after having launched our <a href="https://web3auth.io/mpc.html">Multi-Party Computation (MPC)</a> technology.</p><p>But this is only the beginning. As we continue this journey to achieve our audacious mission, which is to make digital ownership human-centric and accessible to everyone, we want to thank you for being a part of our thriving community and for your support in helping us build this wallet infrastructure for&nbsp;all.</p><p>We’d love for you to try out Core Kit, the Plug &amp; Play SDKs, and join us in the product conversations on <a href="https://community.web3auth.io/">Discourse</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/important-product-updates-web3auth-self-host-and-plug-and-play-590bdf414ef6">Important Product Updates — Web3Auth Self Host and Plug and Play</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This is to clarify our response to a detailed internal investigation into a claimed vulnerability attack on Web3 Magic&nbsp;Links.</p><p>Today, we want to take this opportunity to address a claimed vulnerability on Magic Links in Web3 highlighted by DFNS.co. Read more&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/24/crypto-wallet-firm-dfns-says-magic-links-have-critical-vulnerability/">here</a>.</p><p>The disclosure describes a phishing attack on passwordless Magic Links, that affects Web2 applications but was aimed specifically toward Web3 applications.</p><p>A short summary of the incident with the timelines:</p>  This phishing method was disclosed to us privately on Thursday, 23rd February 2023, over a voice&nbsp;call.  Between 23rd and 25th February, upon discovery of the phishing attack, the Web3Auth team launched a detailed investigation into potentially affected users and their accounts.  In conclusion, the investigation found no cases of existing users being affected by this&nbsp;attack.  A verification challenge and stricter IP policies were implemented to prevent future phishing attempts on Monday, 27th February, 2023.  <p>A brief overview of the phishing&nbsp;attack:</p><p>When a user wants to sign up and log in to any user account on the internet, the conventional flow is that he or she would get a verification email with a link to confirm and verify the email address. Upon verification, the user would now be able to access the dashboard or the user&nbsp;account.</p><p>But in this case, which happens to be a phishing attack, a malicious third party comes into play. It triggers a login request, because of which it sends out a passwordless web3 Magic Link to the user’s email. The link could possibly have a call-to-action button that prompts the user to log in. When the user clicks on it, the malicious third party would now be able to log in on behalf of the user, but the user is kept in the dark about the consequences until the account is accessed or&nbsp;altered.</p><p>This was how the claimed vulnerability attack unfolded, which turned out to be a well-known phishing&nbsp;attack.</p><p>Upon intimation of the issue on 23rd Feb 2023, Web3Auth conducted a detailed investigation into potential scenarios under which the issue might have occurred.</p><p>The investigation found that there were no such cases of this vulnerability found with respect to our existing user accounts. Our current policies that are already in place, display the origination of login requests as well as open channels for support, for identified malicious requests. These shall effectively prepare us for similar malicious incidents where the user did not activate the request in the first place. Rest assured, we continue to conduct our business and everyday operations while our users have absolutely nothing to worry&nbsp;about.</p><p>Our future commitment</p><p>However, this gave us an opportunity to further tighten our existing security measures. As part of some immediate remedial actions, we have proactively added additional security policies to identify potential and existing phishing attacks. This included matching and verification of a numeric login code to identify false requests, along with more stringent IP blocking, if the attack originated from different locations.</p><p>To ensure that we handle similar issues in a timely and effective manner, we have developed a Security SOP. Further, if you happen to discover any issues with our product, please email us at security@web3auth.io. Our team shall quickly review your submission and respond within 72 hours. While submitting these issues, kindly provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue, the potential impact, and any additional information that may be&nbsp;helpful.</p><p>Feel free to refer to our <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/contribute/bug-bounty">bug bounty program</a> as&nbsp;well.</p><p>As part of our commitment to platform security, we will acknowledge your submission and keep you informed of our progress in addressing the vulnerabilities. We would also publicly recognize your contribution, with your permission, in our security hall of&nbsp;fame.</p><p>We take the security of our platform very seriously. We acknowledge your support and extend our gratitude for joining us in our mission to improve the security of Web3Auth and Web3 as an entirety.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auths-statement-on-the-recent-magic-link-phishing-attack-afd7f46566cf">Web3Auth’s statement on the recent Magic Link phishing attack</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Account Abstraction has been all the rage in recent months. But with all the different specifications, implementations, jargon and use cases it entails, it is very easy to be buried in the weeds.

Social logins to Two-Factor wallets that leverage the security of their devices as well. Here is where we echo a similar philosophy and align with Safe on the&nbsp;same.</p><p>”Today, there is a binary choice for users. They can either completely give up ownership of their assets to a custodian and play in a walled garden, or bear the full responsibility of protecting their assets and scrutinizing every transaction. Small everyday burdens of gas fees, seed phrases, jumping wallets, and switching networks to do simple transactions have made web3 unusable by the&nbsp;masses.</p><p>We need to do&nbsp;better.”</p><p>As for developers, if you want to understand more and build on top of the Account Abstraction experience, join us in a month-long global AA Hackathon. The march for this hackathon starts today, with bounties worth $50,000.

 Web3Auth vs Magic — How to choose your Key Management Solution  Authentication is one of the most important components of any application and as the Web3 movement grows, wallet &amp; private key management becomes its most critical aspect. The right to own your own key and the right to own your own identity.  For any dApps, the fundamental question is — how are you managing your users’ wallet? Keeping in mind this critical question, we are comparing two of the leaders in the wallet management space, Web3Auth and&nbsp;Magic. <p>Before we deep dive into the technical details and comparison, let’s understand what these solutions are trying to achieve. Both Web3Auth and Magic replace seed phrases with intuitive one-click logins making onboarding into web3 seamless while giving control to the application to manage their&nbsp;flows.</p><p>Further to that, the infrastructure and usage of both the platforms is very different and needs a deeper understanding. For this, we will be comparing the two platforms on the following aspects:</p>  Wallet Management: How the users’ private keys are managed and held&nbsp;safe?  Authentications Options: How many types of authentication and 2FA methods are supported?  Multichain Support: How many blockchains are supported and utilised?  White Labelling and Customisation: How much control the developer has on the UX&nbsp;flows?  Scalability: How the platforms perform for applications at&nbsp;scale.  Ease of integration: How easy it is to implement a basic instance of the platform.  Open Source &amp; Native platforms support: How much code is publicly available and audited? How many platforms are supported?  Web3Auth vs&nbsp;Magic Differences in Wallet Management Infrastructure <p>According to the Magic’s <a href="https://magic-whitepaper-key-based-authentication-system.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Magic+Whitepaper.pdf">Whitepaper</a>,</p><blockquote>“Magic’s Delegated Key Management leverages Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) provided by Amazon Web Services’ Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Dedicated user master keys generated using AES-256 with 384-bits of entropy are stored on the HSMs. The master keys never leave the hardware as they are meant to be locked inside and unable to be exported. All encryption and decryption operations happen inside the hardware modules themselves. HSMs are a lot like popular 7 FIDO devices like YubiKeys or hardware-based wallets for cryptocurrency storage such as Trezor or Ledger, but instead of traditional harddrive storage, they sit in the cloud, secured by AWS’s data&nbsp;centers.</blockquote><blockquote>Users’ private keys are encrypted by these hardware-based user master keys, which means that attackers need to gain access to the hardware to be able to retrieve the keys, and are forced to stay within Magic’s adversarial infrastructure — which is capable to detect, impede, and monitor attacker’s progress to prevent and mitigate any damages.”</blockquote><p>Hence, we can see that Magic depends on Amazon Web Service’s (AWS) Hardware Security Modules (HSM) for their key encryption. The users’ private keys are encrypted by these hardware-based user master keys and stored separately in a multi-region MySQL database.. This approach is good in terms of speed and availability, however has a major flaw, wherein the entire private key sits encrypted on the cloud secured by AWS KMS which can be a single point of failure. Hence, we can regard their solution as a semi-custodial system.</p><p>Web3Auth is a<a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-mpc-is-here-9387d570990b"> fully non custodial MPC (Multi Party Computation) solution</a> where the user keys are distributed across a network of nodes owned by the top firms in the crypto industry and the user’s own devices. This is enabled by an on chain node network distributed key generation followed by an off chain multi-sig. The key is never fully owned by anyone and only the user has the access to it via their own authentication methods. While making a blockchain transaction, the key is never reconstructed or stored anywhere, rather a series of partial signatures are done across the network and user devices and the final signature is generated for the transaction.</p><p>This infrastructure can be used across the world with node availability throughout the world with industry leading speeds and a surety that user keys are never owned by a single entity&nbsp;anytime.</p><p>You can read more about Web3Auth’s <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/overview/key-management/">Wallet Management Infrastructure</a> and the <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-mpc-is-here-9387d570990b">New MPC Solution</a>.</p> Authentications Options <p>One of key features of Web3Auth and Magic is the support of any social, federated identity ( Auth0, Firebase, AWS Cognito, etc.) and custom JWT auth providers. This allows developers to integrate any kind of login method, provided they are using JWT ID Token for user registration.</p><p>In addition to this, Two Factor Authentication is a key aspect of keeping your accounts secure. Magic supports 2FA with mobile operators like Authy and Google Authenticator and/or SMS authentication giving you the traditional experience of&nbsp;2FA.</p><p>Web3Auth introduces a new layer of security here with the introduction of Two Factor Wallets. Web3Auth actually uses its off chain multi sig to distribute keys into multiple devices and or SMS/ other authentication methods. This enables you to get a true decentralised 2FA setup where your keys are secured even if one of the authentication methods is compromised.</p> Multichain Support <p>Web3Auth’s SDKs are chain agnostic, ie. they can be used on any blockchain. Today there are thousands of dApps built on numerous blockchains that have integrated Web3Auth. On the other hand, Magic supports 20+ popular blockchains.</p> White Labelling and Customisation <p>Web3Auth allows applications and wallets to fully customise and whitelabel the solution. Using the various options of integration available, you can even make Web3Auth totally invisible in the user flow focusing totally on your application end to end. Magic does provide a range of customisation options, but it is limited as compared to Web3Auth.</p> Scalability <p>Both the solutions do very well in terms of scalability of users and availability across multiple regions. Being hosted on AWS HSMs, Magic is available worldwide within their servers. These servers are owned by&nbsp;Amazon.</p><p>Web3Auth’s network of nodes are hosted worldwide and by trusted industry leaders like Polygon, Binance, Tendermint, ENS, Etherscan etc. Additionally, with the new Sapphire network of Web3Auth, applications can choose to run their own nodes in addition to the nodes available publicly giving them flexibility and control over their user scalability.</p> Ease of Integration <p>A basic integration of both the platforms is quite easy and straightforward. With Web3Auth a basic of the Plug and Play SDKs requires just <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/quick-start">4 basic steps</a> and with excellent documentation and examples guiding you throughout the journey of building your own customised solution. A basic integration takes less than 15 mins of work and no extra customisation is required for being production ready. You also have the flexibility to migrate to a more advanced integration with our range of SDKs available for different use cases and platforms. We also have an <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/integration-builder">integration builder</a> which, according to your requirements, shapes up a ready to use code that can be directly implemented in your application.</p><p>A basic Magic integration takes a similar approach with one additional step. You need to use custom authentication for using any social login provider apart from email passwordless. Their documentation and guides are great to follow along and one can figure out how to implement them&nbsp;easily.</p> Open Source &amp; Native Platform&nbsp;Support <p>Open source is at the heart of decentralisation. Both Web3Auth and Magic have strong multi platform support and an active open source community around their products. Web3Auth supports Android, iOS, Flutter, React Native, Unity and Unreal Engine. Magic supports all of them except Unreal Engine. They additionally support PHP and WordPress logins.</p><p>At Web3Auth, all these SDKs are open sourced alongside our core infrastructural SDKs and smart contracts controlling the nodes as well. These are fully audited by some of the top smart contract auditing firms in the world. For Magic, the SDKs are open source, while the encryption and DKMS remain closed&nbsp;source.</p> Final Thoughts <p>Although Magic is a great product in terms of getting your users onboarded into the Web3 world, it is evident that Web3Auth has a clear advantage on the core infrastructure level over them. Being a more advanced product with a greater emphasis on security, non-custodiality, and customisation, Web3Auth becomes a clear choice in almost every situation where user wallet management and recoverability is an involved&nbsp;factor.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-vs-magic-how-to-choose-your-key-management-solution-10bbbe78e58e">Web3Auth vs Magic — How to choose your Key Management Solution</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In many ways, Africa is rapidly proving how financial technology and digital infrastructure can scale and thrive to serve potentially billions of people. Since the launch of M-Pesa in 2007, people and businesses from across the continent have been at the forefront of using technology to move and manage value. Today, they are increasingly turning to digital currency and public blockchains to efficiently connect to global capital flows. And beginning in 2013, the introduction of digital currencies and public blockchains made it possible to more efficiently connect countries across the continent to global capital flows.</p>

 Aztec x Aragon bring private on-chain voting to&nbsp;Nouns  The Private Research&nbsp;Sprint <p>Private DAO voting has long been a holy grail. So when Nouns DAO recognized the urgent need for confidential governance, we teamed up with Aragon to answer the&nbsp;call.</p><p>Today’s Aztec x Aragon implementation of Nouns DAO’s <a href="https://prop.house/nouns/private-voting-research-sprint">private research sprint spec</a> using Aztec’s universal zk language Noir is a massive step toward achieving private voting for the Nouns community and all decentralized organizations.</p><p>Private voting is the “real-world” default, and for good reason! Public voting has long been problematic for DAOs, creating:</p>  11th hour voting&nbsp;problems  vote coercion  bandwagoning effects  <p>Privacy-first governance can solve these issues, providing:</p>  anonymity  vote privacy (confidentiality of&nbsp;vote)  tally privacy (confidentiality of&nbsp;outcome)  <p>The Aztec x Aragon proposal flexibly enables for all 3. Our proposal has minimal off-chain dependency by utilizing Ethereum storage proofs and timelapse encryption.</p><p>Here’s how it will actually&nbsp;work:</p> Phase 1: Nouns Census Using Ethereum Storage&nbsp;Proofs <p>In Phase 1, we develop a system for taking the census of all NFT holders using Ethereum storage&nbsp;proofs.</p><p>This is a unique feature of our proposal enabled by @NoirLang and Aztec’s UltraPlonk prover. The census proves Nouns ownership or delegation rights using on-chain data without revealing owner identities.</p><p>Functionally, it means Nouns owners are able to “find their spot” in the Ethereum data tree, proving that they own a Noun. It’s worth noting the UltraPlonk implementation with Noir is what enables the client-side storage&nbsp;proof.</p><p>To traverse the storage tree, the user may need to run &gt;50 Keccak hashes to get to the right places in the tree and prove those storage slots contain the owner’s&nbsp;address.</p><p>Because Noir compiles to an intermediate representation (the Abstract Circuit Intermediate Representation or ACIR), our team can simply substitute a highly optimized UltraPlonk backend to run these hashes efficiently!</p> Phase 2: Vote Obfuscation with Delay-Relayers <p>In Phase 2, we ensure that addresses with multiple Nouns can also preserve privacy with the help of a vote delay&nbsp;relayer.</p><p>The problem faced by holders of multiple nouns is that of a diminished <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/how-aztec-works/privacy-sets">privacy set</a>. That is, voters with only one Noun belong to the largest set of users. The more unique the number of Nouns held by an address is, the easier it is to identify which address cast a&nbsp;vote.</p><p>Therefore it’s important to decompose large holders’ votes into individual ones. Under our proposal, each NFT will have a unique vote, with vote relayers submitting on behalf of owners with multiple Nouns in order to obfuscate their&nbsp;origin.</p><p>The relayer’s sole purpose is to collect votes from Noun whales and spread the votes out over a long period of time. It has no access to the votes themselves, keeping wallet addresses private at all&nbsp;times.</p> Phase 3: Time-Lapse Encryption Service <p>In Phase 3, we propose implementing a time-lapse encryption service.</p><p>This delayed encryption mechanism achieves tally fairness and ensures no one can tally the proposal’s ongoing votes before the period&nbsp;ends.</p><p>This service publishes encrypted public keys regularly, revealing their corresponding private keys at a set time interval and allowing for votes to be aggregated and then&nbsp;tallied.</p><p>Once the private key is revealed, the votes are decrypted and the results tallied — much like opening a real-world ballot&nbsp;box.</p><p>Our proposal means that Noun owners&nbsp;can:</p>  prove Nouns ownership on-chain  permanently preserve vote&nbsp;privacy  obfuscate ownership of multiple&nbsp;Nouns  cast votes in one&nbsp;step  <p>In our <a href="https://hackmd.io/bAen-Lm4RQuvCod8SYkg2g">exploration of further work</a>, we discuss optimizations to the timelapse encryption scheme, support for multisigs, and private gas payment&nbsp;schemes.</p><p>We also want to shout out <a href="https://prop.house/nouns/private-voting-research-sprint/3985">The Anounymous Proposal</a> by Mach34 utilizing Noir to enable private voting — we’re excited to collaborate among all teams regardless of affiliation!</p><p>For more background on our proposal, Nouns, and the private research sprint, check out these resources:</p>  <a href="https://hackmd.io/SVyDLBq7QSWNl0LaYIuqHA?view">Original research sprint&nbsp;spec</a>  <a href="https://prop.house/nouns/private-voting-research-sprint/3954">Full Aztec x Aragon&nbsp;proposal</a>  <a href="https://research.aragon.org/about/">Aragon ZK Research&nbsp;Guild</a>   Build on&nbsp;Noir <p>Private voting.

 Tokenize infrastructure, not people — 5 tips for international women’s&nbsp;day <p>It is International Women’s day today! Which makes it an important historical day to celebrate and take stock of the structural and everyday gender-based discrimination that happens in our ecosystems and industry. But while doing this important work there are some good and some less great ways of going about&nbsp;it!</p><p>Whether for celebratory or derogatory reasons, it can be unsettling as a person to be reduced to their gender (or any physical attribute for that matter!) So, how does one focus on the issue of gender discrimination without awkwardly tokenizing people? Here are five tips to keep in&nbsp;mind...</p> 1. Diversity in the workplace is not just about doing the right&nbsp;thing <p>It is essential for ensuring a healthy ecosystem. Having a variety of experiences and perspectives present ensures that projects and efforts are actually relevant and resonate outside of an otherwise narrow slice of society. To be blunt, it makes the ecosystem more rich (experientially, and well, literally too)! Diversity makes for better projects, products and services because they will be relevant to more people and resonate with more experiences.</p><p>Nym has consistently put the time in to make sure that we get a strong representation of women within the organisation. Not only are 5 out of 9 (55%) of our executive team are women, but also 15 out of our 45 (33%) full time staff identify as women or non-binary. To put this in perspective the UK’ average for women in tech is just <a href="https://www.uktech.news/sponsored/tech-gender-gap-2022-20220121#:~:text=Just%2026%25%20of%20those%20in,lack%20of%20work%2Dlife%20balance.">26%</a> and for women in Web3 industry jobs at just&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcg.com/press/16february2023-women-are-being-shut-out-of-web3">13%</a>.</p><p>How do we do this? By fostering a culture of inclusivity, and understanding that without a strong representation of all backgrounds, Nym would have no chance of being the best Privacy tech company in the&nbsp;world.</p> 2. Put in the&nbsp;effort <p>So, put in the effort! It is far easier to remember one’s pals and the loudest people in the room when recruiting or organising a panel for a conference. Which means it is hardly surprising that there are often all male panels with organisers throwing their hands up saying they tried but simply could not find any women or non-binary people to speak on the topic. Oftentimes, it just takes a little more effort and a shift in focus to take notice of who else is around and doing important work.</p><p>Whether you are onboarding, recruiting or organising a panel for a conference, qualifications and experiences should be the first criteria, so put in that extra effort and not just go with the first person that comes to mind or the easiest option. Don’t assume any woman you meet at a conference is there because they are someone’s girlfriend and don’t assume the guys are always the decision-makers. Make that effort and make sure you highlight talent, not&nbsp;biology!</p> 3. Don’t single people out for their gender (or any other physical attributes for that&nbsp;matter) <p>When you have done that extra work and have found a super talented person in the field, you might be very proud of yourself and you might be extra proud for having put in the extra effort to find a top professional who is a woman or non-binary person. And while it is fine to celebrate this achievement internally, do NOT publicly single this person out for their gender (or indeed for any other physical or biological attributes —it’s never great, it’s just&nbsp;creepy)!</p><p>It can be a disempowering experience for a person to realise they have been hired, added to a speaking panel, or being interviewed for reasons that have nothing to do with the topic at hand. It can undermine a person’s credibility in the eyes of others, distract from their actual expertise and can ultimately undermine their sense of self-worth.</p> 4. Celebrate talent, not&nbsp;biology <p>Make sure to celebrate people for their talent, not for their physical traits. It is an ingrained habit to celebrate men for their achievements, women for their physical attributes and make anyone in between invisible. To remedy this requires a conscious effort. Habits are usually unconscious, and societal habits are ingrained into language, culture and institutions. Talent and achievements come in loud and quiet forms regardless of gender, make sure your organisation is paying attention to and rewarding all contributors!</p> 5. Freedom means self-determination — don’t impose categories on&nbsp;others <p>Finally, let’s talk about why a privacy tech company is publishing a piece about international women’s day — it is not just about good HR practices!</p><p>The problem of surveillance is that it systematically categorises, profiles and targets people. Surveillance is an imposition of an identity that makes you a target and that you have not had the chance to determine for yourself. And this is exactly what gender oppression does too. It is not about whether someone identifies as a woman or not, wears makeup or not or choses parenting over profession when it is on their own terms. It is about the violent imposition of a set of categories, preconceptions and hierarchies onto a person by other people and&nbsp;systems.</p><p>The historical oppression of women has precisely meant forcing a vast, diverse number of people into a biological category and inventing all kinds of truisms about what it means to be a woman. And the violence of either being thrown into or excluded from the category of woman continues to this&nbsp;day.</p><p>It is essential to avoid echoing this historical mistake of reducing people to biology, while nevertheless putting in the effort needed to ensure that people of any gender can participate in building the societal infrastructures of the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Remember:</p>  Diversity is a strength.  Put in the&nbsp;effort.  Don’t single people out for their physical attributes.  Celebrate talent.  Freedom means self-determination.  <p>In other words, tokenise infrastructure, not&nbsp;people!</p><p>We are always looking for more talent at Nym, have a look at our <a href="https://nym.teamtailor.com/">open job postings</a>.</p> Join our community <p><a href="https://discord.gg/nym">Discord</a> // <a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">Twitter</a></p> Resources   <a href="https://twitter.com/PayGapApp">A bot</a> revealing pay inequality  <a href="https://desfemmesmagazine.com/">A magazine</a> on women in the business of&nbsp;Web3  <a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/the-invention-of-women">A book</a> on how the category of “Women” was exported and imposed across the&nbsp;world  <a href="https://www.sum.si/uploads/downloads/SUM-15_single.pdf">An essay</a> ‘Crypto-politics — an update’ with more than 90% female authors referenced  <a href="https://soundcloud.com/cybersecuritycoalition/cyber-security-coalition-international-womens-day-2022">A podcast</a> with Nym Chief Scientist Claudia Diaz on women in cybersecurity from&nbsp;2022  <p>Get in touch if you have questions, comments if you want to share more resources!</p><p><a href="mailto:Jaya@nymtech.net">Jaya@nymtech.net</a> (CSO) or <a href="mailto:Jack@nymtech.net">Jack@nymtech.net</a> (HR)</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/tokenize-infrastructure-not-people-5-tips-for-international-womens-day-366f6f53d957">Tokenize infrastructure, not people — 5 tips for international women’s day</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Dear Panthers,<br></p><p>It's time for our monthly update on all things Panther! <br></p><p>Let's look back at what happened in February and what we're preparing for March.<br></p> Tech Updates  v0.5 <p>In the beginning of the month, Panther’s dApp front-end faced an issue from IPFS’ side that temporarily impacted access to the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/advanced-staking-overview/">v0.5</a> user interface. However, a new temporary link was quickly set up to remedy this. As a front-end issue, this only impacted the hosting of the application itself and had no relation to user funds.<br></p><p>Panther's dedicated task force has also been working on optimizing the dApp's bundle size for v0.5, which is a crucial aspect of decentralized deployment. Panther's contracts for fees and rewards functionalities are all progressing well, with some already designed.<br></p><p>You can still access 0.5’s dApp and stake tokens by clicking the “Launch App” button on <a href="http://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=panther-protocol-blog">Panther’s home page.</a><br><br></p> Developments towards v1 <p>Regarding the fees/rewards mechanism of Panther's v1, development of its smart contract components is progressing. Mathematical models are now being put to test using modeling based on open data from transactions related to other privacy protocols.<br></p><p>On a similar note, Panther's tech contributors are leading an effort to enhance the underlying processes to conduct <a href="https://katalon.com/resources-center/blog/end-to-end-e2e-testing?ref=panther-protocol-blog">end-to-end testing</a>. This will enable Panther to test roll-outs for both efficiency and effectiveness.<br></p> zSwap integration Swapping zETH for zUSDC through Uniswap on Panther’s v1.<p><br>The core component of Panther's upcoming v1 first DeFi Adaptor, zSwap, represents a significant milestone in the protocol's development. The feature will enable users to swap assets privately through major DEXs, with the protocol fee based on $ZKP. We have also made significant progress in connecting with <a href="https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v3?ref=panther-protocol-blog">Uniswap V3</a> and <a href="https://quickswap.exchange/?ref=panther-protocol-blog#/">Quickswap</a> V2, with <a href="https://curve.fi/?ref=panther-protocol-blog">Curve</a> currently in progress.<br></p><p>First deployed on Polygon, zSwap features a DEX-like screen allowing users to choose:<br></p><p>• the token pair to swap</p><p>• their desired amounts</p><p>• the most favorable route with updated values based on fees and price impact. <br></p><p>To use zSwap, users must first deposit tokens into Panther's Multi-Asset Shielded Pool.<br></p><p>Once deposited, the assets become private (zAssets), shielded by zero-knowledge proofs and zkSNARKs cryptography. <br></p>Panther’s zAssets screen.<p>By design, zSwap serves a dual function of enabling trading across all available assets and enhancing Panther's privacy set. Since along swapping users are able to trade within the pool, tracing assets back to any particular user becomes impossible.<br></p>Why is zSwap the first DeFi Adaptor by Panther? Let’s just say it’s a matter of (total) value. New roadmap<br> Co-founders Oliver Gale &amp; Anish Mohammed (Left, front) met with Panther’s core contributors.<p>Panther's co-founders and core tech contributors also met up to workshop Panther's roadmap, compliance design, and more, leading to the release of Panther’s <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/roadmap?ref=panther-protocol-blog">roadmap for 2023-2024</a>.<br></p>Panther’s Roadmap. Updated on 03/01/2023.<p><br>Panther’s newly-published roadmap brings a well-deserved update to our plans leading up to the release of v1. As you can see from it, Q1 2023 will be a time for planning, revising our public materials, and upgrading documentation. We are also moving forward with Decentralization Phase 2, which includes developing a working governance framework, which has kept the Panther community occupied.<br></p><p>Moving into Q2 2023, we will be launching v1’s Testnet, featuring Panther’s Multi-Asset Shielded Pool (MASP) and support for Zones. We will also be introducing DeFi Adaptors, starting with zSwap, and working towards the OTC-like zTrade functionality. Additionally, it will also feature Trust Providers and present the first version of Panther’s relayers. <br></p><p>Overall, we are excited about the progress we have made and the work that lies ahead in 2023.<br></p>Panther Protocol’s first three quarters of the year.

<p>Last night we streamed the first in a six-part video series examining the business model of We Work (data analytics) and how Adam Neumann’s new venture in the rental “experience” market is likely to intersect with a16z’s Web3 investment strategy. Future installments will feature discussions with Leo Saraceno, Lynn Davenport, Cliff Gomes, and Brandi Hartley. We’ll be exploring how “sustainable” pay for success finance in affordable and workforce housing will advance social computing within the context of Neumann’s vision of a capitalist kibbutz. I’ve created an extensive slide deck with links that you can view <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EoorV600wnPpuZqshHpzK7Xf-1lCGV922OVu0PT-tG0/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. I plan to run part two with Leo Saraceno next weekend. Be advised that tropes like the 15-minute city are meant to keep people at the surface. “Flow Life” will be a deep dive into the structural aspects of the system with a focus on data, finance, and complex emergent systems. Stay tuned. There’s much more to come.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence needs “diversity.” Homogeneity won’t catalyze ecstatic “emergence.” But the diversity must be managed, that darn progressive “social efficiency” again. For that we need <a href="https://www.diversitydashboard.com/">diversity dashboards</a>, ostensibly for administering equity standards, but in reality used to to tag, track, and guide agents on the game board and direct the state of play. When I was looking into <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/dave-robertson">Dave Robertson</a>, professor of applied logic at the University of Edinburgh and chief scientific advisor in the UK to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-robertson-9aab0a13/?originalSubdomain=uk">Huawei</a>, I came across a group of papers published as part of a 2016 conference on “<a href="http://www.ecai2016.org/content/uploads/2016/08/W13-diversity-2016.pdf">diversity-aware</a>” artificial intelligence.

<p>The paper “Managing human diversity in diverse multi-agent collaborative intelligence systems,” detailed the care and management of a crowdsourced “citizen science” platform where volunteers annotate scientific images. </p>

<p>The focus of their paper was how to identify a variety of sub-populations identified as “personas” within the overall community and identify targeted strategies to keep them engaged in the work. These included techniques like personalized reminders and special access opportunities for dedicated volunteers and working to find the right mix of people at various levels of expertise to keep the project vibrant. </p>
<p>It was also about controlling access to information, because equal access to all information, equal agency for all people, would create chaotic conditions within the planned circular economy. We are expected to hand our agency over to AI systems, so the platform can manage individual needs against those of the “collective” (or perhaps the profit margins of the investors in the platform).</p>
<p>“To date we have studied sharing economy platforms such as Uber, viewing these as distributed forms of collaborative intelligence. In the case of Uber, human agents (drivers) and computer agents (algorithms that measure and predict demand) ‘collaborate’ to solve a global resource allocation problem. There are powerful economic drivers in this type of system that motivate the participation of drivers and passengers, but also drive actions of Uber (the platform owner), and in particular, how Uber configures the interplay of the intelligences within the system. For example, when requesting a lift, passengers are shown the locations of nearby drivers on a map, but this information is withheld from drivers themselves, as it is not reproduced on the separate app used by drivers. This prevents the drivers using their own intelligence to collectively manage how supply within the system is organized, which they could do by adjusting their own local position on the basis of information about how supply is distributed globally.” <a href="http://www.ecai2016.org/content/uploads/2016/08/W13-diversity-2016.pdf">Source</a>, Page 45, Case Studies</p>
<p>“Participation in collaborative intelligence systems needs to be sufficiently diverse to provide the right mix of capabilities to sustain the operation of collaborative intelligence platforms.” <a href="http://www.ecai2016.org/content/uploads/2016/08/W13-diversity-2016.pdf">Source</a>, Page 46, Diversity in Motivation and&nbsp; Commitment&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Thus attracting and maintaining the contributions of diverse participating groups is a fundamental operational consideration for collaborative intelligence platforms. Considerations of how to do this need to go beyond simple notions of individual motivations, but instead they need to consider the dynamics of the interactions between diverse sub-communities and how these are managed by platform operators.” <a href="http://www.ecai2016.org/content/uploads/2016/08/W13-diversity-2016.pdf">Source</a>, Page 48</p>
<p>This idea of personas and prescribed nudges aligns with outside pressures to reimagine our complex inner lives in broad strokes as archetypes. Archetypes provide structure in game environments – whether they are happening on a tabletop or with cards, in video games, or live action role play (LARP) with <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Social-Wearables-LARP-Games.-UC-Santa-Cruz.pdf">social wearable tech</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s still elusive, but I’ve continued to wonder about Paul and Mary Conover Mellon’s securing the rights to republish English translations of Jung’s work through the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/14/books/with-love-and-money.html">Bollingen Foundation</a> in the late 1940s. Maybe it was simply a long and winding road to get from formalizing <a href="https://www.psychologistworld.com/cognitive/carl-jung-analytical-psychology">archetypes of the collective unconscious</a> to algorithmic simulation modeling of agents in the collective toward a massive program of computation and perhaps ultimately, Teilhard de Chardin’s <a href="https://christogenesis.org/">Christogenesis</a>. </p>
<p>In fact just this morning I received an email from a friend with a link to an extensive interview with Jung in English that I hope to listen to over the next few days. She know’s I’ve been mulling this over – the Mellon’s being a powerful banking family based in Pittsburgh – and she offered this suggestion, which resonates with my findings thus far:</p>
<p>“I would like to point out that after intense reading of Jung again and, luckily, finding an interview with him in English, this might be the much deeper reason for the Mellon family’s interest in his teachings: if they can create archetypal situations for the public (this would go way beyond creating avatars), they can affect the people on such a deep level that they will respond accordingly and the public will stay unaware of why they respond. This is because the great majority of the people has no idea about the unconscious at all. Have you heard about Mattias Desmet’s book “The Psychology of Totalitarianism?”</p>
<p>“Simply put, he elaborates on why “it takes two to Tango” also with regards to establishing a totalitarian regime as no such thing can take place if people are connected with themselves on levels such as Jung describes. Jung stated in the interview cited above that the most dangerous thing on earth is the psyche – because if a deranged psyche sits at the trigger of the atomic bomb then this would mean the end for our planet. No bomb has been invented without the psyche of a man creating the idea beforehand.”</p>

<p>I’ve mentioned in my talks John Fowles’ novel, “<a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/31/specials/fowles-magus1.html">The Magus,</a>” whose plot revolves around a young man engaging in a mythic LARP, or masque, on a Greek island where the lines between reality and fantasy blur to alarming effect. The LARP theme is also seen toward the end of Neal Stephenson’s novel, “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/The-Diamond-Age-Novel.pdf">The Diamond Age</a>,” where John Percival Hackworth and his daughter Fiona are drawn in to a surreal theater production where members of the audience unexpectedly end up center stage in dynamically-adjusting, intelligent super-organism. In excerpt below, John Hackworth attempts to get his bearings in the house bar run by Dramatis Personae.</p>

<p>Reading the “Managing Diversity” paper, also brought to mind Cambridge Analytica and the power of narrative to present facts even as it obscures more complex truths. It is my view that the emotionally-charged rhetoric of social media has been used as a sandbox for generating and mapping the psychographic profiles of participants for over a decade. All the clamor in the feeds, one polarizing nugget after another, drip, drip, drip so the algorithms know which buttons to push to rile you up, to affirm you, and to deepen your belonging to a given tribe. THAT my friends is about creating <a href="https://archive.org/details/FromBitcoinToBurningManBeyond/page/n141/mode/2up">digital Holons</a>, modules for the machine, a palette of emotion and intellect and problem-solving frames that in the future can be plucked on demand for a global pool of watchful, hopeful task rabbit laborers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The focus of the Cambridge Analytica scandal was kept pretty tightly to electoral politics. The psychographic data scraped from Facebook for personalized political advertising targeting swing voters was the topic in the spotlight. <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/sh/wex94ODaUs/trump-robert-mercer-billionaire/">Robert Mercer</a>, the man who introduced the technology to conservative politics, is a Long Island billionaire and <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/who-are-the-mercers-the-wealthy-backers-of-breitbart/a-42100407">poker player</a> who spent much of his career at IBM developing an expertise in linguistic pattern recognition and then leveraged that skill to boost the profits of <a href="https://www.rentec.com/Home.action?index=true">Renaissance Technologies</a>’ Medallion Fund. Mercer’s research at IBM laid the groundwork for Google translate and Siri.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to economist Richard Baldwin, automatic language translation is a necessary step in order to scale global platform labor. Baldwin imagines a future where Polish accountants “port-in” to New York for the day, working a billable-rate that’s considerably less than their Manhattan counterparts. According to Baldwin it is this arbitrage that will drive the next phase of globalization.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is cognitive capitalism sitting atop a structure of collective token engineering, a newly encoded social contract. I’ve come to view this emergent social structure as the armature of a supercomputing world brain. This mechanistic organism, one whose voice is tinged with plaintive biomimicry, wants to reimagine natural life as a vast network of parallel processors – Balaji Srinivasan’s <a href="https://thenetworkstate.com/">networked “state”</a> . The algorithms Robert Mercer cooked up for IBM and later Renaissance Technologies aided not only efficiencies in translation, but enabled machines to begin to predict human activity parsing the structure of language. It is this predictive capacity that gave him an edge when he began applying these tools to hedge fund bets.</p>
<p>Another computational linguist I discovered researching this series is <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/prof-moshe-koppel-the-judicial-branch-must-be-subject-to-checks-and-balances/">Moshe Koppel</a>, a professor emeritus of computer science at Bar-Ilan University who specializes in <a href="https://thelehrhaus.com/commentary/torah-study-and-the-digital-revolution-a-glimpse-of-the-future/">textual analysis</a> and attribution and social choice theory, which is used in economic modeling. A description of the <a href="https://research.biu.ac.il/labs/prof-koppels-lab/">research conducted in his lab</a> includes automated game playing as well as speech recognition and image processing. A Zionist who <a href="https://en.kohelet.org.il/publication/jewish-state-bill">successfully lobbied for Israel’s nation-state law,</a> Koppel also heads a conservative think tank, Koholet Forum (h/t to <a href="https://gnomes4truth.medium.com/">Sebs Solomon</a> for that information) <a href="https://archive.ph/xOwDe">funded largely</a> by Jeffrey Yass and Arthur Dantchik of Susquehanna International Group. Starting in <a href="https://knesset.gov.il/constitution/ConstOpening_eng.htm">2003</a>, Koppel became involved in the process of developing a constitution for Israel, <a href="https://tikvahfund.org/faculty/moshe-koppel/">consulting on two drafts</a>. The more I research the more I realize how linguistics, language, is code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m thinking back to the first entry in this series that talks about John Holland’s approach to communication: classifier systems, routing tags, containment urns, semi-permeable boundaries, genetic algorithms optimized towards established success metrics, so mathematical logic prevails. It feels like the people working in complex adaptive systems are looking to create a grammar of what it means to be human, a grammar of emotion, a grammar of spirit, so our behavior can be analyzed, interactions parsed out, contorted, labeled like the sentence diagramming I learned to do in tenth grade. They can use the ordered fragments to chart out the next sentence, choreographed social interactions, economic interactions, biological interactions. Once the interface becomes subtle enough, or we become sufficiently entranced by the AI, will we realize we’ve become actors in our own lives?&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Israel being a member of the <a href="https://www.leadingdigitalgovs.org/organization">first cohort of digital nations</a> in 2014, I can’t help but imagine that <a href="https://www.gov.il/en/departments/national-digital-agency/govil-landing-page">electronic governance</a>, possibly with distributed ledger technology and smart contracts, will be incorporated into whatever version finally gains approval. “<a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/prof-moshe-koppel-the-judicial-branch-must-be-subject-to-checks-and-balances/">Democracy under threat</a>” and “tyranny of the majority” are narrative tropes that will be used to make a case for this transition to decentralization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I move on, I want to briefly bring Annie Duke back into the conversation. She’s the one who leveraged her notoriety as a high-profile female poker player into a business consultancy pitching decision science around betting strategies. Well, before her gambling career, she was an <a href="https://firstround.com/person/annie-duke/">NSF fellowship-supported PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania</a> with a focus on cognitive psychology and psycholinguistics. In <a href="https://twitter.com/annieduke/status/1570808241634054147">tweet</a> last September she said she was going back to complete her degree stating, “This one is for Leila Gleitman, my advisor back in the 90s, and like a mother to me.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>When reading the excerpt below I invite you to consider how the linguistic analysis Mercer developed at IBM (also seen in Martin Seligman’s <a href="http://wwbp.org/publications.html">World Well Being Project </a>at UPenn and Koppel’s language and social choice theory work) might be applied to speculation on human capital through the development of “learning” and “behavioral” archetypes refined in real time by children’s interactions (and those of adult “lifelong learners) with educational and therapeutic technologies, screen-based and wearables.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following is from a 2018 article in Institutional Investor, “<a href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b17q91wjnnr68x/renaissance,-cambridge-analytica-connection-should-be-questioned,-experts-say">Renaissance, Cambridge Analytica Connection Should Be Questioned, Experts Say</a>:”</p>
<p>“Cambridge Analytica is largely bankrolled by Robert Mercer, a backer of Breitbart News and other ventures, who stepped down on January 1 as co-CEO of Renaissance following public criticism of his political activism. Mercer continues as a top researcher and part owner of Renaissance.</p>
<p>The specific hot-button issue for Renaissance investors: Cambridge Analytica’s focus on psychographic modeling – using machine-based learning to sort through myriad data points as a way of determining how a person is likely to vote. The techniques are strikingly similar to those Renaissance researchers have harnessed for years, according to quantitative scientists and other experts.</p>
<p>‘The math used in machine learning for the purpose of affecting the election is the same math used in the world of quantitative investing,’ says Peter Carr, chair of the Finance and Risk Engineering Department at New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering. ‘I believe Renaissance has a fairly deep knowledge of human behavior. Whether [Mercer] passed that on I wouldn’t know.” <a href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b17q91wjnnr68x/renaissance,-cambridge-analytica-connection-should-be-questioned,-experts-say">source</a></p>
<p>Dallas ISD launched a new hybrid school model during lockdowns, STEM-uli, which founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/taylorshead/">Taylor Shead</a> calls “a school in a video game.” In this gaming experience, the avatars of children are followed through their digital day in “school” by a floating satellite eyeball.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This Bentham-esque satellite-eye view evokes to me the&nbsp; “<a href="https://www.pokernews.com/news/2011/03/travis-makar-leaks-god-mode-email-from-ultimatebet-scandal-9946.htm">god mode</a>” that was at the center of the Ultimate Bet poker scandal. When hedge fund AI bet on life outcomes, each portfolio manager is going to want to have as much information as possible to guide its strategy, more than the other players in the game. I’m sure that’s something Google had in mind when they went after all the school district’s email accounts. In such a future, there’s a twisted logic in children being separated from human teachers. The data economy can’t run without their digital life blood. The data flow is much more robust when everything is seamlessly sucked into the digital vortex, which is exactly what happens in gaming environments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simulation companies know this. Gaming firms have made an art out of holding the attention of participants when they are flagging and ready to give up and turn in for the night. It’s about creating in-game experiences that trick the body into releasing endorphins, dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin, and cortisol. B.F. Skinner’s conditioning tactics around behaviors that obtain rewards have been encoded into virtual environments as <a href="https://gameanalytics.com/blog/the-compulsion-loop-explained/">compulsion loops</a> where game designers orchestrate complex sets of rules determining the timing and rate of rewards as well as expectations around extinction (when rewards are withheld).&nbsp;</p>

<p>That is the <a href="https://www.growthengineering.co.uk/the-science-behind-game-based-learning/">future of “education”</a> when we become flow state modules in the master computer. With each click we move ourselves closer to becoming digital commodities as algorithmic systems, systems that most of us can’t comprehend, parse the unconscious intent or emotion lurking beneath our keystrokes, our eye movements, our word choices? Makes you look at Grammarly in a whole new way, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>Robert Mercer was a key figure putting Trump into office. His daughter <a href="https://www.desmog.com/rebekah-mercer/">Rebekah</a>, a Stanford graduate with a master’s in operations research and engineered economic systems, was on Trump’s transition team. She’s served on the <a href="https://www.heritage.org/staff/rebekah-mercer">board</a> of the Heritage Foundation since 2004. Heritage is a strong voice in the school choice space and has been promoting <a href="https://www.heritage.org/education/report/financial-technology-and-parental-choice-education">financial innovation in education</a> (digital wallet vouchers) since 2017. It’s the wallets that put you in the hedge fund futures game. Another daughter Heather Sue graduated from Duke with an economics degree and became a <a href="https://www.wsop.com/players/profile/?playerID=85013&amp;s=PA#HarrahsPhiladelphia">professional poker player</a>. During the holiday season the family hosts heroes and villains parties, one of which was attended by Trump. The house provides chips for an evening of <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/trump-party-donors-villains-heroes-mercers-232156">black jack and poker</a> and the guests get to redeem them for luxury items at the end of the night.</p>

<p>Until his break with Trump and calls for a revolt against Mitch McConnell, Steve Bannon counted Robert Mercer among his closest allies. Mercer bankrolled Bannon’s Breitbart News juggernaut. I pulled the quotes below from Jane Mayer’s 2017 New Yorker feature, “<a href="https://archive.ph/QyjWh">The Reclusive Billionaire Behind the Trump Presidency: How Robert Mercer Exploited America’s Populist Insurgency</a>.” Reading between the lines, and with additional context around cybernetics and psychographics, one could speculate that Breitbart and other purpose-built media outlets (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4F5R2-JpM4&amp;feature=youtu.be">Twitter</a>) are functioning as sandboxes for experimentation in the use of language, imagery, and ideology to activate and steer multi-agent systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Another former high-level Renaissance employee said, ‘Bob thinks the less government the better. He’s happy if people don’t trust the government. And if the President’s a bozo? He’s fine with that. He wants it to all fall down.’”</p>
<p>“Mercer’s colleagues say that he views the government as arrogant and inefficient, and believes that individuals need to be self-sufficient, and should not receive aid from the state. Yet, when I.B.M. failed to offer adequate support for Mercer and Brown’s translation project, they secured additional funding from DARPA, the secretive Pentagon program. Despite Mercer’s disdain for “big government,” this funding was essential to his early success.”</p>
<p>​​After the candidate he initially supported, Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, dropped out of the race, Mercer sought a disruptive figure who could upend both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. Patterson told me that Mercer seems to have applied “a very Renaissance Technologies way of thinking” to politics: “He probably estimated the probability of Trump winning, and when it wasn’t very high he said to himself, ‘O.K., what has to happen in order for this twenty-per-cent thing to occur?’ It’s like playing a card game when you haven’t got a very good hand.”</p>
<p>Mercer, as it happens, is a superb poker player, and his political gamble appears to have paid off. Institutional Investor has called it “Robert Mercer’s Trade of the Century.”</p>
<p>“He (Mercer) put ten million dollars into Breitbart News, which was conceived as a conservative counterweight to the Huffington Post… The site played a key role in undermining Hillary Clinton; by tracking which negative stories about her got the most clicks and “likes,” the editors helped identify which story lines and phrases were the most potent weapons against her. Breitbart News has been a remarkable success: according to ComScore, a company that measures online traffic, the site attracted 19.2 million unique visitors in October.”</p>
<p>“Mercer also invested some five million dollars in Cambridge Analytica, a firm that mines online data to reach and influence potential voters. The company has said that it uses secret psychological methods to pinpoint which messages are the most persuasive to individual online viewers…Alexander Nix, the C.E.O. of the firm, says that it has created “profiles”—consisting of several thousand data points—for two hundred and twenty million Americans. In promotional materials, S.C.L. has claimed to know how to use such data to wage both psychological and political warfare. “Persuading somebody to vote a certain way,” Nix has said publicly, “is really very similar to persuading 14- to 25-year-old boys in Indonesia to not join Al Qaeda.”</p>
<p>“In 1993, when Nick Patterson mailed Robert Mercer a job offer from Renaissance, Mercer threw it in the trash: he’d never heard of the hedge fund. At the time, Mercer was part of a team pioneering the use of computers to translate languages. I.B.M. considered the project a bit of a luxury, and didn’t see its potential, though the work laid the foundation for Google Translate and Apple’s Siri. But Mercer and his main partner, Peter Brown, found the project exciting, and had the satisfaction of showing up experts in the field, who had dismissed their statistical approach to translating languages as impractical. Instead of trying to teach a computer linguistic rules, Mercer and Brown downloaded enormous quantities of dual-language documents — including Canadian parliamentary records — and created code that analyzed the data and detected patterns, enabling predictions of probable translations. According to a former IBM colleague, Mercer was obsessive, and at one point took six months off to type into a computer every entry in a Spanish-English dictionary. Sebastian Mallaby, in his 2010 book on the hedge-fund industry, “More Money Than God,” reports that Mercer’s boss at I.B.M. once jokingly called him an “automaton.”</p>
<p>Could it be that libertarian billionaires helped put Trump in office not because they believed he was a competent candidate, but because their ultimate goal was to start dismantling electoral governance as we understand it in favor of a “free market” economic and cybernetic control model grounded in token engineering and digital twin simulations? </p>
<p>The Trump universe, one built in part on gambling, was just the thing to sow profound distrust in the system on all sides and prepare the ground for what is to come – a “democracy” reboot where we’re all tagged as agents in the game to perform our values for the machine and assist its efforts at human social sense-making.</p>

<p>This is the 24th post in an <a>ongoing, regular series</a> describing privacy features in Brave browsers. This post describes work done by Research and Privacy Engineer Shivan Kaul Sahib. This post was written by VP of Privacy Engineering Peter Snyder.</p>



    


    



<p>Starting in version 1.51, Brave will increase user privacy by extending the brower’s permission system to cover legacy Google Sign-In (which needs third-party cookies, or other unsatisfactory techniques, to allow users to log in to sites with their Google account). This new feature will replace Brave’s existing option of a global “allow” or “deny” setting for handling legacy Google Sign-Ins. This feature will be available on desktop and Android, and is another way Brave is retrofitting best-in-class privacy protections to Web APIs that were designed without concern for user privacy.</p>

 The good and the bad of “Google Sign-In” 
<p>Google, like many popular account-based sites, allows people to use their Google account to log in to other sites. This feature, sometimes called single-sign on (SSO), has both security benefits and privacy risks.</p>
<p>SSO systems can be helpful in several ways. First, SSO systems are very convenient for users, and remove the need to go through often-tedious account creation processes on different sites. Second, and more importantly, SSO systems in general (and “Sign in with Google” in particular) can improve user security. Instead of users needing to trust dozens or hundreds of websites with usernames and passwords (sites that may have wide-ranging security practices), users can instead benefit from Google’s top-notch security features, even on sites not belonging to Google. Examples of Google’s security bona fides include two factor authentication (2FA), <a href="https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/">advanced account protection features</a>, and a security team that is among the best in the field.</p>
<p>However, SSO systems can also be harmful to users. For example, the centralized nature of SSO systems means that any flaws can have repercussions across the Web<a>1</a>. More relevant to this post, SSO systems can also harm user privacy, depending on how they are built and implemented. SSO systems necessarily involve the SSO-provider learning at least something<a>2</a> about a user’s actions on another site, and many systems allow the SSO-provider to learn a great deal of sensitive and private information.</p>

 “Google Sign-In” in Brave, past and present 
<p>In most cases, Brave already protects a user’s privacy when they interact with Google Sign-In. Unless people intentionally and explicitly use their Google account to log in to sites, Brave prevents Google from learning about those sites.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in">there are many ways sites can integrate with Google Sign-In</a>, the <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/troubleshooting#third-party_cookies_and_data_blocked">oldest of which relies on unrestricted third-party cookies</a>. To combat this, by default Brave applies the strongest <a>third-party cookie protections</a> of any popular browser. This has the upside of providing robust, best-in-class privacy protections, though with the occasional downside of causing compatibility problems with systems that depend on unrestricted third-party cookies.</p>



    


    




 How Brave previously handled “Google Sign-In” 
<p>Previously, Brave provided compatibility with “Google Sign-In” with a single, global setting, accessible at brave://settings/socialBlocking. If the setting was off, Brave blocked third-party cookies for the “Google Sign-In” system, just as Brave blocks third-party cookies for all other requests on the Web. However, if the setting was on, Brave made a single exception to its third-party cookie policy, and allowed Google’s Sign-In system to access Google’s cookies.</p>
<p>This exception only affected URLs used for Google logins<a>3</a>, and did not allow other Google systems (such as Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, or Doubleclick) to access third-party cookies. But regardless, when enabled, the exception caused Brave browsers on desktop and Android to send third-party cookies to Google in this narrow case.</p>



    


    




 How Brave now handles “Google Sign-In” 
<p>Starting with version 1.51, Brave has removed the exception and the global toggle, and moved to a permissions-based system. This allows users to control when (or if) a third-party cookie is sent to Google, while still taking advantage of the convenience and security provided by “Google Sign-In.” If the website already uses the new <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/overview">Google Identity Services for Web</a> solution which doesn’t use third-party cookies for signing in, there’s no change.</p>
<p>Brave’s new “Google Sign-In” permission builds on <a>previous privacy improvements Brave applies to permission handling in Chromium</a>, including the ability to control how long a permission lasts for, and to partition permissions in third-party iframes.</p>

 Comparison to other browsers 
<p>Brave’s permission-based approach to enabling “Google Sign-In” is unique among browsers. Other browsers use different systems to be compatible with “Google Sign-In”(and other similar services). The approaches other browsers use are incompatible with Brave’s privacy goals and values, requiring us to develop our unique permissions-based approach.</p>

 Chrome’s approach 
<p>Chrome does not need any system to be compatible with third-party, cookie-based SSO systems because Chrome does not meaningfully restrict third-party cookies at all. In Chrome, SSO providers use the exact same techniques that third-party trackers and advertisers use to track you across the Web <a>1</a>. This approach is fundamentally incompatible with Brave’s privacy-first principles.</p>

 Edge, Firefox, and Safari’s approach 
<p>Other browsers apply some restrictions to third-party cookies. Edge restricts third-party cookies if they appear on the <a href="https://disconnect.me/">Disconnect list</a> of known trackers, and Firefox and Safari restrict (i.e. partition) third-party cookies for all sites. These browsers maintain compatibility with systems like “Google Sign-In” by using a system called the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_Access_API">storage access API</a> (plus <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Storage_Access_Policy#automatic_storage_access_upon_interaction">various</a>  <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/8311/intelligent-tracking-prevention-2-0/">heuristics</a> on top). The storage access API was <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/8124/introducing-storage-access-api/">originally developed in Safari</a>, and allowed third-party frames to access unrestricted third-party cookies only after getting permission from the user.</p>
<p>The storage access API is both similar and very different from Brave’s “Google Sign-In” permission. The two are similar in that both systems only allow third-parties to access their first-party cookies after the user has given permission. The systems differ in that the storage access API is a general purpose API that allows third parties to request access for any purpose, whereas Brave’s system is purpose specific, and only enables third-party cookies for a narrow, specific purpose.</p>
<p>Brave disables the storage access API in Chromium as we believe this approach is not the right way to protect privacy on the Web. The storage access API asks users to make privacy-risking choices they do not understand, and generally requires users to bear the burden of protecting their own privacy. Brave’s system, by contrast, allows third-party cookies to be sent only for a specific, easily understood purpose, and for a very limited amount of time (i.e. the amount of time needed to complete the login process).</p>
<p>The storage access API was a tremendous improvement over what came before it (i.e. choosing between unrestricted access to third-party cookies, or breaking many third-party integrations). The designers and developers of the storage access API should be congratulated and appreciated for the privacy improvement their work brought. But Brave thinks the storage access API is best seen as a temporary stop-gap approach that has its own serious drawbacks; the Web should instead focus on other, better protections like <a>ephemeral third-party storage</a>.</p>

 The more promising future 
<p>Thankfully, many other browsers agree that narrow, purpose specific APIs are needed for protecting user privacy when sites need to communicate with each other. We at Brave are optimistic about efforts like the <a href="https://fedidcg.github.io/FedCM/">Federated Credential Management (FedCM) API</a>, which would allow sites to narrowly request cross-site information for purposes like “Google Sign-In” without enabling the broad, unrestricted access to third-party state that the storage access API allows. Brave is still reviewing the current FedCM proposals, but we’re broadly in support of the effort. In a sense, Brave’s new permission-based approach for enabling “Google Sign-In” is Brave’s effort to bring the future privacy promises of FedCM to Web users today.</p>
<p>Brave’s “Google Sign-In” permission feature is another example of Brave’s approach to Web privacy: provide the strongest possible privacy protections for users today, while working with standards bodies to make sure the future direction of the Web is even more user-respecting.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>For example, <a href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10339713">researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago recently found</a> that many single-sign on systems do not correctly handle account revocation, can allow for misconfigured site integrations, or suffer from other important security and privacy issues.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a>&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>
 
 
<p>Though what and how much information the SSO provider learns varies widely between systems.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>
 
 
<p>Specifically, URLs matching the patterns <code>https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth/*</code> and <code>https://[*.]firebaseapp.com/__/auth/*</code>&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

<p>The purpose of this testing is to examine the robustness and error handling capability of the EON platform by increasing on-chain activities beyond the limits of normal circumstances. <a href="https://yuma-explorer.horizen.io/">The Yuma block explorer</a> may show a large number of transactions in blocks – this is to be expected as a result of the testing. Therefore, temporary outage may occur due to abnormally high traffic on the Yuma network.</p>

The following years will abound in innovation as both optimistic and zero-knowledge rollup solutions still have plenty of room to grow, but the involvement of centralized entities will act as a catalyst from a technological, as well as a regulatory standpoint.</p><p>We were joined by Jesse Pollak, Head of Protocol at Coinbase, to discuss the thesis &amp; business model behind Base and how it will act as an interoperable bridge to onboard the next billion users on-chain.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Jesse’s background and his role as Head of Protocol at Coinbase  Base’s business model &amp; thesis  Building on the Optimism stack  Permissionlessness  How regulations are going to influence users of Base (vs. Coinbase)  Learning from the competition (BSC)  Different fee markets to offset transaction costs  Why Base chose the Optimism stack  Base’s upgradeability  Tackling Optimism’s withdrawal period  Bootstrapping Base  Future roadmap and mainnet timeline  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/jessepollak">Jesse Pollak on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/buildonbase">Base on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase">Coinbase on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/optimismFND">Optimism on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  Omni: Access all of Web3 in one easy-to-use wallet!

 Introduction 
<p>2022 was a foundational year for Brave, BAT and Community. Progress with the multichain Brave Wallet and +80 DApps joining the Brave <a>Wallet Partner Program</a> provided additional opportunities to bring pilots to market from our 2022 goals, which we aim to build upon further for 2023. We are also planning on new feature additions and enhancements to the Rewards ecosystem involving BAT and Web3 that we’re excited to bring to market in the year ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the crypto industry has gone through turbulence in 2022, Brave and BAT continue to build and expand utility to millions of users and Creators. 2023 will be a transformative year for BAT, as updates and upgrades to existing programs will best position Brave’s resources to bring more utility on-chain for users, Creators and Advertisers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following previous State of the BAT posts from <a>2021</a> and <a>2022</a>, the 2023 State of the BAT provides a snapshot of BAT stats, key accomplishments from 2022 and a look ahead at our goals for BAT in 2023.&nbsp;</p>

 BAT Stats 

 Circulating Supply 
 
 As of the time of writing, 1,497,353,045 BAT (99.82%) of the total supply of 1,500,000,000 BAT are in circulation. 
 

 BAT distribution on Ethereum 
 
 With 464,289 on-chain BAT holders, <a href="https://etherscan.io/tokens?sort=holders&amp;order=desc">BAT is currently ranked as the 13th most distributed token</a> on Ethereum. 
 

 BAT on-chain holders growing across networks 
 
 The introduction of the multichain Brave Wallet in 2022, and support for Brave Wallet on some of the leading DApps on those networks has resulted in 489,340 on-chain wallets holding BAT across Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Avalanche and Solana. We expect to see greater adoption of BAT on these networks and others into 2023.

 The top 3 defi protocols utilizing BAT in 2023 are Compound, Aave and Uniswap. 
 
 
 

 Brave-initiated BAT Purchases 
 
 Throughout 2022, Brave made a total of 76 BAT purchases for the 70% user revenue share for advertising campaigns paid by advertisers in USD, for a total of 27,169,302 BAT.&nbsp;
 
 Note that fluctuations in the notional USD equivalent value of BAT, Brave Ads monthly campaign sales, and the percentage of advertisers paying in crypto vs. USD result in differences in the quantity and frequency of BAT purchases throughout the calendar year. 
 
 
 

 Brave Ads 
 
 Brave Ads campaigns were supported in nearly 200 countries with over 7.5 billion ad confirmation events to date. 
 There have been over 6,600 campaigns since the inception, from over 900 advertisers, from mainstream brands such as Ford, PayPal, Toyota, Mastercard, Intel, Chipotle, Crocs, BMW, Keurig, American Express, Budweiser, Walmart, Amazon, and The Home Depot, as well as from crypto giants like Binance, Coinbase, eToro, Ledger, Near, and Solana. 
 The average click-through rate (CTR) for a Brave Ads campaign is 8%, well above the industry average of just 2%, with many brands observing even higher engagement. 
 

 Brave Creators 
 
 A total of 1,742,574 Creators have verified with Brave to accept BAT from Brave Rewards users, an increase of over 30% from 2022. 
 

 2022 Progress 

 Brave Ads 
 
 Brave News Ads launched for Android in March 2022.&nbsp; 
 Brave Search Ads Beta launched in December 2022. 
 

 Brave Rewards 
 
 Brave Rewards users have contributed more than 36 million BAT to their favorite registered content creators to date. 
 Work on engineering and implementation of important updates and changes to Brave Rewards (see our <a>Important Changes to Rewards</a> post for more details):
 
 An important step toward helping us combat abuse, so that we can better deliver on our promises to legitimate users and creators. 
 The changes allow Brave to focus efforts on building a more decentralized future by eliminating our current centralized “virtual BAT” system. 
 
 
 Updates to the Brave Rewards interface on Android 
 

 Brave Wallet 
 
 Multichain support introduced for Filecoin, Solana and support for Solana DApps on desktop.&nbsp; 
 Support for popular EVMs with Brave Swap. 
 NFT Gallery support for Ethereum and Solana networks. 
 Mobile Ethereum and EVM DApp support on Brave Android and iOS. 
 

 Brave Wallet Partner Program 
 
 Created in June 2022, the Wallet Partner Program aimed to bring the largest DApps across different networks to support the Brave Wallet, including joint promotion, PR and Twitter Spaces.&nbsp; 
 By the end of 2022, the program grew to over 80 of the largest DApps in the space, including 1inch, DappRadar, Compound, X2Y2, LooksRare, Lido and more, opening the door for additional business development opportunities and utility additions for BAT.&nbsp; 
 

 BAT in DeFi 
 
 BAT expanded DeFi utility in 2022, including DEX/AMM liquidity on ApeSwap and BiSwap on BNBChain, and Orca and Jupiter on Solana.&nbsp; 
 In addition to Wyre, BAT liquidity has been added to on-ramp vendors integrated into Brave Wallet, including Ramp.Network, Sardine and Transak. 
 Additional options via on-ramp vendors to purchase wrapped BAT assets on Solana, Polygon and BNBChain were introduced in 2022. 
 

 BAT in NFTs 
 
 On November 10th, 2022, Brave launched the first collaborative BAT NFT mint on Solana with the <a>BAT x Adam Ape for Brave</a> collection, with the BAT and Adam Ape Communities collaborating to successfully mint the 2500 NFTs in the collection within 3 hours. 
 The collaboration introduced the whitelist option to mint NFTs with wrapped BAT in addition to SOL on the Solana network, with secondary royalty enforcement in collaboration with Cardinal Labs.&nbsp; 
 NFTs from the collection are available on <a href="https://hyperspace.xyz/collection/batxadamape">Hyperspace</a> and <a href="https://coralcube.io/collection/bat">CoralCube</a> secondary markets on Solana. 
 


    


    

 
     
        
        
        
        
     
 

 BAT Community 
 
 Hosted over 40 weekly BAT Community Twitter Spaces featuring panelists from the Brave team and guest projects, including NEAR Protocol, POAP, Solana Spaces, Drift Protocol, and others.&nbsp; 
 Welcomed the BAT Community and general public to 51 weekly BAT Community Calls each week on Brave Talk; all are welcome to join every Tuesday at 2pm Pacific / 5pm Eastern. 
 Grew <a href="https://discord.gg/batbrigade">BAT Brigade Discord</a> membership to over 15K members, doubling our projection for the year. The Brigade is now a flourishing center for BAT daily discussions and weekly live engagement. 
 Continued growing the BAT Ambassadors and Student BAT Ambassadors Programs, laying the groundwork for increased BAT/Brave adoption and community growth in key regions, including LatAm and Africa.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 

 Focus for 2023 

 BAT NFT Creator Collaborations 
 
 With the success of the BAT x Adam Ape for Brave NFT mint, we observed how bringing the BAT and creator NFT communities together can lead to success (even with extremely turbulent market conditions). 
 Following the upcoming Sage mint for the BAT x Adam Ape for Brave collection, we plan to continue bringing the leading NFT Creators and communities across different blockchains together with the BAT Community and Brave to offer more mints through a formal program. 
 Each collaborative NFT mint will bring BAT utility as a mint option, with the aim of fully denominating NFT mints in BAT this year in NFT marketplaces on Solana, Ethereum and other networks.&nbsp; 
 We’re working closely with the Community on utility opportunities for NFT collectors in the program, where collectors can benefit from utility within the Brave ecosystem for all of the collaborative collections, and additional utility for the projects we collaborate with. We aim to incrementally add these utility offerings throughout the year, providing continuous benefits and enjoyment for the Community.&nbsp; 
 Additionally, we’re working with Wallet Partner Program partners on extending additional utility benefits for BAT and Brave NFT collaborations, with <a href="https://getbased.com/">Based MKRS</a> already providing their NFT passes to our BAT Community to create token-gated communities within their <a href="https://app.getbased.com/">chat app</a>.&nbsp; 
 


    
    

    


    


    
    

 
 In addition, <a href="https://degenroyale.net/">Degen Royale</a> has integrated 3D avatars of NFTs from our first collection into its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2156070/Degen_Royale/">multiplayer PC Steam game</a>. 
 

 
 More information on this program will be released in the weeks ahead. 
 

 Brave Ads 
 
 Following the full rollout of the <a>changes to Brave Rewards</a> announced in January, we plan to introduce support for Brave Search Ads to Brave Rewards users, providing another opportunity for Brave Rewards users to earn BAT. 
 We are aiming to hold a public invitation for the Brave Ads Self-Serve Beta Program to advertisers over the next several weeks, with the goal of transitioning from the Self-Serve Beta Program to the fully accessible public-facing Self-Serve Brave Ads product for advertisers by the end of 2023.&nbsp; 
 With Brave Wallet featuring NFT Gallery support, we’re beginning to work more closely with Brave Advertisers as&nbsp;technology partners to explore additional NFT utility tie-ins for BAT Collaboration NFT holders, along with POAPs and other NFT utility use cases. Brave and BAT are well positioned to provide additional real world value for brands with this innovative technology, and we’re excited for the opportunity to bring more brands into Web3. 
 

 Brave Rewards &amp; Creators 
 
 On-chain, Web3 wallet contributions to Creators
 
 New shareable Creator channel pages/URLs 
 
 
 New custodial account options for Brave Rewards&nbsp; 
 Unifying Brave Rewards and Brave Wallet 
 Brave Creators redesign for the Creators dashboard and Creators website 
 

 Pay with BAT 
 
 We plan to introduce Pay with BAT options for on-chain payment support with BAT in 2023, with initial support integrated into Brave Premium Products and Services.&nbsp; 
 

 Gaming/eSports 
 
 <a>We’re excited to announce</a> that Brave and BAT have entered into a 12 month partnership with XBorg, to sponsor and integrate Brave Wallet and BAT into their eSports gaming and tournament events throughout 2023. The partnership includes exploring and experimenting with additional BAT utility for potential cases including tournaments, prize pools, gaming quests involving Brave Wallet and BAT, NFT mints, and a broad array of content generation involving and promoting Brave and BAT throughout the year. 
 Brave and BAT are collaborating on a four month sponsorship and promotional partnership with <a href="https://ev.io">ev.io</a>, currently the most popular game on Solana by daily active users. As part of the partnership, we aim to focus on sponsorships and activations including Brave Wallet and BAT, and exploration of additional gaming utility cases for BAT. 
 The Brave and BAT teams are also working with gaming titles and studios on offering additional opportunities for BAT and BAT NFT holders that we plan to announce in 2023. 
 

 BAT Community 
 
 More cross-chain BAT NFT collaborations with NFT projects and Web3 influencers, and their communities. 
 Optimize crypto and Web3 education through the BAT Ambassadors &amp; Campus Ambassadors programs, regional BAT Ambassador-led Community Calls in various languages, and other localized content. 
 More consistent live engagement with the BAT Community online (BAT Community calls, Twitter Spaces, BAT/Brave team AMAs, etc.) and in-person via meetups, events and more.&nbsp; 
 
<p>As always, we welcome and encourage the community to continue providing feedback and participating with the team in the year ahead.</p>

 Press release: Nym and Chainsafe bring enhanced privacy to over half a million Ethereum validators worldwide <p>Nym and Chainsafe bring enhanced privacy to over half a million Ethereum validators worldwide</p><p>Denver, Colorado, USA — Thursday, 02 March 2023: Today at ETHDenver 2023, <a href="https://nymtech.net/">Nym</a>, the leader in network layer privacy, announced a Nym integration with Ethereum validators and even clients to provide network-level privacy to the entire ecosystem.</p><p>A libp2p module enables over half a million ethereum validators worldwide to shield transactions via the Nym mixnet. The module will prevent Ethereum validators from leaking their IP addresses and metadata, protecting them from DDoS attacks. The first implementation is being written for the Lighthouse consensus client, in collaboration with <a href="https://chainsafe.io/">Chainsafe</a>, a leading blockchain development and engineering solutions firm.</p><p>Harry Halpin, CEO of Nym Technologies, said “Ethereum is the least private of blockchain networks currently, endangering users who may have their IP address harvested as well as validators themselves. Ethereum’s new proof-of-stake consensus protocol is vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks, as described by Adam Back and others as early as 2001 in the paper <a href="http://www.cypherspace.org/adam/pubs/traffic.pdf">Traffic Analysis Attacks and Trade-Offs in Anonymity Providing Systems</a>.”</p><p>Ethereum’s transition to a PoS consensus last year requires increased coordination and traffic between validators, which exposes systems sensitive information, notably giving advanced information on which validator will be the block proposer for a given slot. The mixnet integration for Ethereum consensus clients anonymize this traffic between validators, thereby solving vulnerabilities to DDoS attacks, MEV bots and even helping prevent the censorship of transactions.</p><p>Following the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/11/24/ethereum-software-firm-consensys-reveals-it-collects-user-data/">revelations</a> of how user data was being handled by node infrastructure providers and wallets, the issue of privacy in Web3 became more pressing than ever before. At his talk in ETHDenver, Harry Halpin demonstrated how the Nym mixnet can also be used with Metamask to prevent the harvesting of a user’s IP&nbsp;address.</p><p>“We are incredibly proud to be collaborating with Nym to make Ethereum and libp2p more private, enabling a new wave of innovation with mixnet capabilities. This is a massive step towards the vision of a privacy preserving Ethereum.” said Elizabeth Binks, Privacy Engineering Lead at ChainSafe.</p><p>Further work will continue to ensure improved functionality, including low latency and ease of configuration to ensure scalability as the validator count is predicted to increase exponentially after the impending Shanghai&nbsp;Upgrade.</p><p>Decentralized systems are particularly prone to network layer vulnerabilities due to the sheer volume of traffic that has to pass between nodes. This makes privacy for key infrastructure operations essential for the overall security of decentralized systems. The Nym mixnet, which is chain agnostic, provides metadata protections for the security of both people as well as&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>-END-</p><p>About Nym:</p><p>Nym is an open-source, incentivized, and decentralized platform that protects privacy at the network level of any application, wallet or digital service. Nym protects against traffic pattern analysis and metadata surveillance.</p><p>About ChainSafe:</p><p>ChainSafe is a leading blockchain research and development firm specializing in infrastructure solutions for web3. Alongside contributions to ecosystems such as Ethereum, Polkadot, Filecoin, and more, ChainSafe creates solutions for developers and teams across the web3 space utilizing our expertise in gaming, bridging, NFTs, and decentralized storage.</p><p>Media Contact</p><p>Candice Teo, <a href="mailto:candice@nymtech.net">candice@nymtech.net</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/press-release-nym-and-chainsafe-bring-enhanced-privacy-to-over-half-a-million-ethereum-validators-9792cbdedebd">Press release: Nym and Chainsafe bring enhanced privacy to over half a million Ethereum validators…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>As businesses and organisations continue to grow and expand, prioritising environmental sustainability is becoming increasingly important. One way to do this is by implementing blockchain technology into your enterprise. Let’s dive deeper!</p>



 Why Your Enterprise Should Adopt Blockchain for Environmental Sustainability 



<p>Blockchain is a decentralised digital ledger. Blockchain technology allows for the secure recording and verification of transactions without the need for a central authority. This technology has the potential to revolutionise the way businesses operate, including by making them more environmentally friendly. By using blockchain to support eco-friendly practices and renewable energy, your enterprise can play a key role in creating a more sustainable future. And outside of the obvious benefits for the environment, it can also <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/02/10/why-corporate-strategies-should-be-focused-on-sustainability/?sh=604551947e9f">help propel your business forward in different ways.</a></p>



 How Blockchain Can Help Your Business Go Green 



<p>Multiple ways exist in which blockchain technology can help your business go green. Summarised below are some of the main ways in which blockchain technology can make an impact:</p>



 
 Tracking and verifying environmentally responsible practices 



 Facilitating the exchange of renewable energy 



 Blockchain-powered waste management systems 



 Creating and managing carbon credits 
 



 Using Blockchain To Track and Verify Environmentally Responsible Practices 



<p>One way that blockchain can help is by enabling the tracking and verification of environmentally responsible practices. For example, by using blockchain technology, a supply chain can track the origin and journey of products, ensuring that they were produced using sustainable methods.</p>



<p>This level of transparency can help consumers make more informed choices about the products they purchase. Moreover it encourages businesses to adopt eco-friendly practices in order to maintain their reputation. Additionally, the use of blockchain can help businesses to detect and prevent fraud, such as the sale of counterfeit or environmentally damaging products.</p>



<p>In this way, blockchain can help promote environmental responsibility and sustainability within the business community. By enabling more transparent and accountable business practices, blockchain technology can support the development of a more sustainable and environmentally friendly economy.</p>



 Facilitating the Exchange of Renewable Energy Using Blockchain 



<p>Blockchain can also be used to facilitate the exchange of renewable energy. It ensures renewable energy can be tracked, traded, and sold in a secure and transparent manner. This can help to create a more efficient and reliable renewable energy market, as well as enable individuals and businesses to easily access and use renewable energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, the use of smart contracts on the blockchain can automate the process of buying and selling renewable energy. This makes it even more convenient and efficient. Overall, the use of blockchain in the renewable energy industry can greatly accelerate the transition to a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly energy system that is less reliant on fossil fuels.</p>



 Using Blockchain To Create and Manage Carbon Credits 



<p>Another way in which blockchain technology can help businesses become more environmentally friendly is by enabling the creation and management of carbon credits. Carbon credits are a way for businesses to offset their carbon emissions by supporting renewable energy projects or other initiatives that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>



Source:<a href="https://www.shell.com/business-customers/trading-and-supply/trading/shell-energy-europe/clean-energy-solutions/voluntary-carbon-credits.html"> Shell </a>



<p>Using blockchain, businesses can create and trade carbon credits in a transparent and secure manner. This allows for the efficient and cost-effective management of carbon emissions. It provides businesses with a way to offset their environmental impact. Furthermore, the use of blockchain can help ensure the integrity and verifiability of carbon credits, making it easier for businesses to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability.</p>



<p>Overall, the use of blockchain for carbon credit management can support the transition to a low-carbon economy. Thereof, it can help businesses reduce/offset their environmental impact.</p>



 Blockchain-Powered Waste Management Systems 



<p>In addition to the previous benefits, blockchain technology can also help improve supply chain efficiency, reducing waste and enabling more transparent and accountable business practices through creating decentralised waste management systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a decentralised waste management system, blockchain can be used to track and verify the disposal of waste materials. This can help to ensure that waste is disposed of in a sustainable and responsible manner, reducing the environmental impact of waste. Additionally, one can use blockchain technology to incentivise sustainable waste disposal practices, such as recycling and composting. For example, businesses and individuals could be rewarded with tokens or other digital assets for properly disposing of waste.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the use of blockchain can help to improve the efficiency of waste management systems. By securely and transparently tracking waste materials, blockchain can help to reduce waste and prevent fraud, such as the illegal dumping of waste. This can help to make waste management systems more cost-effective and sustainable.</p>







 Blockchains Do Not Have To Consume Tons of Energy 



<p>But what about the energy consumption of blockchains in general? It is true that many blockchain protocols, such as the one used by the Bitcoin network, rely on energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanisms. This means that validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain requires a large amount of computing power. However, it is important to note that not all blockchain protocols operate in this way.</p>



<p>There are also blockchain protocols that use different kinds of consensus mechanisms, such as the delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which is much more energy efficient. In a delegated proof-of-stake system, the token holders are constantly voting on “delegates”. The delegates who have the most votes at any certain point in time run the blockchain and validate transactions.</p>



<p>As a result, delegated proof-of-stake systems are much more energy efficient and scalable than proof-of-work systems. They do not require a large amount of computing power to validate transactions. This makes them a more <a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/europechain/">environmentally friendly and viable option for businesses and organisations</a> that want to use public or private blockchains and require high scalability.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Implementing blockchain technology into your enterprise may require significant investment and resources. However, the long-term benefits of environmental sustainability and improved efficiency are well worth the effort. By using blockchain to support eco-friendly practices and renewable energy, your enterprise can play a key role in creating a more sustainable future.</p>

<p>Jeff Yass and his wife Janine, the Club of Growth, the Cato Institute are the ones setting up the mechanics of the “free market” game the masses are expected to play, ostensibly to pursue some imagined evolutionary imperative towards “progress” as a networked super-organism guided by effective altruism and collective self sacrifice. The vast majority of people are hung up on polarizing political screeds and cannot see that the emergent control grid is firmly grounded in systems biology, scientific charity, eugenics, and materialism. If we could mute the culture wars for just a few moments, clear our minds, and look around, we might be able to hear in the far distance the soft hum of cadres of quantitative analysts pouring over bioinformatics, psychographic profiles, social physics, and social and natural capital valuations to shape a post-human, post-nature earth. If we don’t get our bearings soon, our descendants will find themselves existing as interchangeable modules in a vast social computer run by machines.</p>
<p>Based on what I am seeing in the Web3 space, I’m picturing a new NGO culture emerging in which Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), with a pretense of tokenized<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8"> cooperative governance</a>, manage legions of platform laborers all tied to ledgers and wearable tech. Algorithms weigh individual needs against those of the collective and mete out payments for digital public goods production. Officials, whether they understand it or not, are setting citizens up to become precarious impact commodities for high frequency options trading. One hand washes the other as the masses are made to power the matrix and build out digital empire. Everyone plays their assigned role in the spectacle advancing the plot without wrapping their minds around the game they’re in or comprehending what the stakes are.</p>

<p>In some ways, Yass may actually be more progressive than liberals. Dismantling the education system in favor of a radical reboot that centers sensor technology and securitized human capital isn’t exactly a conservative move. I once considered myself a progressive, but then I began to understand the history of the movement and its origins in social efficiency from the research of<a href="https://dissidentvoice.org/2017/08/the-despotic-origins-of-u-s-public-secondary-education/"> Tim Scott</a>. Progressive circles of the early twentieth century imagined the human condition would be improved through science, technology, engineering, and directed social cohesion. To my way of thinking this is exactly what a world run on smart-contract logic tied to optimized “evidence-based” outcomes would be. </p>
<p>The difference is that Yass would place the knobs and levers of technocracy in the invisible hand of the market, while liberals would have the government driving the bus.</p>
<p>The following quote is from an article, “<a href="https://archive.ph/I1wzl#selection-419.0-423.330">Upping the Ante for City Hall</a>,” Will Bunch at the Philadelphia Inquirer wrote about Susquehanna International Group’s activities backing school choice candidates in the 2015 election season:</p>
<p>“Nothing offends Greenberg and his partners more than a suggestion that they profit from corporate education reform. But critics of the role their money is playing say that’s not even the issue, that they’ve tilted the playing field in Philadelphia towards charter schools as a loss of money and enrollment is killing off neighborhood public schools that are accessible to all. ‘There is a part of corporate education reform that is making schools into a marketplace,’ said former Philadelphia teacher-turned activist Lisa Haver, who said that testing and test-prep firms as well as some charter operators are making handsome profits from the school choice movement, even if the Susquehanna partners are not.”</p>
<p>People don’t understand that the planned “marketplace” encompasses so much more than test-prep. The children targeted for social impact bond commodification aren’t just public-school students, but rather ALL children whether they attend charter schools, cyber-schools, private schools, parochial schools, and even homeschool families. It will happen through voucher programs linked to digital identity corresponding to the rise of tech-centric, low-cost micro-schools. Children will be put on devices, tagged with wearables, and tracked with artificial vision cameras, not because such practices will offer them a better future, but because it feeds the voracious data economy of the fourth industrial revolution and generates digital twins for simulation modeling and machine learning.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Options traders need for us to adopt a “lifelong” “learning economy model” to legitimize gambling on our futures, but the real end game is guided evolution of humanity into a collective hivemind, Teilhard de Chardin’s Noosphere, a global thought form.</p>
<p>Read the quote below, taken from a longer presentation on complex systems and machine learning. You’ll see I’m not kidding about entraining our minds into a flow state to join the human “ant computer.” You’ll also see the role that libertarians are meant to play in advancing this agenda by pushing deregulation and free market exchanges. You’ll see where token engineering fits in in the references to decentralized governance following simple rules, and the line about increasing profitability by learning about the behavior of individuals and companies? That’s Susquehanna International Group’s poker philosophy. Know the mind of the people you’re playing against; recognize and predict their patterns of behavior; and if possible, get the “god’s eye view,” more data is always better in games of asymmetrical information.</p>
<p>This excerpt starts at timestamp 26 minutes of the interview by Machine Learning Street Talk,<a href="https://youtu.be/MDt2e8XtUcA?t=1566"> Episode #75</a> – Emergence with Dr. Daniele Grattarola.</p>
<p>“…how a group of cells organizes itself to be an eye or a brain; or how independent members of an economy each working chiefly for their own gain produce complex, but structured global markets; or most mysteriously how the global phenomena we call intelligence or consciousness emerge from non-intelligent non-conscious material substrates.</p>
<p>The cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter in his book “Gödel, Escher, Bach” made an extended analogy between ant colonies and brains, both being complex systems in which relatively simple components with relatively little communication among themselves collectively give rise to complicated and sophisticated system-wide global behavior. The ants in our human brain are of course neurons. They communicate with each other in a similarly simplistic manner and yet our intelligence and arguably our consciousness emerge from this low-level, primitive communication.</p>
<p>Markets are also complex, emergent, and self-organizing entities, if you like. Melanie said in her book that they are self-organized on the microscopic and the macroscopic level. She said that on the microscopic level individuals and companies and markets try to increase their profitability by learning about the behavior of other individuals and companies. The microscopic self-interest has historically thought to push markets on the whole at the macroscopic level towards a so-called Nash equilibrium. Now the process by which the markets obtain this equilibrium is called the market efficiency. The eighteenth-century economist Adam Smith called this self-organizing behavior of markets the invisible hand. It arises from the myriad microscopic actions of individual buyers and sellers. The individual actions on a trading floor give rise to the hard-to-predict large-scale behavior of financial markets.</p>
<p>Now Melanie gives three core properties of complex systems in her book. One is complex collective behavior – large networks of individual components with each one following relatively simple rules with no central role or leader. It’s the collective action of vast numbers of components that give rise to the complex, hard-to-predict, and changing patterns, which fascinate us so much. The second is signaling and information processing. Complex systems use information and signals from both their internal and external environments. The third is adaptation. All of these systems adapt, that is they change their behavior to improve their chances for survival or success through learning or some evolutionary process.</p>
<p>So, then Melanie goes on to give her definition of a complex system as follows: a system in which a large network of components with no central control and simple rules of operation give rise to complex collective behavior, sophisticated information processing, and adaptation via learning or evolution.</p>
<p>Now I spoke with our friend Dr. Duggar on strong emergence, and he said that in his opinion it describes behaviors, which cannot be analytically derived, nor effectively computed from a lower level or a higher-resolution theory. This would place glider wars in a cellular automaton firmly in the domain of strong emergence. A cellular automaton is computationally irreducible. There’s no effective computational path from the lower-level rules to the higher-level behavior. The only thing you can do is run the simulation again, from scratch.”<a href="https://youtu.be/MDt2e8XtUcA?t=1566"> Source</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>Few understand that this planned future revolves around catalyzing surprising interactions within the complex adaptive systems of smart cities. That’s cognitive capitalism. The goal is emergence, through networked behaviors that manifest a whole greater than the sum of its parts. Artificial intelligence wants to steal the creative, playful spirit of ALL children. The forces of engineered polarization have parents and community members fighting amongst each other rather than stepping back to look at the system as a whole. Think about how much content in your feed centers the culture wars. That’s on purpose.</p>
<p>I suspect that Susquehanna’s International Group’s executives live in a story where a laissez faire approach under multinational techno-behemoths will somehow bring about human flourishing for the poor. Yass backed the New York mayoral bid of<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/gop-megadonors-jeff-yass-and-ken-griffin-are-betting-dollar1m-on-andrew-yang-for-nyc-mayor"> Andrew Yang</a>, promoter of Universal Basic Income, to the tune of a half million dollars along with hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin. At the time Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Will Bunch was confused by this alliance, because he’s stuck in the polarization vortex and can’t see the long-game is to hook us into a collective “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Social-Computer-Trento-2010.pdf">social computer</a>” (or ant computer) and turn us into data-mineable, creative pets of AI.&nbsp;</p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/Will_Bunch/status/1397358150823645185"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://twitter.com/Will_Bunch/status/1397358150823645185">https://twitter.com/Will_Bunch/status/1397358150823645185</a>
<p>The following are excerpts from the introduction to a 2010 paper co-authored by<a href="http://fausto.disi.unitn.it/"> Fausto Giunchiglia</a>, professor at the University of Trento interested in computational models of the mind and “how we guess,” and<a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/dave-robertson"> Dave Robertson</a>, professor of applied logic with an expertise in machine learning and health data at the University of Edinburgh, “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Social-Computer-Trento-2010.pdf">The Social Computer: Combining Machine and Human Computation</a>.”</p>
<p>“The social computer is a future computational system that harnesses the innate problem solving, action and information gathering powers of humans and the environments in which they live in order to tackle large scale social problems that are beyond our current capabilities…”</p>
<p>“The hardware of a social computer is supplied by people’s brains and bodies, the environment where they live, including artifacts, e.g., buildings and roads, sensors into the environment, networks and computers; while the software is the people’s minds, laws, organizational and social rules, social conventions, and computer software. The algorithms for social computation are those which take advantage of the resilience and scale of mass human problem solving and which achieve higher performance by supplementing social capabilities of individuals by adapting the environment in order to provide better feedback and instrumentation for the mass computation achieved by society. This means that the analogue of an operating system for a social computer is not just the computer or the network but is primarily the social and environmental infrastructure that enables large-scale social computation to occur.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The social computer exhibits an algorithmic behavior which is however the result of very large numbers of local computations, decisions, interactions, data and control information transfers. These activities start, evolve and stop simultaneously inside the computer’s many parts and across them, with its components being most often completely unaware and sometimes partially aware of the resulting global algorithm behavior. The state of a social computation includes part of the state of the physical, social environment in which the computation is situated.”</p>
<p>“The problem-solving capability of the social computer improves in time. This result can be achieved because it is programmable, and the set of programs that it can run can be increased in time, in quantity and quality. In this context the notion of being programmable is very different sense from that which applies to usual computers, even those that are distributed. For instance, people cannot be programmed; yet they can be induced into certain behaviors via, e.g., incentives or laws. And there are already examples where people are used as computing entities whose intelligence and activities are composed to achieve a more complex goal. The behavior of a social computer is programmed by increasing and evolving the amount of globally available knowledge about the world, and about itself, and its capability to make maximal pragmatic use of it.”</p>
<p>“Last but not least, the computer can sense and act in the world. People are one of the main means for sensing, but this can also happen via pervasive sensors and sensor networks. People are the main actuators of the social computer. The social computer can also act via machines but ultimately, modulo limited exceptions (e.g., intelligent machines, automatic control devices) the final decision on how to act remains a human decision, possibly supported by advanced decision support systems. One could easily envisage scenarios involving social robots autonomously acting in the real world. While this is a research area of potential, we believe that the current state of the art does not suggest that we consider robots as key components of the social computer in the medium term.”</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/WeNetProject/status/1319523960552366080/photo/1"></a></p>
<p>People like Will Bunch don’t get that the mid-range game is to set up impact markets in “sustainable” good behavior tracked by smart city sensor networks. He can’t conceive of a world where toddlers on surveillance play tables and homeless veterans on blockchain mental health apps can be securitized and traded to provide market liquidity by firms like Susquehanna International Group, fodder to fuel machine “intelligence.” I’m not sure how we remedy this situation.</p>
<p>The “portfolio model” of school choice was promoted by the Philadelphia School Partnership where school districts “<a href="https://archive.ph/YKLSR">dump the losers</a>” and raise the bar for the remaining schools, including charters. Jeff’s wife, Janine Yass, was a<a href="https://appsphilly.net/who-is-the-philadelphia-school-partnership/"> founding board member</a> of Philadelphia School Partnership, which launched in 2010. Janine helped found<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boys%27_Latin_of_Philadelphia_Charter_School"> Boys Latin Charter School</a> in West Philadelphia in 2007. Disadvantaged, primarily Black communities, have been the target of the “school choice” sales pitch. It is true that the city’s public schools lack resources, the curriculum is often rigid and uninspired, there are discipline problems, billions of dollars in deferred maintenance on buildings, and students with special needs don’t get adequate support. It’s all by design to justify ushering in a new “learning ecosystem” gameboard where the city is a classroom. You don’t live in a city? Just dial one up in VR extended reality. The plan is for us to live in an immersive reality simulation anyway.</p>

<p>The Yass family maintains close ties with Jeanne Allen and the<a href="https://edreform.com/about-2/cer-supporters/"> Center for Education Reform</a>, which got its start in 1993 in Washington, DC. School choice picked up steam during the lockdown years, an opportunity that was not wasted. Janine’s<a href="https://muckrack.com/janine-yass/articles"> Muck Rack profile</a> shows she published ten articles with Forbes last year promoting innovative school models like micro-schools and digital academies that took hold as a result of Covid policy. She struck up a close partnership with former Arizona governor Doug Ducey, a friend of the education choice movement who expanded<a href="https://politicalemails.org/messages/737796"> voucher access</a>. Arizona has been a leader in Education Scholarship Accounts, was the first to offer funds in a debit card format, and now has a “<a href="https://www.azed.gov/esa/classwallet">class wallet</a>” portal, which I imagine will be on decentralized ledger technology soon enough.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Michael Crow, president of Arizona State University in Tempe, is one of the most prominent advocates for technological solutions and a deal broker between venture capital and gamified education. In 2019 ASU co-sponsored a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-2019-global-education-summit-focused-on-the-future-of-education-with-sharing-from-diverse-perspectives-300965474.html">Global Education Summit</a> in Beijing on the Future of Education where a globally coordinated, STEM-centric system of education was proposed in alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Among those attending were gaming companies, including Tencent who backed Epic Games in their development of Fortnite.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.asugsvsummit.com/leadership/michael-moe">Michael Moe</a> of Global Silicon Valley, a co-founder with Crow of the annual ASU+GSV “Davos of Education,” spoke of the promise of flexible, innovative models of education. So it’s somewhat ironic that he co-authored “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/American_Revolution_2.0.pdf">American Revolution 2.0</a>” with GSV in 2012 using over-the-top patriotic messaging for ed-tech’s future. The cover of the report featured George Washington crossing the Delaware no less. Fast forward seven years, and we’ve got the guy with the red-white-and blue branding rubbing elbows with the largest ed-tech vendors in China. If nothing else this should make it perfectly clear that a “free market” artificial intelligence education model is a global program. This imagined super-organism intends to integrate all humans, all natural life on the planet, into its cybernetic circuits, and US interests are on the bleeding edge of this effort. No one – no elected official, no union, no company, no NGO, no university, is using their institutional capital to oppose this plan. In fact, most are scrambling to find a position where they have a chance to “win” in the new hunger games.</p>

<p>In 2021, Janine Yass set up a million dollar prize that would be awarded to a US-based pre-K to 12 education provider that embodies the<a href="https://edreform.com/2022/06/deadline-extended-1m-yass-prize-and-10m-stop-awards/"> STOP principles – Sustainable, Transformational, Outstanding, and Permissionless</a>. Pay attention to the last word, “permissionless.” This is a hat-tip to free-market “choice.” The game of high-stakes human capital wagers can’t advance without it. The premise of school boards authorizing alternative education models has to be overcome. The market will decide “quality.” The education space will be totally deregulated. Human teachers will become edu-preneurial “tutors” and “mentors” until AI assistants take their place. That may have seemed like an overstatement a few years ago, but within the last month, educators now find themselves scrambling to figure out how to deal with students having assignments prepared for them by ChatGPT. A transformation is underway with a shift to micro-schools and pod-based learning triggered by lockdown social atomization. Now we’re looking at holons, agents, signals, boundaries, and cells where emergence blossoms at the intersection of order and manufactured chaos.</p>
<p>In the early years of my blog, I wrote about the threat of “hybrid learning” that went hand-in-hand with competency-based education (also called proficiency-based and mastery-based), that under the guise of “personalization” would subject children to predatory data-mining for a third or more of their time in neighborhood schools. Then, during lockdowns, we saw a total shift in mentality. Teachers who once staunchly fought cyber-charters and virtual learning were convinced their students would kill them and that years of zoom instruction was the only option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I see it, that, sadly, sealed their fate. It’s an inhumane practice. Many families fled public education. Many teachers were so burnt out that they left the profession. It was with a heavy, heavy heart I read a<a href="https://www.riverfronttimes.com/news/in-hazelwoods-82m-experiment-the-teachers-are-miles-away-on-a-screen-39298154"> recent article</a> about the situation in Hazelwood, Missouri near Saint Louis. The district had over forty teacher vacancies and ended up hiring Stride (formerly K12 Inc.) to provide remote instruction to a third of the students in the district. While aides were placed in classrooms, online teachers were not able to effectively manage their classes. Student engagement was terrible. No one was learning anything, and the district was paying Stride, a company with a past history of incompetence, a rate well beyond what the average teacher salary. To top it all off, several schools in the district were found to have been contaminated with radiation dating back to the Manhattan Project.</p>
<p>Despite my dedicated past support for neighborhood schools, I simply can’t continue if the plan is to use them to train compliant citizens for the Metaverse and a global gig economy of coders and cybersecurity warriors. The only course of action I can see taking right now is to educate adults about the bigger picture. The purpose of schools is to condition children to fit themselves into society and become productive participants. Our problem is that the world that’s being built is a world meant for machines, not people. Until we address that issue, no educational “choice” can be a humane one for coming generations.</p>
<p>The driving force behind school choice is to unbundle education into limitless online and work-based options tracked via proficiency badges that document attainment of specified cognitive and soft skills. I’ve been writing about the MacArthur Foundation and Mozilla-backed Knowledgeworks’ <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2016/09/23/from-neighborhood-schools-to-learning-eco-systems-a-dangerous-trade/">learning ecosystem model</a> for years. I describe it as Pokémon Go skill chasing in the CIA’s extended reality esports game. Once we’re all assigned biometric digital identities with blockchain wallets in which to store our credentials and tokens, our economic productivity as digital “agents” can be tracked ad infinitum. Educational inputs provided by the government or, more likely in the future, private investors, will be weighed against measurable outputs to assess our dynamic “in-game” value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Susquehanna International Group is about betting, game theory, and decision science. Imagine the number of bets they’ll be able to make on a nation of “lifelong learners” dragging around blockchain ledgers of securitized debt.</p>

<p>The social computer requires “diversity.” Keep this in mind as you’re served up heaping portions of critical race theory, trauma-informed practice, diversity-equity-inclusion-justice training, social-emotional learning, and ACEs scoring. For the liberals and the left, you need to understand the measures global hedge funds are about to implement aren’t about fixing the structure that created the problems. Rather these are hollow, performative protocols designed to re-traumatize and document vulnerable populations for coming impact finance schemes. And conservatives, they want you in a lather about these movements, but not because you recognize such interventions as part of a “social computer” agenda targeting the entire population of the earth. No, for you the goal is to make you act out in ways that allow them to further refine the meta-data tags determining your position as an agent in their polarity game. The game designers want everyone duking it out on the surface, emotional, reactive, tribal, and distracted. Yes, they have a majority of people exactly where they want them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each datapoint creates an ever more robust palette of archetypes for the program. There has long been tension between generalization and specialization. John Holland describes this as an important factor in genetic algorithm development. Adam Smith opens his “Wealth of Nations” with a story of the efficiencies created in a <a href="https://archive.ph/zWQ4A">pin factory</a> where workers were assigned discrete tasks along the production line, the division of labor expanded production netting significant profits for the factory owner. Later, <a href="https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/adamsmith-summary.asp">in chapter four</a>, Smith writes, “Every man thus lives by exchanging,” a quote inscribed on one side of a luxurious bronze gas lamp located in the atrium just outside the Debate Room at <a href="https://archive.ph/tefe7">Old Parkland in Dallas</a>, the city’s most elite corporate address.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building off energy futures trading, the Dallas old guard is making its move to set up markets in human capital management, led by the <a href="https://commitpartnership.org/">Commit!</a> Partnership with <a href="https://www.financialexecutives.org/Events/Event_Speaker_Bio.aspx?Speaker=C96EA4D5-6BE3-4DD2-B129-1A6E0B864F8C">Goldman Sachs</a> and <a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/news-stories/the-future-is-full-of-promises">JP Morgan</a> standing in the shadows. That lamp stands opposite an elaborately carved portico topped by a large gilded owl. On either side are four paintings. The upper tier shows Watson and Crick and their DNA model on the one side and on the other side Steve Jobs with an orange Apple desktop showing the Pixar movie “Up.” Below is FDR and Eisenhower on one side and Churchill and Truman on the other. What this says to me is that we’re being pulled into a new “war,” a war on consciousness and human agency even as we are being told mythic stories about scientific progress.</p>
<p>In a future of on-demand globotic (pilots operating robots from remote locations) and platform labor lean efficiency says that preference will be given to the specialists. Soon algorithms will be able to instantaneously choose from a multinational pool of desperate labor plucking the exact right person with the exact badges for the right price. Specialization tied to common skills standards will drive labor costs down to the point that most workers will have to rely on some level of universal basic income, with the strings that will certainly be attached.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today we’re thrilled to announce the latest AI-powered feature in Brave Search: the Summarizer.</p>
<p>The Summarizer provides concise and to-the-point answers at the top of Brave Search results pages, in response to the user’s input, solely based on Web search results. Unlike a purely generative AI model, which is prone to spout unsubstantiated assertions, we trained our large language models (LLMs) to process multiple sources of information present on the Web. This produces a more concise, accurate answer, expressed in coherent language.</p>
<p>In addition, the provenance of original sources of data is cited at all times via links. This maintains the rightful attribution of information, and helps users assess the trustworthiness of the sources, both of which are needed to mitigate the authority biases of large language models.</p>
<p>The Brave Summarizer is available today for all users of Brave Search, on desktop and mobile. For users who would prefer not to use the Summarizer, they can easily turn it off by opting out in settings.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Using Web results enables the Summarizer to provide real-time information that is up to date with today’s events. Given the current advancements in AI, it’s crucial to remind users that one should not believe everything an AI system produces, in much the same way one should not believe everything that is published on the Web. At the risk of stating the obvious, we should not suspend critical thinking for anything we consume, no matter how impressive the results of AI models can be.</p>
<p>Besides the summary itself, our AI models are also able to replace the already query-dependent snippets (result descriptions) with a summarized version of those snippets, highlighting the answer when possible. This can be viewed as a summary of a single source (such as a press article), as opposed to the main summary where multiple sources are considered and aggregated to create a more comprehensive answer. The summary at the top of the results page and these special descriptions co-occur, so users will see the overarching summary as well as snippets with highlighted answers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

    
    


    


    
    
</p>
<p>Note the highlighted answers in the result snippets</p>
<p>“With 22 million queries per day, Brave Search is the fastest growing search engine since Bing. We provide independent search results from our own index of the Web, and today we’re further improving the relevance of those results with our AI-powered Summarizer,” said Josep M. Pujol, Chief of Search at Brave. “Unlike AI chat tools which can provide fabricated responses, the Summarizer generates a plain-written summary at the top of the search results page, aggregating the latest sources on the Web and providing source attribution for transparency and accountability. This open system is available to all Brave Search users today to help them better navigate search results.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike many others that have released similar features recently, we do not rely on third parties, nor do we limit access due to scalability concerns. The Brave Summarizer relies on our owned and operated models that are highly tuned to be as efficient as possible at inference time. Today, Brave Search processes daily peaks of 600 queries per second, which are then evaluated against our AI model. Although a summary is generated for about 17% of queries, we expect this number to grow in the near future as we scale our system. The Brave AI model is probably the largest such system in production to date, in that it receives more traffic than others in terms of queries per second, we apply the Summarizer to all queries, and Bing and Google have yet to open up their systems. <a>1</a></p>
<p>Besides scalability, a tremendous effort has been put into ensuring the quality of the generated summaries. However, as the model is still in its early phase of development, there is the possibility of producing “hallucinations,” which mix unrelated snippets into a single result. There is also the possibility of some false or offensive text, but our aim is to continue working on improving the models as our users’ feedback starts pouring in.</p>
<p>The Summarizer was fully developed by the Brave Search team and as such is based on the same principles of independence and privacy that we apply across all products. The Summarizer is not powered by ChatGPT or its backend systems; it is instead composed of three different LLMs <a>2</a> trained on different tasks:</p>
 
 
<p>The first one is QA (question answering): this model is used to try to extract a concrete answer, if any, from text snippets. Brave has been using LLMs for a while to improve search relevance, and this is an extension of what Brave Search already had in place to power its knowledge graph and featured snippets features. The difference lies in the number and length of text snippets analyzed.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>After the QA extraction phase, result candidates are further classified with an ensemble of zero-shot classifiers on a wide variety of criteria (hate-speech, vulgar writing, spam, etc).&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>The final set of candidate text is ultimately processed by the summarizer/paraphrasing model, which tries to rewrite the input so that repetition is removed and that language is kept uniform to improve readability.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>We plan to share more technical details with special emphasis on the scalability aspect and lessons learned after the first weeks of our large scale release.</p>
<p>Note that the Summarizer is currently disabled in Brave Search Goggles (an innovative Brave Search feature that enables users to create filters to alter the ordering of search results) <a>3</a>, while we refine our models to guarantee  the quality of the input source for user-generated Goggles. We’ll be sharing more details about the Summarizer for Goggles in the near future.&nbsp;</p>

 Conclusions 
<p>The Brave Search Summarizer comes on top of multiple developments we integrated to improve search relevance in the past, and more recent developments that were triggered after the release of ChatGPT last December, notably after the announcement that Microsoft would deeply integrate OpenAI’s models into their search engine Bing. Although it has not been publicly released, early feedback of their model ranges from impressive <a>4</a> to scary <a>5</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the industry is generating much hype around AI, at Brave we are not yet convinced that LLMs can replace search as we know it. However, if used properly, these new models can help the user navigate results, which is the approach we follow with the Summarizer. Chat-like interfaces and oracle-based search remain unproven and, as of today, we remain skeptical that they’ll be useful for all search tasks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, we are strong believers in any new technology that helps users satisfy their needs and puts them in control of their online experience. We will continue exploring how to apply LLMs not only to the search field, but also to the Brave browser, where we expect the assistant-like capabilities of LLMs to be truly fruitful and revolutionary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brave has a history of taking up big challenges, offering credible alternatives to BigTech. The Brave browser has over 57 million monthly active users, and Brave Search serves more than 22 million queries per day out of its independent index, which makes it the biggest search engine after Bing, Google, and other engines relying on Bing or Google APIs. Though it’s still early, we expect our developments with AI to follow a similar path and see proven user adoption.</p>
<p>Brave Search is available on all <a>Brave</a> browsers (desktop, Android, and iOS), and is also available from any other browser at <a href="https://search.brave.com/">search.brave.com</a>.</p>

							<p>The Zcash Foundation has been looking into <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1256.pdf">Oblivious Message Retrieval (OMR)</a> to determine whether it offers a potential solution to the recent performance problems that have affected Zcash wallet users, and whether there are any advantages to be gained from implementing this in a Zcash context. For example, can OMR be used to address the privacy leaks of using lightwalletd? Light wallets like Nighthawk Wallet, Zecwallet Lite, and YWallet use lightwalletd to fetch and send Zcash transactions, without the overhead of running a full node locally. Would running OMR on a full node provide us with any performance advantages when fetching transactions?&nbsp;</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 The Current Lightwalletd Architecture 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>Light wallets are typically used to download shielded transactions via a lightwalletd server. To preserve privacy about which transactions a wallet is interested in, one can download all the transactions in full. However, this is expensive and nearly amounts to the full blockchain in size/bandwidth, which is not great for lighter devices or those with low bandwidth/network speed, etc. This is why the lightwallet protocol exists.</p><p>Most light wallets fetch a limited amount of data about every shielded transaction (i.e. a `CompactTx`) from a lightwalletd proxy, just enough to allow trial decryption. The wallet trial-decrypts every `CompactTx` to see if that transaction has been sent to them. This is because all shielded transactions on the Zcash blockchain are encrypted and indistinguishable from the others such that no one can tell which transactions are addressed to whom, unless you have the incoming viewing key to decrypt them. Trial decryption takes more computational effort than transparent syncing, proportional to how many shielded transactions are on on-chain, but <a href="https://hackmd.io/@str4d/dagsync-graph-aware-zcash-wallets">advances</a> in <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zecwallets-blazesync-sync-entire-chain-in-60s/39447">syncing algorithms</a> have made this cheaper. However, to construct new transactions, a wallet needs data that’s not included in CompactTxs or CompactBlocks, so after detecting a transaction, the wallet has to fetch the full transaction via lightwalletd. Everything stays encrypted for shielded transactions (the ‘data’), but now the lightwalletd proxy knows that a wallet with a certain IP address has requested a certain subset of Zcash shielded transactions, at a specific time (‘metadata’). This is an unfortunate and undesirable privacy leak.</p><p>It would be better if we can trial-decrypt and fetch transactions privately, and also not have to download all transactions in full to do so.</p>

							Oblivious Message Retrieval (OMR) is a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1256.pdf">construction</a> from Zeyu (Thomas) Liu and Eran Tromer that uses lattice-based (LWE) fully-homomorphic encryption. It allows a full node to scan the Zcash blockchain for shielded transactions encrypted for a particular recipient and return just the transactions they need without knowing the full query or the results in plaintext. This would offload more computational effort and bandwidth requirements to a full node while also protecting the metadata privacy of a user or wallet, hiding which Zcash transactions the recipient cares about. The only thing the OMR-compatible full node learns about the user is that they are interested in OMR-compatible transactions, but not which ones.

							<p>At a high level, here’s how a version of Zcash that supports Oblivious Message Retrieval could work:</p><p>A user generates an updated unified address that includes a new clue key (this also supports diversified addresses). When sending money to an OMR-supporting address, the regular Zcash shielded transaction will occur, but the transaction will also include a clue ciphertext. This clue ciphertext is about 1KB of additional data per shielded output.</p><p>The user then generates a detection key and registers that with an OMR-supporting Zcash full node. The node uses that detection key to scan all the shielded transactions on the chain and their attached clue ciphertexts. The scanning involves taking all the transactions, including the clue ciphertexts, and fully-homomorphically, trying to use the detection key to decrypt the clue ciphertexts associated with the shielded transactions.</p><p>This is the magic of fully-homomorphic encryption: the full node cannot distinguish the (encrypted) secret key that is trying to decrypt the clue ciphertexts, as it is homomorphically encrypted, but it can still do the computation and return the encrypted results of the computation to the holder of the detection secret key.</p><p>As the OMR-compatible full node scans all the transactions, it homomorphically accumulates all the transactions whose clue ciphertexts decrypt under the clue secret key, and returns the digest of all the transactions as a new homomorphically-encrypted result. The user can then decrypt those results with the detection secret key, and then have all the Zcash transactions relevant to their wallet ready to go. The full node does not know which transactions are relevant to the wallet, as it processes all of them and computes the matching under fully-homomorphic encrypted computation.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 What might this feel like? (beyond lightwalletd flow) 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>OMR supports two kinds of querying for results that support multiple ways for a wallet developer or other client to interact with an OMR-supporting full node:</p><p>“Sync” querying – In the single-shot model, the recipient makes a stateless query to the full node: it provides a detection key, a range of blocks to scan, and a bound k on the number of pertinent messages, and asks the node to digest those blocks with respect to that key. The detector runs all of the `Retrieve` algorithm. Response latency is high: about 0.145 sec per transaction.</p><p>“Async” querying – The subscribe and finalize model utilizes the streaming variant. The user provides a detection key and asks to subscribe to ongoing (and perhaps some past) transactions. The node starts processing these transactions, doing most of the computation (i.e. homomorphically computing the PV ciphertexts). Later, the user shows up and asks the server to finalize the results and pack them into a digest, with respect to some k. Neither the finalization time nor message bound k need be known in advance. This reduces finalization to 0.35 milliseconds/tx per core.&nbsp;</p><p>The latter approach fits in nicely with the steady-state wallet UX: open up wallet app every once in a while, get an up-to-date view of wallet state ~immediately, then take an action.</p><p>This is attractive to wallet developers and users who value the privacy gains of OMR, but hopefully would not sacrifice usability and experience to achieve them.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 This Sounds Great! Are We Doing This? 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>Well, we’re trying to figure that out. Zcash has changed a bit since OMR was first published (we have Orchard Actions now, for example). There are design decisions we would have to make about the Zcash protocol in order to support OMR, and other compatibility, design, and UX questions we’d have to address. Such as:</p>  How backwards compatible is this?  Requires an updated key/address (see below), but also new changes to shielded transactions, specifically the inclusion of 956 bytes of clue data per shielded transaction (or specifically per description: Sapling Output, may need to be updated for Orchard Actions). This is okay but requires a network upgrade and coordination between node and wallet developers. It also increases the transaction size, in addition to the larger Orchard Actions from NU5.  “It would be the cleanest to extend the transaction format with a dedicated clue field,” according to the OMR paper. The clue is 1KB per spend.      Do I need to generate new keys and a new address?  Well, kind of. You need to generate a new clue key to be part of the address, so with Unified Addresses, this can be a new extension with existing Sapling/Orchard key material, but the Unified Address will look different. This clue key uses a different type of cryptography from the Sapling/Orchard keys so we can’t reuse the other keys to support Oblivious Message Retrieval.  Per the constructions proposed in the OMR paper, the clue key is 133KB. That’s right, kilobytes (thanks, lattices!) This is too big for a regular QR code encoding, or hex/ascii string, but, an alternative that should work in the Unified Address framework, and instead of having the full clue key inlined in the address, we encode and inline a link to and hash of the clue key, and fetch it from somewhere else. The clue key is a ~public key.  How can we maintain trust and anonymity if we host OMR keys on another platform? Key transparency?  When you set up a full node to do OMR detection for you, you generate and upload a detection key. This key is not part of your address. It is even larger than the clue key, at ~129MB (yes, megabytes). This is a one-time upload for recipients, but full nodes will have to keep them per-recipient as long as they are privately scanning for that user. The Zcash mainnet chain is coming up on 100GB in size, and storage is relatively cheap, but this does mean adding another recipient client as a full node has non-negligible storage costs as well as the computation costs, and the clue key size may restrict the number of addresses that can be detected live together, as some use cases involve hundreds or thousands of keys.      What about diversified addresses?  OMR clue keys are diversifiable, so that property of unlinkable keys is maintained; incoming payments sent to any of a user’s (multiple) diversified addresses can be retrieved and spent using a single key tuple.      How much compute does this require from full node operators?  “∼$1.02 per million payments scanned (for each recipient served), using commodity cloud computing,” according to the OMR paper. This is about the whole current Zcash mainnet chain right now so it sounds scalable and affordable to serve multiple recipients.      If I serve a lot of OMR recipients on one full node, will query latency suffer?  Hard to say before there is a full implementation to test. Using the subscribe and finalize query model for the general wallet case would indicate it could be quite fast and scale well in general in an async-supporting full node like zebrad.      This is based on lattices, does that mean it’s post-quantum secure?  It looks like it, yes!      How is this different from viewing keys?  Registering viewing keys (incoming, outgoing, or full) with a full node and having them scan the chain on a user’s behalf gets close to the data flow of OMR, but with one crucial difference: the node can see which shielded transactions you are interested in and addressed to you, and can read the memo field, transaction value, and target address. OMR does not allow this.    						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 What's Next? 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>If it were possible to deploy OMR without the need for a network update and/or other significant changes (such as addresses), then we would be looking very closely at doing so. However, given the effort involved, we don’t think it’s a priority at this time, and we would want to consider alternative performance improvement approaches (like detection keys).</p>

<p>The Nym mixnet has a shared history with Bitcoin. Unsurprisingly, we at Nym want Bitcoiners to have the best privacy possible! We are therefore proud to announce that we are supporting Blockstream by adding the <a href="https://blockstream.com/green/">Blockstream Green Bitcoin wallet</a> to <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">Nym Connect</a> due to its <a href="https://liquid.net">Liquid</a>’s privacy features. We want to take this opportunity to delve into the pre-history of Bitcoin and its shared history with&nbsp;mixnets…</p><p>With the invention of Bitcoin, Satoshi brought together major work by the cypherpunk movement, who were working on technologies for anonymous communication like mixnets — the technology for network-level privacy, launched by Nym. Reviewing this history can help us understand how technologies can promote human freedoms and evolve in the most unexpected ways. The cypherpunks were prophetic in their understanding of how easily the internet would become a vehicle for mass surveillance. It is time to join forces and put their solution to work. Looking towards the future evolution of Bitcoin, the combination of the two technologies via integration into Liquid, Lightning and the wider Bitcoin ecosystem would bring to fruition much of this important work.</p><a href="https://blockstream.com/green/">Blockstream Green</a> over the mixnet using <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">NymConnect</a> Mixnets: a short pre-history of&nbsp;Bitcoin <p>Mixnets like Nym were originally invented by David Chaum in his famous paper <a href="https://chaum.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/chaum-mix.pdf">“Untraceable electronic mail, return addresses, and digital pseudonyms”</a>. A mixnet mixes packets to unlink the sender and the receiver. Unfortunately, every time you use Bitcoin (or Lightning), your IP address and the timing and volume of your information leak. Nym Chief Scientist Claudia Diaz has shown how this leaking ‘metadata’ about your communications can be used to uniquely identify you. We recommend you read her paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11860">On the Anonymity of Peer-To-Peer Network Anonymity Schemes Used by Cryptocurrencies</a> with Piyush Kumar Sharma and Devashish Gosain — (which will be presented at <a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/">NDSS</a> this&nbsp;week!)</p><p>Proof of work was invented by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdwOXWmAs8Y">Adam Back’s work on mixnets</a>: Adam Back was running the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixminion">Mixmaster</a> mixnet (a pre-Nym mixnet), which provided anonymous e-mail services to spread information anonymously. When anti-privacy fanatics attacked his mixnet by flooding it with fake messages, Adam Back decided he needed a way to stop this e-mail spam. Importantly, to do so without assigning each person a unique identity, allowing users of the mixnet to remain anonymous. He implemented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash">HashCash</a> to serve as a way to defeat sybil attacks, by forcing any user of the mixnet to solve a hash puzzle. This effectively defeated spam&nbsp;attacks.</p><p>Famously, Satoshi Nakamoto then used this idea from HashCash to reach consensus in the Bitcoin blockchain (solving the <a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/byz.pdf">Byzantine Generals Problem</a>) without uniquely identifying nodes in the Bitcoin network. It is this fundamental invention that makes Bitcoin permissionless. And with this history, we dare say it’s quite likely that Satoshi Nakamoto was a mixnet&nbsp;user!</p><p>While Bitcoin creates different public keys per transaction and so allows some basic privacy, a well-resourced attacker like a government or Chainalysis can identify Bitcoin users by using only on-chain information. Enter the <a href="https://liquid.net/">Liquid</a> sidechain, whose use of confidential transactions via homomorphic encryption and blinded (stealth) addresses allow more privacy on Bitcoin than our prior integration with Electrum, at the cost of dependency on a federated side-chain. We strongly encourage Bitcoin users to look into Blockstream Green with Nym Connect for improved privacy for Bitcoin. This is especially useful as the Tor network typically used by Liquid is under <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/tor-network-ddos-attack/">a mysterious attack</a> that makes it harder to use with Blockstream Green.</p><p>We’re happy to see Nym go full circle. The NYM token was originally the NYMPH token on the Liquid blockchain, and since then we’ve launched a NYM token <a href="https://www.regservices.ch/en/definitions/nym-technologies-sa-neuchatel-switzerland/">prospectus</a>. We’ve rewarded early contributors, users and token holders with NYM — although the community has had to go through KYC/AML with long-time Bitcoin supporter <a href="https://stokr.io/">STOKR</a>. Our privacy-first approach will require many other integrations to diverse applications in order to maintain the anonymity of Bitcoin users, but we think even Nakamoto would be thrilled to see Bitcoin transactions going over a mixnet. Further integrations with Bitcoin and Blockstream are in the&nbsp;works!</p>Harry Halpin and father with Blockstream gear that Adam Back sent&nbsp;over<p>Links</p>  Download <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">NymConnect</a>  Join our <a href="http://discord.gg/nym">Discord</a> and <a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a> communities!   <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/how-mixnets-led-to-bitcoin-blockstream-green-supported-by-nym-connect-85d2ee325012">How Mixnets led to Bitcoin: Blockstream Green supported by Nym Connect!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This week someone brought Naomi Wolf’s Sub Stack post, “<a href="https://naomiwolf.substack.com/p/have-the-ancient-gods-returned">Have the Ancient Gods Returned?</a>,” to my attention. The narrative presented ran counter to my understanding of how we arrived at this point in history. After reading it, I felt like I needed to talk it out, and I’m grateful that my friend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@cg3ly">Cliff Gomes</a> offered to be a sounding board. We had a great three-hour discussion yesterday and streamed it tonight. Give it a listen. You might come away with a few tools you can use to navigate your way through these traumatic times.</p>
<p>If you want to revisit the segments I pulled for the discussion, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PPEKNdkefHpPtZfiNL81OZBIi1U0PuC5SJuHD0H7Few/edit?usp=sharing">here’s the slide deck</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Near the end of the session, we began to talk about the map I made linking management consultant Peter Drucker to Bob Buford and the Protestant mega-church movement in the 1980s and ran out of time. I think we’ll go back and revisit it in more detail, but until then you can <a href="https://embed.kumu.io/e04c6299b703d9746c218fe70b747b83#untitled-map?s=bm9kZS0wUFdPb3Q1WA%3D%3D">use this link</a> to explore.</p>

But in general, if the questions about opening up all the other repositories, I think they are a work in progress. It's just that it wasn't part of the advanced staking itself. It might have been overlooked, but they will be progressively opened up.<br></p> What are the potential risks and drawbacks associated with using zkSnarks technology, and how does the project mitigate or address these risks?<br> <p>Oliver Gale - 4:22</p><p>I think one of the well-known risks of zkSnarks is the trusted ceremony setup phase for the Snark itself, and so how that works when it goes right is if one party in this essentially multi party, trusted setup ceremony, is honest, then you have assurances that the zkSnark has no backdoor. However, if all of the parties are dishonest, then the Snark itself has a backdoor: They can recreate the keys and decrypt the information. <br></p><p>So, generally, what you find with snark-based projects is they will seek a relatively large, trusted ceremony and also include actors who have a reputational stake in the privacy space or, in this case, in the blockchain space. <br></p><p>So, I think Saif can share more information on our trusted ceremony setup. Other drawbacks of zkSnarks versus say, Starks are: Starks are more scalable as transaction types, and they don't have a trusted setup. But the Starks themselves have a much higher gas cost for verification of proofs which makes them good for different use cases and bad for other use cases.<br></p><p>One of the interesting things with the zkSnarks space, and both STARKS and SNARKS are progressing rapidly. There's a lot of research and activity around it. But there are things like Halo which may provide the early validation that zkSnarks can also operate using recursive proofs which removes the need to have a trusted setup.<br></p><p>So, there's a lot of promising technology. Obviously, it's been put into production by multiple players in the web three space for different use cases. I think, for what Panther is building. Our team has chosen the right technology, and zkSnarks are more appropriate than a Stark-driven approach, given where Starks are today.<br></p><p>Carlos - 6:57</p><p>Would you would like to add anything to that Saif?<br></p><p>Saif - 7:00</p><p>No, I think that was well said. Just one point. I think the question also says: what are we doing to mitigate? <br></p><p>I mean, we're using Groth16, which is kind of the standard SNARK system used today. It's proof size, and verification time are the best from the perspective of what it does. <br></p><p>Although, Oliver mentioned the pre-processing setup, and the ceremony that is done. In other words, what we have been thinking of is the eventual movement to PLONK, which increases a little bit on the proof size. The verification time also increases a little bit as compared to Groth16.<br></p><p>But the advantage is there’s a universal set up, rather than a setup for each circuit. So that's a big advantage of PLONK. However, I wouldn't say this is the exact next step for us, or that this is in the roadmap. For us, the most important part is to deliver with Groth16. And then look at how things evolve and how new STARKs systems evolve. Then the community decides, from a technical front, how things should move for Panther.<br></p> When it comes to DAO and community proposals, users could use coins and NFTs to vote. How can Panther protect voters’ privacy in governance proposals?<br> <p>Saif - 9:26</p><p>Private voting is a good use case for the ZK technology in general. And proving membership from a set is one of the applications of ZK, where private voting can be, can be utilized. You basically prove that you are one of the DAO members and you're voting, but you don't disclose which member it is exactly, and how much voting power he had. <br></p><p>So, it's a good concept. From a Panther perspective, this is not on the roadmap. Again, I would say these are the adjacent solutions that are good to have. I really want to focus on delivering what is on the roadmap in the next six to nine months. And then we evaluate, and the community evaluates, what adjacent technologies could be built around it.<br></p><p>Oliver - 10:26</p><p>I think -- just to add on the adjacent technology component. You know, our focus is to deliver what we committed to, which is the primary use case that what we think is the primary driver of utility for the protocol. That’s the multi-asset shielded pools and the ecosystem of DeFi integrations and bridges. <br></p><p>That said, yes, the core Panther protocol technology can enable things like private voting. For those who have been in this community From the earlier days, we actually had a sub-protocol called LaunchDAO, which was used to vote on whether or not Panther protocol should be launched with basic staking. We utilized a zero-knowledge private token scheme, which also had implicitly built into that some identity functions as well.<br></p><p>So we do recognize that the building blocks are there. And it's an exciting opportunity to explore in later iterations of the protocol. I think also, just to add a comment – my view on identity standards and trying to tackle the identity space is that you have to create the use cases for the identity first. Identity sort of emerges as a byproduct. It would, in my view, not be an advisable strategy to tackle things like digital identity, and to a lesser extent, voting, head-on when the primary driver should be to create utility, grow the user base of Pather Protocol. From that user base, we can then assess implementing additional products or features.<br></p><p>Carlos - 12:17</p><p>Yeah, great answer. Especially when it comes to private voting, people can, in fact, look at LaunchDAO and the way Panther was launched, as an example of some private voting mechanism. Although I reckon, if we implement private voting, it will be with a different style. <br></p> Will zSwap be available in v1. And when will v1 be launching?<br> <p>Saif Akhtar - 13:01</p><p>Short answer is yes. The work has been started and is in progress. Whether it will be included in v1 is a good question. I think it depends on a lot of other things that are being done from a core v1 perspective and the compliance tech. However, if you ask me, I would love to have it on v1.<br></p><p>Carlos - 13:28</p><p>Yeah, we're also preparing more content related to zSwap. Because, as we have started to show the community, a lot of the UI components of it are ready for production or are in the near-final stage, although they're still pending some minor changes. So we will continue to introduce stuff related to it because it's very important for Panther's mission of private DeFi access. <br></p> Which DeFi protocol will be the first integrated into Panther? Or will it just bridge different blockchains? <p>Carlos -</p><p>I would like to just quickly clear the second part of the question there. Panther's vision is to enable private DeFi access, not just enable a cross-chain ecosystem. So yes, we want to integrate with DeFi protocols. As for which ones will be the first to be integrated, I'll let Saif answer that.<br></p><p>Saif - 14:31</p><p>Yeah, I mean, it will be. Again, these are the parts where the community will come out and make suggestions. However I will say the testing is being done on Polygon as we speak, with three major top three DeFi protocols: Uniswap, Quickswap, and I believe, Curve. And those three integrations’ work is in progress. <br></p><p>However, I expect that there is some discussion going on. And people come up and say, you know, these discussions or these integrations make more sense. And also the pair. I mean, for me, and for testing the product, the obvious choice is, hey, let's look at the top three by TVL. Let's look at the top 10, or top 20 pairs. That makes more sense from Panther’s perspective. And then put it out there, let the community also contribute to those key decision-making process and go from there.<br></p><p>Carlos - 15:39</p><p>Anything that you'd like to add, from your perspective, related to v1 or to zSwap, Oliver?<br></p><p>Oliver Gale - 15:47</p><p>I mean, no, not really. The first principle of target liquidity is target where there is demand and serve that. It’s a fairly logical conclusion to come from, or come to, and that's what we are aiming to do to tap into protocols that have TVL. <br></p><p>And so I'm just commenting on the issue of bridging into different chains. Here's the issue. The issue is, there are many L1 and L2 chains who are competing with one another for developers and for locals to deploy on their L1 or L2. <br></p><p>The bottom line is, what is the organic reason to deploy on anyone else's smart contract protocol? The answer is because there is an active user base there, there's liquidity there, there is value locked on these chains. And it makes sense for us to participate in and add to this ecosystem. <br></p><p>So you can sort of look at the top protocols by these types of metrics. And those are the protocols that Panther is most inclined to build bridges and DeFi adapters and shielded pools on to. <br></p><p>Then on the other side, there's, of course, the token incentive mechanism, which usually comes in the form of grants. So, whenever we see ambitious protocols which are willing to subsidize – and it's usually a subsidy and not a full coverage of development costs – subsidize the cost of deployment and other chains, then we are happy to deploy on those chains and support them in their vision and their growth. <br></p><p>One other metric which we don't see but which is important, is really the Ecosystem Development Partnership. Some protocols and their foundations or teams take a more proactive approach to actually fostering partnerships. So when we see, L1 and L2 chains that propose that they will make introductions and help Panther Protocol partner with other players – CeFi or DeFi players – we find that to be a compelling reason as well. But again, obviously, those additional incentives. It's really just a function of “where is the activity?”. That's where Panther protocol should be.<br></p> How far are we from launching on different additional chains? If Panther is close to v1, what about Avax, Belux, Aurora, NEAR, or even other blockchains?<br> <p>Carlos - 18:40</p><p>I reckon the question should be thought about in terms of not how far we are, but of the overall rollout strategy for different chains. Saif, could you enlighten us on that?<br></p><p>Saif - 19:26</p><p>Yeah, the overall strategy is: work with these partners and align/agree on what is the best time for them and for Panther. <br></p><p>Having said that, the goal is that Panther should be launched on multiple chains at v1 as individual solutions. In the future then, those individual solutions or individual MASPs are integrated through our ZK bridging technology and that's how the interchain starts to work. <br></p><p>So the Flare discussion is ongoing. Again, we have sent a complete, detailed task list to Flare. <br></p><p>Like I said before, I think there's a lot of dependency on other chains. So that's one. The second part about BNB is, I think the BD team just recently submitted a grant application for Binance. If that is approved, then obviously, we will prioritize Binance. <br></p><p>So two things there. In short, one is the prioritization from a grant perspective. And then the second one would be, if there is no grant, then we will prioritize based what makes sense for Panther.<br></p><p>I would like to deploy on one chain, make sure it's battle-tested, make sure everything is where everything works well, and then continue to expand on other chains, rather than dumping everything on multiple chains and having to deal with multiple problems. So there will be technical decisions versus also commercial decisions that come to play in terms of how it will be integrated.<br></p> When will we have more liquidity on Polygon and Ethereum?<br> <p>Carlos - 21:26</p><p>I reckon we may have an interesting perspective now that the DAO has also experimented with centralized exchange listings. <br></p><p>Oliver - 21:50</p><p>Yeah, well, so the answer is, we are right now amid discussion about a proposal coming to the DAO to add liquidity to Uniswap. <br></p><p>There are also some, you know, Uniswap v2, Uniswap v3, potentially on ETH, as opposed to purely just on Polygon. There are questions of, do you want to build utility directly onto the trading pair? Or is there also benefit in providing access to new users to come into the ecosystem liquidity onto Ethereum. These are valid utility drivers in both cases. <br></p><p>There's also some evaluation of v3 active liquidity managers, by way of protocol-to-protocol partnerships that we're exploring. You know, with the recent uptick in the market, this is a good time to be evaluating these. I'm looking forward to seeing how the MEXC listing resolves itself, and then the next priority will be taxability.<br></p> What costs will be on the protocol itself?<br> <p>Carlos - 23:06</p><p>So, for example, how much ZKP it will cost to turn one ETH into one zETH. I know that there has been some progress on the design of fees that is not final, because anything related directly to the protocol will have to go through a DAO proposal, but what can you tell us about the fee mechanism design, Saif? <br></p><p>Saif - 23:45</p><p>For that specific question, I will say there is no fee, or there is no fee in the design structure to convert an asset into a zAsset. Nothing other than the gas costs or the transaction, which again, is something that is being considered on how to handle that.<br></p><p>Carlos - 24:10</p><p>Okay, yeah, we're speeding up the pace a little bit, because we have 15 minutes left, more like 10 right now, at most. So yeah, let's say –<br><br></p><p>Saif - 24:20</p><p>Just to add there, I would refer all the “fees and rewards” questions – I don't know if we have docs already out there – but as we are finalizing the coding and as the testing is coming into play, there should be a good set of docs available to understand how fees impact, you know, what transaction include fees and things like that.<br></p><p>Oliver - 24:51</p><p>Panther’s shielded pools are a DEX type infrastructure. So the idea is you don't really make money on way-in and way-out. That will be the case on v1 because there are no fees inside of the shielded pool. The shielded pool operates like a same-type, same-asset swap mechanism.</p><p>So, Panther protocol will be looking into things which are equivalent to the fees charged on DEXes. That's the core service. Charges and fees will be DAO governed but will be determined on the basis of the comparable costs for bridging assets across chains. And then, because its privacy and computation costs are higher, there will be some premium on that. So that's how you figure out how fees work.<br></p> What makes ZKP distinct from other ZK technology, such as a zkEVM. How is ZKP different and what is the better ZK solution?<br> <p>Saif - 26:16</p><p>Well, if you're talking about Panther in itself, you know Panther is not zkEVM. And the question is, how is $ZKP different? I'm trying to understand where the reference to ZKP is ZKP proofs in general or if $ZKP means Panther in this question.<br></p><p>Oliver - 26:36</p><p>I would say answer it as Panther. I think that's the question.<br></p><p>Saif - 26:42</p><p>Yeah, so zkEVMs are dedicated blockchains, where the zero-knowledge proving happens inside the EVM itself. Panther is chain agnostic. It's a smart contract, utilizing the zero-knowledge libraries to create these circuits that prove the zero-knowledge aspect. Basically, we use zSNARKs and Grant 16, in that respect, to be precise. So this is something that can be deployed on any EVM chains at this moment, hence the difference. What was the other question, Carlos? <br></p><p>Carlos - 27:27</p><p>A follow-up from me, if you don't mind. Am I right to assume that a zkEVM does not necessarily imply privacy, just scalability?<br></p><p>Saif - 27:38</p><p>No, there is privacy there. It's not just scalability. I mean, when you're looking at scalability, those are more the roll-ups, the zk-rollups. Those are more specific to solutions to scale. But the zkEVM itself is more sort of a privacy solution at the EVM level.<br></p><p>Oliver - &nbsp;28:07</p><p>I just want to say something on that. If you're building a zkEVM, you're competing in the L1 and L2 space. So your goal is to beat the other L1s and L2s with a superior proposition. They almost suffer from the same problem at the core, which is that they need developers, they need network effects. They need TVL and they need users. The competition for zkEVM is higher. So there are trade-offs between transaction latency, fees and security – the typical blockchain trilemma problem. That's the space that any smart contract protocol is operating within. <br></p><p>Panther is not operating within that space. We're operating within the dApplication space. Often every fund, every asset manager, every broker, every exchange, every user, and every computation may have some requirements for privacy at some point or the other. And if we deploy this protocol onto these virtual machines, we can enable the other ecosystem applications to function. If we were to bet on a zkEVM, that would be all of our eggs in one basket. By building Panther we've said we’re multi-asset. We're not interested in who wins 10 years from now. We're just interested in Panther being on that protocol. Higher expected outcome.<br></p> What is the go-to market strategy for the project? And how does it plan to gain traction and adoption in the DeFi ecosystem?<br> <p>Oliver Gale - 29:52</p><p>For the community, members have been tracking the conversations happening in Telegram. As many in our community would know, we've been reevaluating the architecture in light of the Tornado Cash sanctions and the likely further restrictions of who've been facilitating things like laundering of North Korean funds, and stuff like that – criminal proceeds. &nbsp; <br></p><p>So we've taken all of that into account and extensively assessed what it looks like and the summary of Panther is: Panther is going to launch a zone that is currently codenamed T1000. &nbsp;<br></p><p>The first thing is, the Panther multi-asset shielded pool is being subdivided into zones, and each zone will be run by a guardian. The Guardian is your Creator of the zone, and they take responsibility for the actions and transactions that happen within their zone. It is a separate environment that shares the anonymity set of the entire multi-asset shielded pool. <br></p><p>And so, in that sense, new entrants don't have to start bootstrapping from zero, as far as privacy is concerned. At the same time, these actors can actually run the institutional dark pools, which is an example of how well-used things like dark pools are. Now, these are compliant, alternative trading systems in the TadFi world. So in the DeFi equivalent, Panther is enabling this type of deployment along with any permutation, for example, payment networks, brokerage services, etc. <br></p><p>So Panther is looking at enabling these bespoke zones to service different niches within multiple markets across multiple chains, and to bridge transactions between zones and between chains. That’s the end game. Stepping back from that, the goal of the market is to deploy a limited retail zone, if you will. This zone–we’re codenaming T1000, which is indicative of the fact that users will do basic sanction screening, identity checks, and so forth and will be able to transact within that zone, under $1,000 per day. They can do that as long as the zone is operating, which we expect will be in perpetuity. <br></p><p>In parallel to that, we're having discussions with some of these regulated FinTech broker crypto players, to get them to run their own zones and to begin offering private or confidential DeFi services to their user bases and their networks. We're seeing a lot of interest in that. So it is this approach where we're not – if the audience is familiar with Aztec, Aztec has implemented some sanction screening. We've taken a more thorough look at what this looks like in terms of data controller relationships, transaction amounts, due diligence, and so forth, and have come to a place where we can launch this zone, and have it be a permission zone, but with some checkpoints built around it. Essentially, it will be the DAO's responsibility to approve that proposal when it's made. So that's the go-to market and in parallel, we're also signing up zones. <br></p><p>Now, there is a day some time at the end of the roadmap when Panther is “sufficiently decentralized”. At that time, we will evaluate the essential handover of the entire protocol to the community and other parties. In that world, it is possible that zones of other designations – they may be DAO-driven zones, as opposed to regulated financial service provider-driven zones, or government-driven zones – those types of things become possible. That's sort of the progression from public beta, to the full main net to the end of the roadmap.<br><br></p> How will Panther make sure to stay compliant for retail users? <p>Oliver - 35:04</p><p>Panther does not need to be compliant. Panther is a protocol, and Panther Ventures is a development team. So the idea of the protocol being compliant is not the correct way to assess it. If we were building with the idea of the protocol being compliant, the likely outcome will be – and this is unfortunate for many DeFi protocols and many builders out there — is that they're going to find their projects come to a swift conclusion as they are attempting to do something and doing it ineffectively. <br></p><p>So if you are compliant, you're compliant, and if you're non-compliant your non-compliant. And then, if you're compliant in Country A, are you compliant in Country B through Z? And if you're not, then you're non-compliant somewhere. So there are a whole set of very difficult, if not impossible, challenges to solve when a protocol tries to take on the job of compliance itself, in any sort of long-term structure. <br></p><p>When Tornado Cash was sanctioned, that was what we expected in 2020. And that was why we built compliance into the vision; because we thought it was a short-term game plan to go for privacy with a dowel-type structure if you're not building your own L1. And extrapolating again from where we are with some more evidence, my expectation is many of the current DeFi privacy players are going to find themselves out of the market, or having to dramatically adjust their infrastructure to figure out how compliance works. The simple answer to it is: compliance is the responsibility of who uses the protocol – and the protocol design should facilitate operators to take that responsibility into their own hands. And at no time should the protocol custody the data, custody the keys, or control what is happening. At the same time, the protocol should enable those operators, if you will – “guardians” in our case – to respond to their own idiosyncratic legal-jurisdictional requirements. The protocol should be resistant to shutdown or blanket sanctioning, which is what happened with Tornado Cash as an early iteration of an on-chain privacy protocol for Ethereum – one that didn't contemplate the “what if?” questions from the perspective of compliance.<br></p><p>There's always this trade off. The question is: can you sufficiently decentralize? <br></p><p>“Sufficient” is not clear in the market. There is no lawyer on Earth who will tell you what “sufficient” actually means. They may tell you what they think it means, and what one thinks it means might not be what it actually means. That is going to be clarified over the coming months to years. Panther's position is that if you want to be the player that services both retail and enterprise – ultimately if you want to serve all vectors in the market – then you have to be around for that conversation. <br></p><p>So the retail MASP is sort of a risk-managed instance of a zone operating within the shielded pool. It can be thought of as a public eta. It's a step past the test-net because it's actually production privacy. But it's not fully untethered and available in “do-whatever-you-like” mode. That will be something that will be determined by, again, the guardians that utilize the protocol. They're free to do what they like with the protocol and deal with the repercussions of that, whatever those may or may not be.<br></p> What happened to the 100k $ZKP Zafari rewards?<br> <p>Saif - 39:25</p><p>Yeah. So it's not about what happened. It's about when the rewards are going to be processed, &nbsp;and how. The fact that this whole Zafari and the testnet process is evolving. At least from my perspective, what we're trying to look at is: how can these rewards be issued in a decentralized fashion, and how can you actually create these external triggered PRPs on Mainnet? <br></p><p>So as you understand, the team itself does not custody the ZKP or the reward pool. If you have looked at the structure of how vesting happens and how rewards are logged in the pool, I did not want it to go forward and create a proposal to extract 1000k and do manual distribution and things of that nature. So, again, there is a bit of a novel mechanism where, when you perform or contribute to the testing in the test net, how can those contributions be validated and turned into a reward on the Mainnet that itself can happen? <br></p><p>So that one idea was created. There's work going on. The design changes have been done on the PRP creation on the Mainnet itself. I'm waiting for the protocol to be launched, and for all these external triggers be applied on v1. I understand that means there's a bit of waiting that has to be done. But again, these will be clubbed with the additional testing or basically the testing for v1 that is shortly coming. So there will be a lot of testing when the v1 code is deployed. And I think we can basically combine all of those efforts and contributions from the community and the rest of the team that test, and start this PRP generation on Mainnet when things launch.<br></p><p>I would love to hear feedback on that, and what the community thinks. But this is, I think, a novel and a good mechanism to reward users for their efforts and contribution on testing the product itself.<br><br></p> Will v1 rollout with all components at once, and which ones? Or will it be a gradual release?<br> <p>Saif Akhtar</p><p>There is this updated, long pending roadmap that should be published this week. As far as “will it contain all of the features?”, I guess the question would be what are the features that you're talking about? <br></p><p>But, I will say high-level that v1 will contain the DeFi integrations, the ZSwap and basically interactions inside the MASP as its core feature. So those three are going to be included in the v1. I think eventually the rest of the features will be added as we move forward. <br></p><p>I think when we are in the test net, and when we all start to test the product, we would know exactly the maturity levels of different features, and this discussion of what feature to include will be more relevant then. But, from a planning perspective, what I said is in the plans.<br></p><p>My goal is to give more use-cases that all of us can use rather than just, you know, get-in and get-out. That's not the end game for the protocol itself. So more use-cases the user can interact with and deploy strategies from within the Panther is what would make Panther unique in terms of what you can do within that ecosystem.<br></p> How is the zSwap feature shaping up? Are there any new developments related to it? <p>Saif - 47:32</p><p>It's not what new development it is, it is the development for zSwap itself. So trades within the shielded pools are the features that are being worked on. Which kind of, in the background, is an atomic swap within the shielded pool.<br></p><p>It's like I said, this is supposed to be part of the v1 release. So there is development going on. The sub-team that is working on the DeFi integration, is at the final stages of the first prototype for the DeFi integration. Once they've done that then they will pick up working on the zSwap features. The same team basically will work on the zSwap as well.<br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=panther-protocol-blog">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=panther-protocol-blog">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=panther-protocol-blog">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=panther-protocol-blog">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=panther-protocol-blog">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=panther-protocol-blog">Discord</a></p>

<p>Electric Coin Co. is excited to announce the launch of our new podcast, PGP* (Pretty Good Policy) for Crypto, hosted by Gary Weinstein (Head of Global Regulatory Relations) and Paul Brigner (Head of U.S. Public Policy and Strategic Advocacy). This podcast is an in-depth exploration of the intersection of blockchain technology, public policy, and global regulatory topics.</p>



<p>Blockchain technology has been rapidly evolving in recent years and has shown the potential to revolutionize multiple industries. At the same time, public policy and regulations play a significant role in the development and adoption of blockchain technology. The PGP for Crypto podcast aims to provide our audience with expert perspectives on the key issues shaping the future of blockchain and cryptocurrency, including the impact of current and proposed regulations and policy approaches on the growth and development of the blockchain ecosystem.</p>



<p>We believe in fostering a respectful and inclusive environment for our discussions. And while we at Electric Coin Co. hold strong opinions about the need for private and confidential financial transactions in crypto to promote economic freedom, our guests may have differing views. Through these thought-provoking and, at times, challenging conversations, we aim to deepen our understanding of complex policy and regulatory issues and work towards a development of pretty good policy for the cryptocurrency world.</p>



<p>This podcast is for educational purposes only and is not legal or financial advice. Our guest remarks may not reflect those of their organization or of Electric Coin Co. We hope you enjoy the podcast.</p>

New Block Rewards! For Stakers, Masternodes and the PIVX Treasury.<p>On January 22 GMT, coinciding with block 3715200, elements of PIVX’s financial structure changed.</p><p>Payments to the treasury, staking rewards, and Masternode rewards increased. This is part of the PIVX version 5.5.0 upgrade, which will improve funding for initiatives, further secure blockchain integrity, and grow the number of Masternodes.</p><p>With this upgrade, maximum treasury payments will surge by an order of magnitude to 10 PIV per block. (PIV is the cryptocurrency unit for PIVX.) PIVX produces a new block roughly every minute, with 43,200 blocks per monthly cycle, and the new rate corresponds to 432,000 PIV per monthly cycle to pay for coding, marketing, and other helpful efforts. This amount is not necessarily all paid out, but represents a cap for projects that are elected by PIVX Masternode voting. The actual payout in any given monthly cycle may be less, but this increase in the cap brings the potential for great technical and marketing advancement.</p><p>Staking payments will double to 4 PIV per block. PIVX is a Proof of Stake (PoS) cryptocurrency, and staking is used to secure it. Staking is done through nodes, which are software units running a PIVX wallet and communicating with other nodes. With each block, one of the staking nodes is chosen at random, with probability proportional with the amount of PIV it has staked, to process the block. With this upgrade, the randomly chosen staking node will be paid 4 PIV when selected. This increase will strengthen the PIVX network by encouraging more PIVX owners to&nbsp;stake.</p><p>Masternode payments will double to 6 PIV per block. Masternodes are created by running specially configured node software and posting 10,000 PIV to enable Masternode status. Masternodes cycle through selection for payment. They will now receive 6 PIV with each cycle. Masternodes vote on treasury expenditures and represent a resource available for future PIVX applications — which could include rapid settlement, mixing, offline processing, interacting with other blockchains, and much more. Some new applications will need more Masternodes, and this payment increase incentivizes more Masternodes to support these advancements.</p><p>Members of the PIVX community, including newcomers, should take action based on these changes. If you have ideas for improving PIVX, propose them — there will be more funding available for good ideas. If you have idle PIV, stake it or use it to make Masternodes. Staking is a quick and essential way to maximize the return on your PIVX investment, and Masternode operation is a way to both make a return and influence the direction of PIVX by voting on proposals. The rewards for both are now much&nbsp;bigger.</p><p>Embrace PIVX’s 5.5.0 upgrade and its many exciting opportunities.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx-coin/on-january-22-gmt-coinciding-with-block-3715200-elements-of-pivxs-financial-structure-changed-46099b583481">On January 22 GMT, coinciding with block 3715200, elements of PIVX’s financial structure changed.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx-coin">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>There was at least one member of Sam Bankman-Fried’s circle who wasn’t sucked into the Effective Altruism vortex.<a href="https://www.boston.com/news/the-boston-globe/2023/01/23/sam-trabucco-crypto-ftx/"> Sam Trabucco</a>, a prodigy from Boston, crossed paths with his future colleagues at math competitions and camps growing up. He went on to attend MIT, applied his skills as a trader at Jeff Yass’s Susquehanna Investment Group outside Philadelphia for a few years, got absorbed with crypto-currency, and then relocated to San Francisco where he reconnected with Bankman-Fried. Trabucco worked as a high-level executive with Alameda Research for a few years before being appointed Co-Chief Executive with Caroline Ellison. She’s been charged with fraud; he has not. Trabucco seems to have remained outside the innermost circle and stepped off the sinking ship a few months before everything unraveled, keeping his multi-million-dollar condo, luxury yacht, and new home for his parents in Maine. Evidently, Trabucco wasn’t one to lose sleep over whether it was more effective to donate his digital lucre to deworming or anti-malarial programs.</p>

<p>Trabucco loops us back to Susquehanna International Group (SIG) located in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania in Bala Cynwyd just across the Philadelphia border. Montgomery is the second wealthiest county in Pennsylvania after Chester. Jeff Yass started the firm with five college friends from SUNY Binghamton, located on the Susquehanna River a half hour northwest of Susquehanna, PA, which happens to be the childhood home of behaviorist B.F. Skinner and the town where Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon.</p>

<p>Yass and his college buddies were gamblers who played lots of poker. They used mathematics and probability to great advantage on horses, dog racing, even jai alai once they gathered sufficient funds to cover all the probable bets. After being excluded from a growing number of establishments and finding it problematic to cart around duffel bags of cash, the men went into options trading during the “greed-is-good” 1980s.<a href="https://www.marketswiki.com/wiki/Susquehanna_International_Group"> Susquehanna Investment Group</a> was launched in 1987, the same year Oliver Stone released “<a href="https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA10561158&amp;sid=googleScholar&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;linkaccess=abs&amp;issn=07457065&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;userGroupName=anon%7Ed63c905">Wall Street</a>.” Millennium hedge fund manager<a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/israel-englander/?sh=40d38ec61462"> Israel Englander</a> sponsored Yass to obtain a seat on the Philadelphia stock exchange.</p>
<p>While many firms lost money in 1987, Susquehanna<a href="https://archive.ph/8udfJ#selection-3363.0-3363.321"> came out ahead on Black Monday</a> having insurance put options in place. In its early years, the firm was trading as much as 5-10% of the volume of the NYSE each day. Some criticized the upstarts and their models, but with the blessing of his libertarian hero, Milton Friedman, Yass continued to move Susquehanna forward. Today it is one of the world’s largest privately held financial services firms and an important provider of market liquidity. Befitting the low-profile nature of the firm, it occupies a nondescript mid-rise office building on City Line Avenue, the former site of Marriott’s 1961 luxury<a href="https://www.theconstitutional.com/blog/2020/09/09/remembering-marriott-motor-inn-city-line-avenue"> Motor Inn</a>, a mid-century modernist landmark. The site’s most distinctive feature is a massive 300+ year old “Penn oak” that commands one corner of the rear parking lot.</p>
<p>A 2018<a href="https://archive.ph/l5G6E"> article</a> from Bloomberg Markets states, “Susquehanna built its empire on poker.” The firm holds “a philosophy that poker provides the best training for the type of probability-based decisions in uncertain circumstances that are needed in markets” where the goal is not to win the most hands, but rather to maximize gains and to do it clinically, without being influenced by<a href="https://www.phillymag.com/news/2009/08/26/beating-the-odds/"> human emotion</a>. In a<a href="https://archive.ph/xOwDe#selection-2213.144-2213.156"> Haaretz feature</a> this is described as a “poker philosophy” where one places bets on a variety of possible winning outcomes with the expectation that at least one will net a big payout.</p>

<p>A<a href="https://archive.ph/8udfJ"> 2021 in-depth Forbes article</a> goes on to say there is a drive at the firm to turn almost anything into a gambling opportunity, to uncover hidden arbitrage. A<a href="https://www.phillymag.com/news/2009/08/26/beating-the-odds/"> Philadelphia Magazine article</a> shared a story of traders in the New York office betting on whether Yass would know the last king in the Plantagenet Dynasty. He did. Yass recently secured approval to trade futures contracts on US tax rates and dreams of a day when markets can be used to determine public policy. The Wall Street Journal reinforces his position in a quote from “<a href="https://archive.ph/gRfPl#selection-491.0-518.0">A Betting Man With A Plan for America</a>” published last fall:</p>
<p>“On climate, the science remains iffy and frequently misrepresented in public debate. This is where betting markets could help. Think about insurers, fund managers, and speculators with real skin in the game. Think about liquid markets where they could match wits and distill a best guess about those future temperature and climate trends. If we were able to get those prices out there, we can stop the nonsense of the world and the climate change hysterical people, and have a rational conversation,” Mr. Yass says.”</p>
<p>“He’s hardly alone in recognizing the power of prediction markets to improve policy. The idea has garnered legions of academic fans. Then politicians would have to explain why their promises are at variance with investor expectations. Journalists would have a powerful new tool against which to test partisan arguments and hold leaders to account.”</p>
<p>“Nobody says they know who will win a football game,” Mr. Yass points out; all understand it’s a matter of probabilities. Bringing the power of prediction markets and disciplined odds-making into the political policy arena – “that, I think, would be the greatest gift to society.”</p>
<p>This program is Futarchy, though neither Forbes nor the Wall Street Journal makes the connection. Instead, the<a href="https://archive.ph/8udfJ#selection-3367.246-3371.54"> article</a> closes with Yass’s contention that the marketplace will be a harbinger of truth, and that realizing this goal is nothing less than “a mission from god.” <a href="https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/events/the-age-of-em-work-love-and-life-when-robots-rule-the-earth-with-prof-robin-hanson/">Robin Hanson</a>, the theorist behind Futarchy and a professor of economics at the Koch-funded George Mason University, just happens to maintain an affiliation with the Future of Humanity Institute that shares office space with the Centre for Effective Altruism. Hanson’s blog is named “Overcoming Bias” and features a banner image of Ulysses tied to the mast of a ship with sirens singing around him.</p>

<p>Yass has shown considerable interest in sports gambling markets in Europe where Betfair’s<a href="https://betting.betfair.com/what-is-in-play-betting.html"> in-game betting</a> infrastructure has enabled the creation of markets not unlike options trading, though the transactions are much smaller. I’m not a gambler, but as I read the<a href="https://betting.betfair.com/how-to-use-betfair-exchange/advanced-guides/market-making-and-liquidity-010819-6.html"> basic FAQ put out by Betfair</a>, it seems like their platform essentially makes anyone a bookie. In 2016 SIG opened a Dublin affiliate,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/nellie-analytics-limited/about/"> Nellie Analytics Limited</a>, to develop business opportunities in sports and geopolitical analytics. </p>
<p>Dublin is home to<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/betfair"> Flutter Entertainment</a>, one of the world’s largest gambling enterprises and parent company to Betfair. Last February Flutter opened a new technology-enabled headquarters complete with Ireland’s first “<a href="https://www.siliconrepublic.com/business/flutter-dublin-headquarters-contactless-store">fully frictionless” shop</a>. In researching Adam Neumann’s post-WeWork venture, Flow, I came across early experiments he had undertaken with <a href="https://newsroom.mastercard.com/press-releases/mastercard-and-wework-jointly-creating-experiences-to-shape-the-future-of-shared-spaces/">Mastercard</a> that used digital identity authentication and automated payment systems synced with sensor networks. This wasn’t about convenience, but rather the generation of data flows for forecasting and bets – predictions on inventory, profitability, consumer preference, and human mobility in built environments. Some are calling this the IoP “Internet of Places.” I don’t think we’ve thought enough about what it would mean to work at your gig job in a building made available via a subscription model, a building equipped with <a href="https://archive.ph/ZCoIr">artificial vision to track you via your phone</a> to make sure you’ve paid for all the amenities you’ve used. This outside-in robot starts to get Black Mirror pretty quickly. These days real estate developers are in the data business, the cybernetic steering business. Jason and I will be hosting a multipart series examining the Flow business model in the next few weeks. I just want to point out the relevance here to global betting, Flutter, and artificial vision trained on human activity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2022, Susquehanna also became a lead investor in<a href="https://www.legalsportsreport.com/72875/susquehanna-pointsbet-sports-betting-qa/"> PointsBet</a>, an Australian operation with a US office in Denver. In addition to SIG’s role as a major investor, its affiliate Nellie Analytics provides consulting services to PointsBet so that they can be in a position to expand future offerings. SIG also directed seed funding to<a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/194496/susquehanna-bets-on-decentralized-sports-prediction-market-frontrunner"> Forerunner</a>, a Web3 prediction market for sports betting that allows people to buy and sell shares of teams or players using cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Susquehanna International Group was early to the Bitcoin party, having been<a href="https://archive.ph/F1i5x"> introduced to the digital currency</a> by the<a href="https://archive.ph/3vVke"> Winklevoss twins</a> in 2014. A digital asset group was formed in 2017 and began to trade futures in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at a time few large firms were interested or had the capacity to safely execute the trades.<a href="https://events.bloomberglive.com/bloomberg-invest-new-york-2022/agenda/speakers/1787538"> Bart Smith</a> leads their cryptocurrency division. Last summer he opened<a href="https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/news/susquehanna-international-group-expands-to-the-bahamas"> Susquehanna’s office in the Bahamas</a>, following on the heels of FTX. Their plan is to expand<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/30/hxro-raises-34m-on-promise-of-derivatives-trading-infrastructure-for-solana/"> DeFi derivatives trading</a> in a location with a<a href="https://thenassauguardian.com/bahamas-tops-list-of-countries-that-have-developed-digital-assets-legislation/"> comprehensive digital asset regulation</a> though the bloom is a bit off the rose for the Bahamas as a crypto outpost since the FTX implosion. SIG also maintains a reinsurance division in Bermuda that underwrites<a href="https://www.artemis.bm/news/arbol-launches-bermuda-mgu-parametric-reinsurance/"> Arbol</a> and its decentralized weather forecasting marketplace,<a href="https://arbolmarket.medium.com/an-introduction-to-dclimate-a-decentralized-network-for-climate-data-46c7d97273ea"> dClimate</a>, in the development of parametric insurance products.</p>

<p>Where Susquehanna is concerned everything is a potential betting opportunity. The arrival of extended reality means there will be options to place wagers on virtual-world activities. In 2008, SIG sponsored an 800-square foot motion capture lab at the University of Pennsylvania, part of the engineering school’s Center for Computer Graphics located next door to the site of the first general purpose computer,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC"> ENIAC</a>. The lab was led by<a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~badler/"> Norman Badler</a>, an expert in human simulation modeling who helped develop “Jack” software for human factors analysis that was later licensed by Siemens. In 1992, Badler and his colleagues in the computer science department wrote “<a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~badler/book/SimulatingHumans.pdf">Simulating Humans: Computer Graphics, Animation, and Control</a>,” published by Oxford University Press. After five decades at UPenn, Badler landed as the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dr-norm-badler-computer-graphics-pioneer-joins-cesium-to-lead-metaverse-research-301381075.html">lead Metaverse researcher at Cesium</a> advising one of his former students, the firm’s CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickcozzi/">Patrick Cozzi</a> (h/t to <a href="https://pieceofmindful.com/author/novicestephers/">Stephers</a> for this tie in).&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPenn’s<a href="http://cg.cis.upenn.edu/history.html"> Center for Human Modeling and Simulation</a> has been operating since the mid-1990s with support provided by the Army, Air Force, Office of Naval Research, NASA, NSF, NIST, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman. In kind support has been provided by Electronic Arts, Gamebryo, Siemens, and Eon Reality. In a<a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/penn-center-computer-graphics-joins-sig-build-regions-largest-motion-capture-studio"> press release</a> from Penn Today, Badler said graduates of the program were in high demand not only in the gaming and entertainment sectors, but also in finance. Pair the engineering school’s human simulation expertise with Wharton’s creative finance schemes and predictive economic models and toss in some compulsive gambling tendencies for good measure and you’ve got a rather toxic brew. </p>
<p>Esports and iGaming are emerging markets where wagers are made not always in cash but also in<a href="https://www.legalsportsreport.com/esports-betting/"> skins</a> (in-game collectible items). I can’t help but wonder where we’re going with emerging-tech educational models that center gamification with behaviorist digital scrip rewards. Is there anything that won’t become a wager as AI assistants step in to train a generation of Metaverse gladiators?</p>

<p>SIG is a financial sponsor of esports outfit Dignitas, a division of New Meta Entertainment based in Newark, NJ. Dignitas is owned by the Philadelphia 76ers. From the company’s webpage:</p>
<p>“Teaming up with Dignitas was a natural fit for SIG. Gaming is at the core of our culture and the strategy used in esports goes hand in hand with our approach to trading. By joining forces with Dignitas, we are bringing together esports and trading to connect the brightest minds in gaming to take on the competition.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Newark, where Dignitas is based, is home to the United Way of Northern New Jersey that hatched the <a href="https://spaa.newark.rutgers.edu/united-way-ALICE">ALICE program</a> (Assets Limited, Income Constrained, Employed). Once brought to scale,&nbsp; (ALICE United is now operating in <a href="https://www.unitedforalice.org/national-reports-mobile">23 states</a>) the working poor can be developed as collective impact commodities (see this <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2019/06/09/what-about-alice-the-united-way-collective-impact-libertarian-charity/">blog post</a>). Jeff Bezos’s ex-wife <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mackenzie+scott+united+way&amp;oq=mackenzie+scott+united+way+&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0i390.4668j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#ip=1">MacKenzie Scott</a> has been seeding United Way offices across the country with multi-million dollar donations in recent years. Newark has also been a test-bed for public-private partnership experiments. Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla led the charge into privatized education, partnering with Cory Booker back in 2010. Chan Zuckerberg poured $100 million into a school choice initiative that publicly flopped, but I believe privately yielded valuable data, data that will be leveraged in policy poker games still to come. Hedge fund billionaires find <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/entertainment/2017/10/26/richest-people-new-jersey-according-forbes/803063001/">northern New Jersey</a> an attractive landing spot, along with Connecticut.</p>
<p>Organizations like the YMCA and even school districts have started to promote esports as a wholesome activity for children in the aftermath of lockdown social distancing protocols. How convenient it will be to have social-impact funded non-profits in a position to run out-of-school time learning programs (after-school, summer enrichment) that maximize digital team data harvest. These robust data flows can be used to score (and bet on) the next generation of human capital. All the while, moms are working their second or third jobs to try and pay astronomical rents. My friend Lynn Davenport wrote an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dallas-esports-bucky-ballers-lynn-davenport/?trackingId=%2B9ikue0gQUaZ7X3AwzsRvA%3D%3D">article</a> about esports and the YMCA in Dallas, which she discussed with Jason and me last month. See video below.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jeff Yass is a smart guy who hires smart people. He’s driven to win; and winning in the financial arena means making and retaining as much money as possible. He’s a lifelong libertarian who believes markets (which are never as “free” as libertarians like to imagine they are) will offer up supreme truths. Yass is currently vice chair of the<a href="https://www.cato.org/news-releases/cato-institute-names-new-chair-vice-chair-welcomes-mackey-board"> Cato Institute</a>, an organization on whose board he’s served since 2002. He’s also a generous supporter of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_for_Growth">Club of Growth</a>, a limited government, limited taxes, entitlement reform, deregulation advocating conservative 501(c)4 that serves as a conduit for a free-market PAC and a Super PAC. Numerous articles have been written in recent years about Yass’s political donations. </p>
<p>In 2022, he was the<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/03/american-billionaires-spent-a-record-880-million-on-the-us-midterm-elections-.html"> fourth largest individual donor</a> to political races nationally after George Soros, Richard Uihlien, and Ken Griffin. School choice and lowering tax rates are the two policy areas that have his attention. Yass was the largest individual donor to <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/opinion/2022/10/31/why-rand-paul-is-billionaire-jeff-yass-favorite-national-politician/69598738007/">Rand Paul</a> and stepped up his backing of Ron DeSantis to $100,000 over the summer following the lead of Blackstone’s <a href="https://archive.ph/XchEF">Stephen Schwarzman</a>, Citadel hedge fund manager <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/06/gop-megadonor-desantis-24-ken-griffin-00065274">Kenneth Griffin</a>, and founder of Uline shipping supplies firm Richard Uihlein whose German-American ancestors made a brewing fortune with Schiltz in Milwaukee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/10/26/billionaire-quant-trader-donates-a-record-19m-of-bitcoin-to-a-super-pac/"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/10/26/billionaire-quant-trader-donates-a-record-19m-of-bitcoin-to-a-super-pac/">https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/10/26/billionaire-quant-trader-donates-a-record-19m-of-bitcoin-to-a-super-pac/</a>
<p>Most recipients of Yass’s largesse are Republicans, but not all. Wading into the critiques of his political donations, the first thing I noticed was the reductive, polarized framing. While I acknowledge and disapprove of the influence that billionaires have over the electoral process, the corruption and ineffectiveness I’ve experienced during my twenty-plus years as a Philadelphia resident must be laid at the feet of the Democratic party. Democrats need to yell at Republicans just as much as Republicans need to yell at Democrats. With all of the yelling, the general public is too distracted to pay attention to the structure that is oppressing them, which is fully bipartisan.</p>
<p>Yass isn’t MAGA or a white nationalist any more than he’s a circus clown, but by characterizing his donations within such a framework, liberals don’t have to explain why we should be wary of high-frequency derivatives traders. Even as they blanket themselves in social justice rhetoric it’s the progressives that are waving in the social entrepreneurs who are quite anxious to bring human capital finance markets to scale in Web3. In a future defined by cyber-physical and socio-technical environments governed under the rules of ESG (Environmental, Social Governance) social-impact finance, both sides need one another. For now, investors still need governments to corral citizens (cough, cough “agents”), tag them, and put them in play. Only then can the wagers commence. Many governments, meanwhile, are all too happy to delegate their responsibilities to public-private partnerships, civil society NGOs, managed through outcomes-based “what works” contracts.</p>

<p>Building a blockchain from the ground-up is a daunting task in itself, one that should not be a concern when designing an end-user application. Moreover, as Web3 aims to move away from centralized vertical scalability towards a multi-chain decentralized environment, horizontal scalability and cross-communication should represent a standard. While Cosmos solves the latter, deploying application-specific blockchains has not been a streamlined process. Saga aims to address this by providing automated means of deploying application-specific blockchains, called chainlets that use the validator set of Saga. This leads to a simplified user (and developer) experience, presently much needed in the Web3 gaming and entertainment industries.</p><p>We were joined by Rebecca Liao, co-founder &amp; CEO of Saga, to discuss bootstrapping app-specific chains in just one click, leveraging the scalability &amp; security of Cosmos, thus allowing developers to focus more on the product and less on the blockchain infrastructure.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Rebecca’s background &amp; building Saga  Leveraging Cosmos SDK, IBC &amp; ICS to bootstrap other chains  Chainlets  Saga validators &amp; tokenomics  IBC &amp; elastic scaling for chainlets  ICS &amp; Saga’s tech stack  Chainlet customization  Partnerships &amp; use cases  Chainlet ‘Musical chairs’ auction  Targeting gaming and entertainment industries  Multi-chain future and inter-chain communication  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/beccaliao">Rebecca Liao on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/Sagaxyz__">Saga on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  Omni: Access all of Web3 in one easy-to-use wallet!

					Why Should We be Excited About EON?		    

			
						
									
							
					
	
    
					EON (Ethereum Open Network) is opening up the Horizen ecosystem to more developers than ever before! 		    
     
 


 
         
    <p>Ethereum has the largest and most diverse public blockchain ecosystem. This makes Ethereum Virtual Machine (<a href="https://www.horizen.io/blockchain-academy/technology/advanced/evm-ethereum-virtual-machine/">EVM</a>) compatibility one of the key ingredients for other blockchains to build a successful ecosystem. This includes Horizen.</p><p>By harnessing the power of the Ethereum ecosystem, we will be able to:</p>  Welcome the Ethereum developer community into the Horizen ecosystem to build products&nbsp;&nbsp;  Leverage the existing Ethereum DeFi infrastructure to fast grow the Horizen ecosystem  Build a more interconnected ecosystem&nbsp;       
 

 
         
    
					About Yuma Testnet		    

			
						
									
							
					
	
    
					Yuma Testnet is a temporary public testing environment for EON. 		    
     
 


 
         
    <p>This is a big milestone before launching EON to the permanent public testnet, Gobi.</p>     
 

 
         
		    	
		 
	
    
    	 

 
         
    <p>Yuma Testnet is public and accessible for anyone to test and try out. It comes with a set of easy-to-use developer and end-user tools:</p>

					Yuma vs Dune - What's New?		    

			
						
									
							
					
	
    
							    
     
 


 
         
    <p>&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/dune-recap.jpg"></a>EON has been running on our pre-alpha and invite-only Dune Testnet for the past month and welcomed a small group of 90+ community developers to test the platform. We are thrilled to see the amount of activity that has happened on Dune testnet since the January launch: 302 smart contracts were deployed, 88 tokens and 3,751 wallet addresses were created, and over 30k transactions were made.&nbsp;</p>     
 

 
         
    <p>We want to thank the Dune testers for all the valuable feedback! Our product team was able to implement a lot of the feedback in the Yuma release.&nbsp;</p>
 The Yuma version has some major capabilities and improvements added to the platform! 
<p></p>
 
 Non-ceasing sidechains 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Horizen mainchain verifies each sidechain and ensures its integrity. &nbsp;Traditional sidechains have a limited time to communicate with the mainchain in order to be verified. When a traditional sidechain has failed the verification, it will be registered as “ceased” and no longer able to communicate with the mainchain. Non-ceasing sidechains don’t have this constraint. They don’t have a fixed epoch size and can always communicate with the mainchain.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Key rotation circuit 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A security feature to give to validators (guardians of the EON sidechain) the possibility to change their signing key, or pass their status of validator to someone else. This gives a higher level of security and improved decentralization over time. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Secure key management 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Also known as secure enclave which is the ability to sign transactions and certificates using keys that are not stored locally, that are instead in a separate trusted execution environment (TEE). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Fixes from audit 
 
 
 Local EON client for building dapps locally&nbsp;
 
 Developers are now able to develop, test and run their dapps locally before deploying on chain. This can improve the dapp development process by allowing developers to test and iterate more quickly. <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/docs/build/#build-a-dapp-locally">Instructions can be found on the EON documentation</a>.

<p>Despite invoice financing becoming increasingly popular, it is no new financial phenomenon. In essence, invoice financing refers to the process of selling unpaid invoices to third parties in order to get access to a percentage of the value of that invoice quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Depending on the type of invoice financing, the invoice is either sold to a third party for a certain percentage of the full invoice value, after which this third party is also responsible for the collection of the invoice (factoring). Or a certain percentage of the value of the invoice is lent out to the company. That is then repaid once the invoice has been paid, along with a fee and discount charge (invoice discounting).</p>



<p>Tokenisation on the other hand refers to a new way of handling digital assets. Specifically, by turning them into a ‘<a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/tokenisation/">token</a>’ which lives on a blockchain. This allows the tokenised asset to be easily tracked, transferred, and more. But how do these two work together?</p>







<p>Let’s first take a look at the issues with the current method of invoice financing and why there is a need for improvements.</p>



 Issues with modern invoice financing 



<p>Invoice financing sounds like a relatively simple process that offers clear benefits to both parties. But the current process of invoice financing also has its issues, such as:</p>



 
 No standard invoice format 



 Invoice verification is difficult 



 Double spending 
 



 No standard invoice format 



<p>An invoice can be defined as a document that specifies when, who, and how much payment is due. However, there is no universal agreement on what information should be included in an invoice. E-invoicing presents a potential for standardisation, but even within this system, there is no set standard. This makes it difficult to securitise an invoice due to the potential for issues with the data and the operational processes surrounding the invoices.</p>



 Invoice verification is difficult 



<p>The second issue with current invoice financing is that verifying the validity of an invoice is very difficult. Before an invoice can be considered a secure title the financier will have to ensure that the debtor is able to fulfil their obligations as well as verify the correctness of all details in the invoice.</p>



<p>This also makes the financing of invoices inaccessible to regular investors. They do not possess the necessary means to conduct these thorough invoice verifications.</p>



 Double spending 



<p>Another issue with invoices is that they tend to be unregistered in most areas. If somebody has malicious intentions they could sell the same invoice to multiple financiers. This is also difficult to detect for possible financiers.</p>



 How the tokenisation of invoices works 



<p>Let’s now take a look at how <a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/tokenisation/">tokenisation</a> and invoice financing work together is best explained using an example. Let’s take a look at the example below:</p>



<p>Company A sells a product to Company B and sends them an invoice to be paid within 90 days. They need the money from the invoice now and sell the invoice to a third party (financier) after the financier has done their due diligence in verifying the validity of the invoice. Company B then pays the invoice to the financier.</p>



<p>This is a simplified version of the current process of invoice financing. But let’s now take a more in-depth look at all the steps in this process and where the tokenisation comes in:</p>



 
 Company A sells a product to Company B and sends an invoice to Company B to be paid within 90 days. 



 Company A wants to use the money from the invoice now. It sells the invoice to a third party (financier) in order to get a percentage of the invoice value after the financier has performed their due diligence in assessing the invoice. The invoice is usually sold for 80-95% of the value of the invoice. 



 The financier now holds the risk of that invoice on their balance sheet and they are required to hold capital for that risk. As these risks are high, the financier wants to distribute that risk. 



 The financier tokenises the invoice and sells it to investors through an invoice market platform. 



 When the payment term is due and the invoice is paid by Company B, the platform distributes the remainder of the invoice to the investors. 
 



 Benefits of invoice tokenisation and invoice markets 



<p>While the process with tokenised invoices and an invoice market is more complex than the current process, it can also address the various issues with the current process of invoice financing, in addition to offering various other benefits. The benefits of using tokenisation in invoice financing can be summarised as follows:</p>



 
 Invoices as an asset class 



 Standardisation of invoices 



 More transparent ownership of invoices 



 Increased efficiency and automation 
 



 Invoices as an asset class 



<p>As discussed, invoice financing is not accessible to general investors. The indicated is due to the amount of due diligence required when financing an invoice. By having a standard approach along with quality checks of the financiers, invoices can become an asset class that is highly accessible to regular investors.</p>



<p>This is a win-win situation for everyone involved. There is a bigger incentive for financiers to finance invoices as they have better and more efficient ways of managing their risk. It helps companies that want to sell their invoices as there will be a wider range of financiers. And lastly, it helps investors by giving them access to a new asset class.</p>



 Standardisation of invoices 



<p>In order to be able to become securities invoices will have to adhere to certain standards and quality checks. More comprehensive and complete invoices decrease risks and grey areas. Therefore the demand for higher prices, incentivising financiers to request a high standard of invoices.</p>



<p>Additionally, it might lead to better regulations surrounding invoice financing. It can help create a safer environment for financiers and investors alike as tokenised invoice financing becomes the norm.</p>



 More transparent ownership of invoices 



<p>Tokenised invoices are kept and tracked on a blockchain-based platform. This massively increases the transparency of ownership and ensures all parties have access to the same information. This increased transparency tackles the issue of double spending as ownership of invoices can be tracked more easily.</p>



<p>Increased transparency in the ownership of invoices can also help reduce the risk of errors with manual payments. This is done by providing clear and accurate information about who is responsible for the invoice and who is authorised to receive payment. With more visibility into the ownership of invoices, manual payment processes can be streamlined. Consequently, reducing the chance of miscommunication and mistakes.</p>



 Increased efficiency and automation 



<p>The last, but definitely not least important benefit of using tokenisation in invoice financing is increased efficiency and automation. With better invoice standards and an invoice market which increases transparency of invoice ownership and automates payouts to investors, the whole invoice financing process goes from a rather cumbersome manual process to a much more streamlined and automated process which benefits all parties involved.</p>



<p>Invoice financiers have an increased market to offset the risk of financed invoices, and in addition to that they no longer have to manage the tedious task of investor payouts when invoices are paid. For investors the process of investing in invoices also becomes much easier by having a transparent invoice market with a broad offering of invoices.</p>







 Conclusion 



<p>In conclusion, invoice financing and tokenisation of invoices provide a solution to various issues faced by companies and investors in accessing financing, managing risk, and ensuring the validity of invoices. Tokenisation offers greater transparency, standardisation, and automation in the financing process. This makes invoices a new and accessible asset class for regular investors. All, whilst providing efficient ways of managing risk for financiers. The use of tokenised invoices may also lead to better regulations surrounding invoice financing. Hence, this creates a safer environment for investors and financiers alike.</p>

Verida Explainer: Introducing the Verida DID&nbsp;Method<p>The concept of a “Decentralized Identifier” (DID) is at the heart of the web3 movement of self-sovereign identity and&nbsp;data.</p> Watch the explainer video  A quick recap on&nbsp;DIDs <p>Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are similar to usernames in Web3, but with extra features. They are the basis for sharing public keys controlled by the DID holder, creating trusted connections, storing data and many other capabilities.</p><p>Here is an example DID using the “Ethereum” DID Method: did:ethr:0x690b9a9e9aa1c9db991c7721a92d351db4fac990</p><p>Given a DID, it’s possible to use a software library to lookup an associated DID Document (JSON) that provides lots of extra metadata. This document can define an unlimited number of public keys for different use cases, it supports key rotation and supports listing API’s or service endpoints where you can interact with the identity.</p> The problem with current DID&nbsp;methods <p>There are lots of DID Methods (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#did-methods">see the full list here</a>). Unfortunately they all suffer from a variety of different problems that make none of them a suitable base for the next generation of web3 applications.</p><p>Verida CEO, Chris Were, <a href="https://www.chriswere.com/i/99200769/however-did-core-implementations-also-have-problems">recently wrote about these issues holding back DID adoption</a>.</p><p>These key problems typically relate&nbsp;to:</p>  Access: DID Documents must be public to discover and read. The protocol must be enforce that only the DID controller (user with the secret) can change the document (ie: rotate their&nbsp;keys)  Performance: It must be fast to read and write (seconds), otherwise there will be unacceptable delays when creating a new account or signing into Web3 applications.  Cost: Web3 is competing with Web2. The cost must be very low (ideally free), without the user becoming beholden to a centralized entity paying on their behalf. If the user has to pay, that introduces a huge barrier to entry that makes it infeasible.  Revocable: A user must be able to delete their DID document in accordance with the “right to be deleted”. This is a critical requirement that is missed by the vast majority of DID method implementations.  Full support: The implementation must support the full suite of DID-Core specifications for maximum flexibility and security.  Full history: The implementation must support retrieving any historical version of the DID document. This is essential to support signature verification where the signing keys&nbsp;change.   Introducing the Verida DID&nbsp;method <p>The Verida DID method is designed to have a similar architecture to the Domain Name System which has worked incredibly well for an extended period of time for the&nbsp;web.</p><p>The concept of DID “discovery” and Document “storage” are separated.</p><p>When a DID is created, a pointer is created on the blockchain to where the actual DID document is stored. The actual DID Documents (and all their historical versions) are stored on low cost, commodity HTTP&nbsp;servers.</p>DID documents are stored on off-chain servers<p>We have deployed our “<a href="https://github.com/verida/blockchain-contracts/tree/develop/VDA-DID-Registry">DID-Registry</a>” smart contract to Polygon’s Mumbai testnet in preparation for deploying to Polygon’s PoS network in the coming&nbsp;weeks.</p> Verida DID Method capabilities   Access to the DID is guaranteed as the blockchain enforces only the DID controller (owner) can set the endpoints where the DID Document is stored. The DID controller can determine how many replica’s there are. In the event there is a malicious server, that can be instantly identified by the protocol and ignored (or penalized) or the DID controller can remove that server from the list of DID Document storage&nbsp;nodes.  Performance is fast. There is a delay writing the DID pointer to the blockchain, however every DID document update after then is lightning fast, at HTTP speeds. On MATIC the blockchain write with confirmation time in the real world is approximately 5&nbsp;seconds.  Cost is low. There is a single write to the blockchain when a DID is created, but all DID Document updates are then off-chain and effectively free. On MATIC the one-time cost to create a DID is ~0.003. A DID controller can change the pointer to update the list of servers. That does require another blockchain update at the same&nbsp;cost.  Revocation of the DID is possible. The DID controller can update the blockchain to revoke a DID so it’s no longer available. The DID controller can also “ping” the servers hosting their DID Document to revoke the document and it will be permanently deleted.  Full DID Document support is included. Since the DID Document is stored off-chainoffline, there are no challenges trying to store that data on the blockchain. It’s a simple JSON object that can be stored on disk and easily retrieved. It’s also future proof to easily support upgrades to the DID Core specification.  Full DID Document history is included and can be retrieved via different query parameters to the HTTP endpoints (amongst other query&nbsp;types)  <p>As a result, web3 now has a fast, decentralized, low cost, fully featured DID method that supports true revocation of identities.</p> How to use the Verida DID&nbsp;method <p>There are two typescript libraries available for developers:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/verida/verida-js/tree/main/packages/vda-did">@verida/vda-did</a> — A full implementation that supports creating, retrieving, updating and deleting DID Documents. It requires a private key that has Polygon MATIC tokens for writing DID pointers to the blockchain.  <a href="https://github.com/verida/verida-js/tree/main/packages/vda-did-resolver">@verida/vda-did-resolver</a> — A slim resolver implementation (compatible with the getResolver() standard) that supports retrieving the latest DID Document for a given DID&nbsp;string.  <p>See the documentation in each of those packages on how to use the libraries.</p> HTTP Storage&nbsp;Nodes <p>The specification does require a network of HTTP servers that support the Verida DID method API endpoints for creating, storing and retrieving DID Documents.</p><p>We have created an <a href="https://github.com/verida/storage-node/tree/develop/src/services/didStorage">initial implementation of this HTTP API and integrated it into the Verida network storage node API</a>. This means that as the Verida network scales its web3 database infrastructure, it will also be scaling the available nodes for storing DID documents.</p><p>However, anyone is free to run their own API or embed our API specification into their existing network. The code is open source and available to&nbsp;anyone.</p> Read the specification <p>You can dive deeper into the underlying motivation and design decisions by reading the Verida DID method specification documents:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/verida/VIPs/blob/develop/VIPs/vip-2.md">Verida DID Method Specification</a> — The core specification  <a href="https://github.com/verida/VIPs/blob/develop/VIPs/vip-3.md">DID Document Storage on the Verida Network</a> — The HTTP API specification that is implemented in the <a href="https://github.com/verida/storage-node">Verida Storage Node&nbsp;API</a>.  <a href="https://github.com/verida/VIPs/blob/develop/VIPs/vip-4.md">Verida DID Resolver Specification</a> — Compatible with the DID getResolver() standard  <a href="https://github.com/verida/blockchain-contracts/tree/develop/VDA-DID-Registry">DID Registry</a> — The EVM compatible smart contract deployed on Polygon Mumbai&nbsp;testnet   Want to learn&nbsp;more?

<p>This is the 23rd post in an <a>ongoing, regular series</a> describing privacy features in Brave browsers. This post describes work done by (in alphabetical order): Filter List Enginer Ryan Brown, Research and Privacy Engineer Arthur Edelstein, and Senior Research Engineer Anton ​​Lazarev. This post was written by VP of Privacy Engineering Peter Snyder.</p>




    




 1. Hiding “open in app” annoyances 
<p>Starting in upcoming&nbsp;version 1.49 (Android and desktop) and already available since version 1.44 for iOS, Brave will hide “open in app” annoyances that appear on many websites. The links are annoying; they prompt you with unrelated questions when you’re trying to browse the Web. Worse, these notices are often privacy harming. Sites know that the “native” versions of their apps aren’t subject to the kinds of privacy-protections that Brave applies to websites, and they’re thus eager to nudge users into the (often) data-gobbling native apps.</p>
<p>Brave will hide “open in app” annoyances by enabling the terrific “Fanboy’s Mobile Notifications List,” maintained in part by <a>folks working at Brave</a>. Users who want to disable this feature can do so by going into settings and disabling “Fanboy’s Mobile Notifications List” list from the list of custom and regional filter lists.</p>

 2. Additional protections against “pool-party” attacks 
<p>Starting in version 1.49, the desktop and Android versions of Brave will include additional protections against “pool-party” attacks. Pool-party attacks are a category of attack that advanced and motivated trackers can use to link your browsing behaviors across sites (and, in some browsers, across profiles), by leveraging the unintended consequences of how some browser features are implemented. As mentioned in a <a>previous post</a>, most browsers are vulnerable to some form of the attack, though some browsers are more vulnerable than others.</p>
<p>Brave has defended against what was thought at the time to be the most serious form of the attack since version 1.35. However, researchers at Brave have recently identified more ways pool-party attacks can be conducted, and ways they can be carried out faster (i.e. how they can be optimized to communicate across site boundaries faster). As a result, Brave has released fixes to protect against additional forms of the attack <a>1</a>. We are continuing to discuss possible solutions to pool-party attacks with other browser vendors as well.</p>
<p>For more detail on pool-party attacks, please see <a>our research paper</a> that will be presented at <a href="http://usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/">USENIX Security 2023</a>.</p>

 3. Improved ad blocking with procedural cosmetic filters 
<p>Starting in versions 1.49 (Android and desktop) and already available since 1.45 for iOS, Brave includes partial support for <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Procedural-cosmetic-filters">procedural cosmetic filters</a>, an advanced way of specifying which page elements should be hidden when blocking ads and other page annoyances. Most cosmetic filters are defined through <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors">CSS selectors</a>; filter list maintainers can specify unwanted page elements to hide using the same system that website designers use to style elements on a page. In the vast majority of cases, this simple capability is all that’s needed.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-will-force-advertising-on-ad-blocking-users-1470751204">sometimes websites try to evade content blocking tools</a>; in these cases content filtering tools need more sophisticated ways of specifying which page elements should be hidden. Procedural cosmetic filters are a solution to this problem, and are an important tool that browsers and Web tools can apply to keep users in control.</p>
<p>There are many different procedural filters, and Brave supports the two most popular ones <a>2</a>. We plan to support more procedural filter rules soon.</p>

 4. Protecting against screen attribute-based browser fingerprinting 
<p>Starting in versions 1.48 (Desktop) and 1.50 (Android), Brave is expanding our <a>browser fingerprinting protections</a> by preventing sites from identifying you based on the size of your screen and position of your browser window. Trackers try to identify you through browser fingerprinting by combining enough semi-identifiers (things that distinguish you from some other users) to build a unique identifier. No browser user is likely to be the only browser user in their country, but they might be the only browser user in their country, using a specific version of the browser, speaking a specific language, with particular graphics hardware, etc.</p>
<p>The size of your screen is another such semi-identifier that trackers use. On their own, your screen’s width and height aren’t enough to uniquely identify you. But if they’re different enough from those of many other browser users, they can help trackers narrow down who you are as you browse the Web. In addition, the position of your browser window on the screen may be fairly unique and another way your browser can stand out.</p>
<p>To combat this, Brave now prevents trackers from learning the size of your device’s screen and the position of your browser window on the screen. First, Brave reports to Web scripts that your screen has approximately the same width and height as your browser window. This prevents trackers from learning about your true screen size. Second, as with Brave’s other unique randomization-based protections, Brave reports slightly different values to each site, for each browser session. This prevents trackers from re-identifying you across different sites, or across different visits to the same site.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Specifically, by partitioning the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html">Server Sent Events</a> resource pool in Chromium.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>
 
 
<p>Specifically, <a href="https://github.com/brave/adblock-rust">adblock-rust</a>, Brave’s library for applying network level blocking and cosmetic filtering, supports the :has and :-abp-has procedural cosmetic filter rules.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

    <p>ZenIP 42204 proposes the removal of shielded transactions with transparent inputs from the Horizen mainchain, which will prevent shielded transaction (T addresses to Z addresses) support at the consensus level.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/commit/4b34d67914d3cf76eb773a9d43949fae23f32f60">ZenIP 42204’s</a> purpose is to ensure Horizen does privacy technology the right and sustainable way to drive ecosystem growth and minimize risks. It proposes a solution to eliminate technical debt and avoid regulatory threats that can prevent the greater Horizen community from fully and freely participating in our ecosystem.</p>
<p>ZenIPs are for the community to approve or decline. We asked the Horizen community what they think of ZenIP 42204 via a public survey, 426 community members participated in the survey. Here are the results:</p>
<p>When asked if they are in agreement with ZenIP 42204, 75.3% of survey takers are favorable, 12.7% are neutral, and 11.9% are not favorable.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When asked if they think whether or not ZenIP 42204 is positive for the future of Horizen, 77.4% of survey takers rated positive, 13.8% rated neutral, and 8.9% rated negative.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Both Chinese and Korean communities also conducted a vote on ZenIP 42204.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese community – 66 people participated in the voting: 92% Yes, 7% No</p>
<p></p>
<p>Korean community – 288 people participated in the voting: 87.8% Yes, 11.1% No, 0.01% Withdrew</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here are some of the comments we received from the survey:</p>
<p>“In such a brittle environment as we find ourselves in, I believe this is the correct decision and course of action to avoid unnecessary oversight or worse in terms of regulation which is clearly needed, even welcomed to ensure the is no impropriety in the crypto markets, especially given the feature seldomly used.”</p>
<p>“Although ZenIP’s need for transparency is crucial in attracting and ensuring confidence in some investors, I think it should be taken with caution. This is due to the fact that transactional confidentiality will be favourable in the near future, as other crypto projects may not offer it. Leaving those that do with high market competitive advantage.”</p>
<p>“It’s the right thing to do even though privacy is one of the main features I like about Horizen. I will most likely make some investments in other privacy centric projects such as zcash and ironfish. Part of me thinks that Horizen should keep its privacy features in the face of regulators and possible actions but I know that will suffocate growth. It’s too bad a shielded sidechain cannot be developed prior to the switch but I know resources are focused on the EVM. There will be enough demand for sidechains and all the products that EVM brings to make this project flourish in the future even with the proliferation of other platforms doing the same thing. This change will set up Horizen to become accessible to more users and potential users going forward, as well as many more competitors, I’d like to see how you differentiate. You have a fantastic team and more integrity than almost any other project I can think of.”</p>
<p>“We need to limit the risk of being completely blacklisted by government regulators.”</p>
<p>“Get rid of the anonymity on the mainnet and move as fast as you can to the side chain to focus on expanding your ecosystem.”</p>
<p>“Too late to throw up the privacy position, ‘cause Layer1 market is already possessed by competitors. Keep privacy position is best at the moment”</p>
<p>“Good direction! This will make the project more resilient, scalable and flexible. Future proof is the key!!!”</p>
<p>“Tough call, but agree scrutiny is trending up, not down. Shielded/privacy functionality is key for side chains, but I don’t see any reason why mainchain needs to be anything other than a basic settlement layer acting as the source of truth.”</p>
 What’s Next? 
<p>Thank you everyone who joined the discussion and voiced your opinions on this important matter. As the majority of votes and feedback we have received are in agreement with ZenIP 42204, we will be moving forward with this proposal and plan the changes into a future ZEND software release. We will continue to keep the community informed when the new software release containing the ZenIP 42204 changes are coming.</p>
<p>Our next episode of the Horizen podcast <a href="https://podcast.horizen.io/">“Beyond the Horizen”</a> will discuss ZenIP 42204 with our co-founder Rob Viglione and Jordan Calinoff, Horizen Lab’s VP of Strategy. Please stay tuned.</p>

<p>Introducing embedded&nbsp;wallets</p><p>Privy is the easiest way for developers to onboard all users to web3, regardless of whether they already have a wallet, across mobile and&nbsp;desktop.</p><p>Today, we are excited to announce the next step in our product journey: embedded wallets. Embedded wallets make it easy for developers to provision self-custodial wallets for users no matter how they log in, via email, phone or&nbsp;social.</p><p>At Privy, we spend a lot of time obsessing over how to help developers unlock better UX in web3 without sacrificing the ownership primitives that make the space special. Ownership is at the root of web3 but to this day, it has been reserved for only the most technical users.</p><p>For web3 to go mainstream, we must make it easy to bake self-custody into products: web2-caliber UX with web3 ownership and consent. With embedded wallets, you can build simple self-custodial experiences into your app without requiring a seed phrase, third-party extension or any UX interrupt.</p><p><a href="https://gaby.mirror.xyz/0Wq9zk0pZu_s3W1S4BiNcYXw9uSfSVbyGjNPgLHcs18">Why “embedded” wallets?</a> It reflects our conviction that key self-custody should be tightly integrated — embedded — into your product. Our work here is centered around a few core principles:</p>  Self Custody — Privy’s embedded wallets are fully self-custodial. Privy can never sign a message on behalf of a user. Key splitting ensures Privy never holds private keys but your user has simple recovery&nbsp;options.  Native to your app — Key infrastructure should feel native to your app. Let your users come as they are, and keep your UX on-brand with design customization and flexibility around signature prompts for&nbsp;users.  Interoperable from day 1 — Embedded wallets are a springboard into web3. You take care of your in-app experience, we’ll ensure your users have access to a wider ecosystem.  <p>We are not becoming a standalone wallet company. Embedded wallets are tightly integrated within <a href="https://blog.privy.io/announcing-privy-auth-4754be04c515">the existing Privy SDK</a> and its existing wallet connectors. Expert or newcomer, a user is a user: no need to treat them differently in your codebase. For many, Privy will serve as their starter wallet. For others, it will be a UX revolution they can choose to use alongside their existing&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>This is just the beginning. We’ll be sharing more details about each of these over the coming weeks as we roll out embedded wallets to customers. If you’re thinking about how to power native experiences for wider audiences–mainstream products on crypto rails, <a href="https://50fzxaracbi.typeform.com/to/v5gtHb74">we’d love to&nbsp;talk</a>.</p><p>Web3 must disappear into the products it spawns. We believe great products will increasingly be hybrid, incorporating on and off-chain elements to power new experiences with better onboarding and simpler permissions delegation. The web3 stack is changing. Our tooling makes it easy for developers to build for this new paradigm. We are so excited for this next step in our journey. More soon&nbsp;(™).</p><p>Web3 is dead. Long live&nbsp;web3.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.privy.io/web3-for-users-not-experts-52c692c25bb1">Web3 for users, not experts.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.privy.io">Privy Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

							<p>Today, we are announcing a new, experimental Zcash Foundation (ZF) grants program, which we have nicknamed “Minor Grants”. This is intended to complement the Major Grants program (aka Zcash Community Grants) by providing a source of funding for smaller grants. We hope that this will reduce the number of smaller grant applications that are submitted to ZCG, thus enabling them to focus their attention on larger, more significant grants that are more in line with what the Major Grants program is intended to fund. Additionally, we would like to create a channel for grant applications that are not directly Zcash-related but explore broader applications of zero knowledge proofs or other approaches to financial privacy, in line with our charitable purpose.&nbsp;</p><p>The maximum grant size for this Minor Grants program will be $25,000, and the budget is $75,000.&nbsp;</p><p>We also want to engage the Zcash community, and take advantage of the “wisdom of the crowd” by polling the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP) regarding which grants should be funded.</p><p>We plan to see how this first iteration of the program goes, how many and what sort of grant applications are submitted, how the community responds and the feedback we receive, before deciding whether to repeat or extend the program in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 The Application Process
 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>Applications must be submitted via the <a href="https://zcashgrants.org/submit">ZF grants platform</a>, and applicants must agree to sign ZF’s <a href="https://zfnd.org/terms-and-conditions/">grant agreement</a>, and undergo <a href="https://zfnd.org/aml-kyc-requirements/">the ZF KYC process</a> if their application is successful.&nbsp;</p><p>The deadline to submit a grant application is 09:00 UTC on Monday 20th March.&nbsp;</p><p>ZF will review all applications, and will reject any grant applications that are deemed unsuitable (see the FAQs section below for examples of why ZF may judge a grant application to be unsuitable under this program). Suitable applications will then be submitted to a poll of ZCAP to determine which should be funded. Applicants who are members of ZCAP will not be eligible to participate in this poll.&nbsp;</p><p>We aim to publish the list of suitable grant applications, and open the ZCAP poll by 3rd April. The ZCAP poll will remain open for approximately two weeks, and we hope to announce the results on 17th April.&nbsp;</p><p>As this is the first time we are running this program, we don’t really know what to expect, so&nbsp; this timeline may be subject to change. We will try to keep applicants and the community apprised of any changes or delays.&nbsp;</p><p>To be eligible for funding, a grant application must receive greater than 50% approval from the participants in the ZCAP poll. Eligible grants will then be funded in order of priority determined by the level of ZCAP’s approval, and as the total budget permits. There will be no partial funding of grants.&nbsp;</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Example of how the Zcash poll will work 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>In the example below, ten suitable grant applications for varying amounts were voted on in a ZCAP poll that had a turnout of 134 with a $75,000 USD total budget.</p>

							<p>What is the Zcash Foundation’s mission?<br>Our mission at the Zcash Foundation is to build financial privacy infrastructure for the public good, by helping sustain and improve open financial networks that allow anyone and everyone to protect their own privacy, on their own terms. While our primary focus is the Zcash protocol and blockchain, we also support broader applications of zero knowledge proofs, as well as other approaches to financial privacy.</p>
<p>Do grant applications have to be Zcash-related? <br>No. Any grant that aligns with the Zcash Foundation’s mission is suitable for the Minor Grants program.</p>
<p>Under what circumstances would ZF reject a grant application as unsuitable?<br>Here are some examples of why ZF may reject a grant application:</p>
 
 The grant’s purpose is not congruent with the Foundation’s mission. 
 The grant does not, in our estimation, represent value for money. 
 We have reason to believe that the applicant is not capable of delivering on the grant. 
 The purpose of the grant would violate U.S. law or contravene the Zcash Foundation’s obligations under <a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations">U.S. IRS 501(c)(3)</a>. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can applicants remain pseudonymous?<br>Applicants can keep their identity private but they must undergo the ZF KYC process if their application is successful, which includes disclosing and verifying their identity to ZF.</p>

<p>This is the first in what I hope will be a series of conversations where Jason Bosch, Leo Saraceno, and I share some of our research around Web3, the environment, complex systems, community governance, and ritualized behaviors. In this two-hour chat Leo talks about his new article, “<a href="https://siliconicarus.org/2023/02/11/natural-asset-managers-how-decentralized-ledger-technology-will-drive-the-ecosystem-services-sector/">Natural Asset Managers – How Decentralized Technology Will Drive the Ecosystem Services Sector</a>,” I discuss my new series “God’s Eye View,” and the three of us dissect an 8-minute clip about a cooperative extended reality “game” where players upload ecological data to a “Tree of Life” DAO in order to help it gain sentience. Embedded within the game is a governance structure for managing “the commons,” of the digital “park” in which the “tree” is located through proposals and voting tokens weighted to reflect individual contributions to the project. The game was pitched by Curve Labs and Weeve, based in Berlin, and leaders in framing out Web3 “regenerative finance” infrastructure. You can read more about the game in this 2021 medium post, “<a href="https://medium.com/@sovnature/introducing-interspecies-games-bfdf667009e1">Introducing: Interspecies Game</a>.” Jason and I did a live Q&amp;A for about a half hour at the conclusion of the streamed pre-recorded discussion.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The clip is below if you’d like to rewatch it. I’ve transcribed the wording from the introduction, because it’s packed with evocative language and concepts.</p>
<p>“Thanks for having us. A little disclaimer on my side. Interspecies Game is a fuse between Curve Labs (<a href="https://www.curvelabs.eu/">We Make Digital Souls</a>) and Weeve (<a href="https://www.weeve.network/">Value from IoT Data</a>), so our presentation is going to be at hyper-speed. A little forgiveness for that. At Interspecies Game we think that financializing or tokenizing nature is not a sufficient enabler for sovereignty. On the contrary, this approach risks the creation of new algorithms of extraction. Thus, we think agency must be embedded in the Internet relationality of species and their environment.</p>
<p>We propose playing into existence a new paradigm of a networked agency of interspecies context. Nature doesn’t need our charity. We need more robust and convivial forms of engagement to create new relations of solidarity between humans and nature that would foster interspecies engagement and coordination towards the realization of a not-only-human regenerative economy. How to activate a new “we,” a new collective consciousness that allows us to summon and perpetuates interspecies agency. We want to move from an atomized feeling of charity as the modus-operandi of impact towards a relational one where the transformation happens at the edges unleashing viral (spiral?) dynamics.</p>
<p>Our approach draws on the theory of social choice as apposed to classical game theory, from node-oriented systems to edge-oriented systems as we try to articulate peer influence as a multi-species paradigm. We seek to reformulate human nature, false dichotomy through play forms, leveraging automated logic and game mechanics facilitating engagement around resource accumulation and collective allocation. To introduce our game a little bit – the main game mechanic rests around the idea the “Tree of Life,” an embodiment of the spirit of the park in this case the (fox spike?) spirit sign, which coordinates the narratives and the user flows around the park.</p>
<p>The tree has two main objectives – to become self-aware through oracular inputs and to enrich its relations with its community. The “Tree of Life” represents the tokenomic agency with an associated Ethereum address owned by a Gnosis safe. The safe is the owner of a spectralized, fractionalized NFT, thus is the beneficiary for the majority of the stake tokens. These tokens enable both access for governance for the resources and also provide incentives for incentivizing the behavior of its community both in terms of facilitating learning and also the betterment of the public space.”</p>

<p>Brave and XBorg combine forces to drive the growth of Web3 esports gaming and provide a platform to showcase Web3 players.</p>
<p>22nd February 2023 - Brave Software, maker of the privacy-preserving Brave browser, has announced a one-year strategic partnership with XBorg, a leading Web3 esports organization. This partnership involves a series of collaborations for gamers and Brave users, which may include, among other things, live community-driven events between the XBorg, gaming and Basic Attention Token (BAT) communities, Basic Attention Token (BAT) gaming and tournament activations, NFT mints, gaming content creation, and tournaments for gamers of all levels.</p>
<p>XBorg boasts the #1 ranked ev.io team, a browser-based FPS multiplayer game. Brave and XBorg will use in-person and online gaming events throughout 2023 to create content that highlights Web3 gaming, esports, and its players. Content to look forward to includes LAN vlogs, game tutorials, and exclusive interviews with XBorg professional players and content creators. The Brave branded XBorg 2023 Pro Kit Jersey will be released in April, and will be available in the SwissBorg online store.</p>
<p>Brave is also the title sponsor for XBorg’s Xtreme Championship Series. The four-month-long, five-game tournament series runs from March 6 until July 23, 2023, and has a dedicated prize pool of $100,000. In addition, the entire series will stream live for viewers on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/xborgofficial">XBorg’s official Twitch channel</a>. Tournaments will include BAT activations for users of Brave Wallet and other Web3 wallets.</p>
<p>XBorg is producing a 15-episode docu-series called Becoming A Legend, which will air throughout the tournament on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@xborgofficial">XBorg’s YouTube channel</a>. It will feature exclusive interviews with players, team owners, and game developers, as well as matchday highlights and all the behind-the-scenes Xtreme Championship Series drama. Becoming A Legend will shine a light on the backstories and journeys of key Web3 players and games in the industry.</p>
<p>Those interested <a href="https://bit.ly/XCS-Signup">can easily sign up</a> to participate in one—or all five—Xtreme Championship Series games and their monthly qualifiers. Please note that all monthly qualifiers are capped at a certain number of teams/players. Therefore, you are advised to sign up for all three qualifiers at once to guarantee your spot in the tournament and increase your chances of qualifying for the Championship month (each of the 5 games will have 3 monthly qualifiers and then one championship weekend).</p>
<p>Brave and XBorg are excited at the opportunity to combine forces and show a broader audience of users the win-win of combining the leading-edge Web3 gaming browser experience with Brave Wallet and BAT alongside the esports, gaming and media powerhouse team at XBorg. The year-long partnership will provide both Brave and XBorg with room to experiment with BAT and the Brave Wallet to Web3 gaming for a broader audience, with the ease of use of having Web3 built-in with Brave through the multi-chain Brave Wallet.</p>
<p>Finally, you can meet other esports enthusiasts and participate in live community events and discussions by joining the #xborg channel in our <a href="https://discord.gg/batbrigade">BAT Brigade Discord server</a>.</p>
<p>About XBorg</p>

 Secure your crypto — manage your token allowances and choose which DApps can interact with your&nbsp;funds. <p>When was the last time you used a DApp? Chances are, you’ve granted that DApp access to your crypto, possibly even unlimited access. Fear not. Granting token allowances is a common practice in Web3, but it would be wise to consider the potential risks involved.</p><p>Allowing unlimited access to your funds can leave you exposed to anyone looking to exploit vulnerabilities in DApp codes. These hacks can result in unauthorized withdrawals and put your crypto at risk. With the rising number of such security breaches, taking control of your token allowances is another touch of security that won’t hurt. Regularly revoking unnecessary allowances to clear DApp permissions will reduce the possibility of this happening to you and protect your wallet from scams so you can enjoy Web3 with peace of&nbsp;mind.</p> How to revoke token allowances <p>BlockWallet has created a dead-simple process to revoke your token allowances.</p>  Navigate to Settings — Account — Token Allowances  Search for the allowance you wish to revoke by token (ex. USDT, DAI, USDC…) or spender (ex. 1Inch, LiFi, Uniswap…). You may group allowances by spender or token to revoke a specific group of allowances.  Click Revoke next to the allowance you wish to&nbsp;revoke.  Confirm the allowance transaction, which resets the token allowance to zero&nbsp;(0).  Please note that each allowance revoke requires a gas&nbsp;fee.  <p>For those looking to revoke all of their token allowances quickly, use Revoke All. This option consecutively revokes all token allowances in your wallet, eliminating the need to revisit the Allowance page for each&nbsp;action.</p><p>To learn more about token allowances and how to use this new feature, visit our guide on <a href="https://bit.ly/bw-release">How to Revoke Token Allowances</a>.</p> About BlockWallet <p>BlockWallet is a self-custodial wallet making it easy to secure digital assets, protect identity, and experience Web3.

      Partnering with Replicate: Machine Learning, Simplified        Bringing the ease, speed and quality of traditional developer tools into the world of ML  <p>By Stephanie Zhan</p><p>Published February 21, 2023</p>      



     
	 
		
				
			<p>AI avatars of Ben, Andreas and Stephanie.</p>
		
			 
 
    



 
 
   
<p>Five-plus years ago, I sat next to my friend Andrej Karpathy as he published the blog post “<a href="https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35">Software 2.0</a>.” It was a different time in machine learning—we were using Nvidia V100s, and the open source and foundation models we see today were nascent. The level of tooling we had long been used to in traditional software was also absent from the world of machine learning: where were the GitHub, Vercel, Docker equivalents? As Andrej described in his post:</p>



<p>“In particular, we’ve built up a vast amount of tooling that assists humans in writing 1.0 code, such as powerful IDEs with features like syntax highlighting, debuggers, profilers, go to def, git integration, etc. In the 2.0 stack, the programming is done by accumulating, massaging and cleaning datasets. … Who is going to develop the first Software 2.0 IDEs, which help with all of the workflows in accumulating, visualizing, cleaning, labeling, and sourcing datasets? … Github is a very successful home for Software 1.0 code. Is there space for a Software 2.0 Github? In this case repositories are datasets and commits are made up of additions and edits of the labels. Traditional package managers and related serving infrastructure like pip, conda, docker, etc. help us more easily deploy and compose binaries. How do we effectively deploy, share, import and work with Software 2.0 binaries?”</p>



<p>I met <a href="https://replicate.com/">Replicate</a> co-founders Ben Firshman and Andreas Jansson a few years later. They were the creators of arXiv Vanity, which turned scientific papers into responsive web pages—a nifty product I was grateful for.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We talked about Andreas’ frustration with the problem of deploying machine learning models to production while at Spotify, which, as <a href="https://replicate.com/blog/machine-learning-is-just-software">Ben describes</a>, required extensive collaboration between researchers and engineering—including deciding on an API, getting a server written, packaging up the dependencies, getting it hooked up to a GPU and running efficiently. To solve this pain point, Andreas built a set of tools and templates that let researchers package up and deploy models themselves.</p>



<p>Ben came from the world of developer tools. Most notably, he’d built the product that eventually became Docker Compose. He understood the quality of developer tools we were used to in the world of software development, and the opportunity to bring that to the world of machine learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was a thesis we at Sequoia loved and believed in deeply, and we quickly started working with Ben and Andreas, leading Replicate’s seed round and building on our shared dream of what we believed the world could look like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, Replicate provides an easy, fast way for anyone to run generative AI models in the cloud. Instead of battling with GPUs and keeping expensive AWS instances switched on, developers can deploy with just one line of code—in the cloud, billed by the second. And in addition to curating the best models from the open-source ecosystem, the platform allows companies to run their own custom models, which Replicate automatically packages, optimizes and deploys—shrinking the process from weeks to minutes and reducing the need for an infrastructure team’s help.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s been so fun to see the variety of ways developers use Replicate. Character.AI leverages DreamBooth to enhance the conversations people have with characters on their platform, while Vercel uses Replicate for its <a href="https://vercel.com/templates/ai">AI Templates</a>. As the use cases shared on the team’s <a href="https://twitter.com/replicatehq">Twitter feed</a> shows, the ecosystem is burgeoning with creativity.<br></p>



<p>We are delighted to deepen our partnership with Ben and Andreas through this Series A round and to support the team’s <a href="https://replicate.com/about">continued growth</a>. AI is the most important theme of the next decade—driven by the scale of data, new technological breakthroughs in generative models and advancements in compute—and as the infrastructure stack of this Software 2.0 world is written, we believe Replicate will play a fundamental role. We could not be more excited to build this future together!</p>

      Partnering with TipLink: Seamless Cryptocurrency Sharing for Web3        Ian, Aashiq and their team are making it easy to send cryptocurrency to anyone, even if they don’t have a wallet.  <p>By Dan Chen and Shaun Maguire</p><p>Published February 21, 2023</p>      



     
	 
		
			 
 
    



 
 
   
<p>When we were first introduced to <a href="https://tiplink.io/">TipLink</a> as a new form factor for sending payments, we were intrigued—but hesitant. In the wake of Arthur0x being spearfished and losing his Azukis, we were concerned that hyperlinks might be an anti-pattern, and we knew there was a history of experimentation around tipping in crypto that didn’t quite pan out (anyone remember ChangeTip?). Fortunately for us, though, co-founders Ian Krotinsky and Aashiq Dheeraj were persistent. They had thought deeply about potential attack vectors and other areas of tail risk, and they were onto something.</p>



<p>So after a bit of email and Telegram tag, we set up an initial call. We peppered them with questions around crypto OpSec, and they listened politely as we likely bored them to death with stories from the MyEtherWallet days. Then some time later, they followed up with a life update: they’d given notice at Citadel and taken the plunge to work on TipLink full time.</p>



<p>We quickly set up a second meeting—and as soon as we saw their demo, any remaining skepticism vanished.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By tying cryptocurrency to a simple link—bought and shared with just a couple of clicks, even if the recipient doesn’t already have a wallet—TipLink dramatically reduces the coordination required for payments. Information is stored within the URL, making the link itself the wallet—and ensuring it can be shared on any platform with only the sender knowing the key. It’s a fundamental shift, from pull (“send me your wallet address/SNS”) to push (“here’s a link”). Forget the notoriously clunky fiat on-ramping process; suddenly, all you need to join the world of web3 is a friend who owns crypto.</p>



<p>The viral potential of the idea was immediately obvious, and we became convinced that TipLink had a good shot at being the product that would bring the next billion people to web3. It was one of those conversations where the design space seemed to open up the more we talked, with potential use cases ranging from NFT drops and airdrops to physical and digital scavenger hunts to gift cards, just to name a few.</p>



<p>But even more important than the product or its possible applications are Ian and Aashiq themselves. They’ve impressed us with their hustle, tenacity and high clock speed, leading the team to move quickly on projects such as the recent launch of TipLink’s API. We are wowed by the depth with which they think about edge cases and security implications. And their passion and energy are infectious. With this round of seed funding co-led by Sequoia and Multicoin, we are excited to partner with TipLink as they build the future of crypto peer-to-peer payments.</p>

 Unleash the Power of Verus — Technological Showcase of Centrally-Issued Token Fully Backed by&nbsp;Gold  In this article, we showcase how to launch a centrally controlled token with minting and burning capabilities, fully backed by gold. We use the innovative Verus blockchain technology with its versatile currency launches, which can be used both for centralized and decentralized projects. And we don’t even need to code anything! <p>📝 Note that this walkthrough is for the Verus Testnet blockchain, which already has the functionalities that the PBaaS-upgrade (Public Blockchains as a Service) will bring to mainnet. Also, the commands are for macOS and Linux, as Windows works a bit differently. We use the CLI wallet for Verus. <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/tag/v0.9.6-1">Download here</a> 🔗 You can also use Verus Desktop with its incorporated terminal.</p> Fictional Company “Very Good&nbsp;Gold” <p>In this technological showcase, we have a fictional company that is an issuer of a centralized token with 1:1 backing of gold. With a starting supply of 0. The issuer of this token has full control of minting and burning capabilities.</p><p>The mint and burn process however needs to be approved by two signers, making sure one entity doesn’t have full control. For this example we use a 2 of 2 signature setup. Any signature setup is possible (with a maximum of 13 of 25), depending on different use&nbsp;cases.</p> Defining a&nbsp;Currency <p>Defining a currency on the Verus network is simple, just two commands. When the currency is successfully launched it can flow around within the protocol, and outside of the protocol (<a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/get-ahead-of-the-game-with-verus-groundbreaking-1-1-decentralized-currency-mapping-for-erc-20-cc23584a7037">learn how to export a currency as an ERC-20 to Ethereum</a> 🔗). Let’s get&nbsp;started.</p> VerusID Namespace <p>Before defining the currency, we already registered the VerusID VGG@. This cost us 100 VRSCTEST (or 80 when using a referral), which were distributed to the block producers. These costs can drastically vary depending on which PBaaS-blockchain we create a&nbsp;VerusID.</p><p>VerusID is the namespace for currencies and PBaaS-blockchains, among many other things. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/verusid/">Learn more about VerusID</a>&nbsp;🔗</p><p>We also said to have a 2 of 2 signature setup. This means the identity is controlled by two primary addresses, with always two signatures needed to do any action (like launching the currency, minting, burning and sending).</p> Defining the&nbsp;currency <p>Defining a currency costs 200 VRSCTEST. These costs can change depending on which blockchain you want to define a currency on. When launching PBaaS-chains you can define your own costs in the chains’ native currency. Good to know: these costs are going to the miners and stakers of the blockchain.</p><p>With a few simple commands, we&nbsp;will:</p>  Define the&nbsp;currency  Have it signed by a second signature  Launch the&nbsp;currency  <p>Before starting we must fund VGG@ with 200+ VRSCTEST to launch the currency. The chain definition is as&nbsp;follows:</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"VGG", <br>  "options":32, <br>  "proofprotocol":2<br>}' <p>It’s a simple chain definition, with only “options”:32 (= the currency is just a token), and “proofprotocol”:2 (= the controller of the VerusID where the currency is launched from can mint and burn tokens at&nbsp;will).</p><p>These are some options and specifications that are possible when launching a currency: as a simple token, as fractional reserve currency or multi-reserve basket, start &amp; end block, min. &amp; max. preconversions, initial contributions, pre-launch discount &amp; carveout, initial supply and much&nbsp;more.</p><p>⭐ To learn more about the many different launch options when defining a currency on Verus, <a href="https://docs.verus.io/definecurrency/">go here</a> 🔗 We encourage anyone to start testing the protocol to get ahead of the game. <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">The community is happy to help on Discord</a>&nbsp;🔗</p> Approving and launching the&nbsp;currency <p>Now, the second signer needs to come in and sign off on the currency definition, and launch the currency.</p><p>The command from before gives out a HEX. The second signer needs to sign this HEX as&nbsp;follows:</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST signrawtransaction "hex" <p>This gives out another HEX. We use it to submit the transaction to the chain, which in turn launches the currency.</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendrawtransaction "hex" <p>After doing the command above, it takes around 15 blocks before the currency is officially launched on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Next step is the minting and burning of tokens, according to how much gold the company has in&nbsp;custody.</p> Minting and&nbsp;burning <p>Say a customer put 10,000 ounces of gold into the custody of the company. Now let’s make sure the customer gets that amount of VGG into their&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>We mint 10,000 VGG with this simple&nbsp;command:</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "VGG@" '[{<br>  "address":"Customer1@", <br>  "currency":"VGG", <br>  "mintnew":1, <br>  "amount":10000<br>}]' <p>VGG@ is the change-address, Customer1@ is the address where the 10,000 VGG are minted&nbsp;to.</p><p>The second signer needs to do signrawtransaction and sendrawtransaction, as we have done before, to actually mint the tokens into Customer1@.</p><p>Now, if someone wants to redeem their VGG for gold again, we need to be able to burn that amount from the supply of VGG. We burn with the following command:</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "VGG@" '[{<br>  "address":"VGG@", <br>  "currency": "VGG", <br>  "amount": 5000, <br>  "burn":true<br>}]'  <p>To make it happen, the second signer needs to sign off on it&nbsp;again.</p><p>If we want to check to see the supply of the currency, we can do the following command:</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrency “vgg”  Use VGG in Many&nbsp;Ways <p>This article showcased a simple example of how a business can function using the Verus protocol. What we can do with the network goes far beyond what is possible using current blockchain protocols. And all of that without any programming needed!</p><p>We can also easily export the VGG token to Ethereum as an ERC-20. It can also become one of the reserves in a multi-reserve liquidity basket AMM (automated market maker) as part of Verus&nbsp;DeFi.</p><p>Anybody can define a multi-reserve currency which includes VGG as a reserve with weighted percentage (10–90%). The reserves grow as they retain a small fee whenever assets are traded in/out/through.</p><p>A multi-reserve currency itself can also be used as one of the reserves in another multi-reserve liquidity basket AMM token on&nbsp;Verus.</p><p>👀 Stay tuned for more examples, or start reading <a href="http://docs.verus.io/">docs.verus.io</a>, or <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">join the Discord to&nbsp;learn</a>.</p><p>🫡 Credits for the article go to community member ‘ejuliano’.</p><p>➡️ <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Explore with the community on&nbsp;Discord</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/VerusCoin">Follow on&nbsp;Twitter</a></p><p><a href="http://www.verus.io/">Go to&nbsp;verus.io</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/unleash-the-power-of-verus-technological-showcase-of-centrally-issued-token-fully-backed-by-gold-dcc9fae7ca0f">Unleash the Power of Verus — Technological Showcase of Centrally-Issued Token Fully Backed by Gold</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin">Verus Coin</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

      Partnering with Pydantic: No More ‘Steel Seats’ for Developers        We’re delighted to partner with Pydantic’s creator, Samuel Colvin, as he brings his empathy for developers into new arenas.  <p>By Charlie Curnin and Bogomil Balkansky</p><p>Published February 16, 2023</p>      



 
 
   
<p>Sequoia has been thinking about the “<a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/the-unstoppable-rise-of-the-developer-economy/">rise of the developer</a>” for more than a decade, throughout our partnerships with companies such as Unity, MongoDB and GitHub. Their products don’t just make life easier for people building software, but also extend what they can do. If we had things our way, each of the world’s tens of millions of developers would find fast, delightful tools to help them all along the way in creating magical products.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, even in 2023, much of the tooling developers rely on may be functional but far from well-designed. Like a cobbler who goes barefoot, those building delightful software for others are sometimes the last to get delightful tools for themselves. Even the term “developer experience” itself has only become a more regular part of our vocabulary in the last few years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Think of cloud services. Samuel Colvin, creator of the widely used Python library Pydantic, likens building in today’s cloud to driving a 1950s-era tractor: “steel seat, no cab, knobs sticking out of the engine compartment near the component they control, hot surfaces just waiting for you to lean on them.” More and more people are building applications, but still there is too much infrastructure and boilerplate for them to manage, and not enough “just works” magic handling the same nuts and bolts each of them configures in each app they build.</p>



<p><a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/">Pydantic</a>, in contrast, was built to delight developers. Samuel’s library is an open-source data-validation framework—the kind of thing that, if designed differently, people might rarely think of. Instead, it’s managed to win the hearts and minds of Python developers the world over. With its trademark mix of features for making your life easier and your work faster (like the way it “blends right in” by leveraging Python type annotations, or the raw power it brings to validation), Pydantic’s adoption has soared to more than 40M monthly downloads.<br>We at Sequoia are thrilled to partner with Samuel, leading Pydantic’s seed round, as he takes that same passion for developer experience to a new scale. That starts with delivering V2 of the data-validation library, which will remain open source, and continues toward building cloud services which handle all the right things for developers creating applications. Please email <a href="mailto:careers@pydantic.dev">careers@pydantic.dev</a> if you’d like to be part of that.</p>

 1. Top of mind: On staking; plus, a pulse check on crypto policy &amp; regulation  On staking <p>This past week, the SEC announced <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-25.pdf">charges</a> against cryptocurrency exchange Kraken for “failing to register” the offer and sale of their crypto asset staking-as-a-service program. Kraken ceased its staking services shortly after, also agreeing to pay $30 million in penalties. But the question for many was: Would this affect staking overall in the U.S.?&nbsp;</p><p>Why does staking matter? In modern blockchains, "staking" serves a similar function to "mining" in other blockchains — that is, both are mechanisms that allow a participant to earn the right to provide computational capacity. But staking is far more energy efficient. </p><p>How it works: On a proof-of-stake blockchain, anyone can “stake” or lock up their tokens to earn the right to contribute computational resources and security to the network (in exchange for rewards in the form of more tokens). The blockchain's consensus mechanism randomly selects stakers in proportion to how many tokens they have staked. </p><p>Since staked tokens act as an incentive for stakers to act in good faith and follow protocol rules, staking also helps with decentralization because participants are essentially pledging their tokens as an assurance of good behavior — without relying on a centralizing or less secure off-chain system. And while staking means that anyone can participate in a protocol (as long as they have a powerful enough computer, tokens to stake, and a connection to the internet), staking-as-a-service programs can make it even easier for more people to participate.&nbsp;</p><p>For more on proof-of-stake blockchain designs, security, technical considerations, community, process:</p>  <p>▶️ watch: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ-Ya7NRDxM]">A survey of proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain designs</a> by Valeria Nikolaenko&nbsp;</p>  <p>🎧 listen: <a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/proof-of-stake-blockchain-design-consensus-sybil-long-range-attacks-more">PoS blockchains - designs, consensus, attacks</a> with Valeria Nikolaenko, Tim Roughgarden, and Sonal Chokshi</p>  <p>🎧 listen: <a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/ethereum-the-merge-pos-security-decentralization-process-community-people">Ethereum, Merge and beyond</a> with Tim Beiko, Ali Yahya, Tim Roughgarden, and Sonal Chokshi</p>  <p>📄 read: <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/what-the-merge-means/">What ‘The Merge’ means</a> by Ali Yahya</p>  <p>For a16z crypto legal, policy, and regulatory teams’ position on recent events, see 🧵:</p> <a href="https://twitter.com/milesjennings/status/1623850926338629632">  miles jennings | milesjennings.eth @milesjennings   In response to today’s Kraken / SEC settlement - we had a few thoughts 🧵👇 </a><a href="https://twitter.com/milesjennings/status/1623850926338629632"> 1:06 AM ∙ Feb 10, 2023  433Likes85Retweets  </a>  Crypto policy &amp; regulation: What’s going on? <p>Collin McCune, Miles Jennings, Brian Quintenz, and Sonal Chokshi</p><p>In the latest episode of the <a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/">web3 with a16z podcast</a>, we provide an overview of policy and regulation in the crypto industry — from a lay of the land to pulse-checks on sentiment.

For the sake of convenience, many use centralized RPC (remote procedure call) servers; but users need to trust the providers, and there’s no way to verify the correctness of queries. So Helios converts data from an untrusted centralized RPC provider into a verifiably safe, local RPC without running a full node.
